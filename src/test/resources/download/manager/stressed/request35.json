The story is a testament to Patterson’s wife (Steffanie Strathdee, a scientist), who searched for alternative therapies when conventional treatments failed, to his physician, Robert Schooley, who used an untested treatment, and to a large band of phage scientists, led by Ryland Young of Texas A&amp;M University and Theron Hamilton of the US Naval Academy. Their long-term, and sometimes unfashionable, research work meant that phages were available in their labs for the rescue attempt. Because a mixed-phage cocktail was used, no one is sure what tipped the balance, but, importantly, it worked. The Eliava Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia has dispensed phage therapy for years, but it was little tried in the west until recently. This new case encourages physicians to try such microbial treatments for infected patients worldwide, when antibiotics fail. It should also encourage governments to fund more research into natural bacteria-killing microbes, because these may be medicines of the third millennium. Liz Sockett, professor of bacterial genetics, University of Nottingham Parrots are found to lark about It’s a common misconception that only humans laugh: in fact a variety of mammals, from gorillas to rats, have been shown to laugh, and as in humans, animal laughter is a social behaviour, associated with tickling and play. I have long suspected that there is more mammal laughter out there, not least because so many mammals are social and all mammals play. My favourite paper of 2017 revealed solid evidence that in fact a laughter-like play vocalisation – a warble call – has been discovered in keas, a highly social and intelligent parrot from New Zealand. These parrots play a lot – on their own with objects, and with others in rough-and-tumble play (a bit like cats), or in aerial acrobatics. Strikingly, the study found that when these play vocalisations are played back to wild kea, both juveniles and adults will start to play with the other kea around them. This suggests that kea are showing a contagious response to the play sounds. Much as humans will join in with laughter even if they don’t know why people are laughing, kea will spontaneously start to engage in play just from hearing the sounds of other kea playing. This is a dramatic demonstration both of play and play vocalisations in a non-mammal, and also of the contagious effect of these positive emotional sounds in a non-mammal. I’d love to know if this really is an avian form of laughter, and after this year I feel like we need to know there is more laughter out there! Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience, University College London Date of the earliest Homo sapiens is pushed back to 300,000 years ago No other science has enjoyed such a perpetual revolution in recent years as human evolution. In 2017, the pace of change accelerated, with dozens of studies again rewriting our own story. In autumn, exploration of the genes of living people in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Botswana painted a newly complex picture of pigmentation, and revealed both light and dark skin colours in our ancestors hundreds of thousands of years before our species existed. Though much of the fuel for this revolution is the addition of DNA – from the living and the dead – to the toolbox of the palaeoanthropologist, there is still plenty to be learned from old bones. In June, the latest scrutiny of fossils old and new pushed back the date of the earliest members of Homo sapiens to more than 300,000 years ago, and moved their location from east Africa to Morocco. A few weeks before that, the 2013 discovery in South Africa of a primitive human called Homo naledi was finally dated: a jaw-droppingly recent 300,000 years ago too – those humans were contemporaries of our own species in time, if not in space. We have barely scratched the surface of human origins from DNA and bones, and our nursery, the vast African continent, remains largely unexplored. Seek and ye shall find: our story will get richer and deeper in 2018. Adam Rutherford, author of A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived (2016, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) Chinese satellite beams entangled particles of light to Earth Of all the big science breakthroughs of 2017, I have gone with the one that is probably the hardest to explain: quantum entangled particles of light beamed down from a satellite. This was an impressive new world record: less than a year after they launched the world’s only quantum communications satellite, Chinese physicists have for the first time ever sent entangled photons from space. The pair of particles were produced on the satellite, which then sent them down to ground stations in China 750 miles (1,200km) apart, where they remained quantum entangled. The researcher had to overcome many technical challenges and it is remarkable what they have achieved. Quantum entanglement is the most counterintuitive phenomenon in the often baffling subatomic world. The idea that a pair of particles can be widely separated and yet still be able to instantaneously influence each other is so weird that even Einstein hated it, famously calling it “spooky action at a distance”. And yet, it has been shown, time and again in laboratory experiments, to be a real effect. Indeed, it provides us with a radical system for secure quantum communications. China is now leading the world with this fast-developing technology. Jim Al-Khalili, professor of physics, professor of public engagement in science, University of Surrey 5 Extent of large carnivore decline revealed Large carnivores, such as lions, tigers and bears, are some of the world’s most important species. They are apex predators with vital ecological roles, and have immense economic value in the (often developing) countries where they remain. They also have great existence value, having lived alongside humans for millennia, and have become cultural symbols of strength and beauty. Given their charisma and allure, a 2017 study documenting the extent of their global decline was particularly shocking. Lions, African wild dogs and cheetahs have disappeared from at least 90% of their range, tigers from 95%, and Ethiopian wolves and red wolves from over 99%. However, the situation is not hopeless: carnivores can successfully rebound in areas where threats are reduced, and can even coexist with humans under the right circumstances. Nevertheless, if we want our grandchildren to live in a world with these incredible species, we need to act fast – securing and funding protected areas, and investing in communities that still maintain these amazing species. This is a clarion call for action, which must be heeded if we are not, within a generation, to lose species that have been revered for thousands of years. Amy Dickman, conservation biologist, department of zoology, the University of Oxford What the world’s first flower may have looked like The science stories that make the headlines are usually the ones bringing bad news – like the recent report that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has added wild relatives of wheat, rice and yams to its threatened list this year. This matters enormously, because to feed an ever-expanding human population we will need to learn from the genetic tricks that those wild species use to tolerate drought and disease. But a much more cheerful news story this year was the report of an in-depth statistical analysis of what the world’s first flower might have looked like. The study used the features of nearly 800 flowers across the flowering plant family tree to produce a most likely image of the first flower. This was very exciting for evolutionary biologists, because the interactions between flowers and animal pollinators have driven great species radiations of both. Being able to picture the first flower gives us the opportunity to explore how those relationships first evolved, and then how they changed over time to generate the enormous diversity of flower forms we enjoy today – including seasonal favourites like the Christmas rose (which is really a buttercup). Beverley Glover, director of Cambridge University Botanic Garden A sea horse clasping a cotton bud highlights plastic pollution This year we discovered that no corner of the ocean is untouched by plastic pollution. Microplastic particles – pieces of broken-down plastic smaller than a few millimetres in diameter – were found in almost every animal sampled from 10km down in the deepest part of the sea, the Mariana trench. They were also discovered at densities of 100,000 pieces per sq km in Antarctica’s Ross Sea, one of the remotest seas on Earth. The beaches of Henderson Island in the eastern Pacific, one of the most isolated in the world, were found to be covered by tonnes upon tonnes of plastic rubbish. But as we wallow deeper in the filth of generations of plastic litter, there is a movement for change, building like a steepening wave. This may come to be viewed as the year we said: enough! Individuals, communities, cities and countries are beginning to call time on plastic waste, banning single‑use bags, straws, and introducing deposit schemes for plastic bottles. Politicians declared war on plastic pollution at a high-level international meeting on the oceans held in Malta this year. Change is under way and although there will be setbacks, the momentum appears unstoppable. Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York, and scientific adviser to Blue Planet II Number of flying insects plunges by three-quarters The demonstration that flying insect populations have declined by some 75% over the last quarter-century was for me the most beautiful, disquieting and thought-provoking piece of research of the past year. Beautiful, because it was a marvellously solid and lucid study, based on systematic, patient collection of unfashionable “background” data. Disquieting, because of the vital importance that flying insects have to the terrestrial biosphere – and hence to our own life-support systems. And thought-provoking, because it is only a tantalising fragment of some larger global process of the Anthropocene, the new geological epoch proposed to reflect human impact on our planet. How large is the true insect decline? The study started in 1989 – by which time the transformation of global agriculture by massive fertiliser and pesticide applications had already been under way for several decades: the residues of these chemical innovations are widely detected in soils and sediments from the mid-20th century onwards. Insects, though, do not fossilise easily, and so it is hard to show precisely how far populations have departed from their natural baseline levels. Working out such deep-time comparisons – a challenge to the ingenuity of palaeontologists – would show the scale of this new phenomenon, and of the task ahead: to restore healthy insect populations. Jan Zalasiewicz, professor of palaeobiology, University of Leicester Google’s AlphaGo ditches the human tutors We humans are great at solving a wide variety of challenging problems, from low-level motor control through to high-level cognitive tasks. Google’s artificial intelligence group DeepMind aims to produce incredibly intelligent machines that can perform the way we can. Its AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat the best player of all time, Lee Sedol, at the ancient and complex Chinese game of Go, in March 2016. Previous versions of AlphaGo trained on thousands of human amateur and professional games to learn how to play Go. What I find absolutely incredible is that AlphaGo Zero, a new version announced in October, skips this step and learns to play simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play. It created knowledge from first principles, from a blank slate and learned how to play the game to an expert level in just three days! By not using human expertise in any fashion, the creators have actually removed the constraints of human knowledge. AlphaGo’s historic victory against one of the best Go players of all time was a landmark for the field of artificial intelligence, and especially for the technique known as deep reinforcement learning. If this technique can be applied to other problems, such as reducing energy consumption or searching for revolutionary new materials, then AI will truly have a huge positive impact on society and pave the way for artificial general intelligence – imagine a species of machines that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Danielle George, professor in microwave communication engineering at the University of Manchester Robots start doing backflips Observers of the robotics industries have been saying for a quite while now that robots are coming to take our jobs. But in 2017, these claims reached a crescendo with engineers, economists, and politicians all agreeing that it will happen soon. This unusual alignment of opinion gave everyone pause for thought, since these professions almost never agree. Then the robotics firm Boston Dynamics released a video of its latest creation, named Handle. It is a hybrid robot that has both wheels and legs. The wheels allow it to take advantage of the fact that the urban landscape is wheel-friendly, so the robot can easily zip around. Its legs and joints give it stability and balance. In other words, Handle combines the speed of a vehicle with the versatility of a biped. Reactions to Handle were mixed; some praised the innovation that made it possible, while others described it as “nightmare-inducing”. At the end of the year, Boston Dynamics released a new video of Atlas, a robot that can do backflips. This one video seemed to end all argument about when the robots are coming. They are here. The question is which jobs they will replace first: shelf stackers or gymnasts. Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society, University College London Tesla opens the world’s largest battery farm in Australia For me, the most significant story of the year isn’t one of those that announces its arrival with a brass band, a firework display and headlines the size of hippos. My pick is an accelerating flow of smaller stories that together tell an enormous tale: a massive revolution in battery technology. We all know the problem: in the rush for cheaper, lighter, more flexible everything, the battery is still the ball and chain around an inventor’s ankle. They’re heavy, they run down quickly, and occasionally they burst into flames. But 2017 marks a sharp uptick in innovation success. Apart from Tesla’s loud trumpeting about its bigger, better Li-ion batteries, we’ve seen developments in sodium battery technology, the use of organic components and polymers, and an enormous exploration of better materials and control systems. We’ve also seen the falling prices of high-capacity Li-ion systems, and the installation, completed in November, of Tesla’s system big enough to store energy for an electrical grid. These new batteries won’t just revolutionise our personal electronics; they will change our energy generation and our transport. This is not a battle for the one “winning” technology, but the development of an ecosystem of possibility. The new technologies themselves may be this year’s star, but I can’t wait for the inventions that use them. Helen Czerski, research fellow in the department of mechanical engineering at UCL Voyager 1 keeps on trucking In November, a team of engineers at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory signalled the ancient Voyager 1 space probe, asking it to fire a set of thrusters that haven’t been activated for 37 years. It is more than 13bn miles away now and has been exploring since its launch in 1977. No object made by humankind has ever journeyed so far; signals take over 19 hours travelling at the speed of light to reach it. Nevertheless Voyager dutifully complied with the command, puffing hydrazine in precise millisecond bursts, gently rotating and successfully realigning its antenna, allowing it to be audible across the void for a few more years to come. That pirouette became my favourite science moment of the year. Voyager 1 is out there in the darkness, coasting in the frictionless ocean of space, so distant from Earth now that it is nearly meaningless to describe the span in any conventional unit of measurement. It has left behind the indefinite edge of our solar system and begun its long journey into interstellar space, but continues to gather and transmit information about the alien environment that surrounds it. That after all this time, and across all that space, engineers can still find ways to make Voyager 1 do cartwheels, allowing that huge triumph of science, engineering, technology and mathematics to share its odyssey with us just a little while longer is, I think, something worth celebrating.

Let it go. After an unusually bleak year on Broadway, the 2018 season will open with a few escapist musicals – and still more bleakness. Spring will bring a full complement of starry casts and prestige projects and even the promise of giddy fun, but there’s very little in the way of experiment or innovation. The season is a minor calamity for new American plays; there are none fully scheduled, though Tracy Letts’s The Minutes is a likely addition once it secures a theater and Young Jean Lee’s Armie Hammer-starring Straight White Men, the first Broadway play by an Asian American woman, will open post-Tonys in July. It’s dispiriting to see that seeming game changers like Hamilton and Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812 don’t seem to have changed any Broadway games and that the abundance of American plays last year – Oslo, Sweat, Indecent, A Doll’s House, Part 2 – is now a famine. But plays can be a hard sell as can musicals that don’t have a pop culture hook. So it’s understandable that producers would make safer, less ambitious choices. Those trying to make a fetch evening happen will head to Mean Girls, a musical based on the celebrated 2004 Tina Fey film. Fey wrote the book, her husband Jeff Richmond wrote the music, with assists from lyricist Nell Benjamin and director Casey Nicholaw. Dad rocker extraordinaire Jimmy Buffett lends old and new songs to Escape to Margaritaville, a romantic comedy musical, directed by Christopher Ashley, in which a high-powered lawyer falls for a low-powered bartender. Sparks and frozen drinks fly. But icier pleasures await fans of Frozen, the Disney phenomenon that has been converted by its creators, Jennifer Lee, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and Robert Lopez, and the director Michael Grandage, into a book musical complete with snowman and reindeer, starring Caissie Levy and Patti Murin. The two other musicals are cakewalk (or clambake?) revivals, Jack O Brien’s Carousel starring Joshua Henry, Jessie Mueller and Renée Fleming, and Bartlett Sher’s My Fair Lady, starring Lauren Ambrose, Diana Rigg and Norbert Leo Butz. When it comes to plays, much of the excitement whirls around British imports concerning characters whose books have meaningfully altered western culture. Tom Stoppard’s Travesties, directed by Patrick Marber and starring Tom Hollander, a nimble farce that moves among Vladimir Lenin, James Joyce and Tristan Tzara. But Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the wildly ambitious and extremely long and pretty remarkable play by Jack Thorne, directed by John Tiffany, may generate slightly more anticipation. Audiences can decide whether Lord Voldemort or Roy Cohn is the worse villain with the arrival of another two-part London transfer of Marianne Elliott’s production of Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, which arrives with most of its London cast intact, including Nathan Lane as Roy, Denise Gough as Harper and Andrew Garfield as Prior. Though Robert Falls’s The Iceman Cometh played New York pretty recently, the Iceman is coming again, with Denzel Washington, who won a Tony award for Fences, in the role of traveling salesman Hickey under George C Wolfe’s direction. While O’Neill’s bar flies are dreaming paper-thin fantasies, a few blocks away, a young woman receives holy visions. The director Daniel Sullivan revives George Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan, with the luminous Condola Rashad as the French martyr. While Joan busies herself fighting off the English, John Lithgow attempts a more modest undertaking, telling the tales he heard and loved as a kid in John Lithgow: Stories by Heart. And the security guard protagonist of Kenneth Lonergan’s 2001 play, Lobby Hero, isn’t a martyr to much of anything. Trip Cullman’s production will inaugurate Broadway’s newest theater, Second Stage’s the Helen Hayes. The play’s star, Michael Cera, last seen on Broadway in the early Lonergan play This Is Our Youth, will be joined by Chris Evans, Brian Tyree Henry and Bel Powley. Elsewhere, it’s boys, women and children and plenty of bold-faced names. Tony winner Laurie Metcalf appears alongside Glenda Jackson and Alison Pill as Joe Mantello directs the revival of the Edward Albee play Three Tall Women. Joshua Jackson and newcomer Lauren Ridloff star in the Broadway revival of Mark Medoff’s romantic drama about a teacher who tries to encourage a deaf woman to speak. There will be plenty of talking at The Boys in the Band, the 1968 Matt Crowley play, which indulges in some problematic depictions of queer self-loathing. But who could loathe a cast that includes television stars Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer and Andrew Rannells. It’s an eclectic season, if not a particularly risky or striving one, and it’s tricky to discern its themes in advance. Still, several of the plays and musicals ask questions of whether it’s really possible to change one’s fate or meaningfully alter one’s social position, while other works are about the search for love, acceptance, certainty – or simply, that long lost shaker of salt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/14/protests-in-haringey-and-a-revitalised-civic-society","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T19:37:22Z","webTitle":"Protests in Haringey and a revitalised civic society | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/14/protests-in-haringey-and-a-revitalised-civic-society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/14/protests-in-haringey-and-a-revitalised-civic-society","fields":{"headline":"Protests in Haringey and a revitalised civic society","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Aditya Chakrabortty’s article on the political goings-on in Haringey was a welcome antidote to tales of Momentum manoeuvrings and the “hard” left (Haringey taken over by Momentum? It’s just locals taking back control, 12 December). The rightwing media has been very successful in persuading us that the modern Labour party is led by rabid Leninists. If Jeremy Corbyn is to win the next election, he must rebut this perception as explicitly as he can. The present shadow cabinet is doing a good job, but Corbyn should act quickly to make it much more representative of the party. If we want to hear a Labour voice effectively opposing Brexit, we turn to Chuka Umunna or Heidi Alexander; for home affairs we listen to Yvette Cooper; on far-right undercover shenanigans, Ben Bradshaw. To see May wrong-footed we watch and admire Ed Miliband. A good start to the new year would be for Corbyn to bring colleagues of this stature into his shadow cabinet. Were he to do so, he would greatly strengthen his grip on parliament, lead a genuinely authoritative opposition and, at the same time, show that he leads a broad, unified and collegiate Labour party. David Curtis Solihull, West Midlands • Aditya Chakrabortty highlights widespread press distortions about Labour. He rightly says that the revolt against the current Haringey cabinet is/was disgust at the attempt to steamroll through a contract privatising public assets and housing through the Haringey Development Vehicle (HDV), not about a conspiracy concerning Jeremy Corbyn. Last week’s selection meeting of three local councillors against a shortlist of six people was a model of democracy, tightly chaired so that no one overran, the 100-plus members present voting on each stage of the proceedings and the final votes scutinised by an external member of the Electoral Reform Society. Next May we will have fine candidates in the local election who are passionate about fairer policies and, yes, housing will be central. Alison Watson London • I’m a member of the Labour party who reads the Guardian. I do not read the Times, the Evening Standard or the Sun. My fear of Momentum comes from my experiences of its members: complying by party rules only when it suits them, handing out slates at meetings and conducting a discourse defined by its finger-jabbing certainty. While democracies may take numerous forms, accountability must be central to all of them. If Momentum’s candidate for the CLP of Watford (who was not selected by the democratically elected selection committee) is successful, then to whom is he accountable – his constituents or the loud minority that is Momentum? MPs should be accountable to their constituents, not excitable factions within their local party meetings. They should answer to the electorate, not a selectorate. Gabriel Osborne Bristol • Haringey residents decided a while back that enough is enough, and the party politics simply reflects the widespread public wish for an end to Claire Kober’s misruling of Haringey council. One comfort from the Kober years is that the administration has unintentionally revitalised civic society – enthusing existing community groups and creating new ones in opposition to the council’s policies. Hundreds of people at meetings, regularly packed public galleries at council meetings and thousands on marches. That energy and passion for social improvement will serve the borough well as truth and reconciliation comes to Haringey, alongside a process of healing and improving the area. If Kober went now, the repair job could start before May 2018. Martin Ball London • Anger at Haringey’s plans to sell off municipal assets to a multinational property developer with no guarantees of protection for social housing goes way beyond the HDV scheme. This week the cabinet voted to shut Osborne Grove nursing home, the last remaining public provision in the borough for the frail elderly and others with complex needs. In 2011, the council closed down five residential homes and five day centres. In 2015 it shut another residential home and four more day centres, but pledged to maintain Osborne Grove as a flagship rehabilitation service, offering a model of integrated health and social care. In fact, over the past two years it has allowed the service to deteriorate, imposing an embargo on new referrals and then using a series of critical reports by the Care Quality Commission inspectorate to justify closure. A recent report by Which found that Haringey was “one of the worst areas for good quality care” in the country. More than 40% of its provision was deemed as “inadequate” or “requiring improvement”. Faced with protests by families affected by social care cuts, carers, unions and local campaigners, council leaders have always put up the barricades and called in the private security guards. Come May 2018, they will have to face their electorate and stand to account for the wholesale destruction of vital local services.

Most of the victims were reported to be aged between 13 and 17. Photographs from the scene showed that the bus was sliced in half in what the authorities described as a “serious rail accident”. Helicopters took the injured to hospital. The school bus was 12 miles (20km) west of Perpignan, in the Pyrénées-Orientales, heading towards the village of Villefranche-de-Conflent when it was hit. It was carrying pupils from the Christian Bourquin secondary school at Millas heading home to two villages, Saint Féliu d’Amont and Saint Féliu d’Avall. The mayor of Saint Féliu d’Amont, Robert Olive, who went to the scene, said he was “deeply shocked”. He described it as a “horrific sight”. “I don’t know what happened, but the school bus had been actually cut in two by the passing train,” Olive told the local radio France Bleu Roussillon. “The bus appeared to have exploded. People were being very dignified but everyone was shocked.” After travelling to Perpignan and meeting victims’ families, an emotional Édouard Philippe, the French prime minister, described the accident as a “terrible drama”. He said: “The circumstances have not yet been determined and will be the subject of a legal inquiry to throw light on the circumstances of the drama.” Philippe said 24 people had been caught up in the collision: four who had died, 11 who were in a critical condition, and nine who were injured. However, he added that the severity of the crash had made it difficult to identify some of the victims. He said: “The priority at this stage is to give precise information to the families who are living through a period of anguish that we must make as short as possible. The communication of this precise information relates to the identification of those who have died or been injured. This process has begun, but it is extremely difficult.” Reports said the driver of school bus was a 48-year-old woman who was seriously injured. The transport minister, Élisabeth Borne, described the crash as a “terrible accident”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also tweeted his condolences. “My thoughts go out to the victims of this terrible accident involving a school bus and their families. The state is doing everything in its power to support the rescue operation,” Macron wrote. The accident happened at an automatic crossing on a two-lane country road as the bus crossed a single-track railway line secured by a simple striped barrier and warning lights in each direction. A spokeswoman for France’s national rail company, SNCF, said the train was running at 80km/h (50mph) at the time of the accident, and 25 people were on board. Three of those were slightly injured. “The railway crossing was a normal one, well equipped and lit up. Several witnesses have confirmed that the barriers were down, so they were working, but all this will be the subject of an inquiry,” she added. About 95 firefighters, 10 rescue vehicles and four helicopters as well as emergency medics were dispatched to the scene. Carole Delga, the president of the Occitaine regional authority, confirmed that the vehicle involved was a school bus taking children home. The collision happened at around 4.30pm on Thursday. Witnesses travelling on the train told the local newspaper L’Indépendant they had felt a “very violent impact”. “We thought the train was going to come off the rails and turn over,” one passenger named Barbara told the newspaper. “Afterwards there were helicopters mobilised to take away the injured.” SNCF sent a “sincere message of support” to the families of those involved. “Given the severity of the accident, the Pyrénées-Orientales prefect has decided to activate the departmental operational centre so the actions of different (emergency) services can be coordinated. The emergency services and the gendarmerie are at the scene,” the statement said. It said further information would be released when available. The accident was one of the worst involving a vehicle carrying children since 1982, when a coach taking youngsters on a holiday caught fire at Beaune in central France, killing 53 people, 44 of them children. In 2016, there were 111 collisions between trains and vehicles at railroad crossings in France, killing 31.

It’s open plan, to the extent that if I cook anything like a steak, the fire alarm goes off. It looks very neat here, but usually there are about 1,000 condiments behind me. I recommend a cast iron griddle pan for cooking meat, you get a really nice char – this is a Le Creuset one that my mum bought for me years ago. We use Thermopens at work, and I have this one at home. I think it’s one of the most essential tools when cooking meat. I don’t like the idea of serving red raw chicken. Conversely I grew up with my mom always overcooking stuff just to make sure it was done, so I think using one of these is a good idea, as a safety precaution. You can take things a bit easier, because you have more of an idea of what’s going on. When you’re measuring herbs and spices for recipe development, it’s almost impossible to work without a precision scale – I do a lot of my restaurant recipe development at home, so this is one of the most used items in my kitchen. Normal electronic scales just don’t cut the mustard. I have about 30-40 Japanese knives – it’s a little bit of an obsession. It’s important to cut things correctly, to have the right knife for each job, and to keep them sharp. The biggest issue I have when I go to other people’s houses is blunt knives – it takes ages to chop onions and slice roasts! This one was a birthday present from my girlfriend – it’s beautiful. For me, a good knife needs a carbon steel blade. My staple condiments include lots of Japanese sauces, fish sauce, soy sauce, XO sauce, and lots of fermented chilli sauces: I basically raid east Asian supermarkets for everything I can find. The white packet is MSG – I add it to quite a lot of things I cook at home. It makes things delicious. I usually cook very simple rice and veg dishes, and like to pack in as much flavour as I can. I often make curries with whatever I have lying around, so I have lots of whole spices that I grind down too – hence the pestle and mortar, which is in use almost every day. As does the microplane, for zesting ginger, making garlic paste … without that my life would be a lot harder. A child did this drawing of the Temper kitchen in Soho one night. He was sitting with his family at the bar one evening, during the month we opened. They had a really good time, and he gave this to me at the end of the meal. It just says: “I love tacos.” I had it framed; it was a really nice thing to do. He was five, but I never found out his name. I have about 100 cookbooks; this is just a revolving small sample related to whatever I’m cooking at the time. I read cookbooks almost every day, for glimmers of ideas to start me off, but I think home cooking is about having fun with ingredients you like, and whatever else you have lying around. I don’t think you should hunt down every single ingredient in a recipe; they’re more for inspiration.

The spring/summer 2018 collections will dictate what lands on shop floors early in the new year, so get strategic about what elements most inspired you during the last fashion week. You’re far more likely to spend wisely throughout the season because once you have your key on-trend pieces, you can add affordable separates and statement accessories. Here are the indispensable pieces that will ensure you start the year on the right style note. A slip dress A high street mainstay, it won’t be hard to lay your hands on a slinky number in the sales. Resist the urge to buy a long-sleeved top to wear underneath à la 90s styling trick revived of late. Next year they are going to be the main event and worn solo. A pair of trainers Trainers have been the breakout item of the decade and with bulbous, garish and genuine get-fit lace-ups, the style du jour. Some call them sculptural, some call them ugly - but who’s judging? Set to run and run, this is a statement investment. A micro bag Declared “the status symbol of 2016” thanks to Saint Laurent and Kate Moss, micro bags look set to demand maximum attention well into 2018. Despite being utterly impractical, they will be to next season’s outfit what the bauble is to today’s Christmas tree: a decoration crucial to finishing your look. A pencil skirt Take note: sophisticated separates will be big next year - in particular the pencil skirt. Simple and snazzy versions both tick the trend box, while one with a thigh slit will get you extra style points. Look to Mrs Prada and Alessandro Michele’s Gucci catwalk for experimental styling tips. A swimsuit Swimwear is known to be one of the highest mark-up categories, so it’s a good idea to nab one in the sales. Cast the itsy-bitsy bikinis aside in favour of a flattering one-piece as they will be the definitive look in 2018. A trenchcoat If you haven’t already got one, get one now. We don’t have the word count to wax lyrical about their reliability, usefulness, wardrobe super powers and general all-round chicness – sorry. But they are going to be the outerwear of choice in the next couple of months, so either dig yours out and dust it off, or refer to the above."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/14/men-sex-survey-scientists-abs-biceps-gender-stereotypes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:41:49Z","webTitle":"Just what men need – a sex survey that kicks sand in our faces | Peter Ormerod","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/14/men-sex-survey-scientists-abs-biceps-gender-stereotypes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/14/men-sex-survey-scientists-abs-biceps-gender-stereotypes","fields":{"headline":"Just what men need – a sex survey that kicks sand in our faces","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good news at last for strong, heterosexual men who conform to masculine stereotypes: women tend to be more attracted to you than they are to weak men. It seems those downtrodden, marginalised, overlooked alpha males may actually have something going for them after all. The wonders of science, eh? There might now follow, from a decidedly sub-Herculean specimen like me, a stream of wry self-deprecation. There might be references to bits of my body that are particularly podgy or scrawny, by way of humorous contrast with the ideal. Were this social media, I might post a picture of my hairier-than-I’d-like shoulders. I might respond to this latest confirmation of beta-male inferiority with attempts at irony or wit. But there’s something about this study, and the way it has been reported, that makes me feel uneasy. Because other men might respond by pumping themselves full of steroids. They might respond with feelings of inadequacy or shame. They might respond by believing that the best way to attract a woman is to be more stereotypically manly. And all of those responses carry danger. You don’t need to be a men’s rights activist to be troubled by the academics’ language. They talk of “weaker men of poorer quality”. And the study is widely reported in a way which, were the genders and physical attributes changed accordingly, would surely be unacceptable: “Some women may claim that chiselled abs and giant biceps are not what they are seeking in a man. But a scientific study suggests that if your female partner tells you this, she is probably just being kind,” begins the Guardian’s own article. I’d also suggest that it might not necessarily be regarded as acceptable for a headline to advise women to beef up or thin out any part of their body to attract the opposite sex. And there would surely be something a little troubling about men being asked to rate headless torsos of women. Now, I appreciate the limits of flipping genders like this. We still live in a male-dominated society, and we are perhaps only now beginning to understand the extent and effects of patriarchy in terms of abuse, harassment and violence against women. There is plainly far more need for an International Women’s Day than there is for an International Men’s Day – just as there is relatively little need for a White Lives Matter campaign or Straight Pride rallies. And men have long been able to mock and traduce themselves based on their physicality, as decades of Mr Muscle adverts attest. But there surely does come a point where we have to take seriously questions regarding the depiction of men who differ from an idealised masculine norm. In the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45. While there are many and complex reasons why men take their lives, one of the key risk factors in male suicide in Australia has been identified as unhelpful conceptions of masculinity – the “tough Aussie bloke” stereotype, in particular. Moreover, it plays into the idea of “manning up’, which has physical as well as emotional connotations. And it reinforces those gender stereotypes that cause so much harm to women and men alike. Some may argue that we have nothing to fear from the truth: if women really do prefer strong men, then why not be honest about it? But perhaps we should instead question the value of studies like these. They get headlines, for sure, and they must be invaluable to marketeers, casting directors and modelling agencies – who will then just reinforce notions of what is considered attractive. In fact, ideas of attractiveness vary from culture to culture, suggesting there is more going on than some innate animalistic desire; that, to some extent, we find attractive what we’re told we find attractive. This study may well be helping in a small way to create the ideals it is attempting to analyse. Yes, chubbier men may be comforted by the finding that their strength is regarded as more important than their shape. But how much healthier we and our world would be if we accepted and loved ourselves and each other as we are, rather than how we think we should be. • Peter Ormerod is a journalist with a particular interest in religion, culture and gender."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/14/charities-urge-ministers-to-let-councils-oversee-asylum-seeker-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T17:38:26Z","webTitle":"Charities urge ministers to let councils oversee asylum seeker housing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/14/charities-urge-ministers-to-let-councils-oversee-asylum-seeker-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/14/charities-urge-ministers-to-let-councils-oversee-asylum-seeker-housing","fields":{"headline":"Charities urge ministers to let councils oversee asylum seeker housing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 30 leading refugee and asylum seeker charities have called on the government to give local authorities more power over accommodation for those seeking sanctuary in the UK. Around £4bn of government contracts to provide housing to asylum seekers from September 2019 was put out for tender in November. The closing date for bids is 17 December. In October, the Refugee Council said the current system – in which G4S and Serco manage the majority of asylum seeker housing – “routinely dumped” traumatised people into “squalid, unsafe, slum housing conditions”. In an open letter to the home secretary, 33 organisations ask that local authorities be given the role of providing “independent oversight” of housing in their areas. Responsibility for housing people seeking asylum in the UK was taken away from local authorities in 2012 when contracts to provide the service were given to G4S, Serco and Clearsprings. “At £4bn of public money, it is one of the UK government’s largest contracts,” the letter reads. “As agencies working to support refugee integration across the UK we are concerned that these public funds may once again go exclusively to private sector companies, with little or none of that money directed to support local government and the local communities where refugees are housed. “A safe, secure home is a necessity for people seeking refugee protection in the UK. As most people arrive here exhausted and destitute it is right, and indeed a legal obligation, that the government provides housing to people in need as a public service.” The letter’s signatories – who include the CEOs of the British Refugee Council, the Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Action – ask the home secretary to give councils a role overseeing how asylum housing is “planned, procured, implemented and formally scrutinised in their areas”. The letter also calls for local authorities and communities to be “fairly and fully financially resourced” to ensure they can manage the costs of accommodating asylum seekers. In January this year, the home affairs select committee produced a report which branded conditions in asylum housing “disgraceful” after hearing evidence of widespread infestations of mice, rats and bedbugs. A Home Office response to the select committee report, issued in November, claimed it had implemented improvements that met many of the MPs’ criticisms. In their letter, the charities said they were alarmed that the government had “not engaged substantively with this report and the critical evidence made to it”. Speaking on Thursday at a Westminster hall debate on the Home Office response to the report, MP Yvette Cooper urged the government to recognise that some accommodation for asylum seekers was not fit for habitation. “If we don’t recognise the problems that occurred as part of the last contract, how can we be sure that these issues will be recognised in the new contracts and the new system,” she said. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis, representing the government in the debate, said they were committed to ensuring destitute asylum seekers were accommodated in safe, secure and suitable accommodation. He insisted the vast majority of the housing provided was a good standard. “It is important to be aware that the contracts of provision of housing for asylum seekers do demand high standards,” said Lewis. “In many areas they are higher than that which we see in the social housing sector.” Asylum seekers do not have permission to work while awaiting a decision on their claims. Under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 they are able to apply for accommodation and financial help from the Home Office if they have no other means of supporting themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/14/nelson-mandela-family-voices-dismay-funeral-corruption-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T18:26:17Z","webTitle":"Nelson Mandela’s family voice dismay at funeral corruption claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/nelson-mandela-family-voices-dismay-funeral-corruption-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/14/nelson-mandela-family-voices-dismay-funeral-corruption-claims","fields":{"headline":"Nelson Mandela’s family voice dismay at funeral corruption claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nelson Mandela’s family have expressed “indignation and dismay” at allegations that officials stole and misspent more than £16m intended for memorial events after the anti-apartheid leader’s death in 2013. South Africa’s anti-corruption watchdog said last week it had found evidence that millions of dollars disappeared during preparations for Mandela’s memorial and funeral. Officials are alleged to have inflated costs, awarded tenders fraudulently and generally mismanaged the state occasion, which was attended by leaders from around the world. Mandela’s eldest grandson, Mandla, said on Wednesday that the family had reacted with “utter indignation and dismay” to the allegations. “We find it incredulous that while we, as a family, a nation – and indeed the world – were mourning the loss of our elder, icon, leader and statesman, some people were allegedly conniving to profit financially by shamelessly siphoning off funds,” he said in a statement. “The guilty parties should face the full wrath of the law.” Mandela died on 5 December 2013, aged 95, and was buried in his home village of Qunu in the country’s south-east on 15 December. Busi Mkhwebane, South Africa’s public protector, said about 300m rand (£16.5m) of state funds intended for the memorial and funeral were misspent. “It is unfathomable that a legacy built on principled action, integrity and a high degree of ethical standards should be so sullied and allegedly be associated with such criminal intent,” said the family. The row comes at a bad time for the African National Congress (ANC), which has held power in South Africa since elections in 1994 ended the racist apartheid regime. The party is meeting this weekend to choose a new leader to replace Jacob Zuma, who has led the party since 2007 and the country since 2009. The main contenders to succeed him are Cyril Ramaphosa, a prominent trade unionist during the struggle against apartheid and now a multimillionaire businessman, and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the president’s ex-wife and a former senior minister. Ramaphosa heads the broadly reformist wing of the ANC while Dlamini-Zuma is seen as the continuity candidate. The allegations of graft and mismanagement at Mandela’s funeral will reinforce the impression of widespread corruption within the party. Zuma faced harsh criticism from judges on Wednesday after the failure of his attempt to block a report by the previous public protector into allegations of undue influence exerted on his administration by a wealthy business family. The president was ordered to pay the costs of his legal challenge. Support for the ANC, though still strong, has flagged in recent years and the party lost power in several major cities in municipal polls last year. Opposition parties were among the first to raise the alarm over the funeral, demanding an investigation into how taxpayers’ money was misused. Mandela’s long-serving personal assistant Zelda la Grange described the funeral planning process as “chaos” in a memoir published six months after his death. “I had never experienced such chaos,” she wrote, saying that plans were changed every few minutes. She said: “One could not help but wonder whether it was just eight years of bad planning, wasting money on foreign travel to consult with other countries about events of this magnitude, or whether it was a deliberate attempt to exclude from Mandela’s funeral people who were not allied with the right people.” In her report, the public protector, an independent office with a constitutional mandate to combat maladministration and injustice, found that “money meant for infrastructure and social development … the provision of running water, electricity, sanitation, the replacement of mud schools and the refurbishment of hospitals” had been diverted to pay for T-shirts and catering and to transport mourners. The Eastern Cape province, where the funeral took place, has some of the highest poverty levels in South Africa. The investigation also found tendering procedures had been widely flouted and suppliers had inflated prices. “How do you charge 350 rand for a T-shirt? That is exorbitant … where is your conscience for charging the state so much money for a T-shirt? It’s very concerning,” Mkhwebane said this month. News website the Daily Mavericksaid the report was “a depressing reminder that no South African occasion is considered off-limits where graft is concerned”.

Authorities intervened after receiving an emergency call at 1.12am local time. The coastguard said the rescue operation could only begin in daylight due to the rocky area and bad sea conditions. Helicopters dropped food and blankets in the night. Footage from the rescue operation near the coastal city of İzmir showed coastguard personnel airlifting a child as others waited on the rocks next to a partially deflated rubber dinghy. Five children and a woman were rescued in this way while the rest were transferred to coastguard boats with the assistance of fishermen in the area, the coastguard said. There was no information on the migrants’ nationalities, but Turkey is home to 3 million refugees from Syria, and many have continued to attempt the risky boat ride across the sea to Greece despite a deal between Ankara and the European Union that has curtailed illegal crossings. While some still attempt the sea route, others try to cross into Greece through the land border, and are sometimes forcibly returned even after entering the Greek mainland. In addition to refugees fleeing the Syrian war, economic migrants from Asia and north Africa also attempt the crossing. More than 800,000 people reached Greece from Turkey at the height of the crisis in 2015, most of them settling in Germany and Sweden. The March 2016 EU deal, under which Turkey cracked down on illegal migration in exchange for an assistance package and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens, has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups, who say Europe has shirked its responsibility to process asylum requests. Since the deal, Turkey says the number of people detained while making the illegal crossing has fallen by 85%. Thousands of refugees and migrants are stranded in camps in Greece as the country attempts to deal with a backlog of asylum requests, and the influx has empowered far right and anti-immigrant parties across Europe. A relocation scheme introduced by the EU in 2015 in an attempt to share the burden of migrant arrivals has been vilified by nationalist governments. Earlier this week the Guardian reported how Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, was ready to abandon the policy, which is being discussed by EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. On the ground, the suffering continues. A report by 12 humanitarian organisations released on Wednesday said 2,000 unaccompanied children were stranded on waiting lists for safe shelters in Greece, amid a chronic shortage of housing, with many sleeping rough. While interest has waned in the refugee crisis, humanitarian organisations and governments on the Mediterranean continue to mount rescue missions for stranded people, many of whom now attempt to cross through Libya. A recent CNN investigation in the country documented the horrific and widespread abuse of migrants and refugees, describing how some are sold as slaves in local markets after their capture. Human rights organisations have blamed the European Union, which is providing funds to curtail migration from Libya, for being complicit in the abuses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/14/sheffield-council-votes-fell-trees-planted-memory-war-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:06:02Z","webTitle":"Sheffield council votes to fell trees planted in memory of war dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/14/sheffield-council-votes-fell-trees-planted-memory-war-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/14/sheffield-council-votes-fell-trees-planted-memory-war-dead","fields":{"headline":"Sheffield council votes to fell trees planted in memory of war dead","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Councillors in Sheffield have voted to fell dozens of trees planted 98 years ago in honour of fallen soldiers in a move attacked by critics as “the first publicly sanctioned desecrations of a war memorial”. Campaigners have fought a long battle with Sheffield city council over the fate of the trees, planted in 1919 as a “living memorial” to soldiers killed in the first world war. But at a public meeting on Wednesday, the council said 41 of the trees would be chopped down as it was too expensive to save them. Council officials said it would cost £500,000 to keep the memorial trees, which it claimed were causing “significant damage” to roads and private property. The decision is the latest in the long-running battle over the council’s controversial plans to chop down 5,500 street trees as part of a £2.2bn PFI contract to improve the city’s roads and pavements. Dan Llywelyn Hall, an artist who painted the Queen three years ago and who has campaigned to save the memorial trees, said the council’s decision meant Britain would soon witness “the first publicly sanctioned desecrations of a war memorial”. He added: “Sheffield council have ignored the sentiment of what these trees represent for a community and the nation as a whole. They have proven themselves thoroughly undemocratic and negligent of any kind of social responsibility for the war dead.” Llywelyn Hall, who led a “mass painting” of the memorial trees this year, said the move was the “final straw” for campaigners. He said artists would be in attendance at the first sign of tree-felling “juggernauts” from the council’s contractor, Amey. “Our artists will continue to paint and draw these trees in their splendour and go to any lengths to prevent their destruction,” Llywelyn Hall said. “The corporate juggernaut of Amey will have blood of the war dead on their hands and, as for the council, their days of bean-counting are numbered.” At Wednesday’s heated meeting, which was reportedly adjourned at one point because of shouts from the public gallery, the council said it could fund the removal of the trees from its existing highways contract. But the £500,000 required to save the trees and make surrounding roads and pavements safe would have to be found from other budgets, including social care, the authority said. In a press release, the council said it would replant any memorial tree that was felled and plant another 300 memorial trees in the city’s parks. The councillor Bryan Lodge, the cabinet member for environment, said: “Cabinet has agreed that 41 memorial street trees, which are damaging our roads, paths and private property will have to be replaced. “This is because the council, in such stretched financial circumstances, cannot justify switching £500,000 out of our social care or schools’ budgets to retain the trees. “Given that, over the years, about half of the original memorial trees have been lost and never replaced, we believe our commitment to replace the 41 trees, both now and in perpetuity, is a decision that the vast majority of Sheffielders will support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/15/big-shaq-mans-not-hot-christmas-no-1","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"'It sounds like Michael Bubbly!'

Big Shaq rates his rivals for Christmas No 1","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amid the usual sleigh bells, string sections and festive lyrics in this year’s Christmas No 1 race comes a man in a big coat, adamant that he is not overheating. Big Shaq’s Man’s Not Hot has become a snowballing breakthrough hit during the last few months: a parody of hardnut London rappers who use ridiculous slang, impersonate gunshots, and never, ever take off their coats. The knowingly witless aggression of its lyrics – “take man’s Twix by force” – makes them endlessly quotable, earning the track more than 100m views on YouTube and 74m streams on Spotify. It’s even been repeated in parliament by Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya. Man’s Not Hot is currently in the UK Top 10, and is making threatening moves towards the Christmas No 1 position. So what does Big Shaq – aka sketch comedian Michael Dapaah – make of his festive competition? Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé – Perfect Duet After making the UK’s biggest-selling record this year, Sheeran is aiming his gimlet eye on the Chrimbo top spot, and has yoked Beyoncé to him for maximum leverage. “He’s definitely a top contender,” says Shaq, “but he needs to budge. I’ve let him know my feelings.” He and Sheeran hung out at Capital FM’s Jingle Bell ball last weekend. “I told him I was going to take off his glasses, but he wasn’t after any trouble. He’s humble, he’s good people.” Mariah Carey – All I Want For Christmas Is You The multi-octave perennial is making its now yearly bid for the top. Can Shaq hope to compete with Mariah’s vocal acrobatics? “I don’t think with the vocal ting we can go head-to-head. But if you’re talking aescalectically, then definitely. I’m a magazine cover, baby.” He turns to his manager. “Every year this song is popping up. We might have to make a Christmas track, big man! With snow bells.” Wham! – Last Christmas In the CD single era, a re-release of Last Christmas in the late George Michael’s memory would have been a shoo-in for top spot, but not so much now. Shaq is behind it, though. “It’s hard to compete with George. May his good soul rest in peace. I was sad when he passed because I really like his music – my favourite song is of him and Mary J Blige, big tune. He was a creative genius – he knew how to mix melodies, and send his voices to places other people can’t.” Worried Shaq is using this surprisingly trenchant analysis to go after my job, I ask if he’s considering singing lessons. “I can’t do that. Man don’t sing.” Rak-Su – Dimelo As a culture we’ve moved on from The X Factor winner getting the Christmas No 1 every year, and this year’s victors are playing second fiddle to Sheeran in the charts. “It sounds like Despacito,” says an unimpressed Shaq. “But if they’ve got man like Simon Cowell backing them, they’re going to be somewhere in the charts, innit? How long, we don’t know yet. It’s not just about Christmas – it’s about longevity. Cowell is a very smart man though. Hold tight his tight T-shirt.” Gregory Porter – The Christmas Song A slow, classy take on Nat King Cole may not set the charts alight, but it’s a strong curveball. Shaq becomes engrossed and utters a mood board of words. “Sentimental. Nuts roasting. Milk toasting. It’s interesting. It sounds like Michael Bubbly.” But is it any good? “He’s got his own little vibe. It’s something my dad would like – not me personally. But maybe on Christmas Day, in a Christmas jumper, my girl rubbing my elbows, we can listen to it.

Moon’s four-day visit, his first to China since his election in May, was supposed to promote warmer ties between Seoul and Beijing after a long-running feud over Thaad, the controversial US missile defence system introduced to counter attacks from North Korea. On Thursday night Moon, a left-leaning human rights lawyer, is due to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping. However, according to multiple reports in the South Korean media, there were violent scenes on Thursday morning when Chinese guards attempted to restrict the movements of a group of journalists at a trade fair in Beiing attended by Moon. South Korea’s official news agency, Yonhap, reported that after the group was blocked, one photographer “was taken outside of the venue by some 15 Chinese security guards. [He] took a severe beating while being completely surrounded by the guards despite strong protests from his colleagues and South Korean officials, including those from the presidential office,” Yonhap said. The English-language Korea JoongAng Daily said that as presidential officials “tried to stop them, more than 15 Chinese men punched and kicked the journalist as he fell on the ground. He took a severe beating to his face.” Presidential officials “were also grabbed and pushed when they tried to stop the Chinese guards’ violence against the reporter”, the newspaper added. A report in the Korea Herald claimed the guards “threw punches and kicks”. After being treated by Moon’s medical team, Yonhap said the journalist was taken to hospital where he required “intensive treatment”. In a separate incident, a second photographer from Hankook Ilbo, another leading South Korean daily, was reportedly “grabbed by the collar and knocked to the ground” by Chinese guards while attempting to follow his president. “We are taking this violence extremely seriously,” a senior presidential official was quoted as saying by the JoongAng Daily. The incident comes two years to the day after violent scenes broke out outside the trial of a Chinese free speech activist; scores of police and plainclothes security agents wearing masks attempted to physically drive supporters, diplomats and journalists from the area. The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC) denounced the 2015 incident – in which several foreign journalists were knocked to the ground – as “a gross violation of Chinese government rules”. On Thursday the FCCC said it was concerned about the alleged assault on the South Korean photojournalist and it had received several reports in 2017 about resident journalists also being subjected to violence while reporting in China. “Violence against journalists is completely unacceptable, and the FCCC calls on the Chinese government to investigate and address the incident,” the group added. Yonhap said South Korea’s presidency, the Blue House, had filed a protest with Beijing and was demanding a formal apology. A Blue House official said an initial investigation suggested the guards had been hired by the South Korean organisers of the trade fair but were “under the leadership of the Chinese police”. In a statement the Korea Press Photographers Association (KPPA) asked: “Is this Chinese-style etiquette to invite guests and beat them up in your living room?” In October Xi kicked off his second five-year term with a brief statement to the media, from which a number of major international outlets including the Guardian were excluded in apparent retribution for their critical coverage of his country. Xi said he encouraged journalists to visit and report on China. However, China currently occupies the 176th place in the annual World Press Freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Only two countries fare worse: Syria and Turkmenistan. A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry told reporters on Thursday: “If someone is hurt, of course we are concerned about that.” “We hope it’s just a minor incident,” Lu Kang added, according to AFP."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/dec/14/brexit-eu-summit-commons-defeat-not-going-to-stop-brexit-says-government-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T17:43:18Z","webTitle":"Dominic Grieve says he received death threats after Brexit rebellion - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/14/brexit-eu-summit-commons-defeat-not-going-to-stop-brexit-says-government-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/14/brexit-eu-summit-commons-defeat-not-going-to-stop-brexit-says-government-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Dominic Grieve says he received death threats after Brexit rebellion - Politics live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Conservative MP Dominic Grieve has faced death threats after leading a parliamentary rebellion that resulted in the prime minister’s first defeat on Brexit. The Austrian chancellor, Christian Kern, has spoken of his hopes that Brexit can be reversed after Theresa May’s defeat over the UK parliament’s right to have a meaningful vote on the European Union withdrawal bill. Scotland’s highest earners will pay an extra £164m in income tax next year to help fund pay rises for public sector workers, give £400m extra to the NHS and cut taxes for lower earners. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is what Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo was murdered by a far-right terrorist last year, tweeted this morning. It is fairly obvious to whom he is referring. In an article in the Evening Standard defending her decision to vote against the government last night, the Conservative former education secretary Nicky Morgan says the government should drop the amendment to the EU withdrawal bill fixing 29 March 2019 as Brexit day before it gets debated next week. She says: There will be another vote next week, on an amendment as to whether Britain will leave the EU on March 20, 2019. We want the government not to move the amendment about the date. As we saw last week, negotiations aren’t always completed on time so having an exit date could be unhelpful. This is how Anna Soubry, one of the Tory rebels, responded to the Daily Mail front page last night. And she reveals that Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail journalists have been calling councillors in her constituency - not, one suspects, because they are fishing for compliments. Earlier this afternoon MPs were debating a backbench motion tabled by the Labour MP Grahame Morris about the so-called Waspi (Women against state pension inequality) women. These are the women affected by government decisions to equalise state pension ages for men and women (an increase for women) and the to raise it beyond 65. As the Press Association reports, plans to increase the state pension age for women between 2010 and 2020 were initially set out in 1995. But this process was speeded up by the coalition government in 2011, resulting in the state pension age for women due to increase to 65 in November 2018 and to 66 by October 2020. This decision was controversial in itself, but it received wide publicity and led to many women who had not been notified about the 1995 law change discovering they would get their pension six years later than expected. Here are some of the highlights from the debate. I’ve taken the quotes from the Press Association copy. Several Conservative MPs strongly criticised the policy. Opposition parties have been campaigning on this for some time, but the debate showed that Tories are unhappy about what is happening to the Waspi women too. The Conservative MP Scott Mann said: My view is the changes in 2011 were rushed and wrong and brought in at speed. I would the ask the minister to sit down me and look through these figures to see if there’s a satisfactory solution to this current problem. We should consider a sensible way forward. Fellow Conservative MP Peter Aldous said: It is clear that a particular group of people have been unfairly penalised. I thus support the motion and I urge the government to find a way forward that is fair, fully considered and affordable. Another Tory, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: The personal stories of financial adversity faced by my constituents has been beyond frustrating for me to have to listen to. Too many women have told of the inefficiency and inconsistency in the treatment of their cases by the department. And the former children’s minister Tim Loughton said: We need to find a solution; the government needs to listen and get round a table and discuss. There are many different transition arrangements that we could bring in. Scaremongering that it’s going to cost tens of billions of pounds is really not helpful. The Commons passed Morris’s motion without opposition. It says the government should publish plans to provide “a non-means tested bridging solution” to the problem. But the vote is not binding on the government. Morris said the government should introduce a non-means tested bridging pension for the Waspi women, paid as a percentage of the full state pension and covering the period between age 60 and the new state pension age. Some 3.8m women would benefit, he said Norman Lamb, a Lib Dem former health minister, suggested bringing forward the point at which the state pension age increases to 68 to generate money to help the Waspi women. He told MPs: I’ve discovered from the House of Commons Library that bringing forward the proposed increase in the pension age from 67 to 68 from 2037 to 2036 would in itself raise £7.5bn approximately, which would go some considerable way to helping these women address the injustice that they face. Campaigners in the public gallery shouted “Shame on you” at the work and pensions minister Guy Opperman before storming out. The shouts could be heard from the floor of the chamber, but Opperman appeared undeterred by the remarks. Opperman said that the government had listened to concerns when the 2011 bill was going through parliament and watered down its plans, at a cost of £1bn. He said offering “full compensation” to the women affected would cost more than £70bn. The Conservative MP James Cartlidge proposed further reform of the pension system, moving from a pay-as-you-go scheme to a fully-funded model. He said the problems facing the Waspi women should not be seen in isolation. Although people thought they were paying into a pension pot, there was no such thing, he said: When they say they’ve paid in, it doesn’t exist: it is just a mathematical fact - that’s not a nefarious thing, the system was not designed for this ageing population that we have, the demographic change that we now have. And the duty on us in Government and in this place is to be open and honest about that and try and come up with reforms that address it. And in my view, and it’s a big deal: we should try and move to a funded pension system. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP, has faced death threats after leading a parliamentary rebellion that resulted in the prime minister’s first defeat on Brexit. The former Tory attorney has reported incidents to the police. Other colleagues who rebelled have also come under pressure. Grieve told the Guardian: The thing which continues to cause me concern is not that people will disagree vigorously with the positions we take but that the atmosphere is so febrile that it leads firstly to people not listening to what the debate is about, secondly suggests that any questions around Brexit amount to an intention to sabotage and thirdly result in some people expressing themselves in terms that at times include death threats. Death threats should have no part in the political process of a democracy. Grieve also questioned the response of some newspapers to the vote, including a front page story from the Daily Mail that claimed 11 Tory “self-consumed malcontents” had betrayed their leader, party and 17.4m Brexit voters and had increased the “possibility of a Marxist in No 10”. Grieve said: The form of reporting that the Daily Mail adopts is an incitement to obscuring what the issues actually are. That then adds to the atmosphere. Robert Peston, ITV’s political editor, thinks the government will withdraw its amendment to the EU withdrawal bill fixing 29 March 2019 as Brexit day rather than risk defeat next week. Scotland’s highest earners will pay an extra £164m in income tax next year to help fund pay rises for public sector workers, give £400m extra to the NHS and cut taxes for lower earners, Severin Carrell reports. According to RTE’s Tony Connelly, the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar also delivered a rebuke to unionists when he arrived at the EU summit. This is from Sky’s Tom Boadle. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has been speaking at a press conference with the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and their Japanese counterparts. And, according to the BBC’s Norman Smith, he said Brexit was “unstoppable”. Theresa May has arrived at the EU summit in Brussels. And she insisted that, despite last night’s Commons defeat, the government was still “on course to deliver on Brexit”. Asked about the vote, she said: I’m disappointed with the amendment. But actually the EU withdrawal bill is making good progress through the House of Commons and we are on course to deliver on Brexit ... We’ve actually had 36 votes on the EU withdrawal bill and we’ve won 35 of those votes, with an average majority of 22. So the bill is making good progress, we’re on course to deliver Brexit, we’re on course to deliver on the vote of the British people. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg who is in Brussels for the summit. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said that he still trusts Theresa May to be able to strike a deal on Brexit. He made the point in a breif interview with Sky News. Here is a summary. Varadkar said he had “absolute confidence” in May. I have absolute confidence and trust in the prime minister and the British government that they will stand by the political agreement that was made last week. He said the trade talks with the EU might not start until after March. Although the Brexit talks are due to move to phase two, he said the first priority would be to turn what was agreed last week into a “legally-binding international agreement”. Then they would talk about the transition. And only then would they move on to trade, he said. Asked how long this would take, he said: There’s no exact timetable at the moment. But the indicative timetable is that we will spend the next three months or so working on the withdrawal agreement, putting into a legal, international agreement what was agreed last week, talking a bit about the two-year transition phase. And once we have that done, we can then talk about the new trading relationship. He said he wanted the UK to have as much access to the single market as possible. Certainly, from my point of view, we would like to see the United Kingdom having as much access as possible. He said Ireland regarded the EU27 countries, not the UK, as its closest friends. Although Ireland wanted a friendship with the UK, he said its “very closest relations” were with its EU partners, “just as they were our best friends in the weeks gone by” (a reference to how the EU27 stuck with Ireland on the border issue in the phase one talks). Arriving at the EU summit the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said there were “still a few questions remaining open” about the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, but there was “a good chance that the second phase can now begin”. As the Press Association reports, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, said the summit was “not simply a council about Brexit”, stressing that his focus was on issues of EU defence and migration policy being discussed tonight. Speaking to reporters at the EU summit, the Austrian chancellor Christian Kern has suggested he would like to see Brexit reversed. These are from the Open Europe thinktank and the Express’s Nick Gutteridge. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has escaped the possibility of being held in contempt of parliament over the non-existence of Brexit impact assessment papers, but was criticised by the Speaker, John Bercow, for being unclear to MPs when he discussed the matter. Key Tory rebels who inflicted a Commons defeat on the government’s flagship EU withdrawal bill have warned Theresa May that she could be embarrassed again unless she concedes more ground. Dominic Grieve and Stephen Hammond have both said May will face another rebellion next week if she presses ahead with a government amendment specifying 29 March 2019 as the Brexit deadline. Britain has been warned that the EU will not renegotiate a Brexit deal agreed by the government if it gets rejected by the Commons. Some MPs argue that last night’s Commons vote means MPs will now get a “meaningful vote” on the final deal. But some EU figures have challenged this, saying the EU would not be willing to rethink a deal agreed by Theresa May but rejected by parliament. (See 11.26am and 12.10pm.) David Davis has said the government is still considering how to respond to last night’s defeat on the EU withdrawal bill. Speaking during Brexit questions in the Commons, he said: Let me first make an observation on last night’s outcome, as he describes the result. The effect of it is to make the powers available under section 9 deferred until after, as we see it, we get royal assent to the withdrawal agreement and implementation bill, which means there will be a very compressed timetable. Now those who want to see a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union hopefully will want to see a working statute book. So we will have to think about how we respond to it, but as always we take the House of Commons’ view seriously and will continue to do so. During the session Davis also said that last week’s Brexit deal mean the the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal had become “massively less probable”. And he said the government would seek to “conclude the substantive portion of the negotiation” over a future trade deal with the EU before Brexit took place. This contradicts the view of EU leaders, who think only the preliminary aspects of a trade deal will be agree by March 2019. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has hinted that 30% of Scottish income tax payers will see their tax bills rise next year, under the draft Scottish budget being published by the Scottish finance secretary Derek Mackay at 2pm today. (See 12.35pm.) Justine Greening, the education secretary, has said the government will “relentlessly target” resources at schools and nurseries in deprived areas. Announcing a new plan to tackle regional inequality with “no community left behind”, she said reducing regional inequality will help make Brexit a success for Britain. As the Press Association reports, Greening set out “four ambitions” to boost social mobility, including a focus on early years, school attainment, post-16 technical education and career aspirations. The number of households accepted as statutorily homeless and those living in temporary accommodation in England has increased, government figures show. The archbishop of Canterbury has called for a “ceasefire from insults” in British politics in order to make a success of leaving the European Union. The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has arrived at the EU summit in Brussels, and he had some reassuring words for Theresa May. Here are the main points from his brief interview on the way in. Rutte said that he was confident that May had the authority to deliver a Brexit deal. Asked about her standing, he said there was “widespread support for a reasonable negotiated exit” in the UK. He said she had “formidable stature” in Brussels. He went on: “Friday showed all of us we should not underestimate May, she’s a formidable politician.” He said May now had to tell EU leaders what sort of trade deal with the EU she wanted. He said May had been “holding her cards close to her heart” until now, in terms of the overall outcome that she wanted, and that this was “probably a wise negotiating tactic”. But he went on: But of course having now hopefully passed the mark of phase one, I think we need from her to understand how she sees this relationship with the European Union. It is now for the UK to make up its mind. He said that David Davis’s comment on Sunday about the UK-EU deal being a “statement of intent” rather than something that was legally binding had caused concern. Davis subsequently said he was misunderstood. Rutte said it was now important to convert the agreement into “legally-binding text”. Asked about Davis’s comment, he said: An eyebrow was raised here and there because of that comment. But I think it makes it more necessary to have as soon as possible that deal of last Friday in legally-binding text, so that we cannot have a misunderstanding what was exactly agreed. Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, has said that the Brexit transition period needs to be closer to five years than two. Speaking in the Dail on Thursday, he insisted that businesses need time to adapt to any new realities in the context of Brexit. As the Press Association reports, he also said that, in his view, the commitments that the UK government has made to Ireland and the rest of the EU were “cast-iron”. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has hinted that 30% of Scottish income tax payers will see their tax bills rise next year, under the draft Scottish budget being published by the Scottish finance secretary Derek Mackay at 2pm today. Sturgeon has repeatedly hinted her government plans to raise taxes modestly for higher earners, using Holyrood’s new freedom to set income tax rates and bands, to help fund her election pledges and mitigate cuts in the Treasury’s grant to the devolved government. Pressed on her tax plans at first minister’s questions by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, Sturgeon said 70% of Scottish income tax payers and 83% of all Scotland’s adults would “pay no more tax than they do today.” This is from Sky’s Faisal Islam in Brussels, where Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Andrej Plenkovic, the Croatian prime minister, have arrived for the EU summit. David Davis may have escaped censure from the Commons speaker, but the Institute for Government thinktank is not so forgiving. Bronwen Maddox, its director, has put out this statement in response to the announcement from John Bercow earlier. (See 11.12am.) She said: The speaker has found the secretary of state for exiting the EU, David Davis, not to be in contempt of parliament. However, the government has shown contempt for the principle of making decisions based on thorough evidence and analysis. David Davis said to the Commons committee on exiting the EU that the government had not undertaken formal impact assessments of Brexit. This not only appeared to contradict previous ministerial assertions but also showed a disregard for the principle of making decisions based on thorough evidence and analysis. This is no way to approach such a profound change in the UK’s relationship with close trading partners and allies. Brexit will affect businesses and the UK economy more than any other decision made by government in recent years. To forge ahead and enter negotiations with the EU without the benefit of extensive analysis of the potential risks, costs and benefits is reckless. Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, has said that if the Brexit deal agreed by the British government gets rejected by parliament, the EU will not be willing to renegotiate. These are from the Financial Times’ Mehreen Khan. This is the same messsage my colleague Jennifer Rankin picked up from Danuta Hübner, the Polish MEP who chairs the European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee. (See 11.26am.) Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said that Brexit had been a test of EU27 “unity” when he arrived for the EU summit in Brussels. That unity would be tested even more next year, he said. By the way, I have no doubts that the real test of our unity will be the second phase of the Brexit talks. Since David David is in the news, it is worth plugging this interview/profile that Tom McTague has just written for Politico Europe which is well worth reading - all 5,000 words of it. Here’s an excerpt. Davis’ rise to the top of the dining-with-royalty Tory establishment was not ordained. Born David Brown on December 23, 1948, to a disabled single mother in York, his father disappeared when he learned of the pregnancy. The pair lived in what he would later describe as a pre-fabricated “asbestos box” on the outskirts of the city, until his mother met Ronald Davis, “a good but rather tough-minded man,” who adopted him when he was in primary school. “The biggest influence of my life was my grandfather,” he told Desert Island Discs. “A communist, a hunger marcher, he’d been to prison for his beliefs. He was a great man. A good role model. Very, very sure of himself.” Davis believes real men stand for things and don’t doubt themselves. There’s a theory — first put forward by the British writer Lucille Iremonger — about the drive for power and control among children who were abandoned at an early age. Writing in 1970, Iremonger noted that 67 percent of U.K. prime ministers from the start of the 19th century to 1939 had lost a parent before the age of 16. Others have remarked that 12 U.S. presidents, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, lost their fathers while they were young. Theresa May lost both parents in her 20s. Davis not only fits this pattern perfectly; when the theory is mentioned, he’s immediately familiar with it. “It’s called the fight-on complex,” he says. “Lucille Iremonger wrote about lots of orphaned, or illegitimate children.” Does Davis have this fight-on complex? “I don’t know,” he says. “I think people are what they do.” The British parliament will be confronted with a ‘take it or leave it’ choice on the Brexit divorce deal, if MPs vote after October 2018, according to a leading MEP. Danuta Hübner, a Polish MEP, who chairs the European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee, argues it would be too late for British parliamentarians to have a meaningful say on the final treaty after October 2018 because formal negotiations would have already been completed. EU negotiators have long said Brexit negotiations must be completed by October 2018 to allow time for the ratification of the treaty before the UK’s departure day on 29 March 2019. Asked if October 2018 was the final deadline to influence the agreement, Hübner told the Guardian: Once it is finalised and it is signed by both parties, then any change to it means reopening negotiations, meaning we will not make it within the two years [the article 50 deadline], meaning there is a hard Brexit. Stressing it was “purely a British decision” to decide how MPs will have a say on the withdrawal agreement, she said even the smallest change to the treaty would mean resuming negotiations. Once anybody changes a comma or a dot or one-word, then there is no opinion, this has to go back to the negotiations. The MEP was speaking before last night’s dramatic vote in the House of Commons, where MPs voted for parliament to have a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. The six-month window from October 2018-March 2019 is intended by the EU allow the treaty to be translated into the EU’s 24 official languages and scrutinised by committees in the European parliament, before the final plenary vote. This view jars with the perception of some Tory rebels, such as Stephen Hammond, who told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday: “If [the Brexit deal] is concluded by October next year, that gives six months if things go wrong.” The MP, who was sacked as a Tory vice chairman overnight, also pointed to the flexibility in the article 50 process, which could give the UK a few extra weeks beyond departure day. However, any extension would have to be approved unanimously by all 27 EU governments. The European parliament will be asked to approve the article 50 treaty before March 2019, but will be unable to make any changes. Hübner, a member of the parliament’s Brexit steering group, said MEPs were seeking to exert influence in other ways. That is why we use a period of negotiation to influence the negotiations, to know what is in the mandate, to contribute to the result, but we cannot amend [the treaty] because then it will be a never ending story. You may have thought that David Davis, the Brexit secretary, had already been cleared of contempt of parliament over the Brexit impact reports. This is because two weeks ago MPs on the Commons Brexit committee, in a vote that split along party political lines, with one Labour MP absent on maternity leave, decided to issue a statement saying that Davis had complied with the Commons motion saying the government should publish its Brexit impact reports. But the Brexit committee statement only covered one of the two possible contempt charges against Davis, and until today the other matter was unresolved. Contempt of parliament is a parliamentary term for not treating the Commons with respect. In the 19th century and earlier offenders could get locked up for this sort of behaviour. Today, if the Commons passed a motion finding someone in contempt, that is normally the end of the matter, but for a minister it could, potentially, be career-ending. There were two things Davis did which laid him open to accusations of contempt. First, although the Commons passed a binding motion saying the government should hand over its Brexit “impact assessment” reports to the Brexit committee, Davis’s department did not hand over all the documentation it has, and the reports were not proper impact assessments. Davis said that that was because impact assessments as such did not exist. The committee accepted this. But that meant he was open to the second charge - that he and other ministers had effectively lied when they repeatedly told MPs, in the chamber and in select committee hearings, that the government had compiled reports looking at the impact of Brexit on sectors of the economy. (David Allen Green has all the examples here, on his blog.) John Bercow ended up adjudicating because, if an MP wants to accuse another MP of contempt, they have to write to the speaker, and the speaker then decides whether to allow the Commons to vote on the matter. Today Bercow effectively ruled that, on both counts, Davis was in the clear. But on both counts Bercow did make some criticisms of Davis. On the charge that Davis did not comply with the Commons motion, Bercow said: While it was most regrettable that the secretary of state – a point I made to him privately but I now state publicly – unilaterally excised some material from the paper which he provided, and that it took so long to provide the papers, I also feel bound to pay due attention to the formally-recorded view of the committee that the secretary of state had complied with the order of 1 November. And on the charge that Davis and other Brexit ministers repeatedly misled MPs, by talking about Brexit impact reports that did not actually exist, Bercow said: Ministers could, with advantage, have been considerably clearer in their statements, particularly challenging lines of questioning in select committees which were based upon a genuine misconception. However, from the evidence which I have seen today date I have concluded that the test that I am bound to apply, that there is an arguable case that there has in this matter been a contempt of the house, has not been met in this case. John Bercow, the speaker, is making a statement now. He says he wants to tell MPs about the replies he has sent to MPs who have accused David Davis of contempt of parliament. Some MPs said the government was in contempt, he says. He has considered the representations, and discussed this with the clerk of the Commons. His decision is whether to give precedence to a motion. He says ministers could have been “considerably clearer” about the status of the Brexit impact reports, especially when giving evidence to committees. He says he has also considered the claim that the government did not do what the Commons required when it passed a motion saying the Brexit impact reports should be published. He says it is a pity that some information was excluded, and that it took so much time for the information. He says he has judged that there was no contempt of parliament. He will not take points of order, he says. David Davis and fellow Brexit ministers cleared of contempt of parliament, John Bercow tells MPs. But Bercow also says ministers could have been “considerably clearer” with MPs about what the Brexit reports actually said. This is a reference to the way they repeatedly gave the impression that the government had prepared proper Brexit impact assessments. It was only when forced to publish them that ministers made it clear that they were sectoral analyses, not formal impact assessments. More from Laura Kuenssberg. Robin Walker, the Brexit minister, says the government will “explore” the prospect of staying in the Erasmus programme, a student exchange scheme, in the next phase of the Brexit talks. This is intriguing. The Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston says she went to read the government’s Brexit analysis papers in the secure reading room in the Commons. It felt like being in the seventh circle of hell, she says. She says there were only nine pages related to health and social care. She says all the documents should be in the public domain. Robin Walker, a Brexit minister, says some of that information would be very useful to the EU if it were made public. Labour’s Matthew Pennycook asks why Tory MEPs abstained in the vote in the European parliament yesterday saying Brexit talks should move to phase two. Davis says in the past Labour MPs voted against the Brexit talks moving on to phase two. Layla Moran, a Lib Dem MP, says half of Britons now support a second referendum on Brexit. Davis says the government will not have a second referendum. No poll can match the 17m people who voted for Brexit, he says. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says there are more than 42,000 bottles in the EU’s wine cellar. Will the UK gets fair share when it leaves the EU? Robin Walker, a Brexit minister, says that is an interesting question. He says the deal agreed last week sets out how EU assets will be shared. David Davis says people never complain about the EU’s level of openness in the Brexit talks. But he quotes from an EU document saying it is important for it to keep some information confidential. He agrees with this approach, he says; the UK is doing the same. This is what David Davis said when Sir Keir Starmer asked him if he would drop amendment 381, the one fixing 29 March 2019 as Brexit date. Davis said: Unlike [Starmer], I do not view votes of this House of Commons as accidents. They are decisions taken by the House. And that decision [last night’s vote] will be respected, as will the next one. On Monday Theresa May indicated that the government was still committed to amendment 381. Today Davis sounded a bit more non-committal. Anna Soubry, the Tory pro-European and one of the rebels in last night’s votes, says none of the rebels drank champagne after the vote. She says the defeat was avoidable. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, asks for an assurance that the government will not try to overturn last night’s vote. Davis says the amendment passed last night will result in ministers having a very compressed timescale when they have to pass secondary legislation implementing Brexit. He says he will have to think about how he responds to the vote. But he says the government will listen to the Commons. Starmer asks if the government will drop the amendment being put a vote next week fixing 29 March 2019 as Brexit day. Davis sidesteps the question, saying that is a matter for next week. Labour’s Barry Sheerman asks why the transition period could not be extended. Davis says if it went beyond two years, some national parliaments would demand a vote on it. Also, the public want Brexit to happen, he says. Davis says a no deal Brexit has become “massively less probable” since the UK-EU Brexit deal agreed last Friday. David Davis is answering his first question. He says an “implementation period” would be in the interests of the UK and the EU, and it would help businesses. The Tory MP Kwasi Kwarteng says it is important that the implementation period is finite, and that the UK can negotiate free trade deals during that period. Davis says he agrees. Labour’s Hilary Benn asks Davis to confirm that the UK-EU trade deal will be negotiated during the transition period, not before as the government has previously claimed. Davis says the government hopes to conclude a substantial amount of the free trade deal before Brexit. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and his ministerial team are taking questions in the Commons. The session has just started. Key Tory rebels who inflicted a Commons defeat on the government’s flagship EU withdrawal bill have warned Theresa May that she could be embarrassed again unless she concedes more ground, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Her story quotes Dominic Grieve and Stephen Hammond who have both said May will face another rebellion next week if she presses ahead with a government amendment specifying 29 March 2019 as the Brexit deadline. MPs are due to vote on it next Wednesday. Here’s Jessica’s story. According to one report at the weekend, when Theresa May went to Brussels on Monday last week to finalise a Brexit deal, only to see it kiboshed by the DUP, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, reprimanded her with the words: “You can’t come here to negotiate if you don’t have a mandate.” Number 10 deny that Juncker said it, but if he didn’t, he should have done; the phrase summarises well the problems a leader has in an international negotiation if she cannot carry parliament. That’s one reason why the timing of last night’s Commons defeat was so unfortunate for May. This afternoon she is off to Brussels for an EU summit. That said, it is important not to over-state the importance of the vote. It may have a significant impact on the parliamentary dynamics in the Brexit process - May now knows she cannot guarantee she will always get her way in the Commons - but in practical terms the impact the Dominic Grieve amendment has on how ministers handle the withdrawal process may be limited. And this morning ministers are stressing that Brexit carries on. Speaking on the Today programme, the health secretary Jeremy Hunt (a remain voter, but not a “remoaner” - he is now quite enthusiastic about Brexit) said the government defeat would not derail the process. He told the programme: I don’t think it should be a surprise that in a hung parliament, parliament wants to reassert its right to scrutinise the process. But we should also be clear this isn’t going to slow down Brexit, it’s not going to stop Brexit. Hunt also played down the idea that, if parliament were to reject aspects of the withdrawal agreement, Brussels would offer a better deal. Asked if MPs could force the government to go back to the negotiating table by voting against what was on offer, he replied: Parliament can say whatever it wants but of course renegotiation is something that involves two parties. We will be hearing from David Davis, the Brexit secretary, when he takes questions in the Commons soon. And we will also hear from May herself, who is in Brussels later, and the leading cabinet Brexiter Boris Johnson, who is giving a press conference this afternoon. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.50am: Justine Greening, the education secretary, gives a speech at a Reform thinktank conference on social mobility. 9.30am: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 9.30am: NHS England waiting time figures are published. 2.05pm: Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, presents his draft budget in the Scottish parliament. 2.30pm: Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, hold a press conference with their Japanese counterparts after talks in Greenwich.

However, as the vote drew close, Theresa May seemed unmoved, despite having conceded on a separate amendment authored by Grieve to build in more scrutiny when ministers adapt EU law into UK legislation. Urged by Conservative MP Anna Soubry to accept Grieve’s amendment at PMQs, May held firm, saying it could prevent an “orderly and smooth Brexit” process. It was a gamble that did not pay off, though several of the so-called “mutineers” peeled off in the final moments. How did your MP vote on the successful Brexit amendment? After the defeat, many blamed the chief whip, Julian Smith, and some went further, placing the blame on May for promoting Smith’s predecessor in the role, Gavin Williamson, who delivered victories in a string of tight parliamentary votes, to succeed Michael Fallon as defence secretary. Smith is relatively inexperienced, and was bruised by last week’s chaos over the Brexit deal when the DUP raised last-minute objections. Relations between whips and the rebels had deteriorated over the course of the day, with Soubry claiming whips had made one female MP cry. “It is right that the whips should exert pressure, cajole people – that’s perfectly proper in my view,” she told the Evening Standard. “But bullying, reducing colleagues to tears and making them shake is not acceptable. It has got to stop. We are the Conservative party, not Momentum thugs.” Further extraordinary allegations emerged on the morning of the vote, a symbol of how relations were at rock bottom, when at least one potential rebel was warned by Smith that they could be sued if they made defamatory comments about the whips’ activities. In the final minutes, it was left to cabinet ministers to try to salvage the vote. MP Vicky Ford said she would take “a moment to reflect” after an 11th-hour concession by justice minister Dominic Raab, who said he would look seriously at the amendment again, just 15 minutes before the vote, as other Tory rebels shouted “too late.” Appearing to waver in front of the voting lobby, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, took Ford gently by the arm and led her into the “no” lobby. Williamson himself was seen cajoling Scottish Tory MP Paul Masterton, who then tweeted he would abstain. Another crucial vote lost by the government was Charlie Elphicke, the MP suspended from the party by Smith during the sexual harassment scandal, with Elphicke repeatedly claiming he had never been told what the allegations against him were. He abstained on the vote. Conservative whips may also have been banking on a crucial factor that did not deliver – Labour Brexiters. Tory backbenchers were asked by whips to contact their Labour neighbours in leave seats to warn them about the case for backing the amendment. Government whips have become used to counting on around seven Labour MPs who are committed Brexiters to vote with them. Yet there was a Herculean effort on Wednesday by the Labour whips, especially those assigned to the bill, Jess Morden, Alan Campbell and Mark Tami, to ensure those Labour MPs helped inflict defeat on the government. In the end, just two voted against Grieve’s amendment – Kate Hoey and Frank Field. Whips said that veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner, a longtime Eurosceptic, was persuaded by the chance to inflict humiliation on Theresa May and in turn persuaded others, including Grahame Morris and Ronnie Campbell. Jeremy Corbyn rang some of Labour’s pro-Brexit MPs himself to urge them to back the Grieve amendment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/14/tory-rebels-theresa-may-brexit-date-in-law-eu-withdrawal-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:50:28Z","webTitle":"Tory rebels warn May not to attempt to enshrine Brexit date in law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/14/tory-rebels-theresa-may-brexit-date-in-law-eu-withdrawal-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/14/tory-rebels-theresa-may-brexit-date-in-law-eu-withdrawal-bill","fields":{"headline":"Tory rebels warn May not to attempt to enshrine Brexit date in law","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Key Tory rebels who inflicted a Commons defeat on the government’s flagship EU withdrawal bill have warned Theresa May that she could be embarrassed again unless she concedes more ground. Eleven MPs backed an amendment by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve to enshrine in law parliament’s right to a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. Grieve and his fellow rebel Stephen Hammond said another defeat was likely next week if May persisted in her attempt to fix the date of Brexit. The government-backed amendment seeks to set in law that the UK’s membership of the union will end at 11pm GMT (midnight in Brussels) on 29 March 2019. Grieve said he was sure the government would be defeated again next week if the amendment went to a vote. “I hope very much [another rebellion] won’t be necessary because if the government comes back with that date I’m sure the government will be defeated and I have no desire to defeat the government or be involved in the government’s defeat a second time,” he told BBC Newsnight on Wednesday. Hammond, the MP for Wimbledon, who was sacked as Tory party vice-chair overnight, echoed Grieve’s sentiments. “I’ve never rebelled once, unlike some people who are currently ministers who tried their best to bring down the Cameron government,” Hammond told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday morning. “I’ve got no intention of rebelling again. I think frankly last night was avoidable and it’s regrettable it went the way it did.” Asked if he would vote against the Brexit date amendment, Hammond said: “I didn’t say that. I said I hope I don’t have to rebel again. I think a lot of people will view that proposition as unnecessary, probably not a good way to negotiate.” Downing Street said there were “no plans to withdraw the amendment” next week on the exit date. “We are disappointed with last night’s amendment and we now need to consider if further changes are needed to the bill to ensure it fulfils its vital purpose.”Answering questions in the Commons on Thursday, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, gave no comment when asked by his Labour shadow, Keir Starmer, whether he would drop the “ill-conceived gimmick” of the Brexit date amendment or face another defeat. Davis said only that he would respect any vote by MPs. However, asked by Starmer if the government would seek to “undermine or overturn” Wednesday night’s defeat, he said no decisions had been made. The impact of Grieve’s amendment would be to bring a “very compressed timetable” to the Brexit legislative process. “Those who want to see a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union will hopefully want to see a working statute book,” he said. “And so we will have to think about how we respond to it. But as always, we take the House of Commons’ view seriously, and will continue to do so.” Hammond and Grieve were criticised by colleagues and pro-Brexit media on Wednesday night, with the Tory MP Nadine Dorries and former ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie going as far as suggesting they should be deselected. Other backers of amendment 7 were also criticised, including the former education secretary Nicky Morgan, former business minister Anna Soubry, and Cambridge MP Heidi Allen. Speaking in the Commons during Brexit questions, Soubry had a testy exchange with opponents on her own benches. When Soubry began by saying none of the rebels “took any pleasure” in what they did, one Tory MP shouted that the rebels drank champagne to celebrate. Soubry stopped her question to say: “Nobody drank champagne, not on these benches. Let’s just nail that one. These are serious matters.” Grieve also said rebels would not be deterred. “I’m not very concerned about knives being out for me,” he said. “I’m in parliament to do my duty by my constituents and by my country. I’m sorry to hear if colleagues think so ill of me but it’s not going to affect what I do one jot.” Hammond declined to comment on calls for deselections. “I make a cardinal rule not to be rude about my colleagues in public and I am not going to start now,” he said. The MP said some degree of flexibility around the article 50 deadline, two years from the date May triggered the official notification that the UK is leaving the EU, was crucial. However, he said that would be a matter of weeks because of the need to conclude before June’s EU parliament elections. “Nothing that happened yesterday stops Brexit; nothing that happened yesterday actually undermines the prime minister in any way,” he said. “If [the Brexit deal] is concluded by October next year, that gives six months if things go wrong. What we want to see is a deal negotiated in good time, so it can be scrutinised and passed by the House of Commons.” May will travel to a crucial EU summit on Thursday under the cloud of her Commons defeat, somewhat marring last week’s fillip provided by the European commission, which said that negotiations had made “sufficient progress” on EU citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border to move negotiations to the second phase – the future relationship. Downing Street said it would “respect the will of MPs” but may seek to amend the bill again during later stages of its passage through parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/14/australia-must-try-to-engage-trump-with-world-joe-hockey-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T07:41:16Z","webTitle":"Australia must try to engage Trump with world, Joe Hockey says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/australia-must-try-to-engage-trump-with-world-joe-hockey-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/australia-must-try-to-engage-trump-with-world-joe-hockey-says","fields":{"headline":"Australia must try to engage Trump with world, Joe Hockey says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia has to engage the Trump administration on the positive, practical effects of global engagement to get the ear of a president focused on his domestic constituency, according to the Turnbull government’s man in Washington. Joe Hockey has used a speech to the Lowy Institute marking Donald Trump’s first year in the White House to share some observations about the administration and its agenda, and about Australian efforts to keep Trump engaged in the world. The ambassador said on Thursday evening Australia needed the US to remain outward-looking, “even as it faces its domestic challenges”. He said Australia had an obligation to explain to the administration “why we believe Paris matters to Pittsburgh, why beef trade protection hurts Montana or why foreign investment delivers jobs in Mobile, Alabama, or Des Moines, Iowa”. Hockey said it was also important to pursue diplomacy outside the beltway. “It’s an important tool in the tradecraft of diplomacy to engage in advocacy beyond the corridors of the state department or the hallowed halls of the Congress,” he said. Hockey said stepping outside Washington was an acknowledgment that the Trump administration was “responding to the wishes of the American people”. He said it was important to look beyond Washington to understand the unfolding events in the US, developments often playing out “at warp speed”. The ambassador said going to a business meeting in New York, or watching news produced out of the capital or the west coast “doesn’t give you a true understanding of what’s really happening in America”. He said Australia’s “city-centric” view of the US did not reflect the diversity of the country and the change currently under way. Rather than changing the country, Hockey said, Trump was “responding to some of their demands”. He said Australia was focused in its diplomacy on defending free trade and pursuing new opportunities in infrastructure. While Trump remained controversial abroad, Hockey noted that the president had not lost his core supporters and he predicted if Americans went to the polls today, he would be re-elected as president. Hockey said Trump’s decision to bulldoze regulations put in place by previous president Barrack Obama had increased business confidence. He noted the Dow Jones industrial average had increased by over 30% since Trump took the White House. “Many factors are at play but the surge in the US economy is not unrelated,” he said. Hockey noted Trump was active with judicial appointments. He had nominated 59 federal judges and 14 had been confirmed. He said the field evidence suggested Trump was “learning how to use the power of the office to reshape policy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/14/research-shows-that-certain-facts-can-still-change-conservatives-minds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"Research shows that certain facts can still change conservatives’ minds | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/14/research-shows-that-certain-facts-can-still-change-conservatives-minds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/14/research-shows-that-certain-facts-can-still-change-conservatives-minds","fields":{"headline":"Research shows that certain facts can still change conservatives’ minds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There’s a debate between social scientists about whether climate change facts can change peoples’ minds or just polarize them further. For example, conservatives who are more scientifically literate are less worried about global warming. In essence, education arms them with the tools to more easily reject evidence and information that conflicts with their ideological beliefs. This has been called the “smart idiot” effect and it isn’t limited to climate change; it’s also something we’re seeing with the Republican tax plan. However, other research has shown that conservatives with higher climate-specific knowledge are more likely to accept climate change – a result that holds in many different countries. For example, when people understand how the greenhouse effect works, across the political spectrum they’re more likely to accept human-caused global warming. Social scientists have also debated whether communicating the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming moves the needle in a positive or negative direction. Previous research led by Stephan Lewandowsky has shown that informing people about the expert consensus increases acceptance of human-caused global warming. However, Yale social scientist Dan Kahan has remained unconvinced and continues to argue that 97% consensus messaging is polarizing and therefore counter-productive. New research: consensus messaging works on conservatives To test which side is correct, social scientists Sander van der Linden, Anthony Leiserowitz, and Edward Maibach conducted a survey of over 6,000 nationally-representative Americans, of which 934 were conservatives with at least a college degree. This is the group for which facts should hypothetically be most polarizing, because they have the tools to most easily find ways to reject those facts and an ideological bias against accepting climate science. On Monday the authors published their first paper using this data in Nature Human Behavior. In that study, they specifically examined whether informing these high-education conservatives (and liberals) that “97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused global warming is happening” would increase their perception of the consensus, or if it would backfire, causing polarization and further rejection of the consensus among conservatives. In the control group, college-educated conservatives thought the expert consensus was about 64%, and college-educated liberals put the number at 78% (a 14% partisan gap). After being informed about the actual 97% consensus, the conservative answer increased to 83% while the liberal response rose to around 90% (a 7% partisan gap). Notably, not only did highly-educated conservatives respond positively by generally accepting the facts and adjusting their views accordingly, but the ideological gap on this question shrunk in half. It’s a clear example that facts aren’t necessarily polarizing. In response to this study, Kahan pointed out that it only addressed perceived consensus and not acceptance of human-caused global warming or support for climate policy. However, the authors have just published a second paper in the Journal of Science Communication that responds to Kahan’s critiques by including the data addressing those questions. It shows that consensus messaging increased acceptance of human-caused global warming by about 5%, both for the participants as a whole and specifically for college-educated conservatives. Similarly, support for climate policy rose by about 2% across the political spectrum. Public opinion isn’t the policy bottleneck These numbers might sound small, but on their 7-point scale (4 being neutral), support for climate policy rose from 5.48 to 5.59 on average, and from 4.89 to 4.99 among college-educated conservatives. In other words, though it may not be considered a high priority, support for climate policy is already there, and informing people about the 97% expert consensus moved the needle a bit further in the positive direction. And as Kahan said in 2003, Individual opinions influence political outcomes through aggregation. Even a modest amount of variation in opinion across individuals will profoundly influence collective deliberations Indeed public awareness of the expert consensus and reality of human-caused global warming has been on the rise, as research by Larry Hamilton has shown. A recent Gallup poll also found American concern about climate change at an all-time high. But lack of public support isn’t the problem. For example, 62% of Trump voters support carbon pollution taxes and/or regulations. And of course while there is tremendous public support for many gun control policies, Republicans in Congress refuse to vote for those policies. Sadly, the party is now morally and intellectually bankrupt, completely controlled by special interests and indifferent to the opinions of their constituents. To summarize, most Americans are aware that humans are causing global warming, and across the political spectrum they support climate policies. Communicating facts isn’t necessarily polarizing; in fact certain information like the existence of the 97% expert climate consensus actually decreases polarization and increases acceptance of climate science and policies. That’s all important and good news, but until the fossil fuel industry no longer controls the political party in power, America won’t be able to implement national climate policies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/15/song-of-granite-review-joe-heaney-pat-collins","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Song of Granite review – Joe Heaney story is a biopic unlike any other","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/15/song-of-granite-review-joe-heaney-pat-collins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/15/song-of-granite-review-joe-heaney-pat-collins","fields":{"headline":"Song of Granite review – Joe Heaney story is a biopic unlike any other","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In order to tell the story of sean-nós singer Joe Heaney, Pat Collins blends a documentarian’s attachment to authenticity with a poet’s flair for innovation and unconventional storytelling.

Along the way he performed in pubs, helped build stone walls and worked as a doorman in New York City. However, the biographical details are of far less interest to Collins than the music, and the film will be a particular delight to lovers of Irish folk music, with its keening textures and melancholic tones.

Glaucoma is an eye condition in which the pressure of fluids inside the eye damages the optic nerve – and can lead to blindness if left undetected. Many are unaware they have the condition, and while the risk of glaucoma increases with age, it can also affect babies and children. About 57.5 million people are thought to have the condition worldwide. Now researchers delving into the question of whether caffeine could affect pressure inside the eye say they have found that drinking hot tea appears to be linked to a lower risk of glaucoma. Writing in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, researchers in the US describe how they analysed data from a 2005-2006 nationwide health and nutrition survey, looking at the results of eye examinations from 1,678 participants aged 40 or over. They also analysed the participants’ responses to a questionnaire about how often they had drunk coffee, hot tea, soft drinks or iced tea in the past year, and whether those drinks were caffeinated or decaffeinated. In total, 84 participants were found to have glaucoma, with diabetes more common and smoking less common for those with the condition than the participants taken as a whole. There was no link between drinking coffee, soft drinks or iced tea and having glaucoma, whether the drinks were decaffeinated or not, nor between glaucoma and decaffeinated hot tea. But, the team noted, there did appear to be a link to hot tea in general, with those consuming more than six cups of the brew a week less likely to have the condition even when factors such as age, body mass index, smoking and diabetes were taken into account. Overall, the chance of having glaucoma – compared with not having it – was 74% lower among those who drank hot tea in such quantities. “In summary, individuals who consumed hot tea were less likely to have a diagnosis of glaucoma compared with those who did not consume hot tea,” the authors write. The team suggests that certain plant chemicals such as flavonoids and other antioxidants found in tea could be offering a protective effect, adding that caffeinated tea might be richer in antioxidants than decaffeinated tea. But they admit that it is difficult to draw any conclusions since the study only offers a snapshot in time and does not look at whether drinking hot tea actually lowers the risk of glaucoma. It is also a puzzle why there is no link between iced tea and lower glaucoma risk. And there are other limitations, including a lack of data on the type of tea drunk, that participants could have drunk multiple types of beverage, possible errors in diagnosis of glaucoma, and the fact that very few participants had glaucoma – and very few of them drank hot tea. What’s more, the survey relied on participants self-reporting what they had drunk, with the authors noting the association could even be a matter of chance. “Tea drinkers should feel comfortable about drinking tea but should realise that the results are preliminary and drinking tea may not prevent glaucoma,” said Anne Coleman, co-author of the research from the University of California, Los Angeles. Melanie Hingorani from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists urged caution. “Absolutely nothing is proven or even strongly evidenced – there are all sorts of things wrong with it,” she said of the study. All those over the age of 40 should have an eye-check every one to two years, she said, and more regularly for those at risk, such as those with diabetes or a family history of glaucoma. If detected, Hingorani added, glaucoma can be tackled – although not reversed – with drops or other treatments. Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said that while the study was interesting, it did not mean that anyone should starting increasing their hot tea consumption. “I would not say in any way that this proves that drinking tea prevents glaucoma,” he said, adding that the study did not take into account other habits or socioeconomic factors that could be at play, and that robust clinical trials would be needed to show if tea had any benefits for glaucoma risk. Instead, Sattar said, individuals should focus on other lifestyle choices – such as having a good quality diet and staying active – to reduce the likelihood of developing conditions known to be linked to an increased risk of glaucoma, such as diabetes. “Drinking tea without sugar is certainly beneficial because it is a very low calorie drink; whether it has got other magical benefits like preventing glaucoma I think is open to question,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/14/dawid-malan-maiden-century-hands-england-strong-start-third-ashes-cricket-test-waca","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:43:48Z","webTitle":"Dawid Malan maiden century hands England strong start in third Ashes Test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/14/dawid-malan-maiden-century-hands-england-strong-start-third-ashes-cricket-test-waca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/14/dawid-malan-maiden-century-hands-england-strong-start-third-ashes-cricket-test-waca","fields":{"headline":"Dawid Malan maiden century hands England strong start in third Ashes Test","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a ground that has often been a graveyard for English cricket Dawid Malan kept alive hopes of heading for Melbourne with the destination of the Ashes still undecided. Malan hit his maiden Test century, an innings of great character, a bit of luck and some silky strokeplay. His unbroken partnership of 176 with Jonny Bairstow, belatedly promoted to No6, was easily the highest England have managed in the series. Thus the tourists managed to finish the first day on 305 for four after Joe Root had won his third toss of the series. Malan did not suggest too much permanence at the start when he was peppered with a stream of short-pitched deliveries. He was determined to do more than duck, sway or fend. There were two top-edges over the keeper’s head, one of which went for six, and there were a few swishes at fresh air as well. But he survived and as his innings progressed it became more assured. There were elegant cover drives, whether the bowler was the deadly Nathan Lyon or Josh Hazlewood, but nothing bettered the pull shot against the second new ball which took him to three figures. That second new ball should have dismissed Malan, on 92, at the first attempt but Cameron Bancroft at third slip spilled the catch off Mitchell Starc’s bowling. So, alongside Bairstow, Malan was able to negotiate those critical nine overs against the new ball with no losses and just a few alarms at the end of a day that offered some riveting entertainment. We had been warned that we might witness a pale shadow of the superfast tracks of two or three decades ago but the suggestion that the Perth pitch is now a pudding may have been overstated. This one may be slower than in the golden days but in the final Ashes Test on this famous West Australian strip of turf the ball still flew through faster than it does on any other pitch in this country or around the world – with the possible exception of the Wanderers in Johannesburg. Hence there were some captivating duels, unless you happened to be Mark Stoneman, who was hit full on the helmet from a well‑directed short ball from Hazlewood. It is just as well that Stoneman is not a club cricketer since he would now be penniless; his helmet had to be replaced and he broke his second bat of the tour during another plucky innings. The right team was bowling to highlight that there is life in the old pitch yet. After Australia had bowled prettily and full for 90 minutes, they changed tack. The opportunities to drive diminished. Since the ball was obstinately declining to swing the trio of tall pacemen pulled their length back and the ball whistled through to the keeper; sometimes it sailed wastefully over Tim Paine’s head but when it was chest height batting became more of a trial, albeit one with compensations. This surface is true; the outfield is like glass so there are plenty of boundaries out there. England’s slower pace bowlers may not be able to exploit the bounce so easily. Three hundred here would have been worth 400 at Brisbane and Adelaide. The full-length ball, favoured by the Australians at the start, accounted for Cook. A Starc delivery thudded into the pads and Cook knew – even without the statutory glance at his partner – there was no point in seeking a review. Cook has been striving fiendishly hard to recover the magic; it is even possible that he is working too hard but he has always reckoned that hard work brings its rewards in the end. If everything had been functioning smoothly he would have hit that Starc delivery. Meanwhile Stoneman was racing away, clipping full balls through square leg with aplomb as the pacemen searched in vain for swing. James Vince, you’ve guessed it, settled impressively; there was the odd sweet cover drive. But soon he was tied down by Hazlewood; Steve Smith removed his short extra‑cover to slip, leaving an inviting gap, and then Vince, with one eye on that gap and another on lunch, drove away from his body with no foot movement and was caught behind. Patience is running thin with him, even though he tantalises. After the break there was a little flurry of boundaries for Joe Root while Stoneman had a torrid time against Hazlewood. He did manage an upper cut boundary to reach his third Test half-century but in the next over against Hazlewood, Stoneman was dropped at first slip by Mitchell Marsh; then he was hit on the helmet and, after an appropriate delay for recovery and inspection, he was almost caught at short point after spooning another bouncer in that direction. Yet it was Root who departed next, caught down the leg-side off Cummins; the namby-pamby full-length bowling had been abandoned and Australia were looking far more dangerous. Soon after Stoneman fended at another fierce lifter from Starc but was given not out by the umpire Marais Erasmus after the ball had ended up the gloves of a jubilant Paine. The third umpire, Aleem Dar, did not dally long and overturned the decision. It may be that he reached the right conclusion in the wrong way. Initially the replays did little to provide conclusive evidence that Erasmus’s decision should be changed. After Dar had sent his message another replay surfaced, which suggested the ball may have grazed Stoneman’s right glove. At 131 for four it felt like the same old story but Malan and Bairstow, now batting with a fine mixture of aggression and discretion, stayed together for 51 overs, which must have cheered up English men and women with tickets for Melbourne on Boxing Day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/14/national-australia-bank-stops-all-lending-for-new-thermal-coal-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T02:57:20Z","webTitle":"National Australia Bank stops all lending for new thermal coal projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/national-australia-bank-stops-all-lending-for-new-thermal-coal-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/national-australia-bank-stops-all-lending-for-new-thermal-coal-projects","fields":{"headline":"National Australia Bank stops all lending for new thermal coal projects","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"National Australia Bank says it will halt all lending for new thermal coal mining projects, becoming the first major Australian bank to phase out support of thermal coal mining. While the bank will continue providing finance for coal projects already on its books, NAB said an orderly transition to a low-carbon Australia was critical for the economy and for continued access to secure and affordable energy. “While we will continue to support our existing customers across the mining and energy sectors, including those with existing coal assets, NAB will no longer finance new thermal coal mining projects,” the bank said in a statement on Thursday. The news was welcomed by environmental groups. “This is a market-leading position for an Australian bank and is even stronger than the position taken by Commonwealth Bank last month because it is formal policy,” Greenpeace campaigner Jonathan Moylan said. The Commonwealth Bank indicated to shareholders in November that it would not fund new, large coal projects, saying its support for coal would continue to decline as it helps finance the transition to a low-carbon economy. ING has promised to phase out coal within a decade and has committed to stop funding any utility company which relies on coal for more than 5% of its energy. ANZ and Westpac both have policies that limit lending to new coal projects under certain conditions. “NAB has lifted the bar above its competitors by becoming the first major bank to end lending to all new thermal coal mining,” said Julien Vincent, executive director of environmental finance advocates Market Forces. “This policy means NAB joins the ranks of dozens of banks and insurance companies globally that are withdrawing from this most climate-polluting of industries.” The World Bank has also announced it will “no longer finance upstream oil and gas, after 2019” in an effort to be consistent with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. “It’s time for ANZ and Westpac to do the same and rule out investing in new coal projects,” Moylan said. Last month, Australia’s financial regulator warned banks, lenders and insurers that they had to do more to reduce risk relating to climate change, and flagged the possibility of “regulatory action” if they didn’t act.

The vital role of housing when leaving a violent partner is painfully real to everyone in our organisation – as women who have experienced domestic violence, housing sector workers, homeless people, mothers and chronically underpaid workers. The lack of safe, affordable housing comes up again and again as the single biggest barrier to leaving abusive relationships: how can someone leave when there is nowhere to go? The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) releases official homelessness statistics based on a test of homelessness and eligibility defined by Part VII of the Housing Act (1996, amended 2002). At first glance, the latest figures appear to show that the number of people made homeless as a result of domestic violence has fallen by almost 60% in the last decade. But these statistics hide the devastating reality of the number of services for vulnerable women being shut. And they do not tell the story of how many survivors are turned away at the application stage. In July 2016, a woman approached us because Southwark council had told her it was “reasonable” for her to return, with her three children, to the home of her violent partner. Since then we’ve been campaigning to demand that Southwark council makes homeless survivors a priority. We have recently spoken to survivors in Tower Hamlets who were told they would be offered accommodation with men when Hopetown hostel closes. People who refuse to take this dangerous advice risk being found “intentionally homeless” under homelessness legislation; there is then no further legal duty for a council to help them. We are fighting the closure of Hopetown. Tower Hamlets council has proposed a 33% cut to women-only beds, alleging that there is less need for them. But when almost half of homeless women have experienced domestic violence and a fifth have experienced childhood abuse, women-only hostels provide a vital safe space in which they can begin to rebuild their lives. In our experience, the practice of gatekeeping – preventing access to services by turning people away before they can make an application – is rife in council housing departments. And if people are prevented from making homelessness applications, given incorrect information about their entitlement to apply, and told they are not a priority, is it any wonder they don’t show up in DCLG statistics? This government can no longer ignore the desperate need for social housing for people experiencing domestic abuse. In May, North London Sisters Uncut reclaimed the Holloway Prison visitors centre to demand that the site be used to build social housing for survivors instead of being sold off for luxury flats. In a queue for social housing with 18,000 other households, survivors in Islington are forced to choose between living with their abuser or homelessness, while the former prison site is sold off to developers. Cuts to services have been devastating, but they are not the only problem. Many survivors are turned away from housing services because of their access needs, immigration status or gender identity. There is one specialist refuge for learning disabled survivors in the country, though they’re twice as likely to experience domestic abuse. Women’s Aid found in 2016 that nearly 10% of refuge referrals were declined because the service was unable to meet the support or access needs of the survivor. Health and care needs should never prevent survivors from finding safety. Migrant survivors assessed as having “no recourse to public funds” are unable to claim housing benefit, and are therefore barred from most refuges and supported housing services. As a result, four out of five BME survivors who approach a refuge are turned away. Government immigration policy leaves survivors trapped in violent homes. Although up to 80% of trans and gender non-conforming people experience domestic violence, they are often excluded from refuges and forced into street homelessness. Many refuges state that trans women can apply, but this is far from the reality. And with the closure of specialist organisations such as PACE and Broken Rainbow, trans and gender non-conforming people face misinformed, transphobic and dehumanising responses when they seek help to deal with the effects of abuse. In our experience as activists, survivors and housing and domestic violence sector workers, it’s clear that the DCLG figures are the tip of the iceberg. They are merely further evidence that local authorities are turning their back on survivors, pushing them into increasingly unsafe situations as they cut specialist refuge services and lock off social housing.

They couldn’t be more wrong. In recent years local charities have faced huge challenges, which show no signs of abating. This week it was announced that inflation had risen to more than 3%, putting a further squeeze on household incomes. Higher costs have a direct impact on charities, reducing people’s disposable income so that they have less money for charitable donations. These challenges have led to one in five UK charities struggling to survive, according to the Charities Aid Foundation. Research from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations shows that this particularly affects small charities, which are seeing their incomes fall while the incomes of large charities grow. Despite this tough landscape there are reasons to be hopeful. I have the pleasure of working every day with inspirational charities that make a real difference – small charities like Clear Buckhaven, which is transforming underutilised public spaces in a former mining community in Fife into productive green spaces. Or Vauxhall City Farm, which is helping to reconnect young children with nature, food and the environment. These kinds of local charities are exactly the organisations local charities day has been set up to support and acknowledge. What more can be done to help local charities in these challenging times? First, we all need to look at what more we can do. This Christmas I’ll be donating to a local children’s clothing charity in Edinburgh, giving away clothes that no longer fit my children. Small actions like this are often the lifeblood for local charities. But there are also bigger actions that can support local charities. Many streams of funding for which charities can apply have restrictions on how the money is spent. This denies charities the flexibility they need. Funders should offer restricted and unrestricted funding, enabling charities to respond when circumstances change, such as in providing emergency funding following recent flooding in Lancashire. The government can also play its part. Fundraising by society lotteries is capped, with a £10m limit on ticket sales each year and a £4m limit on the value of tickets in a single draw. This restricts the amount of money that can be raised for good causes. Small changes to the law, which are backed by a huge number of charities, would make a big difference and provide many local charities with much-needed funds. Let’s use this year’s local charities day as an opportunity to celebrate local charities and the work they do in challenging circumstances. But let’s also use it to support them, so they can thrive in the years to come. Clara Govier is head of charities at the People’s Postcode Lottery.

In a lengthy statement posted on Twitter, the Super Size Me director revealed that he was once accused of rape and had settled a sexual harassment claim made by a female employee. Spurlock also admitted to being “unfaithful to every wife and girlfriend I have ever had”. “As I sit around watching hero after hero, man after man, fall at the realisation of their past indiscretions, I don’t sit by and wonder ‘who will be next?’ I wonder, ‘when will they come for me?’” Spurlock wrote. The director said that the allegation of rape occurred while he was at college. While no charges or investigations were brought against him, the claimant named Spurlock in an essay on the incident that was read aloud in class. “In my mind, we’d been drinking all night and went back to my room,” he wrote. “We began fooling around, she pushed me off, then we laid in the bed and talked and laughed some more, and then began fooling around again. We took off our clothes. She said she didn’t want to have sex, so we laid together, and talked, and kissed, and laughed, and then we started having sex.” When the woman then started to cry Spurlock said that he “didn’t know what to do. We stopped having sex and I rolled beside her. I tried to comfort her. To make her feel better. I thought I was doing ok, I believed she was feeling better. She believed she was raped.” Spurlock said the allegation of harassment was made by an office assistant in 2009, and that he had paid a sum to settle it. “I would call my female assistant ‘hot pants’ or ‘sex pants’ when I was yelling to her from the other side of the office. Something I thought was funny at the time, but then realized I had completely demeaned and belittled her to a place of non-existence. “So, when she decided to quit, she came to me and said if I didn’t pay her a settlement, she would tell everyone. Being who I was, it was the last thing I wanted, so of course, I paid. I paid for peace of mind. I paid for her silence and cooperation. Most of all, I paid so I could remain who I was,” he said. The director said that he had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child, and had a drinking problem. He concluded the letter by promising to “do better. The only individual I have control over is me. So starting today, I’m going to be more honest with you and myself. I’m going to lay it all out in the open. Maybe that will be a start. Who knows. But I do know I’ve talked enough in my life. I’m finally ready to listen.” The admission by Spurlock follows a number of sexual abuse allegations made against men in the entertainment industry, including James Toback, Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein. In an essay published by the New York Times on Wednesday, actor Salma Hayek joined more than 90 women in accusing Weinstein of sexual assault. The producer denies any claims of non-consensual sex made against him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/14/bollywood-sexual-harassment-minister-for-women-writes-to-film-makers","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T11:25:44Z","webTitle":"Bollywood sexual harassment: minister for women writes to film-makers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/bollywood-sexual-harassment-minister-for-women-writes-to-film-makers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/14/bollywood-sexual-harassment-minister-for-women-writes-to-film-makers","fields":{"headline":"Bollywood sexual harassment: minister for women writes to film-makers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"India’s minister for women has written to leading Bollywood film-makers asking them to crack down on sexual exploitation in the industry after several actors went public with allegations of harassment and assault. Maneka Gandhi wrote to at least 25 prominent producers and actors urging them to “provide a safe, secure and inclusive work environment for women” in line with national laws against sexual harassment. She said harassment under Indian law included unwanted touching, lewd remarks or making “a demand or request for sexual favours”. On Wednesday the Guardian published the accounts of several actors across Indian film industries alleging harassment at the hands of male directors and casting officers. The actors said a “casting couch” culture, where women were regularly propositioned to exchange job opportunities for sex, was endemic. “It is always very subtle,” one actor, Swara Bhasker, said. “People try to insinuate that there are 10,000 girls for one role – so what can you do?” Another, Tisca Chopra, said: “They make situations uncomfortable and load choices in a way where if women want to get ahead, you have to do certain things.” Film industry journalists and union officials blamed the culture on a competitive, heavily male-dominated industry with poor regulation and a surplus of vulnerable young actors. “It’s an insecure industry in which people take advantage of each other because of this insecurity,” said Amit Behl, the senior joint secretary of the Cine and TV Artists Association (Cintaa) in Mumbai. In the ministerial letter, sent to heavyweights such as the producer Karan Johar and actors Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, Gandhi ordered film studios to set up internal complaint mechanisms and processes for dealing with complaints. Similar letters will soon be sent to producers in other Indian film industries, according to ministerial officials. The wave of accusations against high-profile politicians and news and entertainment figures in the US and UK has so far only caused ripples in the Indian cinema industry, the world’s largest. But the number of official reports of sexual harassment made to Cintaa has increased fourfold in the past two years in line with a growing willingness among Indian women across society to report sexual misconduct. Flavia Agnes, a senior lawyer and women’s advocate, said women in Indian cinema had frequently complained to her about the conduct of their male colleagues but “are generally afraid to speak out when their career is at stake”. “They fear they won’t get work, that’s the main worry,” she said. “They are afraid the industry will shun them, and that there are always newcomers waiting to take their place. “There has to be a lot more work to bring women together in associations so they can raise issues collectively,” she said. Indian women contributed thousands of stories of harassment and abuse to the #MeToo campaign, sparked by the revelation of decades of sexual abuse allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Allegations of abuse against men in south Asian academic circles were also collected in a publicly accessible document that was widely shared across social networks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/14/vladimir-putin-annual-press-conference-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T16:18:01Z","webTitle":"Collusion, Kremlin control … and cows: Putin glides through annual Q&A","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/vladimir-putin-annual-press-conference-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/14/vladimir-putin-annual-press-conference-2017","fields":{"headline":"Collusion, Kremlin control … and cows: Putin glides through annual Q&A","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has dismissed allegations of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s election campaign team as “invented” during his annual press conference in Moscow. “It was all invented by people opposed to Trump to make him seem illegitimate,” the Russian president said on Thursday, in response to a question about repeated contacts between members of the US president’s campaign and Russian officials or proxies. “These people are inflicting damage to their domestic political situation, incapacitating the president and showing a lack of respect to the electorate.” As usual, the press conference touched on a mixture of big geopolitical matters and local issues. Detailed questions were asked about particular regional road projects, the wheat harvest and the legality of attaching GPS trackers to cows. Putin also railed at US politicians for demonising Russia and then expecting it to help on issues such as the North Korean nuclear programme. Separately, he suggested the allegations of a state-sponsored doping programme in sport, which have led to a ban on the Russian team participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics, could be an invention by the US. Putin cast doubt on the integrity of the whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, suggesting he may have been drugged by the FBI. “He’s working under the control of American special services. What are they doing with him? What substances are they giving him so he says things?” he asked. Some questions are agreed with the Kremlin press service in advance. Others are asked by journalists who bring placards, flags or other items to wave in the air in the hope of attracting Putin’s attention. This year, the most passionate question was about the price of fish, asked by a man who admitted he had posed as a journalist to get in, and was in fact the director of an Arctic fish plant. The presidential election take place in March, and Putin recently confirmed what everyone has long known by saying he would run. He will almost certainly win another six-year term, but his campaign has hardly begun and he was vague when asked about his electoral manifesto. “Infrastructure, health, education and technology,” he said. “This is not the right format to go into detail.” Putin announced that he would be running as an independent candidate, not as a candidate from the Kremlin-backed United Russia party, resolving one of the few minor intrigues that remained about the election. Most of Russia’s ruling class are part of United Russia, but by distancing himself from the party, Putin will attempt to portray himself as above the fray of Russia’s corrupt political elite. Asked early on whether he was bored by the lack of political competition, Putin said the main problem the opposition faced was the lack of a programme. As usual, he made no reference by name to Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician who has opened campaign headquarters in cities across Russia, and who launched his electoral programme the day before. In what will probably be the closest Russia gets to a public debate before the vote, Ksenia Sobchak, a socialite-turned-journalist who wants to run for president on a liberal platform, attended the conference and asked Putin why Navalny was not allowed to run. “Are the authorities really scared of honest competition?” she said. In response, Putin compared Navalny to the former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is accused of trying to foment unrest in Ukraine, though he refused to refer to Navalny by name. “Those who you’ve named are the same as Saakashvili, only the Russian version. And you want these Saakashvilis to destabilise the situation in the country? Do you want attempted coups? We’ve lived through all that. Do you really want to go back to all that? I am sure that the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens do not want this,” he said. There were other trickier questions amid the softball enquiries: a Ukrainian journalist was given his annual chance to ask a toughly worded question about Russian actions in eastern Ukraine (to shouts of “shame” and “provocateur” from Russian journalists). Tatyana Felgenhauer, a journalist at the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy, who was nearly killed in a knife attack earlier this year, asked about the selective nature of the judicial system. But with no follow-up questions allowed, the Russian president remained untroubled. At one point, Putin ordered a questioner to sit down and give up the microphone. “This is not a discussion. You ask a question, I answer,” he said. The handful of probing questions are likely to be Putin’s toughest grilling before the election. But much of the press conference was dour and procedural, and lacked the spark of Putin’s meetings with the press earlier in his rule. It illustrated a central dilemma for his electoral campaign: after 18 years of Putin, how can the Kremlin keep things interesting without risking a loss of control?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/14/ocado-blames-delivery-drivers-shortage-sales-growth-slowdown","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T09:46:51Z","webTitle":"Ocado blames driver shortages for sales slowdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/14/ocado-blames-delivery-drivers-shortage-sales-growth-slowdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/14/ocado-blames-delivery-drivers-shortage-sales-growth-slowdown","fields":{"headline":"Ocado blames driver shortages for sales slowdown","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ocado has been forced to increase pay for its delivery drivers after a shortage of recruits hit sales at the online grocer. The company said it had put up pay by mid single digits in London and the south-east as it struggled to find new drivers to meet growing demand in these areas. Duncan Tatton-Brown, chief financial officer of Ocado, said there was currently a tight labour market, partly caused by the boom in online shopping, generally high employment levels in the south and possibly the fall in attractiveness of the UK to EU drivers following the Brexit vote and the plunge in the value of the pound. “More people are buying products as soon as they want online and there are more demand for delivery services and a tight labour market,” he said. He said the company had resolved the matter by raising wages and changing the way it recruited and advertised for its drivers, all of whom are direct employees. Ocado employs about 12,000 people, half of them drivers. Ocado is not the only company finding it hard to recruit. According to the recruitment company Manpower, some firms are offering bonuses and paying premiums of up to 20% on their standard rates to attract workers. Lorry drivers can earn more than £20 an hour as well as bonuses of £100 per shift. Retail revenues at the online grocer rose 11.6% to £374m in the 14 weeks to 3 December, its fourth quarter, down from 13.1% in the previous three months. Growth in average orders per week slowed to 11.1%, to 280,000, while the average order size edged up 0.3% to £106.11. Tatton-Brown, said without the driver shortage the sales increase would have been closer to 13%. Ocado’s deliveries are also restricted by the capacity of its latest highly automated warehouse in Andover, Hampshire. The company said the facility was delivering 50% more orders a week than three months ago with its robots working longer and more being added to the system. Tatton-Brown said the facility was “progressing very nicely” but he added: “We have not set a public deadline when we expect to get to full capacity but it is not unreasonable to expect it to take three years.” Analysts described Ocado’s sales growth as slower than hoped and suggested that the gradual ramp up at Andover would continue to prove a “headwind”. But there was optimism about the company signing more deals with overseas partners after joining up with French supermarket business Groupe Casino last month. Under the deal Ocado will build a robotic warehouse for the French group’s Monoprix brand which is due to start operating in 2019. The long-awaited deal reassured investors who view Ocado as a tech firm which can sell its inventions and expertise worldwide. Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, said he remained confident in the company’s ability to sign more overseas deals in the “medium term”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/14/football-transfer-rumours-barcelona-to-swoop-for-arsenals-mesut-ozil","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T09:14:36Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Barcelona to swoop for Arsenal's Mesut Özil?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/14/football-transfer-rumours-barcelona-to-swoop-for-arsenals-mesut-ozil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/14/football-transfer-rumours-barcelona-to-swoop-for-arsenals-mesut-ozil","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Barcelona to swoop for Arsenal's Mesut Özil?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There is a school of thought that your view of Mesut Özil – whether you see him as glorious, waifish creative genius or unnecessary, indolent garnish – offers a window into your very soul. Perhaps what Mesut does next will provide a glimpse into his. Will he scamper into the arms of his former manager, friend and mentor, José Mourinho, at Manchester United? Or will he opt for another kind of football altogether at Barcelona, where the tunnel decorum is at least on point? He may well have that choice: the Catalans are keeping their weather eye on the contract rebel’s situation in case their move for Philippe Coutinho comes adrift, and if the Arsenal man bides his time he might just end up with an unlikely move to Camp Nou. United remain the favourites to snare him, though. Arsenal could replace him with Real Madrid’s Dani Ceballos, although AC Milan would rival them. Not that Barcelona see Özil as the be all and end all: they could just sign the young Gremio midfielder Arthur instead, although he is one of the zillion players Chelsea are reportedly keen on too. And one more thing on Özil – his partner in tedious transfer sagas, Alexis Sánchez, could finally seal his move to Manchester City next month, although anyone who has seen he or they play this season could be excused for wondering why Pep Guardiola would still bother. United’s admiration of Özil may have something to do with the fact that another very-occasionally-brilliant midfielder, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, has fallen so far out of favour. Perhaps he’d be a natural replacement – but they think the same of Inter Milan’s João Mário and a £40m bid could be readied to test the Serie A high-flyers next month. Leaving from the door marked Do One will be Luke Shaw – who Newcastle, perhaps flush with money post-takeover, would like to help their relegation battle. There is full-back related excitement at Liverpool, where a porous defence that isn’t actually that porous at the moment could be augmented by the Atlético Madrid man Sime Vrsaljko, who would cost around £22m but could equally be bound for Napoli. West Brom and Wolves retain an interest in Bournemouth striker Benik Afobe, who isn’t scoring many these days despite beginning his career at the Vitality Stadium in good form two years ago. The Baggies are among a number of clubs looking for a centre-forward and Red Star Belgrade’s Richmond Boakye has also come under their radar, as he has with Newcastle and Celtic. But French side Rennes may have snuck in there first with a juicy £6m offer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/14/6700-rohingya-muslims-killed-in-attacks-in-myanmar-says-medecins-sans-frontieres","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T13:08:41Z","webTitle":"6,700 Rohingya Muslims killed in one month in Myanmar, MSF says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/6700-rohingya-muslims-killed-in-attacks-in-myanmar-says-medecins-sans-frontieres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/14/6700-rohingya-muslims-killed-in-attacks-in-myanmar-says-medecins-sans-frontieres","fields":{"headline":"6,700 Rohingya Muslims killed in one month in Myanmar, MSF says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 6,700 Rohingya Muslims, including at least 730 children under the age of five, were killed in the first month of a crackdown that started in August in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state, according to Médecins Sans Frontières. The figures released on Thursday by the humanitarian agency are believed to be a conservative estimate and far exceed Myanmar’s official death toll of 400. “The numbers of deaths are likely to be an underestimation, as we have not surveyed all refugee settlements in Bangladesh and because the surveys don’t account for the families who never made it out of Myanmar,” said Dr Sidney Wong, MSF’s medical director. The majority of the people killed (69%) were shot, while others were burned and beaten to death. “We heard reports of entire families who perished after they were locked inside their homes, while they were set alight,” said Wong. More than 640,000 Rohingya people have fled Rakhine since August. Soldiers, police and local militias burned hundreds of Rohingya villages to the ground, and they are also accused of gang-raping women and children, as well as slaughtering civilians indiscriminately. Western countries have condemned the violence as ethnic cleansing, an allegation Myanmar strongly denies. Officials in the country have laid the blame on “extremist terrorists” belonging to a new Rohingya militant group. A Myanmar government spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment. Some of the worst violence is believed to have occurred in Tula Toli, in a village in Maungdaw township, where survivors say residents were rounded up on riverbanks and shot as they tried to flee. The Guardian has seen videos taken by villagers showing the corpses of children washed up on shores. Survivors believe thousands may have died in that village alone. The high death toll tallies with reports from numerous journalists and human rights groups. “The latest report adds to a long list of harrowing accounts that Human Rights Watch has collected from Rohingya refugees who fled the campaign of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in northern Rakhine state,” said Rich Weir, Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch. “The numbers should shock the conscience of the international community and stir them to action. Those responsible must be held to account and sanctions must be imposed on those who are behind these atrocities,” he said. Myanmar and Bangladesh have agreed to send Rohingya people back to Rakhine, in a deal that has been criticised by human rights groups as premature and lacking safeguards for the persecuted minority. “Currently, people are still fleeing from Myanmar to Bangladesh and those who do manage to cross the border still report being subject to violence in recent weeks,” said MSF’s Wong. “With very few independent aid groups able to access Maungdaw district in Rakhine, we fear for the fate of Rohingya people who are still there.” Myanmar insists the reports of mass murder and rape are fabrications invented by the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people now living in squalid refugee camps in Bangladesh. Two Reuters journalists investigating the events were arrested this week. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained while carrying maps and documents relating to the region, after meeting police officers for dinner in Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon. The US embassy called the detentions “highly irregular”. The Myanmar military has filed charges against the journalists under the Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison term of 14 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/01/australian-military-worries-played-into-swift-indonesian-security-deal-cabinet-papers-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T13:01:30Z","webTitle":"Australian military worries played into swift Indonesian security deal, cabinet papers reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/01/australian-military-worries-played-into-swift-indonesian-security-deal-cabinet-papers-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/01/australian-military-worries-played-into-swift-indonesian-security-deal-cabinet-papers-reveal","fields":{"headline":"Australian military worries played into swift Indonesian security deal, cabinet papers reveal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As part of his vision of a grown-up Australia, the prime minister, Paul Keating, wanted the nation to find its own voice on trade, diplomacy and security. In particular, he wanted a much deeper engagement with Asia. On 18 December 1995 Australia signed a landmark security agreement with Indonesia, ending decades of antagonistic relations. It had been approved by cabinet just four days earlier, cabinet documents for 1994 and 1995 released by the Australian National Archives on Monday reveal. The submission argues that the defence white paper had identified Australia’s relationship with Indonesia as its most important and that a treaty would put a “formal umbrella” over existing understandings. “There is no country more important to Australia than Indonesia,” Keating argued in his submission. “Australian territory can in effect be directly threatened with military force only through Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.” But the agreement was very controversial. In Australia, as in Portugal, there was growing support for East Timor’s independence from Indonesia following the Dili massacre in 1991 and a series of brutal crackdowns on the resistance movement Fretilin by the Suharto regime. Keating acknowledged there would be “criticism from opponents of Indonesia, groups which are concerned by Indonesian policy in East Timor and from those who have simply been taken by surprise”. But he argued it was a matter of being clear about what the treaty didn’t do. It did not commit Australia in any way it did not wish on East Timor or require Australia to compromise its position on human rights, he argued. At a briefing on the cabinet paper, Kim Beazley, the former defence minister, said: “Paul knew I was pretty hardline when it came to the defence of Australia ... on the 707 he told me what he was up to. Suharto hadn’t told his people either, I believe.” Beazley remembered the thousand-yard stares of the generals who flanked Suharto. Beazley put the breakthrough down to Keating’s closeness to Suharto. Keating referred to Suharto as “bapak”, or father, and Suharto treated him like a son, Beazley said. Beazley said that Keating was especially anxious to sign the treaty before the election. “On the plane Keating said: ‘I think we are going to lose … I don’t think our opponents know much about the region. I want to put in place as much ballast as possible so they can bring themselves up to speed.’” Australia’s secret intelligence service, Asis, also features heavily in the cabinet papers. In February 1994, two former Asis officers and one of their wives appeared in an episode of Four Corners and made allegations of mistreatment, inefficiency, disregard for civil liberties and unaccountability. On 23 February 1994, Senator Gareth Evans, the minister for foreign affairs, announced there would be a judicial inquiry into Asis, which was helmed by public servant Michael Codd. Over the next year or so, cabinet adopted most of the recommendations including that there should be legislation governing Asis, a parliamentary oversight committee and six-monthly briefings for the opposition. The relationship between the various security agencies and the federal and state police forces is revealed as a perennial concern. Cabinet considered new guidelines for the exchange of information but most of the detail remains suppressed. The government also sought to revitalise the D-notice system – a voluntary system in which the media agrees not to publish certain material that could endanger military or intelligence capabilities – in late 1995. Cabinet was briefed on meetings with editors and news directors and told the media was amenable to a system that involved case-by-case negotiations on sensitive stories. Cabinet also considered a ratings system for visits by foreign dignatories after several incidents marred visits. In 1994 a young man had lurched toward Prince Charles during a visit to Australia, firing two blank shots from a starter’s pistol as a protest. There had also been protests when Qiao Shi, the chairman of the national Peoples Congress of China had visited. “Such visits can be counterproductive if visitors are subject to threats or harassment,” Evans said. Cabinet also decided to set up a new interdepartmental committee to deal with providing defence technology to regional partners. The submissions note that this is a major opportunity for Australian industry – it was discussing a joint patrol vessel proposal with Malaysia – and that, if Australia didn’t sell to countries in the region, someone else would. But balancing security and industry development was sensitive. The sale to Malaysia fell through. Relations with some countries also tested Australia’s diplomacy. French nuclear tests in the Pacific were an ongoing concern to the Keating government throughout 1995, as Australia sought to build stronger relationships with its near neighbours. The government feared France would use the short window before the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty came into force in 1996 to conduct more tests at Mururoa Atoll. “We are a leading proponent of the south Pacific nuclear-free zone and have urged France to accede to protocols open to it under the treaty, ” Evans told cabinet in early June 1995. A week later, the then French president, Jacques Chirac, announced testing would resume, prompting Evans to return to cabinet with an action plan to demonstrate Australia’s fury. Australia’s ambassador to France was recalled for consultations, military cooperation was suspended and Australia convened a special meeting of the South Pacific environmental ministers to discuss the environmental impact of testing. But Australia stopped short of banning imports of French wine, as other countries did. “While it is not proposed to embark on any trade or other direct economic restrictions, it should be noted that the existing policy of entering into no new contracts for the sale of uranium to France will remain in force,” Evans said. Despite the regional condemnation, France proceeded with six more tests, prompting riots in Tahiti and other Pacific nations. Subsequent declassified reports have revealed the extent of contamination in the Pacific."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/16/beyond-batman-how-indigenous-superheroes-are-turning-comics-inside-out","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T03:30:14Z","webTitle":"Beyond Batman: how Indigenous superheroes are turning comics inside out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/16/beyond-batman-how-indigenous-superheroes-are-turning-comics-inside-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/16/beyond-batman-how-indigenous-superheroes-are-turning-comics-inside-out","fields":{"headline":"Beyond Batman: how Indigenous superheroes are turning comics inside out","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1988, while Australia was disingenuously promising a treaty to placate the First Peoples protesting against bicentenary celebrations, an Aboriginal character called Gateway appeared in the comic Uncanny Xmen #229. The mutant superhero Wolverine was perplexed, muttering, “Old Abo must be some kind’a teleporter.” Gateway had no reply. In fact, he had no dialogue in that or any subsequent issue. Like most Indigenous characters in superhero comics created by non-Indigenous writers, the voiceless Gateway occupied an uneasy space in the narrative, neither hero nor villain, good nor evil; a troubling part of the flora and fauna of the Marvel universe. A new exhibition, Marramb-ik, at Melbourne museum’s Bunjilaka Aboriginal cultural centre, provides something of an antidote to this precarious positioning of Indigenous characters in the world of comic superheroes. Featuring the works of Victorian Aboriginal artists Lin Onus, Jade Kennedy, Heidi Brooks and Cienan Muir, this small but powerful show gives voice to Aboriginal superheroes created by and for Aboriginal people. It represents an empowering reversal of the genre – one focused on unlocking Indigenous power and potential. The title of the exhibition, Marramb-ik, is a Kulin phrase, a translation of that eternal assertion of being: “I am”. The idea is that the Aboriginal hero is not an alter ego to transform into, like mainstream superheroes do, but is instead the true ancestral self in which we are already grounded. Cienan Muir, a Yorta Yorta/Ngarrindjeri cosplayer in Marramb-ik who describes himself as an “Indigi-nerd”, explains the unique niche occupied by Indigenous superheroes: “Indigenous heroes tend to bear some sort of mark which expresses their journey. Some also gain powers via a spiritual being identifying them as significant and a protector of the community. These markers and powers are not hidden behind any adoption of alter egos or disguises, [but] show the taking on of these new things as part of their true self.” Beneath the surface of western pop culture there is both fascination and terror surrounding the suppressed power of the native. The superhuman abilities that might be unleashed when freed from the constraints of occupation and colonial control are hinted at by white characters with black skills. Crocodile Dundee, raised among Aborigines but a free agent due to his white privilege, is an unstoppable force with his increased kinaesthetic abilities. Captain Boomerang learns how to use just one Aboriginal weapon and it makes him a superhero. He showcases this appropriated Indigenous skill in the recent hit film Suicide Squad, a privilege not afforded to his Native American peer, Slipknot, who has no back story and sees no action as he is exterminated in the first few minutes of the squad’s mission. Indigenous characters have evolved politically, says Muir, from the comedic characters emerging from the 1967 referendum to the anti-colonial vigilantes of the millennial generation. “During the earlier ages of comics, any Indigenous hero was seen as a mystic, such as Bishop, who was sent back in time from the future. Recently there has been a creation of heroes with powers given to them from ancient powers, such as Medicine Man and the Dreaming Gods,” he says. Back in 1988, Australian Aboriginal characters such as Umbalaru and Betty Clawman briefly disrupted Batman and the Guardians of the Galaxy until they were neutralised, reconciled with the main protagonists and retired to obscurity. In 1998, Dark Ranger was assimilated into Batman’s Club of Heroes before fading comfortably from the memory of the DC universe. The First Nations-created characters currently emerging in popular culture have aggressively decolonising agendas. TV’s Cleverman attacks colonial and corporate power structures, while Nakkiah Lui’s play, Blackie Blackie Brown: The Traditional Owner of Death, showing at Sydney Theatre Company in 2018, portrays a black woman with super powers who hunts and kills the descendants of the colonists who massacred her ancestors. It seems that every 10 years, changes in attitudes and policy can be seen reflected in the world of comics. Indigenous agency in pop culture fantasy strikes at the heart of western myths of progress. Western superheroes traditionally represent the pinnacle of progress, mutations on the cusp of the next stage in evolution. Indigenous superheroes, on the other hand, turn the model of progress upside down. They present the unsettling notion that people are actually devolving in this industrial civilisation; that the height of human development – the key to knowledge and power – lies in our past rather than in some glorious, transhumanist tomorrow. Marramb-ik offers an alternative vision of future human potential grounded in engagement with the unacknowledged skills and genius of the past. Wurundjeri curator Stacie Piper says there were unique challenges involved in conveying the complex messages of the exhibition in such a limited space, while drawing exclusively on a local talent. “There were lots of requests to include famous Aboriginal characters created by non-Aboriginal artists, but what I wanted was storytelling depicting the expressions of our Victorian Koori community,” Piper says. Marramb-ik also pays homage to multiple generations of Aboriginal artists claiming space in a modern genre through ancient traditions of graphic storytelling, visual narrative, warrior practice and the ritualised wearing of regalia. The late Lin Onus, a Yorta Yorta man, is honoured for his trailblazing work creating cheeky, subversive characters from Kaptn Koori to the totemic duo, X and Ray. Jade Kennedy (Nyoongar, Muddi-Muddi, Tatti-Tatti and Waddi-Waddi) follows in Onus’s footsteps and builds upon deep knowledge of lore and ritual, incorporating traditional practices of knowledge transmission and mentoring in the learning of powerful, arcane skills. Heidi Brooks (Daingutti) and Muir share images and artefacts from their incursions into the world of cosplay, including a photograph of both of them taken with the legendary Stan Lee, arguably a senior elder in the international comic community. Also on display are the results of community workshops for children, engaging the next generation of Indigenous comic artists. A public program begins in mid-January, featuring comic workshops, cosplay and storytelling in Birrarung language. Mainstream superheroes are generally ordinary citizens who strap on an alter ego to transform into superheroes as required. For Indigenous people, our domesticated identities are our alter egos; colonial masks donned for survival, inhibiting rather than enabling our potential. Marramb-ik strips back our assimilated identities to reveal the ancestral hero beneath the mask, leaving all visitors to ponder a troubling question: are we more than what we have become? • Marramb-ik (I Am) is showing at Melbourne Museum until 18 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/14/sri-lankan-man-risks-torture-and-if-deported-from-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T02:56:30Z","webTitle":"Sri Lankan man 'risks torture and rape' if deported from Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/sri-lankan-man-risks-torture-and-if-deported-from-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/sri-lankan-man-risks-torture-and-if-deported-from-australia","fields":{"headline":"Sri Lankan man 'risks torture and rape' if deported from Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United Nations committee against torture has advised the Australian government not to deport a Sri Lankan man, citing concerns he might be tortured upon return. The Geneva-based committee of 10 independent human rights experts has issued an interim measure formally requesting Australia not to return the man while his case is considered. The man, whom the Guardian has chosen to refer to as Jyran, was told on 6 December by the department of immigration to prepare to be deported imminently from Australia. Jyran faces arrest in Sri Lanka over his alleged links to the defeated separatist army the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam – the Tamil Tigers. He is not alleged to have been a fighter: his arrest warrant states he faces charges of “assisting anti-government activities and supporting and assisting a terrorist organisation”. The Tamil Tigers were ultimately defeated in 2009 after 26 years of brutal civil war. The asylum seeker, an ethnic Tamil, went through Australia’s controversial “fast-track” refugee status determination process and was found to not meet the criteria for refugee status. Under the fast-track system, no additional information can be brought after an initial protection application. Jyran did not present the arrest warrant in the first instance, later explaining he did not understand the Australian justice system and feared he would “get in trouble” because of it. Having failed to produce the warrant, his protection claim was dismissed as not credible, and the Immigration Assessment Authority, which reviewed his case, chose not to consider the document after being presented with it. But the UN committee heard that Jyran faced “state-sanctioned torture” if he were to be refouled. “It is highly likely that the outstanding arrest warrant will be exercised on his arrival in Sri Lanka,” Jyran’s lawyer, Alison Battisson, told the committee. “Jyran will then be placed in custody. As a Tamil accused of assisting the LTTE, it is then highly likely that Jyran will be subjected to a range of torture practices, including rape.” There has been widespread reportage of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape. In July this year the UN’s special rapporteur Ben Emmerson visited Sri Lanka and reported that “the use of torture, has been, and remains today, endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds”. “Entire communities have been stigmatised and targeted for harassment and arbitrary arrest and detention, and any person suspected of association, however indirect, with the LTTE remains at immediate risk of detention and torture,” Emmerson wrote. Arrest warrants over alleged links to the Tamil Tigers are often seen as highly politicised or based on limited, or no, evidence. Battisson, the director of Human Rights for All, said the committee’s interim measure highlighted the serious issues faced by Tamil asylum seekers facing forcible return from Australia. “By issuing this measure, the UN recognises that Sri Lanka is not safe for Tamils, despite Australia denying refugee status to many Tamils.” Battisson said she was relieved the committee against torture had chosen to act, and quickly, to prevent the potential refoulement of Jyran. “These interim measures are quite rare – this illustrates the very real concern the UN has over Australia’s practices of refouling Tamils to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is not safe for many Tamils to return to.” A spokesperson from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection told the Guardian that people with no lawful basis to remain in Australia were expected to return home. “Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australia’s non‑refoulement obligations. Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously, including those under the convention against torture. “The Australian government considers each interim measures request in good faith and has an established process for considering each request on its merits.” The department said it would be inappropriate to comment further on individual cases. The Guardian understands that Jyran remains in immigration detention in Western Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/15/my-summer-of-whatsapp-love-a-true-romance-that-was-just-a-different-kind-of-real","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"My summer of WhatsApp love: just a different kind of true romance | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/my-summer-of-whatsapp-love-a-true-romance-that-was-just-a-different-kind-of-real","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/my-summer-of-whatsapp-love-a-true-romance-that-was-just-a-different-kind-of-real","fields":{"headline":"My summer of WhatsApp love: just a different kind of true romance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Not so many years ago I had a summer romance that was different from other summer romances. We met at a party, then he returned overseas and we spent several months locked in a dopamine-frenzied storm of messages. Sometimes hundreds a day, not respecting timezones or the real-life fragility of our connection. A lot of the messages had a curious quality. They lay somewhere between thoughts and spoken words – a kind of intimate hinterland that extends just beyond the borders of your head and heart but is mostly comprised of things you keep to yourself. As I found out, when you’re on a roll with someone, you both type quickly and have super speedy internet, these old citadels soon fall. What do I remember about that summer? It was hot but I didn’t go to the beach much because the glare of the sun on my screen made it hard to text. I was constantly anxious about leaving an area where I couldn’t charge my phone. At parties I left half-finished conversations with friends because I heard a ping from my pocket or my phone would shake on the table. I’d pick it up and go into the bathroom for ages, just so we could finish that conversation about Obama. At another friends’ beach house, I pretended I was sick, slipping her proffered Panadol into my pocket so I could spend the afternoon in my room, messaging him. I wondered if it was just another version of falling in love, or if it was not love, but a form of addiction. I listened to music he sent me and read articles he linked to; and then debated those articles on WhatsApp, which would lead to more links being sent. Show me the links and I’ll show you the man: I discovered he was the libertarian child of Christopher Hitchens and Ayn Rand. Mostly towards the end we just fought about politics. Cat Person, the short work of fiction in the New Yorker which went viral this week, struck many chords. Yesterday a male friend said,“Yeah, isn’t the messaging great? Sometimes it’s the best bit.” And he’s right. Sometimes it is. Some people after a holiday romance have pictures of themselves holding hands on the beach, posing by a lighthouse, chinking glasses of frosty margaritas, glowing with love and sunburn. The pictures I have are a bit different: selfies but also fragments of poetry, song lyrics, voice recordings, links to long-form pieces in the Atlantic or Paris Review, large slabs of Paul Keating’s speeches, lines from Philip Larkin’s poetry, photographs of photographs of the work of Nan Goldin or pictures of where I was when I was messaging him – all the meals left to go cold, all the beaches I didn’t swim at. Links, message, photo, link, link, photo, video, audio file, link, message, message, message, message – all summer long. Maybe it’s getting to the stage when a relationship won’t be judged on actual memories but on the size of the memory used to accommodate it. “He was so great,” some girl might sigh to her friends. “He took up a whole gig in my hard drive. I had to delete apps to accommodate his messages and photos on my phone.” I wonder if it was the same long ago, when people were away at sea, or in prison, or at war, and there were only letters. And the letters were ardent and bold, and sexy and intimate, and just like texting and WhatsApp are today? This is how it is now – and it has nothing much to do with Tinder and dating apps, but everything to do with phones and the way these devices can be used to accelerate intimacy in incredible, beautiful and terrifying ways. You don’t need to be nearby to feel close; sometimes being far away is better. You show a curated side of yourself for sure but, in the glow of the Messenger screen, with the lights out, you can also be vulnerable and tender in the way that you can’t be in a bar on a second date. I am not young but I straddle that divide between romance pre-internet and what it is like now. People like me are centaurs – or at least that’s how it feels – part person of the old world, part person with device. I’ll still never forget sitting next to some blond boy on train from Geneva in 1998 and knowing everything about him by the time we got to Barcelona. We spent two days together – walking the city, talking nonstop. He left me with a Hotmail address on a scrap of paper that I lost. It was a real connection, and those few days were for a long time my private shorthand for what I meant when I talked about romance. They could make a movie of what happened in 1998 (and did in Before Sunrise) – but how do you capture what’s going on in 2017? Of course romance is all about emotional connection and physical attraction – that never changes. Whatever generation you find yourself in, it’s all about the thrill of discovering someone else who you quite fancy, someone who says to you, “I’ve never told anyone else this – but …” The private, enclosed walls of a WhatsApp or Messenger chat thread can feel the same as two people sitting in a room. Yet there is some commentary around whether all of this virtual stuff is even real – as though the people involved in this sort of message maelstrom are somehow victims of a scam, that the feelings they have or the intimacy they feel is fake. It’s not fake. It’s just a different kind of real – and one we are starting to grapple with as a society. This way of courtship is not something you plan. No one ever thinks, “I would love to exchange thousands of text messages with this one person then have sex with them twice and then read back the texts and simultaneously want to die of shame.” There is nothing there in real life except for the discombobulating feeling that this stranger has hacked your inner hard drive, and the ache in your heart at the thought that if the history of your chats were published it would be the greatest love story of all time. It wasn’t just that dude, that summer. It’s a lot of afternoons in hotel rooms on warm days in thrall to messages coming on to the screen, and not caring if it’s sunny outside and there are things to do. It’s missing your bus stop because you are staring at the bubbles and the dots of an emerging message. It’s texting all through the night every night and not minding the fatigue.

The discussion paper points to figures that show about 80% of the world’s poker machines are in dedicated gambling venues, such as casinos. Only 241,000 poker machines worldwide are in non-gaming venues, with the vast majority of those – 183,000 – in Australia’s pubs and clubs. The report’s co-author Bill Browne said: “Australia’s large number of poker machines and our unusual decision to allow them in pubs and clubs make us a global anomaly. “Australia has 0.3% of the world’s population but 6% of its conventional gaming machines and 18% of its poker machines. “In terms of machines per person, Australia is right up there with casino-states like Monaco, Macau and Caribbean island nations.” The report comes as Tasmania’s opposition Labor party announced a policy to remove poker machines from pubs and clubs in the state by 2023 if the party wins the next election in March. Labor’s leader, Rebecca White, said the party would phase out more than 2,300 poker machines from venues to curb their “devastating effect on people and their families”. It would make Tasmania only the second state without pokies after Western Australia. The promise was welcomed by community groups and anti-pokies campaigners but criticised by Premier Will Hodgman, who warned it would cost the state jobs. Labor would provide a $55m package to encourage venues and businesses to voluntarily retire the machines before 2023. “Last financial year, Tasmanians lost $110m on poker machines in pubs and clubs, White said. “Economic modelling has shown that it could provide an additional 180 jobs in Tasmania if only half that money is spent in the community.” The anti-pokies campaigner and independent federal MP Andrew Wilkie welcomed the policy. “We know that poker machines cause or at least add to many social ills including crime, domestic violence, suicide and childhood poverty,” he said in a statement. Labor’s policy is a point of difference with the Liberal government, which plans to cut the number of pokies in the state by 150 by 2023. Hodgman told reporters Labor’s policy would hurt businesses. “We’ve heard from operators of hotels across the state, which support local economies, that if poker machines are removed in their entirety it will cost jobs,” he said. Poker machines bring in about 1% of the state’s revenue. Separate modelling by the Australia Institute found the loss of tax revenue from a ban on hotel and club poker machines in Tasmania would be very small and could be accounted for by adopting higher tax rates for poker machines in casinos. One of the paper’s author’s, Leanne Minshull, the director of the Australia Institute Tasmania, said: “Tasmania has more pokies than India, Italy and the Netherlands combined; most countries, 226 out of 238, do not have any poker machines in pubs and clubs. “Tasmanian Labor’s policy of getting poker machines out of Tasmania’s pubs and clubs is not a radical step but a step towards a global norm.” The Country Women’s Association has also backed the campaign to ban poker machines in the state’s pubs and clubs. Lindy Cleeland, the CWA chief for Tasmania, told the Mercury that members were united on the issue of poker machines and the easy availability of gambling had had devastating effects on local communities. “It’s well past time for Tasmanians to have our say and for our representatives to choose to serve the community interest ahead of vested interstate interests,” Cleeland said.

It made for alarming start to the opening day at the Waca, with the newspaper’s front page on Thursday claiming to have “smashed a plot” to fix the Ashes. Inside was an undercover probe into a former Indian state cricketer and a bookmaker who boasted to reporters about their ability to fix elements of matches at both domestic and international level. The ICC, Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board were quick to respond after receiving the information, issuing a series of statements that outlined how seriously the matter has been taken but adding there is no indication the ongoing Test, or any elements of the series, have been rigged, nor players on either side approached to do so. Tom Harrison and James Sutherland, the respective chief executives of the ECB and CA, were part of an ICC conference call at 7am local time in Perth, where they were briefed on The Sun’s findings by Alex Marshall, the decorated former British chief constable who now heads up the world governing body’s anti-corruption unit. Marshall, later speaking publicly about the details passed on to him by The Sun, said: “It is obviously very early stages and our priority on receiving everything late last night was to consider whether the integrity of the third Ashes Test had been compromised. “There is no evidence, either from The Sun or via our own intelligence, to suggest the current Test Match has been corrupted. At this stage of the investigation, there is no indication that any players in this Test have been in contact with the alleged fixers. “We are taking these allegations very seriously and will follow the correct processes of a thorough investigation. We will look for clear and usable evidence that proves or disproves the allegations made. This will include looking for corroboration, speaking to key witnesses and securing all relevant evidential material.” In the report, Sobers Joban, an Indian state cricketer, and Priyank Saxena, a bookmaker, told the journalists they work with a fixer in Australian cricket known as the “Silent Man”, adding that he has contact with past and current international players. Spot-fixing – the act of manipulating small passages of play – could be arranged for sums up to £140,000. The pair cited details of how such scams work in Australia’s Big Bash League and the Indian Premier League and outlined the nature of how players relay information to fixers off the field through a series of messages. These included players’ coloured watches, different length sleeves, stopping before bowling or requesting equipment be brought out to the middle during play. Though covertly filmed by the Sun as part of a four-month investigation in Dubai and Delhi, there was not much to suggest anything beyond the two men making an elaborate sales pitch. The prospect of fixing the ongoing first Test in Perth was due to the two-and-a-half hour time difference being close to that of the Indian capital. “It certainly seems to be a bit of a scattergun story where there’s almost a whole lot mud been thrown out there,” said Sutherland, the CA chief executive, told Channel Nine. “I just can’t see any reason why a player from Australia or England would in any way be vulnerable in this sort of situation. They’re very well paid players, they know and understand the consequences.” Asked about the report on day one of the third Test, the Australian captain, Steve Smith, said: “I saw that this morning, Obviously there is no tolerance and no place for that in our game. As far as I know there is nothing that has been going on or anything like that.” Joe Root, his England counterpart, added: “It’s sad that this has been written about.” Nevertheless, the report highlights how the spectre of match-fixing still surrounds cricket. Just last week the ICC confirmed it was currently conducting seven live investigations into corruption, with three international captains - among them Zimbabwe’s Graeme Cremer and Sarfraz Ahmed of Pakistan - having reported approaches in the past two months. Under new powers brought in this year, the ICC has the ability to request that players, coaches and administrators working in cricket hand over their mobile phones with refusal to do so resulting in two-year bans from the sport for non-cooperation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/14/homelessness-women-seeking-support-outnumber-men-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T02:31:05Z","webTitle":"Women seeking support from homeless services outnumber men for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/14/homelessness-women-seeking-support-outnumber-men-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/14/homelessness-women-seeking-support-outnumber-men-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Women seeking support from homeless services outnumber men for first time","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More women than men are seeking homeless support for the first time, with the rise in those escaping domestic or family violence driving a 21% increase in women at risk of homelessness since 2012. New figures released on Thursday by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) reveal that the archetypal homeless person is no longer a man sleeping rough but a young woman aged 25-34, often with a child, and, increasingly, escaping violence. About 60% of those who asked for support from service providers in 2016-17 were women, the majority of them “at risk” of homelessness when they sought help. Of the people seeking support, 40% of them – the vast majority women – cited experiencing domestic or family violence. The chief executive of Domestic Violence New South Wales, Moo Baulch, called for more emphasis on extra housing services. “Increasing numbers of women and children who have experienced domestic and family violence are seeking assistance from homelessness services,” she said. “But services are not being funded to keep up with this demand. Ensuring a resourced and funded homelessness sector is vital to ensuring the safety of those escaping domestic and family violence.” Victoria and NSW were the two states where the most people needed support – 109,901 and 74,216 respectively. In NSW homelessness service providers are contracted to deliver services to 57,000 clients each year. The chief executive of Homeless NSW, Katherine McKernan, said accommodation services were severely lacking. She said there had been a 43% increase in those seeking services since the NSW government’s Going Home Staying Home reforms. “This is the second year of data since the homelessness reforms undertaken 2015 and it confirms the untenable demand for homelessness services in NSW,” she said. “The figures also highlight the impact of the housing affordability crisis in NSW on the most vulnerable. “Homelessness will continue to rise unless governments urgently invest in the social housing system, take action to make private rentals affordable and appropriately resource homelessness services to meet the current demand.” The AIHW report found that overall in 2016-17 more than 288,000 Australians were assisted by homelessness services agencies, a 3% rise in the past year that equates to about 119 clients per 10,000 people in the population. The report also found that most people at risk of homelessness – 56% – were already in housing, but at risk of losing their accommodation. “Of those clients at risk of becoming homeless, about six in 10 were living in a private dwelling at the time they sought assistance,” AIHW spokesman Matthew James said. “Overall, around nine in 10 clients at risk of homelessness successfully maintained their housing with assistance from a specialist homelessness agency. “This illustrates the role that homelessness agencies play in preventing people from becoming homeless.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/14/wikileaks-recognised-as-a-media-organisation-by-uk-tribunal","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"WikiLeaks recognised as a 'media organisation' by UK tribunal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/14/wikileaks-recognised-as-a-media-organisation-by-uk-tribunal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/14/wikileaks-recognised-as-a-media-organisation-by-uk-tribunal","fields":{"headline":"WikiLeaks recognised as a 'media organisation' by UK tribunal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A British tribunal has recognised Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks as a “media organisation”, a point of contention with the United States, which is seeking to prosecute him and disputes his journalistic credentials. The issue of whether Assange is a journalist and publisher would almost certainly be one of the main battlegrounds in the event of the US seeking his extradition from the UK. The definition of WikiLeaks by the information tribunal, which is roughly equivalent to a court, could help Assange’s defence against extradition on press freedom grounds. The US has been considering prosecution of Assange since 2010 when WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of confidential US defence and diplomatic documents. US attorney general Jeff Sessions said in April this year that the arrest of Assange is a priority for the US. The director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo, after leaks of emails from the US Democratic party and from Hillary Clinton, described WikiLeaks as “a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia”. He added Assange is not covered by the US constitution, which protects journalists. But the UK’s information tribunal, headed by judge Andrew Bartlett QC, in a summary and ruling published on Thursday on a freedom of information case, says explicitly: “WikiLeaks is a media organisation which publishes and comments upon censored or restricted official materials involving war, surveillance or corruption, which are leaked to it in a variety of different circumstances.” The comment is made under a heading that says simply: “Facts”. Assange remains holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has been granted diplomatic asylum. The tribunal’s definition of WikiLeaks comes in the 21-page summary into a freedom of information case heard in London in November. An Italian journalist, Stefania Maurizi, is seeking the release of documents relating to Assange, mainly in regard to extradition, and had lodged an appeal with the tribunal. While the tribunal dismissed her appeal, it acknowledged there issues weighing in favour of public disclosure in relation to Assange. But it added these were outweighed by a need for confidentiality on the matter of extradition. The UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the US justice department have refused to confirm or deny whether they have discussed extradition of Assange. Maurizi, likely to take her appeal to a higher tribunal, welcomed Bartlett’s acceptance of WikiLeaks as a media organisation but argued the tribunal should have gone a step further by pushing the CPS to confirm whether the US has lodged an extradition request. “If such a request were made, the UK would not be assisting the US to extradite a narco, a mafia boss, or a drug kingpin. It would being assisting the US to extradite a media publisher to prosecute him and his media organisation for their publications,” she said. The tribunal also looked at the destruction by the CPS of emails relating to Assange. It said the deletion took place when a CPS lawyer retired and it had been believed all significant case papers were collated separately from his email account. The tribunal said: “We conclude that there was nothing untoward in the deletion of the email account.” Maurizi had put in FOI requests for information relating to communications between the UK and Sweden, where prosecutors were investigating sexual assault allegations against Assange which have since been dropped. Supporters of Assange feared that if he want to Sweden, the US would seek to extradite him from there. Maurizi also pressed for disclosure of any communications by the CPS and the US to extradite Assange directly from the UK. Estelle Dehon, who specialises in freedom of information and who represented Maurizi at the tribunal, said that while disappointed with the overall ruling, she welcomed some of the findings. “Progress has been made because the tribunal accepted that the circumstances of the case raise issues of human rights and press freedom and also agreed that there is a significant public interest in disclosing the information, in particular to increase understanding of how the CPS handled the extradition process and its relationship with a foreign prosecuting authority, “ Dehon said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/14/sexual-abuse-of-children-still-continuing-in-institutions-warns-royal-commission-head","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T23:37:15Z","webTitle":"Sexual abuse of children still continuing in institutions, royal commission head warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/sexual-abuse-of-children-still-continuing-in-institutions-warns-royal-commission-head","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/14/sexual-abuse-of-children-still-continuing-in-institutions-warns-royal-commission-head","fields":{"headline":"Sexual abuse of children still continuing in institutions, royal commission head warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The chair of Australia’s child sexual abuse royal commission, Justice Peter McClellan, has delivered his final address before a room of hundreds of survivors and advocates, telling them: “The sexual abuse of children is not just a problem of the past.” The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, attended to hear McClellan’s final address as commission chair. The Labor MP Jenny Macklin also attended. Survivors held signs and wore badges that read: “Thank you royal commission.” The final sitting of the royal commission in Sydney was held as a mark of respect to the thousands of survivors who told their stories to the six commissioners in private sessions or public hearings. For five years, the commissioners have held hearings throughout Australia, hearing about abuse that occurred in more than 4,000 institutions. “The failure to protect children has not been limited to institutions providing services to children,” McClellan told attendees. “Some of our most important state instrumentalities have failed. Police often refused to believe children. They refused to investigate their complaints of abuse. Many children who had attempted to escape abuse were returned to unsafe institutions by police.” Survivors and their advocates cried as McClellan spoke of children being betrayed by those they were entitled to trust. He thanked survivors for reliving traumatic experiences that “profoundly harmed them” to assist the commission in its work. He said the trauma of sexual abuse was something survivors would “never escape”. “The commissioners thank each of the survivors who told us their personal story. Without them we could not have done our work. Each survivor’s story has been important to us. The survivors are remarkable people with a common concern to do what they can to ensure other children are not abused. They deserve our nation’s thanks.” The royal commission conducted a total of 57 case studies resulting in 44 separate reports, McClellan said, but he added that, because of ongoing investigations and prosecutions, reports concerning Catholic church authorities in Ballarat, Melbourne and some parts of New South Wales will be suppressed in whole or in part until the criminal process has concluded. “Although I know this will disappoint some people it is important that nothing should occur that might compromise any criminal proceedings,” McClellan said. He was met with applause when he spoke of the counsel assisting, Gail Furness, and the work of more than 680 people who worked for the royal commission. The greatest number of abusers worked in Catholic institutions, he said. Power afforded to leaders and the trust placed in them by parents and other staff, and a desire to protect institutional reputations allowed and facilitated the sexual abuse of children. Aggressive lawyers were engaged by institutions to silence them, he said. After the hearing, Francis Sullivan, head of the Catholic church’s Truth Justice and Healing Council, expressed his disappointment in the Catholic church. No senior church figures attended. “I think it would have been a real sign of solidarity with the victims if we’d had some members of the hierarchy and senior figures from the church here,” he told Guardian Australia. “One can only assume they didn’t feel comfortable coming here.” McClellan concluded by saying: “Child sexual abuse continues in institutions today.” “We heard in private sessions from children as young as seven years of age who told us they had been recently abused,” McClellan said, adding: “If the problems we have identified are to be adequately addressed, changes must be made.” He said: “The sexual abuse of any child is intolerable in civilised society. It is the responsibility of our entire community to acknowledge that children are being abused. We must each resolve that we should do what we can to protect them. “The conjunction of events which the royal commission has examined can only be described as a national tragedy.” The commission’s 21-volume final report will be delivered to the governor general in Canberra on Friday. Outside the courtroom survivors from the Care Leavers Australasia Network confronted Turnbull and Shorten. A co-founder of the network, Leonie Sheedy, was told by the Labor leader: “We are not interested in giving you half justice.” She also pressed Turnbull about redress for survivors, angered that those with criminal records would be excluded from the scheme proposed by the government, which goes against the royal commission’s recommendations. “We love you and we believe you,” Turnbull told her. “The redress bill we’ve introduced is being considered and we will look at submissions carefully. “We will read all the recommendations carefully, we’ve already implemented the ones about redress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/15/mps-protect-sex-workers-risks-70000-people-face","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"MPs, we need to talk about – and to help protect – Britain’s sex workers | Frankie Mullin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/mps-protect-sex-workers-risks-70000-people-face","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/mps-protect-sex-workers-risks-70000-people-face","fields":{"headline":"MPs, we urgently need to talk about – and to help protect – Britain’s sex workers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On 29 May this year, Romina Kalaci was found dead in her flat in Kilburn, London. She had been stabbed multiple times by Noor Mohammad, who is now serving time in prison. Kalaci was a sex worker, one of the estimated 70,000 people (mainly women) who sell sex in the UK. She was working alone. Under current UK law, that was her only legal option. Sunday 17 December is International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers (IDEVASW) and, worldwide, sex workers will gather to mourn and to call for change. In London, the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP) and the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (SWARM) will hold a vigil outside parliament on 18 December. We will build a memorial for the sex workers who’ve lost their lives, and have invited MPs to come out and speak to us. We are calling for full decriminalisation of working with another person for safety, and acknowledgment that the UK’s piecemeal legislation, which criminalises such working, contributes to violence. No single piece of legislation will make the world perfect. Male violence is endemic, our society still deeply racist. Closed borders create the conditions in which migrants make risky choices, when they have choices at all. Austerity, the closure of women’s refuges, lack of affordable childcare; all of these lie at the heart of stories that invite us to shudder at the idea of stories like “Prostitutes selling themselves for a meal deal”. Decriminalisation of sex work will not undo centuries of stigma any more than the criminalisation of marital rape in 1991 instantly redressed gender inequality or ended sexual violence. The world doesn’t work like this. What legislation can do is offer recourse, the backing of the criminal justice system; it makes a crime visible by drawing a line between what is and is not morally acceptable. Adequate working conditions in the sex industry become discrete from forced sexual labour and exploitation. This year, a woman in north London jumped out of the window of a brothel to avoid a robbery. She broke her leg but did not go to the police. Her assailants have not been caught. Another woman told the Guardian: “They come – five or six guys with knives, and they know where the money is. The girls, they don’t call the police, because if they call the police they will just appear there and say to [the girls] to leave.” National Ugly Mugs, which allows sex workers to anonymously report violence, has received 745 reports this year, including 282 for violence, 103 for robbery, 97 for rape. But sex work isn’t dangerous by virtue of the labour itself. Giving someone oral sex won’t kill you. What exposes sex workers to danger is inadequate prostitution law and the relentless stigma that casts sex workers as a tainted subsection of society, already singled out for violence if they’re women, more so still if they’re trans or if they’re migrants. It is that stigma that makes their murders seem inevitable. It’s impossible to create a comprehensive list of sex workers’ deaths. In 2016, more than 150 names made the awful IDEVASW roll, but many go unrecorded. In a climate of fear, few sex workers are open about what they do. But these figures should exist, they should be recorded. Why is this industry at once the subject of such unforgiving scrutiny and yet still so shrouded in the unknown? Why, of the 70,000 sex workers in the UK, can I count on one hand those willing to stand up in public and talk about their work? The level of shame is so telling. We urgently need an honest conversation about – and with – the tens of thousands of people who sell sex in the UK. Yet chances keep slipping by. The UK’s current inquiry into sex work, led by the all-party parliamentary group on prostitution, has missed the target, focusing instead on the largely media-driven moral panic that is “pop-up brothels” and lending its weight to the Nordic model, which most sex worker-led groups around the world oppose. Monday 18 December is the closing date for this inquiry, and for that reason we will be standing outside parliament, both mourning the dead and demanding that MPs listen to those who, today and tomorrow, continue to sell sex. Many of my sex-working friends have experienced violence and harassment at work, few have gone to the police. This International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers we ask politicians to speak with us outside parliament and take seriously their role in ending the violence. • Frankie Mullin is a freelance journalist, and is part of the English Collective of Prostitutes and the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement • The vigil takes place on Monday 18 December, between noon and 2pm, at New Palace Yard, London SW1.

Sales at the Sports Direct, USC and Heatons chains fell 1% to £1.14bn in the six months to 29 October, as the company said it had cut online promotions and closed stores as part of its attempts to improve the look and feel of its stores. Overall revenues for the group, which owns stores in the US and Europe as well as the Flannels fashion chain, rose 4.7%, partly thanks to acquisitions and overseas growth. But profits dived 67.3% to £45.8m in the half year as margins came under pressure from the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar, in which Sports Direct buys much of its stock. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Whitman Howard, said in a note that changes to Sports Direct’s structure made it difficult to assess performance but he believed sales at the core chain’s established stores and website were both down. Mike Ashley, chief executive and the majority shareholder of Sports Direct, said underlying profit before tax remained healthy and the company was investing for the long-term. “Our high street elevation strategy is currently delivering spectacular trading performance within our flagship stores. We intend to open between 10 and 20 new flagship stores next year,” he said. Shares in Sports Direct closed down just over 2% as analysts were surprised by a big rise in net debt to £471m, from £182m a year before, and raised concerns about lack of transparency, corporate governance and investments in potentially distracting “strategic stakes” in companies such as Debenhams. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Sports Direct’s corporate governance practices continue to attract headlines for all the wrong reasons, with independent shareholders rejecting an £11m payment to Mike Ashley’s brother on Wednesday. “Unfortunately the lack of transparency also stretches to the ‘Selfridges of Sport’ initiative. Mike Ashley has described trading at the new format stores as ‘spectacular’, but it’s difficult to see evidence of that in the numbers. Improved profits are being driven by cost cuts rather than sales growth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/spanish-middle-eastern-breakfast-recipes-morito-exmouth-market-london","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Morito’s recipes for three breakfasts with a Spanish-Middle Eastern spin | Breakfast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/spanish-middle-eastern-breakfast-recipes-morito-exmouth-market-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/spanish-middle-eastern-breakfast-recipes-morito-exmouth-market-london","fields":{"headline":"Three hearty breakfast-brunches with a Spanish-Middle Eastern spin","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Salt cod cake, fried eggs and avocado mojo Your salt cod fillet should be rinsed well, then soaked in cold water in the fridge overnight or longer with one change of water.

Put a large nonstick frying pan over a medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. When the butter begins to foam, fry the cakes (in batches if necessary) until both sides are golden brown and crisp. Transfer them to kitchen paper to remove excess oil. 6 Heat up to 200ml olive oil in a small frying pan – the Spanish prefer to fry eggs in a huge amount of olive oil. You can by all means reduce this by half. When it’s hot, carefully crack the eggs into the oil, one by one. Sprinkle with some salt, then and spoon the hot, bubbling oil over the yolk. When the edges are frilly and crisped slightly and the yolk is cooked to your liking, remove the egg with a slotted spoon and put on top of the salt cod cake on a plate. Serve immediately with avocado mojo on the side. Cardamom granola, yoghurt and fruit salad We love the flavour that cardamom adds to this homemade granola, which gets its sweetness naturally from the banana and date molasses; I try to avoid refined sugar if I can. A seasonal fruit salad and a creamy yoghurt are ideal companions. We’ve used peaches, blackberries and figs here, but you can use citrus fruits or other seasonal fruit as preferred. Serves 4 200g large rolled organic oats 200g blanched almonds 200g sunflower seeds 200g pumpkin seeds 2 very ripe (black) bananas, mashed with a fork 4 tbsp date molasses 2 tbsp coconut oil 2 tsp roughly ground green cardamom seeds 100g coconut flakes, toasted 400g Greek yoghurt 150g blackberries 2 peaches, sliced lengthways 2 figs, quartered lengthways 1 Set the oven to 150C/300F/gas 2. Blitz the oats, almonds, sunflower and pumpkin seeds in a food processor for just a few seconds. Transfer to a baking dish. Add the mashed bananas, date molasses, coconut oil and cardamom. Mix well, then roast gently for 20‑30 minutes, or until lightly toasted. 2 Remove from the oven, cool, then gently toss in the flaked coconut. 3 Divide the Greek yoghurt among four bowls. Serve with granola, blackberries, peaches and figs. For colour and crunch, I sometimes like to top with shredded mint, chopped pistachios and pomegranate seeds.

If not: add the olive oil to the pan, fry the onion, peppers, thyme, and rosemary with a pinch of salt. Cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the onion and peppers begin to soften. 3 Stir in the potatoes and garlic. Cook for another 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft and tender, but not coloured, stirring occasionally. 4 Return the chorizo, if using, to the pan. Crack in the eggs. Remove from the heat and gently mix until the eggs are cooked, returning the pan to the heat if necessary. Adjust the seasoning, sprinkle with parsley and paprika, then serve immediately with toast or bread. Morito is the sister restaurant of Moro on Exmouth Market, London.

The exams watchdog’s investigation showed that some boards had awarded extra marks despite not finding errors in the original marking and that re-marking rules imposed by England’s exam regulator had been ignored. Ofqual’s official report revealed a big rise in the number of grades that were raised on appeal – in part because of exam boards using outdated procedures. GCSE English language and literature exams and those administered by the AQA board were worst affected by failures, in which “some reviewers changed marks where there was no error with original marking”, according to Ofqual’s report. Suzanne O’Farrell, an assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools had made appeals in good faith, based on Ofqual’s rules that examiners should review marking procedures rather than detailed re-marking. “We are very concerned about the massive muddle that has emerged,” O’Farrell said. “Grades have been changed, most notably in English language and literature. Now we are told that in some cases this should not have happened, and that this is at least partially responsible for an increase in the proportion of regraded GCSEs. “Ofqual has said that these results will stand. However, the confusion that this situation has created is deeply unsatisfactory for students and schools.” Overall, the number of GCSE grades raised after appeal jumped by 50% compared with 2016, as nearly 74,000 entries received higher grades despite Ofqual’s reforms designed to halt an upward creep in re-marking. “It appears that some of the exam boards have not done enough to change old practices and meet our new rules around reviews of marking,” said Sally Collier, Ofqual’s head regulator. “We expect all exam boards to comply with our rules at all times. We are currently looking at where more could and should be done and will consider what form of regulatory action may be appropriate.” Previously, exam results that were challenged were re-marked in detail, with higher marks often the result of minor differences in opinion between markers. Under Ofqual’s new rules, marks would only be changed if a procedural error were discovered, such as an answer being overlooked. There was an initial fall in the number of appeals after the new rules were introduced. Independent schools, which have long complained of inconsistent marking, said the revelations were “deeply frustrating” and unfair. Ofqual found that the percentage of grades changed after appeal was higher in 25 out of 37 GCSE subjects this year than in 2016. “It seems efforts to embed the revised rules for reviews have varied by exam board and subject and that some reviewers changed marks where there was no error with original marking,” Ofqual stated. The number of appeals that resulted in rises by two or more grades also soared, from 401 in 2016 to nearly 2,000 in 2017, leading Ofqual to say it was “concerned about the sharp increase in the number of changes on this scale”. The AQA exam board appears to have been the least successful at adopting the new rules, while Ofqual praised Pearson for best adopting them. Ofqual also published an interim review on allowing teachers to act as examiners, after the Guardian revealed exam malpractice at Eton involving the Pre-U examinations this summer. The interim review said that teachers should still be allowed to set exams while working in classrooms, despite the potential conflict of interest. But it is likely to recommend a range of safeguards to avoid the problems that emerged at Eton. The Ofqual report also said safeguards should be strengthened in its review of rules allowing teachers to set question papers. Ofqual’s report, published in the wake of exam leak allegations, said exam cheating was rare but could be “deeply damaging” to public confidence when it happened. The watchdog conducted a review of rules and safeguards in place to stop confidential information being disclosed after two high-profile private schools became embroiled in a controversy over exam breaches in August. Its report said the number of incidents in which the integrity of exams was brought into question by the behaviour of teacher/examiners was “very small”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/15/rightwing-evangelicals-politics-roy-moore","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"The days of rightwing evangelicals swaying politics are numbered | Daniel Jose Camacho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/rightwing-evangelicals-politics-roy-moore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/rightwing-evangelicals-politics-roy-moore","fields":{"headline":"The days of rightwing evangelicals swaying politics are numbered","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A large majority of white evangelicals voted for Roy Moore – 80%, according to exit polls – in Alabama, in the deep south, in a solidly red state. And they lost. The results of Alabama’s Senate race are an omen for the future of white evangelical politics. White evangelicals, as a whole, are still flexing some political muscle. But their future outlook is of an embattled political bloc with extremist views and diminishing power to decide elections. Moore was a fundamentalist Christian hero. He was removed from office twice while serving as Alabama’s chief justice: first for refusing to remove a 5,280lb Ten Commandments monument he installed in the state court house; then for defying the US supreme court by directing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to gay people. Although Moore faced serious allegations of sexual assault and misconduct, involving women as young as 14, white evangelical voters were largely undeterred in their support for him. Nevertheless, they were unable to propel him to victory. The key factor: although most white evangelicals voted for Moore, they only made up 44% of total voters. At first glance, some may chalk this up to evangelicals staying home. White evangelicals’ total share of the vote dipped in comparison with the 47% share they had in the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections. Yet the factors are more complicated. According to the Pew Research Center, white evangelicals comprise – at most – 49% of Alabama’s population. Considering national religious trends in the past few years, this number is probably a little lower. Moreover, white evangelical voters are typically overrepresented, especially in midterm elections, when minority and younger voters usually have lower turnout. This was no longer the case in Alabama’s Senate race on Tuesday night. African Americans constituted 29% of all voters, aligning more closely with their share of Alabama’s total population. In this light, Tuesday’s special election for Alabama’s open Senate seat was far more representative of the state’s population than is usually the case. Within an environment of strong voter suppression, the fight for voting rights shows what is possible when conditions are more democratic. Roy Moore’s loss is not attributable to a depressed white evangelical vote. Sure, some may have stayed at home or opted to write in another candidate. But many still stuck by the politician they saw as defending their priorities on abortion, gun rights, and same-sex marriage. The reality is that the white evangelical vote is losing its power. As the Public Religion Research Institute has demonstrated, white Christians have been consistently declining as a proportion of the country’s electorate. The percentage of white Christians living in this country fell to 43% in 2016. By 2024, white Christians are projected to no longer constitute a majority of voters in the United States. While white evangelicals have typically made up for their decline through overrepresentation in midterm elections, Alabama’s race shows that even this pattern might not hold. Once deemed the Moral Majority, white evangelicals are increasingly looking like they will be an immoral minority in the landscape of American politics. Backing alleged sexual predators and discriminatory policies, they are losing elections having already forfeited their souls. They are cracking as a firewall for Donald Trump and the extreme sectors of an extremist political party. As the religious right’s obituary is being written, another chapter is yet to form. This one includes Christians of color and attempts to reconstruct a viable religious left. Nevertheless, such a coalition is still fraught with its own problems. The degree to which a substantial religious left can exert political influence is still up in the air. But one thing is clear: the religious political playbook in the United States is changing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2017/dec/14/toni-mascolo-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T18:05:06Z","webTitle":"Toni Mascolo obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/14/toni-mascolo-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/dec/14/toni-mascolo-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Toni Mascolo obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Toni Mascolo was not in hairdressing for fashion, fame or art. He expressed his creativity not in extreme cut or colouring but in a novel business structure through his family firm, Toni &amp; Guy. From his teens, Mascolo, who has died aged 75, was his own accountant, business adviser and advertising director, with an immigrant’s willingness to work full-speed from 8am to 10pm six days a week and concoct hair lacquer in bulk from raw ingredients in the back room should there be an hour’s slack in trade. Mascolo understood from early on that the trade was descended from the guild system, where apprentices learned on the job, served time with a local master, then often split to found a new business. Its services were not reliable in standards or geographic spread. He introduced franchising, where every salon provided a brand-guaranteed level of service, but allowed the franchisee independence within a family. There are now almost 500 Toni &amp; Guy salons in nearly 50 countries. By the time he was 20, a serious young man, balding and with a moustache to make him look even more mature, he had already worked in most levels of salon. He was born Giuseppe, grandson of a barber-surgeon and eldest of the five sons of Francesco Mascolo, who had a barbers-cum-salon in Scafati, a town in Campania, southern Italy; the boys did salon tasks for their father. Mascolo senior, who had talent but no outlet for it, decided to migrate after a visit from a cousin who had done well for himself hairdressing in London. Francesco’s wife Maria, (nee Gallo), determined it should be a family move. They arrived when Giuseppe was almost 15, then school-leaving age; he spoke no English and spent his last classroom months in the school of the Italian church in Clerkenwell, the expatriate community’s social heart. The Mascolos clustered nearby, then found half a house to rent in Clapham, funded by Mascolo Sr’s job in a smart Mayfair barbers, where his son joined him as assistant (wages 15 shillings and 11 pence a week; Charles Forte tipped the lad a quid). The firm was sold on and the boy was workless for three days, then so convinced the owner of a tatty salon near his home of his competence that he was made manager. He moved to a chic, Italian-run salon near the Houses of Parliament, with a clientele of political wives plus Barbara Castle’s red bouffant. There he learned about volume business – it was the era of volume hairstyles, too, achieved through shampoo-and-sets – with electricity for the driers costed into overheads and setting-lotions mixed on the premises to keep margins low. He also became Toni, a little less publicly Italian. His workrate was so prodigious, often 50 clients a day, that he might soon have achieved his goal of buying the family a decent house. But when he was 20, his mother died and his father fell apart. The family closed in around home, with provider and worrier Toni, and brother Gaetano, professionally renamed Guy, finding jobs in a grotty one-room establishment in Clapham Park Road. They took over the business in 1963 at a high weekly rent of £20 and lost all but one of their Saturday girls (who didn’t want to work for Italians); some weeks the family lived on a fiver in tips, all they had after the business bills were paid. The brothers kept the place open, promising “Mayfair hair designs” (which they could deliver) on their shop sign and “Florentine elegance and Roman flair” (they had been to neither Florence nor Rome) in the leaflets they jammed through local letterboxes. It worked. The salon kept up with fashion and technology, but in an atmosphere without West End hauteur or celebrity-hairdresser flamboyance; in the Italian manner, it welcomed older women, and young men wanting highly stylised looks. “Toni &amp; Guy” became three south London salons with siblings Bruno, Andrea and Anthony joining as they grew up. The next hurdle was snobbery: for historical reasons, prestige hairdressers were all in Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea, and they monopolised magazine and advertising work; salons elsewhere in London (especially south of the Thames), no matter how gifted their stylists, were ignored. Toni Mascolo decided to open in Davies Street, Mayfair, in 1973, and persuaded the family it had to part with the south London salons to restart at a different level. That worked, too. “Toni &amp; Guy” became a familiar magazine credit, and a second salon opened in Sloane Square (until his death, Mascolo did a stylist shift there or in Mayfair most weeks; he didn’t tell clients who he was). The backroom recipes were formalised into products for their TIGI line in 1979, and a first staff training academy opened in 1984. Mascolo believed in slow craft learning, especially by experience; there was no substitute for his Scafati years among the perm rollers. Touring the US in the 1970s, he saw that the then new food-chain franchising system would work in hairdressing; it would tap a market wanting higher local standards while retaining the family feel he had prized since Clapham. The brothers sundered as the firm expanded, with Bruno, then Guy, moving to the US to run operations there; in 2002, they and Anthony took control of TIGI products and salon business in the Americas, leaving Toni with the rest of the world and his new franchise, essensuals. The teen girl assistant who didn’t walk out of Clapham in 1963 was Pauline O’Donnell. She befriended all the Mascolos; they missed their mother’s food, so she learned to cook Italian, and married Toni in 1970. Their daughter, Sasha, and son, Christian, run their father’s businesses, while their other son, Pierre, produces movies. His wife survives him, but Guy died in 2009. Mascolo was a Chelsea supporter, a devout Catholic with a chapel in his mansion’s grounds, and an unstoppable charity fundraiser (he knew how much luck he had had in life.) He was awarded an Italian knighthood and an honorary OBE. • Toni (Giuseppe) Mascolo, hairdresser, born 6 May 1942; died 10 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/15/minimum-alcohol-price-raise-cost-90-scotland-study-ifs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T00:01:02Z","webTitle":"Minimum alcohol price will raise cost by up to 90% in Scotland – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/15/minimum-alcohol-price-raise-cost-90-scotland-study-ifs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/15/minimum-alcohol-price-raise-cost-90-scotland-study-ifs","fields":{"headline":"Minimum alcohol price will raise cost by up to 90% in Scotland – study","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Scottish government’s 50p minimum unit price for alcohol, which comes into force on 1 May 2018, will have a dramatic impact on prices, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Some cider products will rise in price by as much as 90%, according to the IFS briefing note, which also found prices would increase across all alcohol types. The price of a 20 x 440ml pack of Strongbow would double, while a bottle of Tesco cream sherry would increase by 20%. The minimum pricing policy, which comes into force after a five-year legal battle between the Scottish government and the Scotch Whisky Association, is intended to stop the sale of cut-price, high-alcohol drinks such as cider. The IFS found that almost 70% of the alcohol units bought in supermarkets and off-licences across the UK between October 2015 and September 2016 were priced below 50p per unit. With a 50p minimum unit price, the cost of these products would increase on average by at least 35%, with lager and cider most affected. The per unit price of cider products currently priced below 50p would rise by 90%, while for lager the equivalent would be 44%. The majority of wines and spirits are also currently priced at less than 50p per unit, but alcopops would be unaffected because almost none are sold below that unit price. Last month, the Scottish government’s health secretary, Shona Robison, told Holyrood it had been estimated that a minimum price of 50p would cut the number of alcohol-related deaths in Scotland by 392 in the first five years and reduce hospital admissions by 8,254 cases. The IFS also found that minimum unit price was reasonably well targeted at problem drinking, because heavy drinkers tended to purchase the kinds of cheaper, stronger alcohol affected by the new pricing policy. Martin O’Connell, an associate director at the IFS and co-author of the briefing note, said: “Heavy drinkers are more inclined to buy cheap units, so this suggests a minimum unit price may well be reasonably well targeted at this group. However, the impact of the policy will depend crucially on the price sensitivity of different types of drinkers, and how much less alcohol they consume in response to a rise in price.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing is not the only policy that a government has at its disposal. We also show that heavier drinkers tend to buy stronger alcohol, suggesting that redesign of the current system of alcohol excise duties could also help target problem drinkers. Tax reform is likely to avoid the main drawback of minimum unit pricing, which is that it boosts the profits of the alcohol industry by creating a price floor.” The introduction in Scotland of minimum pricing, which was declared legal under EU law by the UK supreme court in November, comes as the Welsh government consults on the policy, fuelling fears among the whisky industry that minimum pricing in the UK will increase the likelihood of higher tariffs imposed on whisky exports, hitting sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/15/invest-solar-energy-energise-frica","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T19:11:58Z","webTitle":"How investing in solar energy can create a brighter future for Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/invest-solar-energy-energise-frica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/15/invest-solar-energy-energise-frica","fields":{"headline":"How investing in solar energy can create a brighter future for Africa","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How would you like to earn a return of up to 6% on your cash while at the same time providing families in countries such as Kenya with “life-changing” access to clean, affordable solar energy? Energise Africa is a new ethical investment scheme which aims to raise £20m to provide a brighter future for more than 110,000 families and small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa over the next three years. Investors will find some reassurance that it is supported by UK aid money from the Department for International Development (DfID). And what is also notable is that, unusually, some of the investments on offer benefit from what is known as “first loss cover” – which means that if the worst were to happen, and the company was unable to pay back what it owed, individual investors would be prioritised ahead of DfID, thereby providing an extra level of protection. With a minimum investment of £50, it is a potentially straightforward and accessible way for people to make sure their money is doing some good. However, this is not risk-free, and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there was some kind of disaster/crisis/bankruptcy, you could lose some or all your capital, and you would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, so you need to go into this with your eyes open. Currently 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without access to electricity. For example, in Uganda, the figure is just 7% of rural families. Many use traditional energy sources such as kerosene lamps, candles and batteries for their energy needs – but these can be extremely hazardous, as well as costly. Lamps and candles have been responsible for many house fires, while soot and fumes can cause health problems. Having a solar system can transform people’s lives in so many ways – allowing children to read and study in the evening, enabling families to charge their mobile phones, or enabling a stallholder to install a fridge so they can sell cold drinks. Energise Africa is an initiative that provides working capital to businesses that sell solar home systems, the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. It was “soft launched” in the summer and is also being backed by Virgin Unite, the non-profit foundation of the Virgin Group. So what’s the deal? This involves investing in unsecured bonds that are not listed on a public market in return for an expected 4% to 6% annual return. Basically, you are lending money to businesses that sell small solar systems to families throughout sub-Saharan Africa. UK investors can deposit small or large sums in one or more projects, and the term of the investment is typically either two or three years. Once the project is fully funded, the money is transferred to the solar business. Every six months investors will receive both interest and a capital repayment from their chosen business. The loans provided to the businesses are then used to buy solar home systems, which are then sold to African families via a financing plan. Typically, a family makes monthly payments over 12 to 24 months, and then owns the system outright. At the time of writing there were two projects open for investment, both of them featured on the Lendahand.co.uk website and benefiting from match funding. One, from Dutch firm SolarWorks!, is looking to raise £90,000, and is a three-year bond where the expected interest rate is 6% a year. This project aims to provide clean energy to 1,000 families in Mozambique, and there is the added advantage of £45,000 of first-loss cover from DfID. “In the unlikely event that SolarWorks! Trading BV was unable to make all of its bond repayments, the crowd would be prioritised ahead of repayment to UK aid,” says the Lendahand site. The other project is a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 5% a year but no first loss cover. The company behind this is a UK one, Azuri, which has its HQ in Cambridge, and has set an investment target of £200,000. It says every £100 invested will allow Azuri to make a solar home system available to a rural family in Tanzania that would otherwise be out of their financial reach. This project benefits from match funding to the tune of an upfront £100,000 of DfID aid money. In June, Lisa Ashford, a director at Lendahand Ethex, travelled to Mpigi in Uganda, where she met families and visited schools, orphanages and businesses, all whom were now using solar. She says one of the most striking things was the demand for education. “The desire to study hard and succeed was very apparent across the classes we visited at Lumuza school. The children were still doing prep in the evening under the solar lights across the classrooms. Without the solar I’m not sure how they would have all have managed to work so hard.” The team also met Patience, who runs a small local store that provides her with income to look after her young family. Since getting solar, she has installed fridges, so she can sell cold drinks and refrigerated food without high bills or power cuts. Those who sign up will be able to benefit from tax-free returns by holding their investment within an “innovative finance” Isa – the new account for debt-based crowd funding and peer-to-peer loans. But it’s vital to read up on the risks, which could include everything from potential political instability in the country concerned to a natural disaster such as a flood or famine. • Fancy earning a potential 15% a year from turning whisky into motor fuel? It sounds fanciful to say the least, but this is a genuine investment offer, with multimillion-pound backing from the Scottish government. But that sky-high rate gives you an indication that this is a whole lot riskier than putting your money into a savings account, with no compensation if things go wrong, so this definitely isn’t the place to stash your entire life savings. A Scottish startup, Celtic Renewables Ltd, has secured planning permission to build a plant at Grangemouth that will produce biobutanol, a sustainable biofuel made using whisky residue that, according to the firm, is a direct replacement for petrol and diesel. The plant will cost just over £20m to build, almost half of which is coming from the Scottish government in the form of a £9m grant. The firm is looking to raise up to £4.375m via a two-year investment available via the ethical investment platform Abundance. It is offering 15% interest a year, with the capital and interest paid at maturity in December 2019. Those who invest would be buying debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, the offer document outlines five pages of risks - for example, debentures are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. “Part or all of your original invested capital may be at risk,” and returns are not guaranteed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/17/plantwatch-wildflowers-lose-out-twice-from-nitrogen-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T21:30:41Z","webTitle":"Plantwatch: Wildflowers lose out twice from nitrogen pollution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/17/plantwatch-wildflowers-lose-out-twice-from-nitrogen-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/17/plantwatch-wildflowers-lose-out-twice-from-nitrogen-pollution","fields":{"headline":"Plantwatch: Wildflowers lose out twice from nitrogen pollution","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nitrogen pollution in the air is devastating for many sensitive wild plants, which is why so much of the countryside is becoming a vast carpet of nettles, hogweed, hemlock and other rampant vegetation that feasts on nitrogen. In many places, these are running out of control. Much has been written about the damage to human health from nitrogen oxides given off by traffic, but the damage to sensitive plants has gone largely unnoticed. Excessive nitrogen also comes from ammonia from fertilisers and manures, with much of the countryside awash with nitrates running off farmland. More than a third of Britain’s wild flowering plants need low levels of nutrients in the soil, and they are suffering from too much nitrogen raining down from the atmosphere. That onslaught is having a devastating effect on 90% of sensitive plant habitats in England and Wales, such as woodlands, grasslands, heaths and bogs, according to the charity Plantlife. And in some wild areas, nitrogen-guzzling plants such as nettles have run riot and swamped the natural wild plants. Nitrogen pollution can come directly from the air or be washed down in rain. It is absorbed into the soil, creates acidic conditions and damages sensitive plants. More than two thirds of our wild flowers such as harebell and betony need low or medium levels of nitrogen. And it is only robust species, such as nettle, that can thrive in this flood of nitrogen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/15/ban-sale-of-energy-drinks-to-under-16s-say-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T06:12:09Z","webTitle":"Ban sale of energy drinks to under-16s, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/15/ban-sale-of-energy-drinks-to-under-16s-say-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/15/ban-sale-of-energy-drinks-to-under-16s-say-experts","fields":{"headline":"Ban sale of energy drinks to under-16s, say experts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Energy drinks should be banned from sale to young people under the age of 16, health experts have warned in light of a study showing they have unacceptably high levels of sugar and caffeine. The study in the journal BMJ Open analyses the sugar, caffeine and carbohydrate content of energy drinks, which include brands such as Monster and Rockstar as well as supermarket own-brands. In both 2015 and 2017, the average sugar content of the energy drinks was more than the entire recommended daily maximum for an adult in the UK. The campaigning group Action on Sugar, whose researchers carried out the study, is calling for a ban on sales to under-16s. “This study illustrates the huge contribution of energy drinks to sugar intake, which is linked to the development of obesity and various types of cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and rotting our children’s teeth. They are completely inappropriate for children to consume, form no part of a healthy balanced diet, and should be banned for under-16s,” said its chairman, Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London. TV chef and food campaigner Jamie Oliver has also called for a ban on sales of energy drinks to children, as have teacher groups. Energy drinks are marketed for general consumption, rather than for athletes, who are targeted with so-called “sports” drinks. Children and teenagers drink them more than older adults, even though energy drinks with high caffeine levels over 150mg per litre have to carry a warning that they are not recommended for children or pregnant women. The study found that the 43 products carrying such warnings contained the caffeine equivalent of nearly two cups of coffee. “Since children and teenagers are the main consumers of energy drinks, manufacturers should consider reducing levels of caffeine,” says the study. That would also help reduce the sugar levels. “The removal of caffeine also allows for the removal of 10.3% of sugar without affecting taste, which has the potential to reduce body weight of adults by 0.6 kg, without any change in sugar-sweetened drinks consumption,” says the paper. Soft drinks are responsible for 30% of the sugar intake of children aged 4 to 10 and 40% of those aged 11 to 18. Energy drinks were typically sold in 500ml cans and bottles, which is larger than a standard soft drink. In 2015, 86% of products in 2015 exceeded the maximum daily recommendation for sugar intake for a child aged 7–10 years (24 g/day – equivalent to six teaspoons of sugar) and 78% in 2017. The threat of the sugary soft drinks tax, which the government plans to introduce in April, has led to some reformulation of some of energy drinks to reduce their sugar levels – but only by 10% on drinks that are still very high in sugar. Almost all – 95% – would receive a red label for sugar content under nutritional traffic light warnings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/15/health-concerns-one-in-six-parents-allow-kids-alcohol-by-age-14","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T00:01:02Z","webTitle":"One in six parents allow children alcohol by age of 14, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/15/health-concerns-one-in-six-parents-allow-kids-alcohol-by-age-14","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/15/health-concerns-one-in-six-parents-allow-kids-alcohol-by-age-14","fields":{"headline":"One in six parents allow children alcohol by age of 14, says study","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One in six parents allow their children to drink alcohol by the age of 14, with potentially dire future consequences, according to a new study. The researchers, from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the UCL Institute of Education, and Pennsylvania State University, suggest that many parents are offering their children alcohol at an early age to teach them to drink responsibly. With Christmas approaching, and wine more likely to be shared at the dinner table, they say parents should heed the message from previous studies that children who start drinking early are more likely to fail at school, have behavioural difficulties and suffer alcohol problems in adulthood. The analysis of 10,000 children born in the UK at the turn of the century, which is part of the Millennium Cohort Study, found that well educated parents of white children were most likely to allow their children to drink at 14. The study’s lead author, Jennifer Maggs, said: “Parents of socially advantaged children may believe that allowing children to drink will teach them responsible use or may in fact inoculate them against dangerous drinking. However, there is little research to support these ideas.” The researchers examined reports of parents’ drinking habits and attitudes to drinking, linking them to information on family structure, employment status and parents’ educational attainment. The authors conclude: “While social disadvantage predicts many long-term health problems, parents of socially advantaged children appear to view alcohol use as less risky.” The results, published on Friday, also showed that fathers and mothers who were light or moderate drinkers were just as likely to let their children drink as those who drank heavily. However, parents who abstained from alcohol tended not to allow their children to drink. By age 14, almost half the children said they had tried more than a few sips of alcohol but three years earlier only about one in seven had done so. Katherine Brown, chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, highlighted the chief medical officer’s advice that children should not drink before the age of 15. “This is important guidance because alcohol can harm children, given their bodies and brains are not yet fully developed,” she said. “It is worrying to see that this advice may not be getting across to parents, who are trying to do their best to teach their children about alcohol. We need to see better guidance offered to parents via social marketing campaigns and advice from doctors and schools. Parents deserve to know they can have a positive impact, and can reduce health harms associated with young people drinking.” The proportion of children choosing to drink alcohol is at the lowest level in recent times, with only about one in six aged eight to 15 admitting to ever drinking alcohol. Dr John Larsen, director of evidence and impact at Drinkaware, said children should not drink but parents should give advice to teenagers about alcohol and its effects. He encouraged them to keep the conversations “open and honest”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/16/stained-sofa-rodgers-of-york-furniture-ombudsman-small-claims-court","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T07:00:55Z","webTitle":"‘Going to the Furniture Ombudsman about our sofa was a waste of time’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/16/stained-sofa-rodgers-of-york-furniture-ombudsman-small-claims-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/16/stained-sofa-rodgers-of-york-furniture-ombudsman-small-claims-court","fields":{"headline":"‘Going to the Furniture Ombudsman about our sofa was a waste of time’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How much should you trust an ombudsman to resolve a complaint? The Furniture Ombudsman, used by major retailers such as DFS, Marks &amp; Spencer, Dreams and Bensons For Beds, has been described as a “waste of your time” and “a joke” after it found in favour of a retailer, but a court subsequently ordered a full payout in favour of the consumer. In March, Frank and Joan Johnson took delivery of a £2,500 two-piece suite from Rodgers of York, paying an extra £140 for five year Staingard protection. But they say that after just two weeks of use the sofa looked stained and “awful”. Rodgers sent a manager to examine the sofa, who said that was supposed to happen to the chenille fabric and that it was an “authentic” look. He claimed it was their jeans that were causing the problem and refused their request for a full refund. The firm paid for the cushions to be professionally cleaned, which temporally restored their colour, but left the couple having to shell out for a professional clean every few weeks if they wanted the sofa to maintain its colour. The Johnsons pointed out that none of other chairs used by the family had the same problem and that the towels and sheets they had been forced to use on top of the sofa had not been discoloured by their clothes. The Rodgers manager said if they were unhappy with the decision, they could contact the Furniture Ombudsman for independent arbitration. But the Johnsons say their experience with the ombudsman, which is a limited company, not a government body, has left them with a lack of confidence in its ability to deal with what they say was a reasonable claim. The ombudsman says it made its decision in good faith on the evidence provided. The Johnsons say it declined their claim for a refund without even examining the sofa in their home. The ombudsman looked at the report sent to it by Rodgers, examined the photographs and other evidence provided by the Johnsons, and decided in favour of the furniture company. The Johnsons’ son-in-law, Andy Steele, took up their case. “As they had effectively been told that their everyday clothing would cause discolouration of the suite and that a two- to three-weekly professional cleaning regime was required to keep the suite in a presentable condition, they assumed the Furniture Ombudsman would find in their favour,” Steele says. “But they were astonished when, two weeks later, they received a letter saying that having looked at the report filed by Rodgers and our photos, the ombudsman had decided it was due to general wear and tear. It was a joke.” Undaunted, the family sought legal advice and in August filed a claim against Rodgers in the small claims court. The Johnsons say the court saw similar evidence as the ombudsman had and awarded them a full refund. The retailer did not contest the claim and a default judgment was entered in favour of the the Johnsons. The case will raise fresh concerns about the Furniture Ombudsman scheme, which sells itself on the basis that it offers an impartial service. Guardian Money has seen lots of complaints from consumers who felt the process was unfairly stacked in the retailers’ favour. In 2011, the ombudsman, which was then run as part of the Furniture Industry Research Association, claimed that its staff had a “90% success rate of ‘kept in home’ results … because, if it isn’t kept in the home, there is a direct cost to the business”. Although the two bodies have since been more clearly separated, that sentiment remains at the ombudsman, according to the Johnson family. A spokeswoman for the Furniture Ombudsman defended its decision in this case. “Based on the balance of probabilities and weight of evidence we made a decision. The retailer had provided us with test results, which we believed discharged their burden. We had no objective information from the consumer to counter this.” Asked why an independent inspection of the sofa was not carried out, she said: “We received no objective evidence from the consumer, which would have led to an inspection. Our process is free to consumers and it is not binding on them, meaning that the full judicial process is still available at the conclusion of our involvement. “We are not automatically privy to information presented to the court in a case that was previously reviewed, so we cannot comment on that process.” But Steele takes a different view. He says: “The Furniture Ombudsman claims that it is ‘inspiring consumer confidence’. But what it is actually doing is giving furniture retailers licence to browbeat their customers to despair – to the point that they simply capitulate.” Money invited managers at Rodgers of York to respond to the case, but no statement or comment was offered. Private scheme has top retail members The Furniture Ombudsman received 5,900 complaints in 2016 from consumers in dispute with one of its 250 or so member companies, which include most big-name retailers. It says 99.1% of the cases “were resolved or closed because of our conciliation process”, meaning that either the consumer was happy with the outcome or the ombudsman simply sided with the retailer – as it did in the Johnsons’ case. It doesn’t reveal in how many cases the consumer was left unhappy. From the remaining 50 or so cases it investigated fully last year, 52% or around 27 cases were found in consumers’ favour and a binding award was made. The scheme says its processes are approved by the government and that it meets the strict membership criteria of the Ombudsman Association. An independent standards board, oversees its work, it adds. Unlike the Financial Ombudsman Service, there is little information on the way it is financed, or how much the not-for-profit body pays senior staff. It is a private company, not a government agency, and is listed at Companies House. Member retailers pay £125 plus 8.5p per £1,000 of their gross annual turnover every year. If the scheme adjudicates a case like the Johnsons’, the retailer pays £44 plus VAT, which may explain the lack of resources devoted to looking into claims like theirs. The standards board is made up of nine members, four of whom work for retailers and include directors of Homebase and Marks &amp; Spencer. The other members come from trading standards and academic backgrounds. The Furniture Ombudsman’s website shows that it is run by Kevin Grix, 39, a lawyer who trained at the University of Hertfordshire. His previous non-legal and ADR career includes senior positions in the retail, financial and online gaming industries. • This article was amended on 29 January 2018 to clarify that a default judgment was given in favour of the Johnsons when the retailer did not contest the matter in court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/14/scotlands-highest-earners-to-pay-extra-164m-in-income-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T15:05:53Z","webTitle":"Scotland’s highest earners to pay £164m more in income tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/14/scotlands-highest-earners-to-pay-extra-164m-in-income-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/14/scotlands-highest-earners-to-pay-extra-164m-in-income-tax","fields":{"headline":"Scotland’s highest earners to pay £164m more in income tax","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Taxes for Scotland’s highest earners will rise by £164m next year to help fund pay rises for public sector workers, modest tax cuts for lower earners and £400m extra for the NHS. Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, used the Scottish parliament’s recently strengthened tax powers to raise the higher and top rates of tax by 1p to 41p and 46p, boosting funding for public services. He said Scotland’s lowest earners would have a new starter rate of 19p, while the basic rate would be frozen at 20p from April 2018. There would be a new 21p intermediate rate of tax for those earning more than £24,000, increasing the taxes paid by middle and higher-rate employees. To the delight of Scottish National party backbenchers and the irritation of the Tories, Mackay said his proposals meant the lowest earners in Scotland would pay less tax than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. He said the new starter rate meant no one earning less than £33,000 a year – about 70% of Scottish taxpayers – would pay more tax. But the Fraser of Allander Institute, an economics thinktank, quickly took the shine off his announcements by saying the most any taxpayer would gain was a cut of £20 a year. Mackay said the budget was being delivered “in the most challenging circumstances” but would “build a fairer Scotland and put the progressive values of this government into action. It invests in public services and supports businesses to develop and thrive.” The Scottish Fiscal Commission, a body recently set up and similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility in London, said that combined with last year’s freeze in Scotland’s higher tax threshold, the new tax rates increased Scottish government funding by £366m. That meant Mackay was able to propose a 3% pay rise for all public sector workers earning less than £30,000 and a 2% rise for those earning more than £30,000, after 10 years of pay freezes and a cap on pay rises for about half a million public sector employees. Public sector executives earning more than £80,000 will have their pay rise capped at £1,600. But Mackay’s proposals, which need to win support from at least one other party to get passed at Holyrood, were soon attacked by potential allies, including the Scottish Greens and trade union leaders at the Scottish TUC, after it emerged he was not directly funding all the public sector pay rises. The fiscal commission also cast a shadow over Mackay’s upbeat speech by warning that the Scottish economy faced a continuing squeeze: it would grow by less than 1% a year until 2022, compared with average UK growth forecasts of 1.5%. Susan Rice, the commission’s chair, said: “Our forecasts point to a subdued outlook for economic growth in Scotland, driven by slow productivity growth and exacerbated by demographic challenges.” That would cut future tax revenues. Mackay said council funding would be protected in cash terms, with £84m extra next year. Patrick Harvie, the Holyrood leader of the Scottish Greens, said he was delighted by the new progressive tax regime but council funding meant an unacceptable real-terms cut. That made it far harder for councillors to fund a pay rise for local government workers. Mackay will need the Greens’ six votes at Holyrood to get his budget passed but Harvie said: “It is clear the Scottish government is going to have to make changes to its local government settlement” to win Green support. Labour said the council cuts were equal to £135m in real terms. With several public sector unions threatening strike action over pay, the Scottish TUC warned Mackay he faced continued unrest. Grahame Smith, the STUC’s general secretary, said every public sector worker deserved an inflation-linked pay rise, not just the lowest paid. “He can expect to see a sustained campaign from public workers to begin a real process of restoring their livelihood. The issue of public sector pay will not disappear,” said Smith. Dave Watson, the Scottish head of policy for the public sector union Unison, said: “An unfunded pay policy is of no value for council workers.” Mackay again attacked the UK government for cutting Holyrood’s budget for day to day spending by £200m in real terms next year, although the Treasury has increased his capital budgets by £509m and financing for home-ownership by £1.1bn over the next three years. Holyrood is largely protected from the deep cuts in public sector spending elsewhere in the UK by the Treasury’s funding formula. Overall spending in Scotland, including UK government departments, meant spending of £1,436 more per head than the UK average last year. The budget announcement included: • Increasing the school attainment fund to improve outcomes for poorer pupils to £179m. • £60m for a climate change low-carbon innovation fund and £20m for low-carbon buses and cars. • Funding for the arts agency Creative Scotland increased by £6.6m after arts organisations and famous writers attacked last year’s cuts. • Scotland’s private schools to be made to pay business rates, excluding special schools for those with additional needs. • The threshold for the Scottish levy on home buying, the land and buildings transaction tax, to rise to properties costing £175,000, with £756m for building affordable homes. Mackay’s efforts to protect the SNP’s position as Scotland’s dominant centrist party were rewarded when Labour and the Tories attacked his tax plans from the left and the right. Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Tories’s finance spokesman, accused him of introducing a “Nat tax” which would leave about 1.2m Scottish workers who earned £26,000 or more paying more tax than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Scottish government figures showed someone on £35,000 a year would pay £90 more in tax than someone in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Richard Leonard, the recently elected pro-Corbyn leader of Scottish Labour, accused him of being “Tory lite” for refusing to introduce a new 50p top rate of tax. He said the council cuts were equal to £135m in real terms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/14/after-alabama-republicans-need-to-choose-reason-over-rage","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T17:38:05Z","webTitle":"After Alabama, Republicans need to choose reason over rage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/14/after-alabama-republicans-need-to-choose-reason-over-rage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/14/after-alabama-republicans-need-to-choose-reason-over-rage","fields":{"headline":"After Alabama, Republicans need to choose reason over rage","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"First Virginia, and now Alabama. From the looks of things, the Republican party is going through a rough patch. Sure, the GOP controls the White House, both chambers of Congress, and even the supreme court – thank you, Mitch McConnell – but it doesn’t look or feel like fun. Instead, traditional Republican constituencies like high-end suburbanites and college grads appear to be abandoning the party of their parents, or at least taking a powder. With the 2018 midterm elections looming just over the horizon, a little soul searching and reflection may do all of us a bit of good. First, let’s be honest about things. The ascendance of the white working class within the Republican party, coupled with Donald Trump’s persistently sagging poll numbers, have brought the GOP’s simmering fault lines to the fore. Since Richard Nixon, the Republican party has tried to outgrow its reputation as a country club restricted to north-eastern Wasps and Cheeveresque suburbanites, and the reality is that it has succeeded beyond Pat Buchanan’s wildest dreams. Nowadays, the GOP is home to blue-collar Americans, southerners and regular churchgoers. It has also kept its doors open to America’s rich – think the Koch brothers and the Mercer family. Talk about coalition-building. Truly. On paper, all this should spell good news for the Republicans, but it hasn’t been. The president tweets way too much and has a way of sucking the air out of the room. Yes, Trump calls his shtick “modern presidential”, but we all know that it reminds us of a surly 10-year old who stays glued to his Xbox or PlayStation, and that’s not what we want in our president. Or, as Senator Bob Corker put it, the White House is now “an adult day care center”. But it’s not just about Trump. Rather, it’s what passes these days as standard Republican tropes. In the hopes of forging a permanent alliance with the white working class and fending off primary challenges from the right, the GOP offers up continuous fare of scare. Campaigning in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for governor and a member of the party’s establishment if there ever was one, mouthed a steady stream of homages to Confederate monuments and warnings about the horrors of gang violence. Ultimately, Gillespie convincingly lost in what was expected to be a cliffhanger. While rural and older Trump voters responded to Gillespie’s call, suburbanites, wealthier voters, white voters with college degrees and non-evangelicals all flocked to Ralph Northam, Gillespie’s Democratic opponent. The story repeated itself earlier this week in Alabama. There, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House aide, backed Roy Moore as his vehicle for battering McConnell and the GOP’s powers that be. Bannon guided Moore to a primary victory and then to special election calamity. That Moore was soft on slavery, hostile to modernity, and repeatedly accused of being a pedophile appeared almost irrelevant to Trump, Bannon and Alabama’s Republican base, with tribalism nearly triumphing over reality – the operative words being “almost” and “nearly”. In the end, Moore lost nearly one out of 10 Republicans and a majority of independents to his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. Meanwhile, moms walked away from Moore, and a Republican who can’t win the mom vote has a problem. As for Alabama’s suburbs, Moore won those by only four points, after Mitt Romney had scored a 33-point victory in those same precincts back in 2012. Talk about underperforming. So where does that leave what was once the party of Lincoln, but which now looks awfully like a white workers’ party? At the crossroads. To the extent that the GOP continues to double down on its unvarnished working- class message, expect defections to continue, and the party’s popularity to decline with upscale America. And we’ve seen this movie before. As a response to the 2008 stock market crash and the Iraq war, Americans earning more than $200,000 actually favored Barack Obama by a six-point margin over Senator John McCain in that year’s presidential election. Meanwhile, in 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly bested Donald Trump among the $200,000-and-up set, even as she lost the election but won the popular vote. For the Republicans to hold on to what they have, the party will need to cool some of its more inflammatory rhetoric in the coming months. There are definitely arguments to be made for the GOP’s positions on an array of issues. For the moment, however, instead of ginning up the GOP’s base, the cacophony has energized the Democrats, and given marginal Republicans further reason to leave what was once their political home. If this continues, come January 2019, Nancy Pelosi may once again be seen wielding the speaker’s gavel, and Senator Chuck Schumer may be known as the majority leader. Is this a scenario that Republicans want to see? I doubt it.

The reality is always going to be more prosaic. Which is why those who do make the pilgrimage can sometimes feel a little deflated by the sheer everydayness of the place – the shops, the traffic, the traffic wardens, and all the paraphernalia of a bustling tourist industry. For Jews this disconnect can feel even sharper, given that for nearly 2,000 years Jerusalem was a hope and a promise – but not a place to actually live in. Indeed, much of the literature of the Hebrew Bible took shape in that period, even further back in time, when the people of Israel were exiled in Babylon. “By the rivers of Babylon, we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion,” wrote the psalmist. And this Jerusalem wasn’t just nostalgia for the capital city of a united kingdom. The Temple in Jerusalem, built on the site of Jacob’s famous dream of a ladder connecting heaven and earth, was understood to be a portal between God and humanity. Like no other place on earth, this specific spot is where heaven and earth are supposed to reach out and greet each other. Yet following the destruction of the Temple by the Romans in AD70, the Jewish people experienced nearly 2,000 years of exile from this holy place. And the idea of Jerusalem was kept alive in the constant telling and retelling. Indeed, since Jerusalem was founded, Jews have spent more time telling stories about the place than actually living in it. Which is why the very idea of being Jewish is inseparable from a yearning and a homesickness for the city of Jerusalem. At the heart of the traditional Jewish wedding, for example, is the breaking of a glass to symbolise the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple and the making of a promise, taken from the same rivers-of-Babylon psalm, 137: “If I forget thee O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its cunning: If I do not raise thee over my own joy, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.” Boney M didn’t get this bit into their song, but it was a promise I made when I got married in Israel. As have millions of Jews over the centuries. So, too, “next year in Jerusalem”, as Jews have promised each other at every Passover. Jerusalem is both a place and an idea. But just as there are those who want it to remain a perfect idea in their heads, so also there are those who can only see Jerusalem in terms of the current political crisis, a place of walls and occupation. My point is not that the Jerusalem of hopes and dreams trumps the Jerusalem of drains and shops and politics, but that Jerusalem the golden is just as much a part of the reality as the practicalities of a modern city in a highly contested area. The secular mindset can often feel frustration towards the influence that the Jerusalem of the imagination has over its present-day politics, and not least over Donald Trump’s unhelpful intervention in recognising Jerusalem as the capital city of modern Israel. And it’s true, Trump is being driven on by Christian fundamentalists, most of whom won’t ever leave flyover country and for whom the city of Jerusalem is just a distant fantasy. And I completely understand the frustration of people like my father-in-law, who was born there and who lives in Jerusalem day to day and who finds it maddening to be the object of such vast, overwhelming projection. Nonetheless, Jerusalem has always been a construction of the imagination – and I don’t mean that pejoratively. Jews, Christians and Muslims have all invested in it their hopes and dreams, their tears and their longing. The imagination has made Jerusalem the city that it is. And no real-life political peace can ever be possible without an understanding of why and how this is so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"law/2017/dec/14/laws-safe-use-driverless-cars-ready-2021-law-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T14:44:33Z","webTitle":"Laws for safe use of driverless cars to be ready by 2021","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/dec/14/laws-safe-use-driverless-cars-ready-2021-law-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/dec/14/laws-safe-use-driverless-cars-ready-2021-law-commission","fields":{"headline":"Laws for safe use of driverless cars to be ready by 2021","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Legislation to promote safe use of driverless cars is to be developed by the Law Commission to be ready as early as 2021, supporting advances in autonomous vehicle technology. Revealing an ambitious programme of work for next year, the body, which reviews parliamentary acts and identifies gaps in regulations, will also update laws controlling surrogacy and the disposal of dead bodies. The automated vehicle project is being launched at the request of the government’s Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV), which has asked for a “modern and robust” package of reforms as part of public transport networks and on-demand passenger services by 2021. The review is likely to consider the difficult question of who is liable in an accident involving a driverless bus or car – the manufacturer, operator or other drivers. “Automated vehicles do not readily fit within existing legal frameworks,” the commission said, “so the review will identify pressing problems in the law that may be barriers to the use of automated vehicles, as well as considering broader, longer-term reforms.” The commission said it aimed to “promote public confidence in the safe use of automated vehicles, and to ensure the UK has a vibrant, world-leading connected and automated vehicles industry”. On surrogacy, the commission said hundreds of children were born in the UK every year as a result of agreements between women who bear a child and those who wish to become parents. The arrangements are controlled by the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 and certain provisions of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. “The greater acceptance of same-sex relationships, with the introduction of civil partnerships and the extension of marriage, is one of a number of factors likely to result in an increase in the number of children born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement,” the commission said. “For a same-sex male couple, surrogacy is the only formal way of having a child who is biologically related to one of the intended parents. Surrogacy may also be an important route to parenthood for some transgender people.” Courts have struggled to implement the statutory conditions for a parental order, the commission said, because the paramount position of the child’s best interests makes it difficult for the court to refuse to recognise an existing relationship between the intended parents and child. Surrogacy arrangements also raise unresolved issues of children’s rights to access information about their parentage, both genetic and gestational. New methods for the disposal of human bodies are being developed including resomation, using alkaline hydrolysis to reduce the body to ash, and promession/cryomation, using liquid nitrogen to crystallise the body and vibration to disintegrate it into particles. Such methods “are completely unregulated here, which is an unsatisfactory position”, the commission said. “The legislation governing more traditional methods of disposal is outdated, piecemeal and complex. The law does not ensure that a person’s own wishes as to the disposal of their remains are carried out, leading to disputes where family members disagree. Disputes also arise as to entitlement to a person’s remains.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/15/moment-that-changed-me-sadness-counselling-depression","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"A moment that changed me: when overwhelming sadness drove me to seek counselling | Sachin Nakrani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/moment-that-changed-me-sadness-counselling-depression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/moment-that-changed-me-sadness-counselling-depression","fields":{"headline":"A moment that changed me: when deep sadness drove me to counselling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’d never said goodbye to a man before. Not a man like David, anyway. A man I had been so close to, a man with whom I had shared so much of myself. But now it was time to say goodbye. So I stood up, leaned forward and shook his hand. I smiled, he smiled, and I walked out of the door, almost certainly never to see him again. A total of 20 times, stretching from spring to autumn, each for precisely 50 minutes: those occasions David and I spent together will live with me forever. Part of me wonders how I will cope without him, but I know there’s nothing else he can do for me now. And there are no regrets, because seeking help was exactly the right thing to do. David was kind and attentive from the start, and while he knows an awful lot more about me than I do about him, I don’t feel used in the slightest. Counselling is not for everyone, but it was for me. I desperately needed it during what has been the most difficult period of my life. So much has happened this year and there is, I know, so much more to come. But I feel ready to take it on because of what I’ve been through. I still remember the moment crisis hit. It was a Wednesday afternoon in mid-February and I was on my way to Leicester Square to watch the sequel to Trainspotting when a great sadness overwhelmed me. In truth it had been stirring for some time but now its grip was suffocating, and I was struggling to breathe. So I got off at Elephant and Castle tube station and called someone I knew who was going through long-standing difficulties relating to mental illness and asked for his advice. The message was simple: seek help – immediately. I booked an appointment with a GP and was referred to David. Our first session took place in early May. Even now, after my final session, I’m not sure if I was – and still am – suffering with depression; I was never officially diagnosed. It’s certainly possible, and during the summer, at the height of my troubles, I was prescribed the antidepressant sertraline which after some initial discomfort (painful headaches, problems staying asleep), has had a significantly positive effect. I continue to take it now. Seeing David on a weekly basis may well have saved my life, because it got very dark. I will never forget the Friday afternoon in July when I lay on a bench in open woodland near my parents’ house in north London looking up at the sky. It began to rain, and although part of me wanted to get up and go home I just stayed there, practically motionless, my legs dangling over the edge. I felt empty, fed up, devoid of happiness. The rain was having no effect, I was numb to it and considered ending it all there and then. Would I have gone through with it? Perhaps not, but the fact I was considering it was enough. This was rock bottom and for the sake of my family and friends, and my wife and daughter in particular, I had to rise up. David helped enormously. He listened and allowed me to unload my burden of anger, longing and sadness. I’m 36 years old, married, a father, a homeowner and a sports journalist. It’s a lovely, rewarding, stimulating life, but it’s also very grownup. And as anyone who is very grownup will tell you, being very grownup can be, well … boring. Routine kicks in and can completely take over. Thankfully I love my job, and have a regular release in my lifelong interest in Liverpool Football Club that sees me spending many hours travelling up and down the country to watch them play. But something else, something very important has all but gone – my friends. It creeps up you on. When you’re in your 20s you imagine nights in the pub, long weekends in far-off lands and chains of giggle-inducing messages with people with whom who share a common way of thinking will last forever. But you get older, some of you get married or have children, and gradually the ties weaken. Contact reduces, chains of messages become one here or there, and before you know it, months have passed without you seeing or speaking to people you once couldn’t go more than two days without. That’s life – people get older, their priorities and responsibilities shift, but that doesn’t make it easy. I’m fully aware this is a first-world problem. Perhaps you’re wondering: “Is it possible that your friends just don’t like you any more?” Well, maybe. But I will not apologise for suffering with this particular kind of loneliness. I love my wife and daughter, and seeing the latter grow into an utterly wonderful person has and will be the greatest experience of my life. She’s six years old, loves reading and dancing to Drake, hates nuts (claims she’s allergic – she’s not) and isn’t into Peppa Pig as much as she once was. Every day she makes my heart glow. But there’s still only so many times you can mow the lawn, clean the bathroom, put out the bins, do the school run and stand awkwardly next to a fellow dad in the local park before you need a break from it all. And that break is your friends. That’s why, after I got married in 2009 and became a father in 2011, I tried to see them as much as possible, so much so that last year I sent an email outlining my determination to do so. A plan was put in place – we were to meet once a month, with a different person organising each outing. Everyone agreed, everyone was up for it … and then it petered out after two gatherings. I’ve seen most of them since but not as a group, and each meeting was somewhat fleeting. It’s not how it once was and that has left me feeling sad, angry and, yes, lonely. I discussed all this with David, which led to me accepting it was a problem, and one cause for the slump I have found myself in this year. Can it be fixed? Probably not. But by recognising the problem I have released the internal angst and realised that things are not as bad as all that. After all, I do still see my friends and have a lot of other people in my life whose company I enjoy immensely. I feel better now. And so can you. Ignore the cynics who dismiss mental illness as a fad. It’s real, caused by complex emotions and circumstances, including feeling lonely through an absence of friendship. There is nothing to be ashamed of, no rights and wrongs when it comes to your wellbeing. It’s only by coming to terms with their feelings that sufferers can avoid sliding into a dark, potentially tragic place. I miss my friends, I miss seeing them and speaking with them. And I refuse to feel guilty for writing that here or for saying it out loud, to David. • Sachin Nakrani is a Guardian sports editor and writer. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

The author Robert Macfarlane says that public libraries are nothing less than “magic portals into learning and dreaming”. Virginia Woolf once said they were “full of sunk treasure”. When it comes to libraries’ civic importance, their modern supporters tend to use terms such as “community hub”, but on that score, I would rather turn to 24 elegant words uttered by the American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie: “A library outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people. It is a never failing spring in the desert.” Slightly less romantically, in an age in which access to the internet is a necessity, libraries represent pretty much the only public place that people without a computer or smartphone can get online. In among its endless demands and diktats, the new system of universal credit makes this compulsory – as evidenced by a woman I recently met in Newcastle, who said that every time she received a text message from the jobcentre, she had to gather together her kids and sprint to the local library, to find out what’s now required of her, for fear of having her benefits stopped. Libraries are also one of the most solid collective bulwarks against the modern scourge of loneliness: places that offer shared experience and a chance to linger among company, without having to spend any money. But does anyone in government care? Since 2010, at least 478 libraries have closed in England, Wales and Scotland. Over the same period, the number of books held by surviving libraries has dropped by 14m, while librarian numbers have been cut by around 8,000. Statistics released this week by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy show that over the past five years, loans of books have dropped by a quarter, and that spending on libraries by councils fell by £66m in 2016-17 alone. The results are heartbreaking: according to research by Tim Coates, the former managing director of Waterstones, book loans to children in Birmingham have fallen by 32% since 2011. In Newcastle the figure is 35%; in Sheffield 56%. The numbers are mind-boggling, and it’s obvious what they denote: reading being snatched out of young lives, with a blithe cruelty that ought to make ministers ashamed. While too much of the national media now behaves as if austerity was something that began and ended with the David Cameron years, it goes on apace. Across the country, as money from Whitehall continues to be cut and council leaders fret about how local authorities are to avoid financial ruin, places still face seemingly endless economies. In Norfolk, the ruling Tory council is eyeing cuts of around £100m over the next four years. Bradford faces cuts of £30m between now and 2020; in Leicestershire, £54m will have to go by 2022. In the reports of these ongoing disasters, one kind of sentence recurs time and again. It goes something like this: “Services including street cleaning, libraries, and museums and galleries are set to be among the hardest hit.” And so it proves. Around half of people in the UK are now reckoned to be at least occasional library users; among 25- to 34-year-olds in England, the use of libraries has actually risen since 2011. In English cities, the busiest libraries continue to rack up huge annual visitor numbers, in excess of a million each. But instead of being modernised and developed, far too many libraries are still either cutting back their hours, or closing. In Northamptonshire, the council is considering shutting as many as 28 of the county’s 36. In Bury, near Manchester, 10 of 14 are about to close. Closures are also looming in Cheshire, East Sussex, Anglesey, Shropshire and more. In Edinburgh, 2018 will see a pilot in which libraries are run without any staff (“CCTV cameras, emergency telephones, loudspeakers and alarms will ensure security when libraries are unstaffed,” apparently). In other places, drawing on the dying embers of the “big society”, there is the usual talk about keeping services running by handing things over to volunteers – which is obviously much better than nothing, but threatens to turn a properly funded public resource into a Cinderella service, often cut loose from an area’s official library system. Finding sufficient volunteers in disadvantaged areas is often a big problem. Suddenly, replenishing book stocks becomes a matter of appeals to the public, and such matters as building maintenance and cleaning are the focus of ongoing worry. The danger, clearly, is that the aroma of the jumble sale soon arrives, and the stupid idea that libraries are some kind of outmoded relic becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy – something highlighted by an early warning contained in a letter written to the Swindon Advertiser back in 2010. The subject was a library handed over to the so-called third sector, which had decayed at speed: “It has no real library staff, is now shut on Saturdays and is no longer available for the local schools to use, because there’s no room available since the charity shop moved in. It is now, in fact, a charity shop with some stacks of books as a sort of afterthought.” Somewhere in those words is a neat diagnosis of the modern British condition. When it comes to people trying to manage their benefit payments, the sudden loss of libraries only adds to the sense of a system run on a mixture of chaotic ineptitude and an entirely deliberate Kafkaesque cruelty. And in the context of the importance of learning, savaging library provision highlights the old con trick whereby Conservative politicians talk up the wonders of social mobility and self-improvement, while attacking the very institutions that give those ideas any meaning. Dozens of Tory politicians regularly shine light on that hypocrisy – such as the high-profile Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin, currently one of the more verbose occupants of the Conservative benches, and a man who embodies all the awful delusions that still afflict his party. On a recent edition of Question Time broadcast from Swansea, he took exception to an audience member’s mention of the class system. “I wish we’d just stop talking about class,” he said. “Class isn’t important. It doesn’t matter where you’ve come from. We should provide the country with opportunities.” These are the same people who are not only starving state schools of money, but who have now spent seven long years attacking a public service that is a byword for the education and opportunity they bang on about. Somewhere in the deepest recesses of their souls, they must know: you cannot talk about such things while depriving people of the chance to read. Other than as an example of howling cant, it makes no sense. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/17/imperium-rsc-robert-harris-observer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Imperium review – Rome sweet Rome, with a masterly turn from Cicero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/17/imperium-rsc-robert-harris-observer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/17/imperium-rsc-robert-harris-observer-review","fields":{"headline":"Imperium review – Rome sweet Rome, with a masterly turn from Cicero","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There are, well, a legion of reasons for going to Imperium. To experience a driving theatrical narrative on a scale rarely attempted. To be transported to the politics of ancient Rome. To see 21st-century politics through classical spectacles. To watch a masterly performance by Richard McCabe. Mike Poulton, who adapted Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies for the RSC, has turned Robert Harris’s trilogy about the rise and fall of Cicero, and the decline of the Roman republic into a seven-hour, six-act, two-part epic. It thwacks down: clear, and, particularly early on, speedy. It helps that Harris is a storyteller not a phrase-maker. He nails a resonant subject, spins a plot, gives a sharp take on character. His default mode is plain speaking. Which makes Cicero’s eloquence the more luxuriant and striking. Nothing miniature or delicate in Gregory Doran’s production or Anthony Ward’s design. A giant pair of mosaic eyes oversees the action. A bronze globe dangles: glowing, fading and – as an augury – darkened by a murmuration of starlings. Audiences count off contemporary parallels. The rise of populism. The suppression of citizens’ rights during a crisis. Conspiracy. Dictatorial leaders. “Stupid people vote for stupid people,” goes down well. A point is sometimes pressed too far. Christopher Saul’s Pompey swaggers around with blond wig and pouter-pigeon chest, proclaiming himself “a good republican”. Actually, modern parallels are the least unusual aspect. It is the underlying manoeuvring that fascinates, the intricate arguments that entice. McCabe – a celebrated Harold Wilson in The Audience – is a beautifully judged Cicero. Propelled by adherence to the republic and the rule of law, tugged by vanity, he operates sinuously, especially adept at warmly greeting someone he is excoriating. Expressions perch fleetingly on his face. It is words that count. After an impressive declaration, his jaw juts, his lips move: he savours his speech as if he can’t bear to let it go. Joseph Kloska is shrewd and wry as Tiro, the slave who, as in Harris’s novels, is the framing narrator. It is an anti-dramatic device, but Poulton plays with that danger: “This is getting very expositional,” Tiro is warned. He should also be warned about dropping into facetiousness. Tiro is rare in not being a chap about to take or lose power. Peter de Jersey is a lethal, poised Julius Caesar; Joe Dixon’s Mark Antony a feral panther. Oliver Johnstone, as the young Octavian is chilly and unwavering: he might be the statue of a child come commandingly to life. This is a testosterone-fuelled production. Drums; whopping sandals; lots of roaring and rushing across the stage. Siobhan Redmond makes an intelligent, stalwart Terentia, wife to Cicero. Otherwise, the significant female parts are a saccharine daughter, harpies – and vestal virgins, who whisk around like ambulant lampshades. Of course, this is imperium. Still, Emily Wilson’s brilliant introduction to her new translation of The Odyssey shows the classical world as capable of feminist inflections. I would have welcomed some of those inflections here. • Imperium is at the Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 10 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/14/david-daviss-brexit-department-tops-government-secrecy-table","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T19:33:16Z","webTitle":"David Davis's Brexit department tops government secrecy table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/14/david-daviss-brexit-department-tops-government-secrecy-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/14/david-daviss-brexit-department-tops-government-secrecy-table","fields":{"headline":"David Davis's Brexit department tops government secrecy table","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May’s key Brexit department has failed to respond to more than six out of 10 freedom of information requests over the past year, giving it the worst annual record for secrecy in Whitehall. The Institute for Government (IFG) said the figures, included in an analysis shared exclusively with the Guardian, painted a “broader picture of government opacity” – particularly related to Britain’s departure from the EU. The figures come after David Davis had his knuckles rapped after appearing to boast about a series of reports assessing the impact of Brexit on different British sectors, which never existed. Despite MPs’ annoyance, the cabinet minister avoided a charge of contempt of parliament. However, he could face further questions following the IFG research in which the Department for Exiting the European Union topped a list on the number of times information was fully withheld over the past year. The Department for International Trade – also involved with Brexit planning – was worst for timeliness. It only responded within the required 20 working days (or longer with a permitted extension) 63.5% of the time – well below a target of 85%. Falling below the expected level repeatedly can result in special monitoring from the Information Commissioner’s Office. “DExEU’s record on freedom of information is worse than most other government departments – in two of the five quarters of its existence, it’s withheld more information than any other department,” said Gavin Freeguard, the IFG’s head of data and transparency. “This poor performance is part of a much broader picture of government opacity when it comes to Brexit. We have yet to see any serious impact assessments from departments, and are still waiting for white papers that were due to be published before the summer.” Over the past year Freeguard found that the Brexit department, led by Davis, granted just 18% of FoI cases in full – the lowest of any department. That was followed by the Foreign Office and Department for Trade which both provided all the requested data in 24% of cases. Meanwhile, it fully withheld information in 62% of cases, the highest proportion, followed by those of the Cabinet Office and HMRC. The statistics were marginally better when limited to the past quarter. That placed the Brexit department in third place on 55%, behind HMRC and the Cabinet Office. Freeguard found that Brexit officials used FoI exemptions more regularly than other colleagues across the government, citing international relations, the economy and formulation of government policy as reasons to keep information private. A separate request for information from the department – by Ben Worthy – found that it often also used the claim that requests had been “vexatious”. Officials insisted there were good reasons for the lack of data being provided. A DExEU spokesperson said: “The department’s purpose is to negotiate our successful exit from the European Union, and therefore a significant amount of our work is sensitive. We always strive to balance our commitment to transparency with the need to protect sensitive information that could affect our negotiating position.” However, the IFG’s director, Bronwen Maddox, questioned the behaviour of Davis’s department. Speaking about the impact assessments, she claimed the government had shown disregard for the principle of making decisions based on evidence. She said: “David Davis said to the Commons committee on exiting the EU that the government had not undertaken formal impact assessments of Brexit. This not only appeared to contradict previous ministerial assertions but also showed a disregard for the principle of making decisions based on thorough evidence and analysis. “This is no way to approach such a profound change in the UK’s relationship with close trading partners and allies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/14/net-neutrality-fcc-rules-open-internet","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T01:36:02Z","webTitle":"US regulator scraps net neutrality rules that protect open internet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/14/net-neutrality-fcc-rules-open-internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/14/net-neutrality-fcc-rules-open-internet","fields":{"headline":"US regulator scraps net neutrality rules that protect open internet","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US’s top media regulator voted to end rules protecting an open internet on Thursday, a move critics warn will hand control of the future of the web to cable and telecoms companies. At a packed meeting of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington, the watchdog’s commissioners voted three to two to dismantle the “net neutrality” rules that prevent internet service providers (ISPs) from charging websites more for delivering certain services or blocking others should they, for example, compete with services the cable company also offers. Outside, protesters angrily called on Congress to block the FCC’s efforts. Bouquets of flowers and white candles were placed on the grass outside the building, an apparent reference to the “death” of open internet. Posters of the angry-face emoji covered the walkway. And activists carried hand-made signs that read: “Don’t make the internet a private toll road”; “Ajit Pai doesn’t want you to meet your fiancé online”; and “Don’t undermine our democracy – that’s Russia’s job”. The meeting was briefly interrupted by a security threat. FCC commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, denounced the move. “I dissent because I am among the millions outraged, outraged because the FCC pulls its own teeth, abdicating responsibility to protect the nation’s broadband consumers,” she said. Fellow Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said the FCC had shown “contempt” for public opinion during the review. She called the process “corrupt”. “As a result of today’s misguided actions, our broadband providers will get extraordinary new powers,” she said. But FCC chair Ajit Pai and his two fellow Republicans voted for the repeal. Pai said the current rules had impeded innovation and addressed non-existent concerns. “We are restoring the light-touch framework that has governed the internet for much of its existence.” He called claims that the move would kill the internet “outlandish”. Net neutrality’s advocates argue that an open internet has been essential to the creation of today’s web, and has allowed companies like Skype to compete with telecoms providers and Netflix to change the media landscape. They say the removal of the rules will affect consumers worldwide. Cable companies have attempted to block or slow competing services in the past, and the rules were meant to prevent such cases arising in future. Removing the rules, critics argue, will stifle the online innovations that have been enjoyed by people worldwide and set a dangerous precedent for other countries looking to take firmer control of the internet or to hand oversight to corporations. Evan Greer, campaign director for internet activists Fight for the Future, said: “Killing net neutrality in the US will impact internet users all over the world. So many of the best ideas will be lost, squashed by the largest corporations at the expense of the global internet-using public.” Michael Cheah of Vimeo said: “ISPs probably won’t immediately begin blocking content outright, given the uproar that this would provoke. What’s more likely is a transition to a pay-for-play business model that will ultimately stifle startups and innovation, and lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers.” Passing the plan is a major victory for Pai, a Donald Trump appointee and former Verizon lawyer who has been a long-term critic of the net neutrality rules brought in under Barack Obama in 2015. The FCC will require internet providers to disclose how they treat traffic, but regulation of the internet will essentially move to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), removing barriers to potential abuses and leaving the FTC to assess violations after the fact. Cable companies have dismissed critics’ concerns and said they remain committed to an open internet. “This is not the end of net neutrality,” Comcast’s senior executive vice-president wrote in a blogpost. “Despite repeated distortions and biased information, our internet service is not going to change. Comcast customers will continue to enjoy all of the benefits of an open internet today, tomorrow, and in the future. Period.” But critics charge that as cable companies become ever bigger investors in media (Comcast owns NBC Universal, and AT&amp;T is trying to buy Time Warner) the incentives to hamper competition are increasing. Pai’s proposal still faces heavy opposition. A record 22 million comments were submitted to the FCC by the general public before the vote – the majority in favor of keeping the rules. Millions of comments submitted in support of Pai’s decision were found to be fake and are now being investigated by New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman. On Wednesday morning, two US senators, Susan Collins and Angus King, both of Maine, called on the FCC to cancel the vote. “Repealing the FCC’s net neutrality rules will undermine long-standing protections that that have ensured the open internet as a powerful and transformative platform of innovation and economic opportunity,” they wrote. Eighteen attorneys general, dozens of Democratic congressmen and two Republicans had pushed for a delay to the ruling. Critics and activists will now push for Congress to step in and pass a resolution of disapproval using the Congressional Review Act to overturn the FCC’s order.

The comment was made in a Freedom of Information response from November 2016, suggesting that work was underway on the documents more than a year before the government backtracked on acknowledging their existence. In addition, the Guardian has found at least 12 references in Hansard, the official record of parliament, to ministers talking about the work to “assess the impact” or “assess the economic impact” of Brexit over the last year. The findings are likely to fuel suspicions that the Department for Exiting the European Union does have documentary evidence of the impact of Brexit on the economy. Parliament asked for 58 impact assessments to be handed over to the select committee on exiting the EU last month, so they could examine how Brexit would affect different sectors. But MPs who were allowed to view the 800-pages of documents ridiculed the analyses for simply setting out the current situation for businesses, explaining how the EU operates and then providing a section on what stakeholders think. Davis and other ministers claimed they had never said any “impact assessments” existed, and the committee, which is dominated by Conservatives, ruled that he was not in contempt of parliament for failing to release such documents. However, campaigners believe the government does still hold relevant information setting out the official view of how Brexit could affect the economy and businesses. A judicial review has been launched by Green MEP Molly Scott Cato, and the Good Law Project, led by Jolyon Maugham, to try to force the government to reveal any analysis of the impact of Brexit but it is not certain this can be completed in time. Launching the review, Scott Cato said: “There are two possibilities. Either the studies do exist, and Davis has lied to the House and must resign. Or the studies do not exist, in which case Davis is guilty of dereliction of duty and must resign. Either way, he cannot maintain the confidence of the House as our Brexit negotiator.” Asked about the repeated use of the words “impact” and “assess” to describe the documents, the government has changed tack to claim that the documents released to the House of Commons do in fact analyse the impact of leaving the EU. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union pointed to recent comments in the House of Commons by Robin Walker, who denies the existence of impact assessments, but said: “The information that has been shared with the select committee and is available to all members of this House in the reading room includes assessments of the impact on the regulatory matters and of the importance of EU trade to different sectors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/14/england-forced-to-work-hard-considerable-ashes-cricket-waca-first-day-gains","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T14:37:03Z","webTitle":"England forced to work hard for their considerable first-day gains at Ashes | Adam Collins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/14/england-forced-to-work-hard-considerable-ashes-cricket-waca-first-day-gains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/14/england-forced-to-work-hard-considerable-ashes-cricket-waca-first-day-gains","fields":{"headline":"England forced to work hard for their considerable first-day gains at Ashes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If the plan was to manage expectations before the Waca’s final Ashes fling, it was expertly done. Not hot enough to bake the pitch, we were told by groundstaff. A bit soft, Steve Smith warned. Stories from recent years illustrated that the famous track was like Seattle’s grunge scene: once awesome, long finished. Australia’s pace trio found otherwise. The stumps score will confirm that this was England’s best shift on tour but it will not show how hard they had to work for their considerable first-day gains. According to CricViz, only once since speed-gun records began has a group of quicks averaged a faster speed than Australia’s did on the first day of this Test. That too is deceptive. Radar readings do not tell the degree of difficulty for batsmen under fire, especially when short bowling is involved. It is an experience that needs to be taken in with your own eyes to observe the physical and mental toll. And 22,148 spectators had themselves a post-lunch treat. Sure, before the first break the locals had been sharp. Mitchell Starc all but blew Alastair Cook’s pad off early, before bouncing twice over Tim Paine’s head with deliveries that nearly cleared the rope on the full. The preconditions were there for something special. But the hour after was something else for romantics with long memories. The magic happened across nine rousing overs, beginning with Josh Hazlewood in his protracted stoush with Mark Stoneman. The Englishman had reached 50 in a hurry after his sandwich. Maybe the modest wave of the bat angered the big quick? In the best traditions of the angry Australian, he bowled as though he took personal offence. That extra yard immediately found an outside edge. Mitchell Marsh’s first act back in Test cricket was to shell a shocker at slip. Hazlewood cracked on the best way his type knows how, by going upstairs into Stoneman’s helmet. The blow was audible. Hazlewood’s next offering was fended into the gully, but not to hand. He bumped the batsman again, then beat him once more. All in one over. Breathe now, if you dare. Did his set shape Pat Cummins’s dismissal of Joe Root four balls later? Done in by extra bounce but not much else, garroted down the legside. Bowling in partnerships, as they say. The right-armer’s second ball to new bloke Dawid Malan was a searing bouncer from central casting. Strap in. Hazlewood’s turn again. He had unfinished business with Stoneman. Beaten. Bumped. Rinse and repeat. Every Waca mouth agape, the umpires involved too. Beaten again. “Now he’s missing straight ones,” opined ABC’s Dirk Nannes, in a lather on the radio call. Bouncer to finish, steepling so much Paine was able only to drag it down with one extended mitt. “Mr Malan, your interrogator awaits you at the Prindiville Stand End.” The ground announcer didn’t say that, but you could surely see it in Cummins’s flamboyant delivery stride. In an effort to draw every last kilometre from his frame, he was routinely off-balance after unfurling. Twice in three balls the batsman swayed under bouncers trained on his head. He was hit on the thigh pad. There was an appeal for caught behind. Malan’s response? A mature push for three, a sign of the ton to come. But three off the last ball meant retaining the strike. To Starc no less, who must have ripped the ball from Hazlewood’s hands to get a go. Three balls in, Malan was now fending from his throat, just evading short leg. Who needs this when fighting for a career? Isn’t Perth placid? To the first ball of Starc’s next over, Malan did the smart thing and got himself down the other end. But not so fast. Stoneman had yet to face the attack-leader in this fresh spell, with the ground heaving like one imagines it did for Lillee or Thommo or Snow or Curtly. Another short ball, another desperate attempt to get out of the way. But not this time. Maybe he gloved it, maybe he didn’t. No one really knows. But after all that happened, it felt the right ending. For a time, Malan kept living la vida loca against Starc, haphazardly hooking, surviving while accumulating. But the titillation, for now, was over as the game returned to how we know it more often than not, the roar settling into calm. The scorecard will never know what came before Malan’s maiden three figures. But we do. One last time with feeling. It felt so good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/when-good-tv-goes-bad-why-scooby-doo-went-dogs-mystery-incorporated","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"When good TV goes bad: why Scooby-Doo went to the dogs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/when-good-tv-goes-bad-why-scooby-doo-went-dogs-mystery-incorporated","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/18/when-good-tv-goes-bad-why-scooby-doo-went-dogs-mystery-incorporated","fields":{"headline":"When good TV goes bad: why Scooby-Doo went to the dogs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Growing up, there is no bigger worry than bogeymen hiding in your cupboard or monsters camping under your bed. But – as Scooby-Doo would advocate – there is no such thing. Because every time Scoob and the gang discover a mummy or a ghost, off comes the mask and it’s merely the janitor, shaking his head at those meddling kids. There have been many outings for the world’s most famous great dane over the years. There’s Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! with the original crime-fighting cast of Fred (handsome but bossy), Velma (geeky but the most switched-on), Daphne (clumsy, optimistic), Shaggy (hungry) and our Scoob (“Raggy!”), who dart around in their garishly painted Mystery Machine. You might also remember throwing your proverbial slipper at the world’s most annoying sidekick, Scrappy-Doo (“Puppy Power!”), who sends Fred and Velma their P45s in The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show. You may have even stumbled upon What’s New, Scooby-Doo?, which ran from 2002 to 2006 but still looked as if it could have been made in the 70s, even if the monsters were holograms and everyone was using mobile phones. Things are made rather complicated if you tune in to watch Scooby nowadays (bored weekend, lazy day off work or – worse still – you’ve got kids) as TV schedulers mix up the old Doo with the new. Fred and Velma are back and Scrappy has been sent to the dog pound. Bleary-eyed at 6am, it can be difficult to remember which decade you’re supposed to be in. Besides, Scooby-Doo may sometimes leave you with a few mysteries of your own. What exactly was in those Scooby Snacks that made them so addictive to both humans and canines? Were they legal? Are Fred and Daphne secretly doing it behind Velma’s back? How is Scoobert a real name, even for a dog? Despite all his, there’s always one constant: there’s no such thing as ghosts and monsters, because – when the villain is unmasked – it’s always a bitter human in a rubbish costume. Take The Neon Phantom, who was just a bloke in lit-up Lycra. Or the Headless Spectre, AKA a guy with his shirt pulled over his head. The Ghost Clown wasn’t even a clown, but a hypnotist in some face paint. However, 2010’s Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated changed all that and, in the process, made a big old mess of things. As well as some untoward office romances blossoming behind the Mystery Machine doors (Velma is secretly going out with Shaggy. Velma and Shaggy! And Fred and Daphne are engaged!), there are actual ghosts and proper monsters. Hide under the duvet at the Evil Entity, a mass of tentacles and eyeballs who is obsessed with the total destruction of the universe. Quiver behind the sofa at Charlie the Haunted Robot, who is still a haunted robot when the gang unmask him. And jump into Shaggy’s arms at a race of alien creatures called the Anunnaki, who travel to Earth every 1,000 years from another dimension and inhabit the bodies of animals (yes, really). Scoob-thusiasts may note that actual ghosts, monsters and aliens have long frequented the many straight-to-video Scooby movies. But, erm, they don’t count. In a traditional half-hour escapade, the slime monster needs to turn out to be a jaded professor not some transdimensional being. How are we supposed to sleep at night, Scoob?

Yeah, right","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With exquisite timing, just hours after the government had been defeated on a vote on the EU withdrawal bill, the Brexit secretary found himself back in the Commons to face departmental questions. Still, David Davis had had enough time to consider how best to respond to the setback – and he had decided to pretend that it hadn’t really happened. Or, if it had, that it was of little significance. A minor setback in the grand scheme of things. It wasn’t long before Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, tried to put him right. The government had suffered a “humiliating and avoidable” defeat, Starmer observed, and parliament had decided it should have a meaningful vote on a final deal. Could the minister now confirm there were no plans to overrule this at the report stage of the bill? Perhaps it was fatigue. For all his protestations that he was feeling “bright-eyed and bushy-tailed”, Davis looked done in: the bags under his eyes get deeper by the week and his state of permanent jauntiness seems more and more an act. Or perhaps it was confusion. On his own admission, he isn’t particularly clever. But, either way, the Brexit secretary’s reply was a masterclass in mumbling stream of unconsciousness. “Smooth and orderly exit ... compressed timetable,” he said, apparently playing for time, before ending with, “We will have to take time to think about how we respond.” Which didn’t sound entirely like the unequivocal “We recognise the authority of parliament” that had been expected. Taking back control appeared to have become rather less appealing than it had been in the referendum. Starmer took a moment to regroup, observing that Davis’s answer was not the basis on which the previous night’s debate had been conducted. He then offered the minister the chance to accept the amendment on the removal of the date of departure from the bill, or risk suffering a second defeat inside a week. Davis went back to his usual pugnacious, punch-drunk self. The government was prepared to take on all comers and had no intention of backing down. Labour could bring it on, if it thought it was hard enough. Labour definitely thinks it is. This brought an intervention from Typhoid Anna. After her rebellion the previous evening, Anna Soubry was considered such a pariah that no Tory dared sit within 10 metres of her. She was a one-woman exclusion zone. Soubry began by saying she had derived no pleasure from rebelling against her party. “You were drinking champagne afterwards,” yelled one Tory Brexiter. It’s amazing how many MPs believe only they are allowed to act on matters of principle. “Nobody drank champagne,” Soubry snapped. “Let’s nail that one now.” Anna wasn’t going down without a fight. Rather, she seemed empowered by the abuse she had received from colleagues and the media, and tried to get Davis to commit to a date for the first reading of the EU withdrawal and implementation bill. “Sometime in September or October this year, I hope,” Davis said, entering a parallel world in which it was possible to travel back in time. When questions turned to the mystery of the missing Brexit impact assessments, Davis was happy to let his junior minister Captain Darling – aka the nice-but-reliably-dim Robin Walker – take the flak. There was cunning as well as cowardice in this, as Darling is a minister whom people are inclined to believe when he says: “I know nothing.” Once more we were transported into a conceptual multiverse where the impact assessments both did and didn’t exist; where government departments had worked tirelessly on sectoral analyses but had next to nothing to show for them – the effects of Brexit on the NHS had been reduced to just nine pages of stating there would be an impact but it was impossible to assess what it would be. Several MPs were unable to prevent themselves from sobbing. “Thank you, Darling,” whispered Davis, as Walker sat down. The Brexit secretary also had cause to thank John Bercow a few moments later, when the Speaker ruled he hadn’t been in contempt of parliament. It had been a close-run thing, though, with Bercow appearing to have decided, on balance, that Davis had been too stupid to mislead the Commons and was merely guilty of being spectacularly incompetent by failing to make himself clear. A result for Davis, though a worry for the country. On balance, it might have been better to have a clever liar in charge of the Brexit negotiations.

It was two years after he had left Downing Street, and the former prime minister resembled nothing so much as Francis Maude done up as a drag queen. Plucked and buffed, caked in makeup, his whole face gurned and twitched, the eyebrows and teeth performing a bizarre kind of eightsome reel. The man’s discomfort in his own skin was disturbing to witness. The figure who greets me this week in the London office of his new Institute for Global Change is unrecognisably altered. The facial dance has vanished and he is strikingly composed; performative agitation has been replaced with centred gravitas. The cadence of his speech has changed, too; the curiously verb-less sentences are gone, along with the faux glottal stops. But then, lately, an awful lot about Blair’s life has changed, too. In autumn last year, he announced the closure of Tony Blair Associates, his private business empire, and the winding up of complex and controversial financial structures that have earned him so many millions and so much opprobrium. Reserves of £10m, and henceforth 80% of his time, would be devoted to his not-for-profit work. Aged 64, he is returning to frontline British politics using his institute as a platform to promote progressive centrist policy ideas and combat the rise of populism. He categorically denies any plans to create a new political party, but confirmed last weekend that he has fully committed himself to a mission to reverse Brexit. “To leave the European Union is just an extraordinary thing to do,” he says quietly. “It’s a decision to relegate ourselves as a country. It’s like being a top-six Premier League football club, and deciding to play in the Championship from now on.” Can he recall any historical precedent for a nation volunteering to demote itself? “Not in the modern developed world, no. And if you think it’s the most important decision this country has taken in living memory, then even if you think there’s only a small chance of it being changed, if you think that’s the right thing to do, you should be up arguing for it.” Blair is perfectly aware that many, not least on his own side of the argument, consider him so toxic that any intervention on his part can only be counter productive. I’m curious to know if he factored this in before deciding to, as he has put it, “stick my head out the door” and “get a bucket of wotsit poured all over me”. “Of course, there will be some people who refuse, literally refuse, to listen to you because it’s you. But my experience with people most of the time is that, if you’re making a reasonable argument, they’ll listen to you on that argument, even if they disagree on other things. In any event, frankly, if there was a stampede of people getting out there then I’d be very happy to be at the back. But I don’t notice this stampede. I think this is such a serious moment for the country that it’s your obligation to go out and state the argument.” Blair believes it is still possible to prevent us leaving the EU, through a combination of grassroots pressure and parliamentary opposition. His problem, of course, is that, notwithstanding this government defeat on the EU withdrawal bill, his own party refuses to oppose Brexit. “I understand it’s a very pragmatic position that the Labour party’s taking. And I don’t disapprove of pragmatism in politics at all. But I still think it’s the wrong choice. I think what the Labour party is essentially doing is saying: ‘There are a number of Labour voters who voted leave, and if we are painted as the anti-Brexit party, we’re going to lose that support. Therefore, what we should do is say: We’re going to do Brexit, and try to take Brexit out of the equation for our electorate, so they can vote [for us] on other issues.’ I completely get that. It’s a piece of political strategy. It’s actually what a lot of people would advise you to do.” Still the legendary political operator of our time, Blair refers to “strategy” with the kind of objective respect a racehorse breeder might accord to a rival’s thoroughbred. “I totally get it. But I think there are two problems with it. The first is that our language may be different, but we’re actually in the same position as the Tories, which is to say we’ll get out of the single market but we want a close trading relationship with Europe. Your risk is that, at a certain point, you get exposed as having the same technical problem that the Tories have, which is: here’s the Canada option, here’s the Norway option, and every time you move towards Norway you’ll be accepting the rules of the EU, but you’ve lost your say in it, and every time you move towards the Canada option you’re going to be doing economic damage. That’s the essential dilemma of the Tories, which I think will be exposed over time, and Labour’s got that problem, too.” Blair’s second problem with the strategy is that it prevents Labour from making what he calls “an election-winning argument”. Voters, he argues, need to be told that all their concerns about jobs, public services, opportunities for young people and, crucially, the NHS, are correct and legitimate. “But Brexit is not the answer. You can make a huge point of not just the destructive impact of Brexit, but the distractive impact of Brexit, because it’s that distraction that means that this government has no time to deal with the health service. It’s got no time to deal with the problems of poverty. It’s got no time to deal with the problems of inequality. It’s got time to deal with one thing only. The whole country has been pulled into this Tory psychodrama over Europe.” I wonder if Blair might, like many passionate remainers, be underestimating the public ferocity towards politicians who tell them they voted the wrong way in the referendum. “Now of course, you’d have a huge fight. But you’d be fighting from a point of principle. Think of what a galvanising movement you would have in those circumstances, because you would actually be – well, for a start you’d be saying what’s right. That’s quite an important thing to start with. Secondly, I think the impact on the Tories would be really profound, because you’d be driving a wedge right into that Tory division – and the Tories are a profoundly divided party.” Lots of Labour politicians I talk to share this view in theory, but argue that it’s hopeless in practice while the polls fail to indicate any significant shift in public opinion against Brexit. “And I say to them, ‘But what about leadership?’” Many believe the reason the country voted to leave was precisely to defy its political leaders; if they want the public to change its mind, invoking “leadership” is the last way to go about it. Blair rolls his eyes. “Guys, come on! I mean, what the hell are you in politics for? Of course, you’ve got to listen to people, but you’ve also got to lead them. You’ve got to be a bit more robust.” Instead of telling leave voters they were wrong, I suggest, Labour could now have an opportunity to capitalise on Jeremy Corbyn’s own well-documented ambivalence towards Europe. Were Corbyn to say to the country: “I shared many of your misgivings. But having seen the harsh reality of what Brexit really looks like, I’m now convinced we shouldn’t do it,” would that convey both humility as well as leadership? Blair looks surprised, and pauses to consider this. “Yes. I think that’s a really good idea. I think that would be actually quite powerful. I agree, if Jeremy Corbyn was to say, ‘Look, I’ve always been sceptical about Europe, but I’ve now looked at this …’ Yes, that would be powerful.” He pauses again. “But you’ve got to want to do it.” What does he mean? “You’ve got to want people to change their minds. I may be wrong about this, but I think there are elements of the Labour leadership who think that doing Brexit increases their possibility of winning power.” Does he mean they have calculated that it’s a strategic price worth paying for office? “Yes.” Blair is certain this is a miscalculation. “I actually believe stopping Brexit is the route to win power.” But suppose they were right, I say, and supporting Brexit is indeed a strategic necessity for reaching No 10 – arguably not unlike new Labour’s 1997 electoral pledge to abide by Tory spending levels. Would Blair agree it’s a sacrifice worth making to win? “I don’t, actually. No. I think this principle’s too important. I do.” So given a straight choice between stopping Brexit and getting Labour elected, he would choose the former? “I’d like to see a Labour government in power. But I think the key national priority right now is stopping Brexit. I would put it above everything else right now for the country.” The irony of Blair cast as the selfless politician willing to sacrifice power for principle, and Corbyn the power-hungry arch-triangulator, is not lost on either of us. “Yes, there is an irony in it, yes,” he agrees, smiling. “I’ve thought about that, too, and whether it’s me that’s forgetting what it’s like to try and win power.” Labour’s performance at the polls in June caught Blair, along with most New Labourites, by surprise, so I ask what he had failed to see in Corbyn. He smiles again. “I think what he does have is a genuine personal charm. I’ll give him that. You know, when the rightwing media were trying to build him into some sort of demented Marxist, I think his demeanour was of enormous assistance. I pay tribute to that, I genuinely do. I mean, I actually admire that.” But he puts Labour’s success chiefly down to a Tory campaign “more incompetent than any I’ve ever seen ... And I don’t think the same rules will necessarily apply in the next election.” Blair’s faith in the politics of the centre ground remains as ideologically implacable as Corbyn’s faith in socialism. But when the demographic centre of property-owning, middle-income middle classes is collapsing, is the political centre even relevant? “We’re in an era when people want change. I still believe you can mobilise people to vote for a vision of the future rather than two competing visions of the past, one that is this nostalgic nationalism, which is what the Brexit thing amounts to in the end, and the other, these old-style, leftist policies of the 60s. If this is the choice, OK, then people are going to choose between those things. But I still think we’ve got a huge number of people who don’t really want either of those.” Whether Blair can still connect with the centre is unclear to me. His repeated protestations in recent years that he is “never going to be part of the super-rich” are weirdly tin-eared from a man who counts his wealth in multiples of tens of millions. He is also conspicuously uncritical of Donald Trump’s presidency. Trump represents precisely the kind of populism Blair’s institute is dedicated to fighting – and yet, he says, were he still in office, he would have invited Trump to Britain, and would not have withdrawn the invitation following the infamous Britain First retweets. He told Alastair Campbell, in a GQ interview this year: “The left media finds it very hard to be objective on Trump,” and complained that Democrats “just go mental” when he even tries to suggest Trump’s administration could do anything good. Why does Blair find it all but impossible to criticise a US president? “Look, this will not appeal to much of your readership, but I really think it’s really important that America is strong in the world – clear, consistent and predictable with its allies. I always want to protect the relationship, because its important.” But if nothing matters more to Blair than Brexit, presumably it’s even more important than our relationship with the US. What I don’t understand, I say, is why he doesn’t desist from making comments about Corbyn and Trump that will only alienate the very people in Britain he is trying to win over. Telling them they’re wrong about Corbyn, and wrong about Trump, feels like more of his old compulsion to chastise the left. “I’m not telling people they’re wrong about Trump. I’m just saying it’s not a debate I want to get into at this point in time. And there’s no point in me saying: ‘I’ve now decided Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership is fantastic and I think he’s the answer to Britain’s problems’ – because you wouldn’t believe me.” I can’t decide which surprises me more – Blair’s resolve to privilege speaking his mind over strategising, or the impression he conveys of a man restored to peace with himself. The two are almost certainly not unrelated. But I think I detect something else in his air of calm authority. Iraq had always seemed to be almost entirely about him – first as a vehicle for his ego, then as a battleground of his reputation. What makes his campaign against Brexit feel very different, and compelling, is a sense that it has little to do with him, and everything to do with the issue itself. But is it winnable? “I can’t predict it. I’ve given up predicting politics. I used to be really good at it, and then I was not so good at it, and now I think it’s probably inherently unpredictable. So where do you camp in those circumstances? You camp on the ground you believe in.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/gardens-witch-hazel-christmas-tree-john-brookes-exhibition","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T11:00:11Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/gardens-witch-hazel-christmas-tree-john-brookes-exhibition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/gardens-witch-hazel-christmas-tree-john-brookes-exhibition","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Plant this Witch hazel’s spidery blooms may be small, but their scent wakes up your nose when you venture outside in winter.

Usually she caught the black flat cap shark-finning over the top of the allotment fence in time to prepare herself. But today he’d caught her off guard. She sighed. “Afternoon, Jeremy.” The Labour leader’s nose now rested on the surface of the wood, his eyes darting between Trina and her parsnip patch. “My allotment’s bigger than yours.” “What’s that?” “My allotment. It’s bigger than yours now, Trina.” Trina sighed again and returned to her raking. “No, it isn’t, Jeremy. You just moved the fence into my space a bit when I wasn’t looking. Yes, my allotment is now slightly smaller than it used to be, but it is still objectively larger than yours is, Jeremy. Jeremy?” Trina looked up. The cap and eyes were gone. Back at home, he perused his life’s collection of trophies: third place at an egg-and-spoon race, a drooping self-made clay vase from a visit to Stoke-on-Trent, and various ribbon-adorned cups: Year 8 Maths – Most Improved; Clarinet Grade 2 – Pass; Competitive Salsa – Participation. Shedding a proud tear, he moved on to the second shelf: Chess Club – Attendance; Rugby – Most Sick Notes Given; Choir – Loudest. He closed the small glass door on his prizes, it finally reflecting a translucent face – a white-haired watermark against a backdrop of bronze and silver. “A life of triumphs,” he whispered through a smile. “This cabinet believes in me.” Beep beep! His Casio watch. Young Tommy’s Sunday league game! Jeremy had promised his 23-year-old he’d be there to support, and he’d completely forgotten! Quickly (for him), he ran out the door, unlocked his bike, and flew down the road to his car (that tree smacking him in the face along the way). He locked up the cycle and jumped into his motor. London’s Lenin sped his banger down to the local grounds, singing along to his burned CD of Seven Nation Army all the way, screaming “OH, JEREMY CORBYN” at the wrong bit. Arriving well into the second half, he parked up and walked straight past the stands on to the side of the pitch, barging into Tommy’s coach. “Jeremy, we’ve been through this. You’re not supposed to be here. Your place is up there at the back.” “Not any more, it isn’t!” Just then, young Tommy Corbyn sped down the left wing (a position his father insisted on despite the boy’s heavy favouring of his right foot), and nipped past two defenders, before scoring a nifty lob over the keeper. But too late – the final whistle goes. Despite Tommy’s efforts, his side lost three goals to two. Jeremy was elated. “Well done on winning the match, son!” “Not this again, Dad.” “Ah,” smiled the Labour leader proudly, wrapping an arm around his muddy kid, “another glorious victory for the Corbyns.”. • Phil Wang’s show Kinabalu is on tour nationwide until 11 March 2018; philwang.co.uk Want to respond to this piece?

He can’t help his nose","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I recently stumbled across a penetrating article by Latham Hunter, a Canadian professor of cultural studies and communications, entitled: “It’s a holly jolly feminist Christmas – filled with one patriarchal construct after another.” Christmas has become considerably more problematic as a discourse since the publication of the article in 2014. It has long been noted that the personal is political. For Hunter, the seasonal is also political. She points out that carols such as O Come, All Ye Faithful are imprinted with patriarchal stereotypes. She notes that all the Christmas movies have male protagonists – from It’s a Wonderful Life to Home Alone to The Polar Express to Elf. Even secular Christmas songs are problematic and reinforce the dominant paradigm. Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa himself, “a white male who gets all the credit for labour overwhelmingly done by women”. I was shocked when I read this as I had not realised that Santa’s work was done by women. Then, there is much that is groundbreaking in the article. For instance – and this had never occurred to me – it is always “Father” Christmas. My 11-year-old daughter has speculated about a “Mrs” Claus, or “Mary” Christmas, which, as Mr Claus is posited as a cisnormative construction, is understandable. But no such counternarrative exists. “The holiday feminist challenge extends to every Christmas category,” writes Hunter. This is true. The only problem is that she does not go far enough. There are tropes lodged within this celebrational superstructure that escape her gaze. She fails to make any mention of intersectional concerns. Surely reindeer deserve better than being forced to haul an impossibly heavy sleigh full of “gifts” built by forced labour into the polar wastes, rather than remaining in the forgiving tundra to which they are more adapted? As for the stigmatisation of one of the reindeer, Rudolph, for his facial disfigurement, this is both ableist and speciesist. You might argue that these creatures are purely “imaginary”, but this is to fall prey to literalism. The messages generated are the same whatever the nominal status in terms of reality of the groups represented. Likewise, there is a marginalisation of the debate about the “elves” – as they are pejoratively characterised. It is as if, politically, they are invisible. But what are they, essentially? A slave army. A signifier for sweatshops and the exploitation of globalisation. What are they paid? What are their conditions? And what do they do the rest of the year? Mr Claus remains tight-lipped. Why? Can it have anything to do with the huge oil deposits discovered under the ice and the need for cheap labour to extract it? I thank Professor Hunter for perspectivising this latest example of an implicit power structure and a concomitant system of retrogressive ideologies that have been in place for far too long. I, too, am tired of “Santa” and the way this dominant paradigm is reinforced. I am weary of the Christmas “cracker” – obviously phallocentric as surely as the Christmas wreath represents the male projection of the vagina, evergreen and indiscriminately welcoming. I am tired of the injunctions of “goodwill to all men”, disgusted by the uniform whiteness of snow, repelled by the farce of that flagrant invitation to sexual abuse, the mistletoe sprig. Together, men and women can and must do better. Together, we can end Christmas in its current form once and for all. In the end, we have nothing to lose but our paperchains, our archaic and regressive preconceptions and, of course, our minds. And I feel that on this issue Professor Hunter is, once again, well ahead of the rest of us. @timlottwriter.wordpress.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/shortcuts/2017/dec/17/its-a-bad-look-are-you-suffering-from-selfitis","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T15:00:33Z","webTitle":"It's a bad look: are you suffering from selfitis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2017/dec/17/its-a-bad-look-are-you-suffering-from-selfitis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/shortcuts/2017/dec/17/its-a-bad-look-are-you-suffering-from-selfitis","fields":{"headline":"It's a bad look: are you suffering from selfitis?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Selfitis. Age: Three years old. Appearance: Chin up, lips out, zero attention span. This sounds like it might be an illness. Correct, it absolutely is. A joint study by Nottingham Trent University and Thiagarajar School of Management has proved it beyond all doubt. But what is it? A condition that causes people to post too many selfies on the internet. I mean, that hardly sounds like cholera. But it might be just as dangerous. Did you know that 36 people have genuinely died from taking selfies this year alone? Some fell in rivers and drowned, others were hit by trains. One was trampled by an elephant. What does that have to do with selfitis? Maybe if these people had spent less time taking selfies and more time looking around for rampaging elephants, they would still be with us. Now I’m scared. Give it to me straight: do I have selfitis? I’m pleased you asked. The study has developed the Selfitis Behaviour Scale to help diagnose those who think they might suffer from selfitis. All you have to do is assign the following statements with a value between one and five. OK, shoot. “I feel more popular when I post my selfies on social media.” Five. “By posting selfies, I expect my friends to appraise me.” Five. “When I don’t take selfies, I feel detached from my peer group.” “Taking different selfie poses helps increase my social status.” “I use photo-editing tools to enhance my selfie to look better than others.” Five five five. Oh boy, sounds like you might just be a chronic case. What does that mean? According to the research, it means that you’re likely to balance low self-confidence with obsessive attention-seeking, and you hope that by compulsively detailing the minutiae of your life online, you will somehow feel like part of a larger group that doesn’t necessarily exist. Well duh. Yeah, I know, me too. Is there any treatment available? Not yet, but I suppose we could just put our phones down for a second and experience the real world in the moment. Ha, no, just kidding. Do say: “I can’t come to work today. As you can see on Instagram, I’m suffering from a nasty bout of selfitis.” Don’t say: “Finally, proof that anyone who owns a selfie stick is unwell.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/15/magnus-carlsen-london-classic-grand-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T13:01:59Z","webTitle":"Magnus Carlsen under the weather and out of sorts at London Classic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/15/magnus-carlsen-london-classic-grand-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/15/magnus-carlsen-london-classic-grand-tour","fields":{"headline":"Magnus Carlsen under the weather and out of sorts at London Classic","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Magnus Carlsen won only twice in nine games, and survived several perilous moments, at this week’s London Classic. He even suffered an embarrassing defeat in the puzzle diagram, but Norway’s world champion still came away with the four-event Grand Tour trophy and £245,000 in prize money. Carlsen dominates global chess in its faster forms, half-hour rapid and 10-minute blitz. Nowadays, though, something often goes wrong in classical slow tournaments, the arena where historic champions like José Raúl Capablanca, Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov strutted their stuff with only a few setbacks. Carlsen failed to finish first in any of his five classical all-play-alls in 2017, and a few weeks ago was eliminated in an early round of the World Cup knockout. The 27-year-old had a heavy cold at the Classic, complained of a lack of energy, and technically made a couple of strange opening choices which could be considered a waste of the white pieces. His 1 f4, Bird’s Opening, against the England No1, Michael Adams, was a prelude to an offbeat piece formation known as the Polar Bear, while against Ian Nepomniachtchi the game began 1 Nf3 c5 2 c3. Carlsen stood worse against Adams and was even closer to defeat against Hikaru Nakamura. His best performance was defeating Levon Aronian in the final round, but there, too, the Armenian had an edge for many moves. Other world champions have had rocky patches during their careers, but it is worse for someone whose name is often placed alongside Fischer and Kasparov as the all-time No1. Carlsen’s rating of 2834 points is 55 below his 2014 peak, although he has still no clear-cut leading rival. Fabiano Caruana, who won the Classic on tie-break, and Aronian, the most successful tournament player of 2017, are the favourites to win the 2018 Candidates at Berlin in March and so qualify to meet Carlsen over 12 games at London in November. Despite Carlsen’s recent lapses, he would still be expected to defeat either of them. His strength in rapid and blitz is a big asset, given that the classical games can easily end 6-6, leading to speed tie-breaks. Next up for the GM elite are the world rapid and blitz championships, to be played in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, starting 26 December. The venue is controversial, even though it is claimed that Israeli entrants will be granted visas. A record prize fund, $1.5m for the two men’s competitions and $500,000 for the women, has attracted a strong field led by Carlsen. Meanwhile the No1 woman player, Hou Yifan, is in the news for quite a different reason. The Beijing 23-year-old is one of four Chinese students awarded Rhodes scholarships at Oxford, starting in autumn 2018. There were 12,000 applicants worldwide, and the Chinese quartet were selected mainly on academic performance. Hou will study for an MSc in education. The Oxford v Cambridge match, launched in 1873 and the oldest annual fixture in chess, should be interesting in March 2019. The Russian championship, also played this week, was won by Peter Svidler for a record eighth time. It produced some entertaining games including this Grunfeld Defence, which is sharp but level until White’s 18 Ng5? (18 a3). Errors on both sides (19...Bh6! 20 Nf3! and 21...Bxd5! are better than the moves played) set up the final blunder 22 Qe1?? (22 Qd3! leads to a draw) which allows a forced mate and a queen sacrifice.

While the first report of a male Japanese macaque, or snow monkey, and female sika deer taking to each other was revealed earlier this year, scientists say they are now confident the behaviour is sexual after scrutinising adolescent females suggestively interacting with stags at Minoo in Japan. “The monkey-deer sexual interactions reported in our paper may reflect the early stage development of a new behavioural tradition at Minoo,” said Dr Noëlle Gunst-Leca, co-author of the study from the University of Lethbridge in Canada. While sexual interactions between closely related species have been seen for all manner of animals, from various species of fish to species of baboon, such liaisons are rare, with the sexual assault of king penguins by Antarctic fur seals the only other known example between distant species. But earlier this year, a study revealed a male Japanese macaque had been filmed mounting a female Sika deer at Yakushima island in southern Japan. Gunst-Leca said it wasn’t clear quite what was going on. “They were dealing with a single anecdotal event between one individual monkey and one individual deer, and the description they provided was short, vague and out of context,” she said. “As a result, even the sexual nature of this interaction was not clearly demonstrated.” In the latest study, published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, Gunst-Leca and colleagues describe how they sought to unpick whether the intentions were indeed carnal. To investigate, the team recorded the behaviour of snow monkeys at Minoo, north of Osaka in Japan. With only adolescent female monkeys spotted mounting deer, the team compared the interactions to sexual interactions between adolescent female monkeys. The latter is a well known practice, and the only available comparison, as during the study adolescent females were not seen performing sexual mounts on adult male monkeys. In total, the team recorded 12 successful interactions between monkeys, involving six adolescent females, between November 2012 and January 2013 – with a total of 67 mounts by the monkeys. In addition, 13 successful interactions of an apparently sexual nature were recorded between monkeys and deer between early November 2014 and January 2015, involving five adolescent females and a total of 258 mounts. Analysis of the animals’ behaviour revealed no clear difference between the adolescent female snow monkeys and other females or deer when it came to how often they sought such attentions, mounted their partner, how long they spent on their partner, or even their orientation – although as expected monkeys more often undertook sitting mounts on deer than on other monkeys. Unexpectedly, pelvic thrusting was more common when the partner was a deer. With no monkey-deer sexual interactions previously having been noticed at Minoo, the team say that the behaviour could be the start of a new custom, adding that adolescent females would watch others on the backs of the deer and try to take their place. Dr Cédric Sueur of the University of Strasbourg, a co-author of the study released earlier this year, said the monkey-deer liaisons might be a nascent relationship. “It is maybe a new/innovative behaviour that can be socially transmitted and will spread,” he said. “Monkeys do this according to the sex ratio at the reproductive season: if females cannot have access to males, they can have homosexual relations or relations with a deer.” The team also found that the adolescent females emitted high pitched calls at the deer when gazing at them, and threw tantrums – including body spasms and screams – if the deer walked away, as they do when engaged in sexual interactions with other monkeys. The successful sexual interactions observed involved a male deer, with the majority involving an adult male: two female deer and three young males courted by the monkeys simply reared up, unseating them. “Also, heterospecific mounts between Japanese macaques and sika deer have not been observed outside their coinciding mating seasons,” said Gunst-Leca. While it is unclear why the animals would engage in such behaviour, Gunst-Leca said there were several possibilities, including adolescent females practising for sex with other monkeys, that it offers females a safer way of engaging in sexual behaviour than hooking up with aggressive male monkeys, or that adolescent females are often rejected by adult male monkeys, leaving them at a loss for partners of their own species. Since snow monkeys have also been spotted riding sika deer with no clear sexual agenda – the animals are often found at the same sites since the deer eat food left by monkeys as they forage – it is also possible that adolescent females have developed a taste for the genital stimulation, Gunst-Leca added “Future observations at this site will indicate whether this group-specific sexual oddity was a short-lived fad or the beginning of a culturally-maintained phenomenon,” the authors note."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/17/pinocchio-review-unsettling-touching-christmas-fable-national-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T07:55:25Z","webTitle":"Pinocchio review – a familiar fable is brought to captivating life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/17/pinocchio-review-unsettling-touching-christmas-fable-national-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/17/pinocchio-review-unsettling-touching-christmas-fable-national-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Pinocchio review – a familiar fable is brought to captivating life","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is easy to draw up a list of items that make Pinocchio, the National’s Christmas show, beguiling. An unexpected levitation. Invisibly wired flying. The star that dances down to flick across the stage as a guardian angel. The grinning gob of the whale that floats on and swallows up key members of the cast. Oh, and as well as a witty script by Dennis Kelly there is Martin Lowe’s score, which expands and sometimes folklorically rearranges songs from the Disney movie. Still, what really makes John Tiffany’s production distinguished is a tilting of emphasis. Suddenly, this story seems tailor-made for the stage. Of course, the telescopic proboscis is a high point – Pinocchio’s nose is a terrific shooting broomstick – as is the anti-wooden heart sentiment: When You Wish Upon a Star still soups its way to the tear ducts. But the centre of it all is the Frankenstein/Pygmalion moment of the inert coming to life. It’s an idea skilfully, unsettlingly played with throughout the evening. Pinocchio wants to be “real” (don’t we all?) – but who’s to know who is pastiche, fake, authentic? Brilliantly, Geppetto the puppetmaker is himself a gigantic puppet (his puppeteers huddle inside him like refugees). Meanwhile, his creation, Pinocchio (sprightly Joe Idris-Roberts), slowly unbends from the wooden block in which he is carved, not as a mannequin but a human. Flesh and fabric, original and imitation are beautifully, disconcertingly entangled. This familiar fable has an unexpectedly long reach. There is no question about the reality of the talent of Audrey Brisson, joint puppeteer and voice of Jiminy Cricket. Brisson has been captivating before – particularly in The Flying Lovers of Vitebsk. Now she reaches into another dimension. Her voice and sweet-clown demeanour are perfect for Pinocchio’s conscience. But she is also a crotchety cricket (really cross when called a beetle) who is obsessed with bacteria: suddenly Brisson is not only adorable but annoying.

You know that’s what you get when you start nursing. It’s not the end of the world. In the neonatal unit where I work now, you see parents under the worst stress of their lives. There are babies born at 26 weeks, some of them earlier, and they’re ventilated. Parents are never sure if their baby’s going to get home. We do get some babies that die and a few that have long term complications, but on the whole, there isn’t much sadness. I enjoy watching the journey of parents whose babies are born three months early, and who eventually get to return home with their little one. On the children’s and neonatal wards, there is less sadness than in A&amp;E, say – or on wards for people with life-limiting conditions or dementia. You try and make Christmas a big family event; siblings and grandparents come in. You do have to be mindful of the fact that some people don’t want that, though, like the parents who may have recently lost a twin, or whose baby is critically ill and who have to spend their child’s first Christmas in hospital. Not everybody wants a jolly, happy Christmas, so you just have to bear everybody’s needs in mind. One Christmas some years ago, I was working on a children’s ward. One of my patients was a baby who was a few weeks old. The baby had been born prematurely and gone home, but had then returned to hospital with a chest infection – a common occurrence with premature births. The father had confided in the team on duty that he had originally planned to propose to his partner, the mother of the baby, on Christmas Day. The baby wasn’t due until after new year and he had thought about getting up on Christmas morning and opening presents, one of which would contain an engagement ring. That was out of the window now, he said. It was a stressful time for the pair. Not only were they worrying about their baby and whether it was going to get better, they had the added worry of having Christmas dinner all planned and relatives coming, all of which was now cancelled. Despite all this, the father decided he was going to go ahead and propose. The baby was in a separate room where the mother had stayed overnight. He had gone home and when he came in in the morning, his partner went for a shower. He put the engagement ring in the baby’s cot with a note that read “Please will you marry my daddy?” The team on duty were in on the secret. We all knew it was going to happen at some point, but we also knew there had to be peace and quiet, and that we couldn’t hang around too much. There was a feeling that this was going to be a nice day, but nobody knew anything about it apart from the father (and us). I don’t know what went on between the two of them inside the room when she saw the ring, but I did hear lots of shrieking, yelling and tears. His now fiancee came out of the room and said: “Look, look! Look what I’ve got!” There were tears all round. Other parents picked up what was going on, and it was a happy morning. It’s awful that children have to spend Christmas in hospital – there are those with long-term conditions, for example, who have to be in there for a few weeks. But the Christmas Day proposal was brilliant. It lifted the mood for the day. It made me think that nice things do happen in the world.

In the mountains of North Carolina, workers at Hart-T-Tree farm in Grassy Creek say they had their wages stolen, were exposed to hazardous chemicals, and lived in constant fear of injury on the job. They also say they faced intimidating bosses pushing them to work harder in order to meet the holiday demands. So they decided to organize to fight for their rights as members of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee – and won a $350,000 wage theft settlement against their employer. The company acknowledged that mistakes were made and said they were being addressed. “We want to make it clear that we care about our workers and their safety has always been important to us,” a spokesman said. The workers’ story is an inspiring one that is likely to encourage others in the industry. However, scared by their organizing efforts of more than 10,000 unionized farm workers in North Carolina, Republicans in the North Carolina general assembly are attempting to making it more difficult for farm workers to unionize; putting the gains of workers in the mountains of North Carolina at risk. Christmas tree work begins in March when workers begin planting trees. Workers there say while they were planting trees, the farm owner was simultaneously spraying toxic chemicals such as Dimethoate 400, a toxic herbicide used to kill mites and aphids. Chemical guidelines stipulate that farmers should wait for up to 10 days after spraying Dimethoate 400 before they let workers enter the fields. However, workers claim the owners of Hart-T-Tree farm made them keep planting only 50 to 100 yards away from where the chemicals were being dispersed. Workers say they immediately began to get sick. “The chemical made us have headaches, dizziness, vomit and diarrhea. They were awful,” said one worker, “Carlos”, who wished not to reveal his true name for fear of retaliation. Workers who say they were forced to work under chemical exposure claim they were rarely given breaks to drink water and were forced to work 12 hours a day in sweltering heat. “The people buying Christmas trees should know that it’s not easy to go out there in the heat when they don’t let you drink water,” said Carlos. “A few white people came here to work and they couldn’t take it. This is work being done entirely by Mexicans.” Workers at the Hart-T-Tree also say they faced consistent pressure and abuse to work quicker. “The grower was always right behind us, pressuring and criticizing your work,” said “Alejandro”, who also wished to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. “They would yell at you constantly. Many people quit.” As the holiday season approaches and it comes time to cut down the trees, the workers say that this pressure grows even heavier, leading to injuries as they chop trees that can weigh 200lb. Instead of transporting the workers to the job site in trucks, which were available on Hart-T-Tree farm, workers say the owners forced them to ride on the top of a tractor bed full of trees being transported down winding mountain roads. Workers complain that during the rides, the trees would routinely shift, throwing many of the workers off the tractor, leading to fractured arms and bruised ribs. Despite the injuries suffered by the workers, they say that they feared reporting the injuries to their supervisor. “If somebody reports to the supervisor what happened, the supervisor won’t pay attention to them and then later say it’s not convenient to have that worker there any more,” said “Jimenia”, who also wished to remain anonymous. Finally, this fall, workers at Hart-T-Tree farm acted after the company began deducting the cost of rent, electricity and gas from their pay. Under federal law, employers must provide the cost of room and board to those employed under the H-2A guest worker program. The workers contacted Legal Aid to see if they could get their paycheck deductions back. Legal Aid put them in touch with the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (Floc), which through an agreement with the North Carolina Growers Association (NCGA) and other groups represents more than 10,000 H-2A guest workers in North Carolina. While meeting with Floc, workers discovered that some workers were making as little as $9 an hour while the collective bargaining agreement between Floc and NCGA set a minimum wage of $11.27 an hour for all farm workers. With the help of the union, the workers decided to file a legal grievance. In late September, Hart-T-Tree settled and agreed to pay a combined $330,000 in back wages to 54 workers. “A settlement of this nature being reached and paid out in a matter of a few weeks is unheard of in agriculture,” said Justin Flores, vice-president of Floc. “Workers without a union agreement would have been waiting at least a year and at worst three or more years to reach such a settlement.” A spokesman for Hart-T-Tree said: “Some mistakes were made in the past that were unfortunate and we are very pleased to have been able to work with Justin Flores from Floc to get all of these issues resolved in a proper way and be in full compliance with the law. “We are appreciative and grateful to the many men and women who have worked with us on our farm. We could not farm without them and we are grateful to Floc for helping improve our communication with these hard-working men and women.” Following Floc’s success, Republican legislators in North Carolina passed a law that makes it illegal for the union to automatically deduct union dues from workers paychecks, forcing the union to collect dues by hand from workers each month. Despite the new law, farm workers in the Christmas tree fields say they intend to keep fighting. “We gotta organize, this is the hardest work out there,” said Carlos. “We’re human beings too.” This article was updated on 18 December 2017 to correct the spelling and location of Grassy Creek, North Carolina."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/dec/18/how-fire-caught-on-and-unicorns-took-off-2017s-book-trends","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T16:35:22Z","webTitle":"How fire caught on and unicorns took off: 2017's book trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/18/how-fire-caught-on-and-unicorns-took-off-2017s-book-trends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/18/how-fire-caught-on-and-unicorns-took-off-2017s-book-trends","fields":{"headline":"How fire caught on and unicorns took off: 2017's book trends","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hygge died a snuggly, comfy death Like the light of a cosy candle in a Scandinavian winter, the much-marketed concept of hygge flickered out of popularity this year. Was it replaced by lagom, the Swedish concept of living with just enough, as this Elle article predicted? Well, there are certainly a host of lagom-focused titles out there, in appealingly muted jackets, but we’re told that the next “breaking lifestyle trend” will be the Scottish concept of coorie or còsagach in old Gaelic, which means snug or cosy. Gabriella Bennett’s The Book of Coorie is out next autumn, and “explores Scottishness and coorie through homes and interiors, the way we live, traditions, and what makes us feel good”. Humour died, too – but unicorns are alive and well This festive season, we’re not finding ourselves particularly tickled by the Ladybird and Famous Five pastiches that have done so well in recent years, with neither making bestseller charts this week. Instead, the “giftier” titles picking up sales in the lead-up to Christmas include two unicorn books – the Where’s Wally-esque Where’s the Unicorn? (“Follow a colourful blessing of globetrotting unicorns as they gallop around the world on an incredible whistle-stop tour”), and, hitting trend after trend on the nose, the unicorn colouring book, Keep Calm and Colour Unicorns (“There’s nothing like a unicorn to give life some colour”). We returned to nature... Exemplified by Robert Macfarlane’s The Lost Words, Peter Wohlleben’s The Hidden Life of Trees and Rosamund Young’s The Secret Life of Cows, 2017 saw readers celebrate the wonders and mysteries of the natural world. All three titles were hugely popular, along with … Supernatural thrills Domestic suspense – those tales of creepy goings-on in the home a la Before I Go to Sleep and The Girl on the Train – was still going strong in 2017, but the paranormal has started to creep in as 2018 looms, led by Sarah Pinborough’s smash hit Behind Her Eyes. Faceless women are out, goldeneyes are in Amazon.com has spotted a few trends in book cover art this year, all of which are decided improvements on the faceless woman obsession of a few years back. There have been a spate of flame-backed jackets, including David Lagercrantz’s latest Lisbeth Salander thriller, The Girl Who Takes An Eye for An Eye, and Anita Shreve’s The Stars Are Fire. Then there’s the “misty blue and bold hand lettering” seen on George Saunders’s Booker winner Lincoln in the Bardo, a look that took off this year, as did the use of painted typography, seen on the likes of John Green’s Turtles All the Way Down. Amazon also spotted a trend it’s calling “goldeneyes”: an image of an unsmiling face, obscured by the book’s title. Serial killers love playing cards As identified (by me) in the Bookseller, there were three thrillers out, in November alone, in which a serial killer left a playing card on their victim’s body, in order (we assume) to tantalise the detective with whom they are in a cat-and-mouse situation: James Patterson’s Murder Games, PJ Tracy’s Nothing Stays Buried, and Elly Griffiths’ The Blood Card. Snap! Medical insiders revealed the best – and worst – of healthcare Adam Kay’s diaries of a junior doctor, This Is Going to Hurt, was named book of the year by the British public – but we’ve also seen fellow junior doctor Rachel Clarke’s Your Life in My Hands, ambulance driver Kit Wharton’s Emergency Admissions, and heart surgeon Stephen Westaby’s Fragile Lives. At least we all know how to make fires now And in tune with the bleak state of news in 2017, writing about surviving in the wild had a good year. Books on fire-making lit a spark among readers: author Sally Coulthard says that her The Little Book of Building Fires sold out its first run in just three weeks. Then there was Daniel Hume’s The Art of Fire and Paul Heiney’s Playing With Fire, as well as Bear Grylls’s How to Stay Alive (a “survival guide for any situation”), David Scarfe’s The Wild Book (“outdoor activities to unleash your inner child”) and Daniel Beard’s Do It Yourself Bushcraft. Whether this is due to the threat of impending nuclear war or the surprise success of Lars Mytting’s guide to chopping and stacking wood, Norwegian Wood in 2015, it’s hard to say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/15/first-vulnerable-child-refugee-arrives-uk-greece-dubs-amendment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T14:31:05Z","webTitle":"First vulnerable child refugee arrives in UK from Greece under Dubs scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/15/first-vulnerable-child-refugee-arrives-uk-greece-dubs-amendment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/15/first-vulnerable-child-refugee-arrives-uk-greece-dubs-amendment","fields":{"headline":"First vulnerable child refugee arrives in UK from Greece under Dubs scheme","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first vulnerable child refugee stranded in Greece who qualifies for sanctuary under the Dubs amendment has arrived in the UK, more than a year after the government pledged to bring over hundreds of children. The Home Office had accepted that the boy was vulnerable and eligible for transfer 16 months ago. The Dubs amendment, part of the 2016 Immigration Act, was passed after a campaign to transfer 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees stuck in camps to Britain. There are more than 3,300 unaccompanied children in Greece, 11,186 in France and 13,867 in Italy. The Home Office agreed to resettle 480 under the Dubs scheme. Conditions for lone children in Greece have been condemned by Human Rights Watch, which found filthy cells infested with bugs and vermin, sometimes without mattresses or access to showers. Hammersmith and Fulham council in west London has stepped in to offer the boy a home and one of its social workers travelled to Greece to assess the child, who has lost contact with his family in Syria. The boy, who is said to be deeply traumatised, was detained until last month in a police cell with no access to medical professionals, and forced to sleep on an inch-thick mattress on the ground. Police said the boy had repeatedly self-harmed, tried to kill himself and was at “imminent risk” of doing this. According to Antonia Moustaka, a lawyer for the humanitarian agency Praksis, he spent more than 380 days in psychiatric clinics, 124 days in shelters for unaccompanied minors and six weeks in police detention. The boy has been taken to a flat in Hammersmith provided by the local authority and will receive 24-hour care. Council officials will begin the process of assessing his long-term needs. A social worker was permitted to meet and accompany him through the airport when he landed on Friday morning. A council spokesman said he appeared well but anxious. “We have a Greek-speaking mental health specialist social worker with him who worked with him in Greece,” he said. The council is already accommodating and supporting 13 Dubs children from France. George Gabriel, the project lead at the charity Safe Passage, said: “There are more than 3,300 unaccompanied children in Greece and only 1,130 spaces in shelters. The winter is bitterly cold and conditions are getting worse. “Over a year and a half ago, the Dubs amendment brought hope that hundreds of these kids would be brought to safety. It has been appalling to watch these minors wait, month after month, on bureaucratic delays.” Hammersmith and Fulham council’s leader, Steve Cowan, said: “We worked closely with Safe Passage, who alerted us to this case. This child has a legal right to come to Britain and deserves so much more.” Josie Naughton of the charity Help Refugees said: “While we are thrilled to hear of this child being brought to safety, we are heartbroken at how long it has taken. One child in two years is unacceptable under any circumstances.’ Naughton said Help Refugees, Safe Passage and the Refugee Rights Data Project had written a joint letter to the home secretary demanding the immediate identification, assessment and transfer of child refugees under the Dubs amendment, to meet the government’s target of 480. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act. We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely. “Our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region, which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region – almost 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the UK – and the government has pledged £2.46bn to the humanitarian response to the Syria conflict.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/sushi-atelier-its-impressive-without-being-neurotic-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Sushi Atelier: ‘Impressive without being neurotic’ – restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/sushi-atelier-its-impressive-without-being-neurotic-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/sushi-atelier-its-impressive-without-being-neurotic-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Sushi Atelier: ‘It’s impressive without being neurotic’ – restaurant review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sushi Atelier, 114 Great Portland Street, London W1W 6PH (020 7636 4455). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £70-£110 Good restaurants make us think better of ourselves. They create a mood and then, by granting us a seat, co-opt us into it. Sushi Atelier, on London’s Great Portland Street, makes me feel like a better person. It makes me feel refined and precise, organised and knowing. In reality, perched on one of their stools at their blond-wood counter, I am still the shambolic bundle of appetites and desires I have always been. I am still all sag and so much muffin top I’m practically the whole cake counter of a branch of Costa. But here, I feel taut and focussed. It’s an achievement for a restaurant flogging raw fish and rice. I was optimistic about Sushi Atelier from the start. It’s run by the people behind Chisou in Mayfair and Knightsbridge. For years the two branches have been my answer to requests for a reliable Japanese place covering all the bases. Are they the very best in London? No, not quite. Umu is better, but it’s also three times more expensive. At Umu you also have to sit next to people who have self-tanned themselves orange; the sort of people who buy Swarovski Crystal-encrusted iPhone cases to go with their elective enemas because they’ve run out of things to spend money on. At Umu they play mellow beats on the sound system, which makes me want to kill people. At Sushi Atelier there are no mellow beats, just something lyrical involving pianos that sounds like the sea coming in and going out again. It’s full of people who happen to like quality Japanese food and reckon this is it. They are right. There’s a curious thing that occurs more with Japanese food than almost any other culture’s cooking: at the top end, discerning the ethereal from the brilliant from the merely great becomes harder and harder. We all know what truly crap sushi is. We know about chilled pucks of sushi rice from the bottom of a motorway service station counter which are a Heimlich manoeuvre just waiting to happen. We all know about dead lozenges of fish which are about as fresh as the socks of a reality TV star two weeks into their stint on I’m a Celebrity… The further up the graph of quality you go, however, the shallower the curve becomes. It’s the culinary equivalent of listening for the very highest of frequencies, until you get to the kind of restaurant where there’s space for only four of you at the sushi master’s counter and the only way you can tell it’s better than the other place is because dinner costs £300 a head. Spending the stupid money makes schmucks feel better about themselves. Sushi Atelier takes all the anxiety out of the search for quality Japanese cooking. It’s impressive without being neurotic. The menu is slightly more diverse than that at a hardcore sushi shop, but only just: there are pork gyoza, in silken dumpling cases that are practically translucent, served warm enough to steam gently. They sear slices of sweet scallop until the sugars just catch, but they are still pearly inside. Then they lie them on a bed of green sauce punched up with ponzu alongside some asparagus (which I want to pretend aren’t there, because they shouldn’t have been at this time of year). The kitchen enjoys sparking up the blow torch now and then. But their interests lie more with the raw than the cooked. There are three fish tartares, piled up along a sturdy piece of Japanese ceramic. Tuna has been dressed with soy-marinated wasabi, so that a kick of horseradish heat comes in right at the end. A mixture of diced sea bass and butterfish, the bright white of new piano keys, bursts with crisp, green chilli; there is salmon, splashed with yuzu, soy and sesame oil. A salad of various dressed seaweeds, which tastes like you imagine Ben Ainslie smells after three laps around a choppy bay, comes with ribbons of pickled cucumber, to lift it from the salty depths. An oblong of tuna is seared on all surfaces, then sliced and served under a sweet-sour chilli ponzu jelly, the colour of polished amber. If anybody ever tells you jelly is for babies, bring them here and feed them this. It is strident and grown up. If life were fair you’d be able to get in a bath of this with a friend. And then on to the sushi. Pay attention to the rice. It is still just warm. It is only very lightly vinagered. You can pick out individual grains with the tip of a chopstick. It’s not what I’d call a great spectator sport, but at least it’s a mark that everything is as it should be. In any case there are other things to watch. There is the dip and weave and furrowed brow of the men behind the counter. We have a spicy salmon roll, made by a broad-shouldered Japanese chap who looks like he could help give your car a bump start, but who does extraordinarily delicate things with his fingertips. The roll is marked by the freshness of the toasted seaweed, which cracks beneath our teeth, as we bite through the layers. When it comes to the nigiri there are bursts of that blow torch, which makes the fish oils run. There are brushes with different soy-based sauces. Tiny dollops of seaweed paste are dropped into place. Crevices are dribbled with chilli oil. It is all beautiful: the sea bass and the salmon, the sweet prawn and the sticky glazed eel with its seaweed life belt to keep it in place. Best of all there is sea urchin, the colour of caramel, and the taste of the carnal. That’s not a clever piece of imagery. It’s a literal use of language. If it doesn’t mean anything to you I’m just so sorry. For you. We drink a soft, warming sake. In the traditional style, it is poured until it overflows from the glass into the “masu”, the square wooden box it sits in, as a mark of the restaurant’s generosity. And while I wouldn’t suggest they are giving it away, I would argue there is value here. This time last year, I reviewed the Italian restaurant Veneta which I tried to like but couldn’t quite. As we reported recently it closed two days ago. I suspect Sushi Atelier will be here for a long time to come, which is great. I’m always in need of a restaurant that makes me feel like a better person than I really am. Jay’s news bites Jason Atherton startled many when he opened Sosharu in London’s Clerkenwell last year. There had always been Japanese elements to his cooking, but this was the whole deal. And very good it is, too, if a little spendy. There’s a brilliant tartare of scallops, stuffed, glazed and grilled chicken wings, and pork belly in a tonkotsu stock. Beguiling (sosharulondon.com). For those concerned that the biggest challenge to the restaurant industry comes from diners ordering restaurant food to be eaten at home, there’s new evidence. Online food delivery business Just Eat, has announced that Saturday 2 December was their first ever 500,000 order day in the UK. It was the day of the X Factor live final. A wise and insightful restaurant critic suggested earlier this year that there should be a branch of the Indian street food and craft beer restaurant Bundobust in every northern town. And here they come: Liverpool for 2018 with two more in the north for 2019 (bundobust.com).

It was mint-green and it wobbled. Oh God, I thought to myself, this is what happens when you meet people off the internet; you go home with them thinking they’re perfectly normal and then it turns out they breed tarantulas or they’re gluten-free or freakishly fond of slime and masochism. I held my misgivings at bay and asked, calmly, “Is that slime?” Yes. It was. But there was a very wholesome explanation for it: the small child next door had kindly given her the home-made slime as a gift. Slime, apparently, was very popular with kids these days. Hah, I sneered, that’s clearly a weird American thing – back home in the UK all the kids are into grime. Anyway, that was in May and I haven’t thought about slime since. Until just now that is, when I realised my girlfriend had been right and I’d been wrong (not for the first time). Slime isn’t just a weird American thing; it’s a global phenomenon. Indeed, according to Google’s recently released The Year in Search, “How to make slime?” was the top trending “how to” question around the world in 2017. Comment faire du slime? Hur gör man slime? Cómo hacer slime? From Mexico to Malmö to Milton Keynes, people really wanted to know how to sculpt slime. And in Australia, bless them for going the extra mile, they wanted to know how to make fluffy slime. Slime wasn’t all that was on our minds. People wanted to know how to do a whole gamut of things in 2017. As Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google tweeted: “This year we searched ‘how’ more than ever before. The questions we asked show our desire to understand, and ultimately improve the world around us.” In the UK, for example, the top questions we asked included: “How to lose belly fat fast”, “How to make Yorkshire pudding”, and “How to watch Mayweather vs McGregor”. Because nothing says “improving the world” like watching two men beat each other to a bloody pulp while munching on Yorkshire puds and worrying about your muffin top. Enough with the hows, however. Let’s get on to the whos, whats, wheres, whens, and whys. What insights about the state of the world (apart from the fact that we’re all doomed) can we derive from a year of global Googling? Here’s my own list of 2017’s most surprising search results. The Russians hacked our stomachs We’ve heard a lot this year about Russian meddling in the 2016 US election and Brexit vote. The improbable idea that a major world power would interfere in another country’s democratic process has shocked a great number of people. But while everyone was distracted by headlines about secret meetings with Kremlin officials and state-sponsored hacking, I think we all missed the real story. Which was beef stroganoff. According to Google, beef stroganoff was the No 1 trending recipe in America and No 4 in the UK. Stroganoff, of course, is a Russian dish, supposedly named after the 18th-century count Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov. You might think it fanciful to link a sudden taste for stroganoff to recent Russian geopolitical power plays but let me remind you that the way to a nation’s heartland is through its stomach. Food for thought anyway. Levels of waterboarding knowledge rose considerably The seventh-top trending “what is?” search in the UK, sandwiched between “What is a general election?” and “What is the DUP?” was “What is waterboarding?” So, FYI, you might want to avoid arguments with your neighbours about politics. Who knows what they have been looking up online? Britain has a poor appetite for patriotism Speaking of food, I think it rather sad that Brexit hasn’t had much of an impact on the great British kitchen. The Top 10 trending recipes in the UK in 2017 were overwhelmingly foreign. As well as the stroganoff these recipes included chilli con carne (foreigne), spaghetti bolognese (foreignese), Beef bourguignon (foreignon), and Dauphinoise potatoes (foreignoise). The lone English dish in the top five was hot cross buns. Bitcoin regrets abound Not to be one of those bores who goes on about how they were into cryptocurrency before it was cool, but I liked bitcoin before it got popular. Unfortunately, I didn’t buy any. If I had I’d be writing this on a yacht eating stroganoff with a silver spoon and waterboarding peasants for sport. It seems I’m not the only one wishing they had got involved with the bitcoin boom. “How to buy bitcoin” was the second-top trending “how to” in the UK, and the third-top trending globally. Fast forward a year, after the bitcoin bubble inevitably bursts, and you can expect Google’s 2018 top trending searches to include: “How do I tell my partner that I remortgaged the house to buy bitcoin and our only remaining asset is a stockpile of home-made slime?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/27/how-did-half-of-the-great-florida-coral-reef-system-disappear-climate-bleaching","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T10:30:15Z","webTitle":"How did half of the great Florida coral reef system disappear?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/27/how-did-half-of-the-great-florida-coral-reef-system-disappear-climate-bleaching","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/27/how-did-half-of-the-great-florida-coral-reef-system-disappear-climate-bleaching","fields":{"headline":"How did half of the great Florida coral reef system disappear?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The great Florida coral reef system stretches hundreds of miles down the eastern seaboard of the US. It is the world’s third largest, and nearly 1,400 species of plants and animals and 500 species of fish have been recorded there. But last year marine scientists found nearly half the reef was missing. They took the latest satellite images, compared them with precisely drawn 250-year-old British admiralty charts and found them nearly identical. But where the historic charts showed there had been extensive coral reefs close to the shore in the 1760s, the satellite maps revealed just sea grasses and mud. Only those reefs far from the shore were still intact and alive with fish and plants. So when and why did so much of the world’s third largest reef system just disappear? Natural forces like spells of extreme rainfall and heatwaves may have played some part, but it is more likely that man was responsible. In those 250 years, fishing off the Florida Keys intensified, causeways and cities were built, pollution increased and the flow of freshwater, sediments and nutrients from the land all changed. Any of these factors could have led to the stress and decline of the reef, but it probably took a combination to kill off half the corals. Something similar to what took place over 250 years off the Florida coast is now accelerating across reefs around the world as natural and new anthropogenic threats emerge and combine with deadly effect. Corals are intolerant both of temperature and salinity change and it just takes a rise of 1C for a few weeks or extreme rainfall for them to begin to die. In the past 20 years, extreme weather linked to El Niño events and climate change has hit the world’s shallow reefs hard. Abnormally warm water caused the world’s first recorded widespread coral bleaching in 1998. Stretches of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, and other reefs off Madagascar, Belize and the Maldives, were left white and seemingly dead. Most recovered because corals survive if conditions return to normal. But since then, widespread bleaching and other events have occurred nearly every year, leaving many of the world’s reefs stressed and vulnerable to disease. Over 20 years the trend of decline and loss has been inexorable. In 2001, and again in 2005, even warmer seas damaged many more reefs. From 2008-11, extreme summer temperatures led to major flooding and pollution in Australia which badly damaged the Great Barrier Reef. 2013 saw sea temperatures rise again and the longest global coral bleaching event on record began in 2014 with another exceptionally strong El Niño. The 2016 and 2017 mass-bleaching events may now have affected nearly two-thirds of the world’s shallow reefs. The fear now is that natural resilience is being lost and damaged reefs will not have time to recover before the next extreme event further weakens and then kills them. But reefs are now beset with more problems than bleaching. Just as off Florida in the 19th century, local pollution, overfishing, loss of oxygen and excess nutrient runoff have increased, and now growing acidification of the oceans is a real danger. Most organisms can withstand some stress but few can cope with this tsunami of trouble. Much of the early damage to near pristine Pacific and Indian ocean reefs may have been done in the 1980s when overfishing peaked in tropical and subtropical seas. Shark fishing and the use of cyanide and explosives to supply fish to Hong Kong, Singapore, and mainland China has wiped out whole fish populations. Fishing gear dragged along the ocean floor has crushed corals, dynamite has shattered colonies and cyanide has killed hosts of living creatures. A vast natural treasure is rapidly being lost. The world’s reefs may only cover 2% of the ocean floor but they are thought to be home to up to a quarter of the world’s 500,000 known species living in the oceans. Aside from providing food for many millions of people, reefs are now recognised as essential to the whole marine ecosystem. Fish spawn and grow around coral, which in turn helps to regulate carbon dioxide levels in the oceans and protects coastal areas from erosion. Take out any one part of the reef system and the whole is threatened. Economically, too, reefs are increasingly important. Tourism and fishing on the Great Barrier Reef is estimated to be worth at least $6.4bn Australian dollars (£3.7bn) a year. The Maldives’ tourist economy would collapse without its reefs. Together, the world’s coral reefs have been valued at $1tn a year. The full ecological and economic damage done by 20 years of intense exploitation and warming seas is not yet known, but some scientists believe the world may already have lost half its shadow reefs, with the rest likely to be threatened within 30 years. The solutions are political and technical and must address the entire marine ecosystem. Protected reserves are urgently needed and fishing must be controlled and policed. But the answers will come mainly on land. For reefs to have any chance of surviving, farmers, cities and mining companies must reduce their pollution and prevent the runoff of sediment and nutrients into the seas. But above all, climate change must be addressed. If the oceans continue to absorb CO2, the increased acidity will be fatal and coral bleaching will worsen. All that may be left are the deeper reefs. The UN target to drastically cut emissions and hold temperature rises to 1.5C must be met. If not, then the the world’s rich, diverse and astonishingly beautiful coral reefs may all but disappear within a lifetime. Recklessness on this scale would have unimaginable consequences."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2017/dec/26/nazis-nukes-and-nick-knowles-2017s-least-welcome-comebacks","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T17:30:00Z","webTitle":"Nazis, nukes and Nick Knowles – 2017’s least welcome comebacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2017/dec/26/nazis-nukes-and-nick-knowles-2017s-least-welcome-comebacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2017/dec/26/nazis-nukes-and-nick-knowles-2017s-least-welcome-comebacks","fields":{"headline":"Nazis, nukes and Nick Knowles – 2017’s least welcome comebacks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pirates of the Caribbean I defy you to recall anything that happened during any Pirates of the Caribbean film. And yet 2017 brought us an entirely superfluous fifth instalment (below); the only difference this time being that the lead actor’s innate creepiness overwhelmed his ability to wobble and gurn. Will and Grace The best you can say about the revived Will and Grace series is that it was exactly the same as the original Will and Grace series, which means it still felt like your ear was being chewed by four especially irritating chipmunks. White nationalism True, white nationalism never really went away. But this year it seemed especially emboldened, with its tiki torch parades and bizarre infatuation with Richard Spencer. Obviously this was bad news for society as a whole – and even worse news for progressives fond of wearing chinos and well-pressed polo shirts. Mel Gibson Everyone deserves a second chance. However, Mel Gibson – a man most notorious for screaming racist, violent abuse at the mother of his child in 2006 – has starred in seven films since returning from exile in 2010. The fact that the most recent of these was Daddy’s Home 2 probably means that that’s enough chances now. Transformers 5 The world needed a fifth Transformers film like it needed to have its jaw kicked off by a donkey. But nobody told Michael Bay, who this year offered up another two and a half hours of robots indistinguishably mashing up against each other to the delight of nobody. Dynasty First they brought back Dallas, and that didn’t work. So then they brought back Dynasty – the cut-price Sindy doll to Dallas’s Barbie – and that didn’t work. They will bring back Knots Landing next, and that won’t work either because nobody ever learns. Political sex scandals Back in the mid-90s, politicians being caught with their pants down sparked countless resignations. This year, we’ve had a bracing revival across the political spectrum. However, it’s slightly less interesting this time around, because sexual inappropriateness now spreads to all men from all industries ever. Nuclear tension Worried that millennials will never experience the heart-stopping terror of nuclear armageddon that helped define several previous generations? Thanks to Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, existential dread is right back on the table. We will all be dead in a fireball this time next year. Oh, nostalgia. Nick Knowles In 2009, Nick Knowles released an anti-war single that sounded like Pierce Brosnan’s Mamma Mia character being trampled by a herd of buffalo. This year he released an entire album of it.

A report by ITV earlier this week went viral after it showed schools where teachers said they had to wash their pupils’ uniforms because their families couldn’t afford to pay the electricity bills. One primary school, West End primary, said it sometimes gave coats and shoes to pupils whose parents could not provide them. Meanwhile, a local GP spoke of treating children for rickets, a condition usually seen in developing countries. But David Morris, the MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, responded to the reports by posting a call for social services to investigate on Facebook. “These claims are not those being experienced by myself or the jobcentre in the area and I would urge anyone affected to book an appointment with the staff at Morecambe jobcentre to assess if they are receiving all of the benefits they are entitled to,” he wrote. Morris added that the claims “always seem to emanate from the same primary schools and Ash Trees surgery in Carnforth”. He later told ITV: “I’ve not got issues with the report that you’ve run, I’m just questioning the validity of it … [the schools featured] have very strong links to Momentum, and to be quite frank, all the indicators from Ofsted say that the child poverty at that school is absolutely no different to any other in the country.” Previously, Siobhan Collingwood, a headteacher at Morecambe Bay primary school, said: “We’ve had parents pass out in the school hall just through going without meals themselves. We’ve helped them to join in with the breakfasts that are available within school. We’ve taken them as well to food banks.” Last summer, Collingwood was accused by Morris of having a political agenda and trying to oust him from his seat. Both schools in the report have denied links to Momentum and say their work has never been political. Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator, said: “For 15 years I worked for children’s charities and I’ve never seen an MP show such blatant disregard for vulnerable children in their constituency. “That David Morris has tried to cover up children going hungry and suffering from Victorian diseases such as rickets is shocking. That he’d do it by smearing Momentum and implying that local schools are lying is even worse.” Parker claimed the issue told a wider story “about a Conservative party which simply doesn’t care about the daily struggle many working-class families face” and suggested Morris “considers his position” following the developments. Amid claims that Morris has blocked people online who have questioned his statement, Morecambe residents are using the hashtag #blockedbydavidmorris and have started a Facebook group to air their grievances. “I guess I’m blocked too!” Collingwood posted online. “Anyway the response from the community today, and I suspect beyond, has reduced my staff and I to tears on several occasions. Thank you everybody, the children of Morecambe Bay school and West End school are very grateful for your kindness and generosity.” Morris said this was because “most of the postings are from Momentum trolls all across the country”, according to a local paper. “My Facebook site is an information site,” he said. “It is not a billboard for trolls to put silliness on there. Some of those trolls – the local ones – are actually being investigated by the police for abuse.” The Morecambe and Lunesdale Labour party said in a statement that Morris “does not see what is happening on his own watch because on the rare occasions he is here, he refuses to engage with the community and attacks teachers and doctors for being ‘politicised’.” A spokeswoman for the party said: “In the age of the internet, MPs should use social media to establish meaningful dialogues with their constituents. “For a long time now, Morris has blocked and banned from his Facebook page those who voice their concerns regarding things that happen in our constituency and speak out about the government’s policies, which he supports. However, Mr Morris has gone beyond blocking and banning his aggrieved constituents and now frequently accuses those who criticise him of being trolls or part of coordinated campaigns against him, often using parliamentary privilege to do so.” The spokeswoman added that Morris was “yet to provide a shred of evidence to back up his accusations and continues to refuse to acknowledge the genuine concerns of his constituents”. The Guardian has contacted Morris’s office and the Conservative party for comment. According to the End Child Poverty group, 5,087 children in Morecambe – about one in four – live in poverty. Morris later announced he had had a “productive meeting” at Morecambe Bay food bank and also with the headteacher of West End school."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/dec/24/ballynahinch-castle-walking-galway-connemara-ireland-literature","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T07:00:44Z","webTitle":"Lost in rhyme: a walk in the poetic beauty of Ballynahinch, Galway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/24/ballynahinch-castle-walking-galway-connemara-ireland-literature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/dec/24/ballynahinch-castle-walking-galway-connemara-ireland-literature","fields":{"headline":"Lost in rhyme: a walk in the poetic beauty of Ballynahinch, Galway","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There are few things I’d rather do, on a cold December morning, with ice in the puddles and a crisp blue sky overhead, than go rambling for an hour or two in the woods around Ballynahinch Castle hotel in County Galway. One of the most romantic places to stay in Ireland, Ballynahinch sits at the base of the Twelve Bens mountain range in the heart of Connemara. It has its own lake, and a river runs right past the dining room, weaving its way down to the Atlantic coast at Roundstone, six miles away. There are no fewer than 700 acres of grounds to stretch your legs in. The paths are muddy when I head out for my walk, and my ears and nose are red with cold, but I have a couple of incentives to keep me going. There is a hot whiskey waiting for me when I get back, and a roaring fire in the bar, and I want to feel that my rewards have been properly earned. I cross the bridge on the main avenue and walk along a section of the old Galway-to-Clifden railway line, which hasn’t encountered a train since the 1930s. Along the way my companion Josh Mcgloin, who runs activities at the hotel, is on the lookout for fungi. With a basket in one hand and a penknife in the other, he leads me to secret clusters of ceps, burnt-orange chanterelles and hedgehog mushrooms, all of which end up in my lunch the following day. Reaching the immaculately preserved station building, we loop back and follow the river past the main building, an 18th-century manor house, and on up to Ballynahinch Lake. This is angler’s heaven. At Beat No 1, just below the lake, wild salmon take a breather. Evidence of this can be seen in the hotel bar, where some of the most staggering catches of recent decades – including a spectacular 20lb specimen landed by a lucky first-timer last year – are mounted for posterity. There is deep history here. On the far side of the lake, on the site of a 2,000-year-old crannóg, or artificial island, lie the ruins of a 16th-century tower house – the original Ballynahinch Castle. This belonged to the once-powerful O’Flaherty clan, who owned the land before it was taken away by the British. The beauty of this spot didn’t escape the poet Seamus Heaney, a regular visitor to the hotel before his death in 2013. In his poem Ballynahinch Lake he recalls stopping by the water “As a captivating brightness held and opened / And the utter mountain mirrored in the lake / Eked into us like a wedge knocked sweetly home / Into core timber.” Heaney loved the hotel bar, to which we repair when the rain sets in and the need for hot whiskeys becomes urgent. I’ve heard people describe the Fisherman’s Pub at Ballynahinch as the most beautiful bar in Ireland, a hard claim to dismiss when you settle in by the crackling log fire, glass in hand, and survey the artful jumble of paintings and photographs on the wall, each with a story to tell. (I would, however, make a competing case for a wonderful pub in Drogheda called Clarke’s.) “This is an egalitarian sort of room,” says the hotel’s gregarious manager Patrick O’Flaherty, noting that ambassadors and local sheep farmers have been known to bond over a couple of pints at the bar and get animated about the state of fishing. In the lull before dinner, I gather that Seamus Heaney wasn’t the only literary figure to patronise Ballynahinch, which marked its 70th anniversary last year. Edna O’Brien is a regular, and O’Flaherty invites artists, such as Dorothy Cross, to “stay at the castle and record their response to the landscape”. The resulting work is published by Occasional Press and some of the art ends up on the well-furnished walls, where you’ll also find paintings by Paul Henry, Louis le Brocquy and Sean Scully. It would be easy for a place like this to feel stuffy, given the weight of its history but Ballynahinch feels informal, almost bohemian in character. The food, too, is carefully constructed without seeming fussy. At dinner, fat scallops are served in a delicate dashi with sea vegetables and a roe cracker. Roast duck breast from Skeaghanore in Cork – probably the best I’ve ever had – comes with several types of beetroot, cooked to the tenderest pink. None of this comes cheap: Ballynahinch is a place for special occasions and is perfect at Christmas time. As well as woodlands to explore and rivers to fish, you can go cycling or climbing – the Diamond Hill near Letterfrack has spectacular views out to Inishbofin island – and it’s worth driving a little further up to Killary Harbour, Ireland’s only fjord, to have lunch at Misunderstood Heron, a food truck serving fresh mussels and lamb samosas right down by the shore. Closer to home, Roundstone Ceramics, Rosemarie O’Toole and Séamus Laffan’s lovely workshop, is highly recommended for its pretty pottery. The following day we head to Roundstone Harbour to meet our skipper John O’Sullivan for a boat trip to the island of Inishlacken. There’s no longer a community here, only the remains of their limestone cottages. The island gradually emptied out during the 20th century but a few of the houses have been restored and (yet more) artists come to the island each year in search of inspiration. You can see why. The island is fringed by beaches of white sand, giving way to tufty dunes and bogland strewn with wildflowers, the territory patrolled by a number of temperamental goats. By the old schoolhouse, with its bright blue door and high windows, Patrick produces a Thermos flask filled with broth from yesterday’s haul of wild mushrooms. We drink it all in. Not every afternoon in Connemara is this picture perfect, but even in the deepest midwinter, with rain driving in from the Atlantic, this is an extraordinary place to spend a couple of days or more.

It turned out he was staying in a luxurious hotel overlooking the Bay of Naples, so I checked out of my two-star hovel and into his five-star palace. Then, at 3pm, I set about finding him, mindful of everything that could go disastrously wrong. A receptionist connected my call to “someone who can help”, which I took to mean a publicist, PA or agent. Instead it was the king of the high Cs himself who answered. Taken aback, I spluttered out my plan. “I am tired,” he replied. “You call back later,” but with no suggestion as to how much later. I called at 6pm. “Still tired,” came the reply. At 9pm I called again. “You come to top floor.” I knocked on the door of the Caruso Suite and Pavarotti appeared, no publicist, no PA, no agent. He led me through the hallway which had become a temporary kitchen. Two large fridges buzzed, and plates were stacked with cutlery. We entered a sitting room and he applied face powder from what you would call a compact if it weren’t so huge. I noticed his black hair. An armchair was perched on piles of books to aid his back pain. A novel solution, I thought, but didn’t say. We chatted while I set up and I mentioned how I’d converted my hotel bathroom into a darkroom to meet my newspaper deadline. He misunderstood and snapped back with: “So let’s get on with it.” I thought I’d upset him and blown my opportunity, but remembered I had brought a gift. I passed him a tube containing a portrait of his parents that I had taken in Modena the previous year. It was a touching shot showing his mother Adele, affectionately nuzzled against her husband Fernando’s chest. Pavarotti melted. “It’s, it’s… incredible,” he whispered as his eyes welled up. He insisted I chose an Hermès scarf from a pile for him to wear in the portrait but, “Olé!”, he started flicking me with it, a strange cross between heroic bullfighter and my brother aged 11 in the Scunthorpe baths changing room. Photographs taken, I developed the films in my bathroom, connected my modem using crocodile clips and “pinged” the shots to London. A more thoughtful picture from the shoot was published, but this remains my favourite. I photographed Pavarotti once more with the Spice Girls and escaped unflicked.

A favourite theme was the contrast between wealth and poverty, between the firelit drawing rooms of the prosperous and the stark and frozen world beyond the silk curtains. For every fictional child such as Clara in The Nutcracker, with her presents and her party dresses, there was a ragged waif shivering on the pavement outside. Nowhere is this pathos more excruciatingly brought to bear than in The Little Match Girl by Hans Christian Andersen. A child is wandering the streets barefoot in the snow, but she’s afraid to go home because she hasn’t sold enough matches and her father will beat her. As night falls she strikes her matches to keep warm and sees visions of the loving family life that fate has denied her. Finally, curling up beneath a street lamp, she succumbs to the piercing cold and is borne to heaven. Adapting this story for the stage, as the choreographer and director Arthur Pita did in 2013, cannot have been easy. Poignancy is one thing; an auditorium full of sobbing parents and children quite another. That Pita succeeds not only in producing a joyous spectacle, but in leaving Andersen’s compassionate message intact, is testament to his theatrical deftness. Corey Claire Annand is as entrancing as she is touching in the title role, and the three-strong supporting cast of eccentric vagabonds are individually pitch-perfect. Pita has coloured the piece with quirky humour and imaginative grace notes. The story is relocated to 19th-century Italy, and when our young heroine freezes to death (in a scene no less heart-rending than Andersen’s) she is transported to the moon. There, she attends the 1969 American landing, dances with an astronaut, and helps relaunch the lunar module with one of her matches. Pita’s choreography for Annand is simple but telling, and she draws strong, articulate lines. The cast sing, too. The countertenor Angelo Smimmo is notably fine, while Annand has an engaging, canary-like chirrup. A live multi-instrumental soundtrack by composer Frank Moon provides haunting atmospherics. All in all, a delicate and charming work, which deserves to become a Christmas perennial. • At the Lilian Baylis Studio, Sadler’s Wells, London, until 24 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/vole-bigfoot-fat-tyre-ebike-preview-superhero-levels-of-traction","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Volt Bigfoot Fat Tyre E-Bike preview: ‘Superhero levels of traction’ | Martin Love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/vole-bigfoot-fat-tyre-ebike-preview-superhero-levels-of-traction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/vole-bigfoot-fat-tyre-ebike-preview-superhero-levels-of-traction","fields":{"headline":"Volt Bigfoot Fat Tyre E-Bike preview: ‘Superhero levels of traction’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Worried by icy conditions?

Theresa May is outraged. She hadn’t taken back control only to give back control to the British parliament. The Conservatives then draw up a bill to go through the Commons that Jeremy Corbyn says his party will back. Theresa May is again outraged. How dare the Labour party attempt to thwart the will of the people by voting with the government? Towards the end of January, Theresa spells out her vision for Brexit in her Lancaster House speech. Britain will be leaving the single market and the customs union, though very much hoping that the EU will give us all the benefits of both, without either having to pay a penny or being obliged to abide by any of its regulations. The EU is understandably bemused, but praises the prime minister for the clarity with which she described her confusion. Over Easter, Theresa goes to Snowdonia with her husband for a walking holiday. While there, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill call to tell her she will be announcing a general election on her return to London. Theresa points out that she has repeatedly said that an election wouldn’t be in the national interest. Nick and Fiona remind her that if she wants to remain PM she had better do what they want. And what they want is a general election: Labour is 20 points behind in the polls and now is the time to wipe them out for at least a decade. Theresa declares what Nick and Fiona have decided that she has decided: there will be a general election because they want a mandate of their own. And while she was about it, Theresa added, there would be no televised debates because that wasn’t in the national interest. What the public really wanted was for her to go round the country having conversations with people. Nick and Fiona look horrified. No one can remember the last time anyone came away from a conversation with Theresa feeling good about themselves. Instead they recommend that Theresa goes around the country saying “strong and stable” and “Brexit means Brexit” to a few dozen Tory activists who could be squashed into a community centre to make it look as if the place was packed. At the launch of the Tory election manifesto in Halifax, Theresa announces plans to make people with dementia pay all but their last £100K for their care. This comes as a shock to her cabinet, who are seated in the front two rows, and to everyone else. “Why are we bringing in a dementia tax?” Theresa later asks Nick and Fiona. They reply that just because a tax targets people with dementia, it doesn’t make it a dementia tax. Theresa is momentarily reassured. After it’s pointed out to her that a dementia tax will not go down well with many elderly Tory voters, Theresa reverses the policy at the launch of the Welsh manifesto in Wrexham, while insisting that “nothing has changed” and that the manifesto had never been meant to be seen as a binding document – more like a collection of random ideas. Meanwhile, crowds sing “Oh Je-re-my Cor-byn” at sellout stadium gigs on what is widely expected to be the Labour leader’s farewell tour. The exit poll brings out the largest smile yet seen on television – on the face of George Osborne. A tearful Theresa goes back to Downing Street to announce she has won a magnificent victory. She had promised a coalition of chaos if Labour got in and a coalition of chaos was what the country had voted for, albeit a chaotic coalition between the Conservatives and the DUP. The Tories insist on Nick and Fiona being removed. Lost without her system operators, the Maybot asks if she can go as well. Everyone says no. Why not, asks Theresa (she now feels an intense need to go running through wheat fields). Because all the other possible candidates are even worse than you, the Tory party chairman points out. Theresa tries to reboot herself at the Tory party conference by apologising for having run a campaign that was too scripted, while reading from a script. Then a comedian hands her a P45, which she accepts: in her heart of hearts that’s what she wants more than anything else. Then she loses her voice. Then letters start dropping off the scenery behind her; Skills Mean Jobs becomes Kill Me. Her world is truly falling apart. When David Davis is caught out by parliament for saying the 58 sectoral impact analyses existed in “excruciating detail”, when it later turns out they don’t exist at all, it dawns on Theresa that she has to take charge of the Brexit negotiations herself. Along with the Four Pot Plants, now her sole remaining friends. After barely coping with the resignations of Michael Fallon (for sex pestery) and Priti Patel (for conducting her own independent foreign policy) Theresa goes to Brussels to announce she has agreed a deal to take the Brexit negotiations on to the next stage. Except she hasn’t, as the DUP kick up rough. She goes back to Brussels four days later having agreed to pretty much everything the EU has demanded. Theresa returns home to announce that Britain will be seeking a deal that everyone in the EU has said is not on the table. By now no one cares – they just want to forget about Brexit over Christmas. Theresa remembers she has forgotten to sack Damian Green for lying and hopes no one will notice by sneaking out the news on the last day of parliament. Boris Johnson gleefully points out that she now has no friends left. Happy new year to you, too, she thinks.. • I, Maybot by John Crace is out now, published by Guardian Faber (£9.99).

The sites were among more than 1,000 new entries on the Historic England register. The public body’s chief executive, Duncan Wilson, said almost everyone in England – 99% of the population – lived within a mile of a listed site, some even world famous. “These sites are irreplaceable and showcase the wonderfully distinct and diverse character of England and its people across thousands of years,” he said. Others included a jolly Festival of Britain-style clock tower in the first pedestrianised shopping centre in England, and acoustic mirrors carved into the cliff face at Dover to capture the sound of approaching warplanes. The horse memorial is in Halewood in Merseyside, and marks the grave of Blackie, one of the very few, out of hundreds of thousands of British army first world war horses and mules, which came back safely from the western front and died of old age. Blackie survived some of the most infamous battles, including Arras, the Somme, and Ypres where he suffered severe shrapnel wounds. His master was the war poet Leonard Comer Wall, who was killed in action in June 1917, aged 21, and whose mother bought Blackie when the horse returned to England. Blackie served at the Territorial Army riding school and led parades through the streets of Liverpool, before being retired to a horses’ rest home in Halewood, where he died aged 37 in 1942. He was buried with his master’s war medals. The clock tower was designed by Frederick Gibberd for Chrisp Street market in Poplar, in the east end of London, the heart of a new housing estate, and became the centrepiece of an architectural exhibition in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain. The complex included the Festival Inn, the first permanent postwar pub, also designed by Gibberd and also newly listed. Its interior, with a panelled dartboard area and a Festival of Britain mirror over the fireplace, was created by the brewery’s then designer, R W Stoddard. By far the oldest of the newly listed sites is a neolithic trackway near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, built 4,500 years ago across boggy land and shallow water – possibly for ritual use, carefully designed to appear even longer and more impressive as it narrows from three to one metre. It was found by accident during peat cutting in the 1990s, and survives as well preserved buried waterlogged timbers. In contrast Leaf Hall was a 19th-century attempt at social engineering, built for local fishermen in Eastbourne, East Sussex, in the 1860s by William Laidler Leaf, a London philanthropist and leading member of the temperance movement. Although there was no question of including a bar, it did have a coffee room, lending library and reading room, smoking room, a lecture room with an orchestra gallery, and a skittle yard, all dedicated to promoting “the social, moral and spiritual welfare of the working classes of Eastbourne”. The seaside gardens, among 13 parks and gardens newly added, are along the breezy promenade at Skegness, and were first laid out as a Lincolnshire fishing village was transformed into a holiday resort in the 19th century – celebrated by the Jolly Fisherman image created in 1908. In the 1920s the town engineer and architect Rowland Jenkins poured in new features including a boating lake, bowling greens, ruined castles, a ballroom, a Swiss garden and acres of rose garden. Billy Butlin first brought his hoopla stall to Skegness in the 1920s, and did so well he created a funfair featuring the first dodgems in England, with cars imported from the US. In 1936 he opened his first Butlin’s holiday camp – with a day and night entertainment programme said to have been inspired by miserable memories of being locked out all day by a landlady in his childhood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/15/lab-notes-dracula-weird-sex-and-hunting-for-aliens-a-b-movie-week-in-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T18:13:59Z","webTitle":"Lab notes: Dracula, weird sex and hunting for aliens – a B-movie week in science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/15/lab-notes-dracula-weird-sex-and-hunting-for-aliens-a-b-movie-week-in-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/15/lab-notes-dracula-weird-sex-and-hunting-for-aliens-a-b-movie-week-in-science","fields":{"headline":"Lab notes: Dracula, weird sex and hunting for aliens – a B-movie week in science","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This week’s biggest stories The biggest and most exciting news this week is, of course, that remarkable success in a drug trial for Huntington’s disease means we may be at a turning point in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Alexei Ulyukayev was also ordered to pay a $2.2m (£1.7m) fine as part of the punishment for soliciting a $2m bribe from Igor Sechin, the chief executive of the state oil company Rosneft, who is widely seen as the second most powerful man in Russia after Vladimir Putin. Ulyukayev was arrested in a sting operation at Rosneft’s headquarters last year, after Sechin handed him a basket containing $2m in specially marked $100 bills. Sechin said in his testimony that Ulyukayev had asked for the bribe during a game of billiards at a summit in India. The former minister said he had never made any demands and assumed the basket contained sausages or wine. There was little evidence in the case except Sechin’s testimony, and he refused to show up at court despite receiving several summons. He said he was too busy. The trial was a rare case of the vicious infighting between government clans spilling out into the open. Putin has attempted to portray himself as above the fray, but said at his annual press conference on Thursday that he did not understand why Sechin had refused to appear in court. In a sign that there may still be a behind-the-scenes battle going on over the case, an unnamed source told the Tass news agency that Ulyukayev’s health meant he may not have to serve the time in prison. The case has widely been seen as Sechin’s revenge for Ulyukayev opposing Rosneft’s takeover of another oil company. While Russian courts rarely give innocent verdicts, many were expecting a suspended sentence as a compromise. The harsh sentence sent shockwaves through the more liberal parts of the Russian elite. Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister, tweeted: “An awful, unfounded sentence. Weak and biased investigative work. Unfortunately, many people are suffering this kind of injustice today.” In his final words to the court last week, Ulyukayev insisted he was innocent, but apologised for turning a blind eye to injustice during his time in government. “I am guilty instead of too often agreeing to compromise, of taking the easy way out and choosing my career over standing up for principles,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/15/the-league-of-gentlemen-announce-2018-uk-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T12:03:54Z","webTitle":"The League of Gentlemen announce 2018 UK tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/15/the-league-of-gentlemen-announce-2018-uk-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/15/the-league-of-gentlemen-announce-2018-uk-tour","fields":{"headline":"The League of Gentlemen announce 2018 UK tour","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Their three forthcoming reunion specials for the BBC are among this Christmas’s most anticipated television shows.

The League of Gentlemen Live Again! tour starts in Sunderland on 25 August 2018, offering local entertainment for local people around the UK, culminating in three nights at London’s Eventim Apollo, from 27 to 29 September. The comedy troupe – comprising Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson – are celebrating 20 years since they stormed the Edinburgh fringe with their darkly bizarre sketch show. They beat Al Murray, Graham Norton, Milton Jones and Johnny Vegas to the Perrier award in 1997. (“The thing I most remember was being hot,” Pemberton said. “We were in the hottest room at the fringe, the Pleasance Attic, in dinner suits.”) The League of Gentlemen’s radio series began on BBC Radio 4 in the same year as their Edinburgh triumph. Their TV show about the unnerving inhabitants of the fictional village of Royston Vasey ran from 1999 to 2002 on BBC Two and won them a Bafta. A film, The League of Gentlemen’s Apocalypse, followed in 2005. Earlier this year they returned to Edinburgh to present the awards to 2017’s comedy winners. In a joint statement, the group said: “Performing in front of an audience gives us the biggest thrill of all. We’re overjoyed to be taking the citizens of Royston Vasey on a road-trip and can’t wait to see all the wonderful local places in our increasingly local country.

Chris Grayling told local government leaders that the future of local buses was a more bespoke service, suggesting on-demand models similar to the ride-hailing app could be used more widely to bridge funding gaps. The transport secretary made his comments in a meeting with the chairman of the Local Government Association, Lord Porter, and the chair of its transport board, Martin Tett, in October. The minutes were published this week. Funding for buses across England and Wales has been cut by 33% since 2010, while passenger numbers have fallen to a 10-year low and fares have soared above inflation. Asked how to address the funding gap, Grayling “suggested that the nature of bus provision is likely to change over the coming years, with more Uber-style, demand-led services replacing traditional services”. Labour said the comments were the equivalent of telling people “let them take taxis” and that it was not the right way to address the chronic underfunding of bus services. According to the minutes of the meeting, Tett said switching to an Uber-style model made sense up to a point and had been trialled, but that such services needed to be accessible for all people. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “For many people, especially the young and the elderly, those living in rural areas and those who do not own a car, bus services are a lifeline. But rather than addressing the buses crisis, Chris Grayling’s solution is to say ‘let them take taxis’. Nobody wants to see Uber replacing local bus services except Chris Grayling.” The Unite trade union also expressed concern. Its national officer for passenger transport, Bobby Morton, said: “In Grayling’s warped view of the UK’s transport needs, he now sees an unregulated and expensive bus service, probably only operating at peak times, as the transport holy grail. He is completely out of touch with ordinary people and their daily transport needs.” Research in the Campaign for Better Transport’s Buses in Crisis report found that 63% of local authorities had cut funding for buses since 2010, and almost half had withdraw some services. The report said local authorities in England and Wales had cut £78m in funding for bus services and reduced or withdrawn more than 2,400 routes since the Conservatives came power. The campaign has, however, previously suggested there could be some value in demand-responsive services, It cited Bwcabus, a pre-bookable bus service operating in Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion in rural west Wales, and Arriva launched ArrivaClick, an on-demand service for Sittingbourne, in March. Companies such as Uber and Lyft have trialled services that closely resemble buses. Lyft runs a regular service called Shuttle in San Francisco and Chicago, offering passengers a fixed-fare route in a shared vehicle, much like a public bus. Uber trialled UberHop in North American cities including Toronto and Seattle, but the services have ceased. It still runs in the Philippines capital of Manila. Campaign for Better Transport’s chief executive, Stephen Joseph, said: “Uber and Lyft will not be interested in providing services in some of the rural areas where even taxis are disappearing. Mr Grayling is right to say that technology can transform bus services in the future, but he needs to focus on and tackle the decline happening now in local transport services of all kinds, in part due to funding cuts. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Like all modes of transport, technology is changing how we travel and can offer better and more flexible journeys for all commuters. “Buses are vital for communities, connecting people, homes and businesses and we have given councils extra powers to work in partnership with bus companies to improve the service passengers expect and deserve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/15/far-right-conference-prague-czech-republic-populism-marine-le-pen","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T12:10:16Z","webTitle":"Far right to gather in Prague as fears grow of rising Czech populism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/far-right-conference-prague-czech-republic-populism-marine-le-pen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/15/far-right-conference-prague-czech-republic-populism-marine-le-pen","fields":{"headline":"Far right to gather in Prague as fears grow of rising Czech populism","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"European far-right leaders including Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders will gather in Prague this weekend for a controversial conference likely to be met with protests from groups fearful that xenophobic populism is on the rise in the Czech Republic. The meeting of the rightwing Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European parliament is being hosted by the anti-Islam Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD), which emerged as a force in Czech politics after winning nearly 11% of the vote in a parliamentary election in October. Opponents of the meeting have vowed to demonstrate outside the conference venue, Top Hotel in Chodov, seven miles from central Prague, in a show of defiance they say aims to prevent intolerance from taking root in a city defined by the peaceful 1989 Velvet Revolution that spelled the end for communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. The SPD, led by a part-Japanese immigrant Tomio Okamura, attracted electoral support through its slogan “No to Islam, no to terrorism”, in an election won by the ANO party of Andrej Babiš, a billionaire businessman sworn in as prime minister earlier this month. The growing importance of Okamura’s party was illustrated last week when the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, who is known for hardline anti-Islam rhetoric, addressed its annual conference in a thinly disguised plea for support in his campaign for re-election next month. Both men have seized on growing anti-Islam sentiment at odds with the Czech Republic’s small and low-profile Muslim population, estimated at between 3,000 and 20,000 people, but fuelled by the refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in Europe. Czech police, at the request of their Dutch counterparts, are providing a special security detail for Wilders, the leader of the Freedom party (PVV), who has received death threats in response to his fierce anti-Muslim statements. Le Pen, the leader of France’s Front National, will join him at the conference along with Janice Atkinson, a former Ukip MEP who became an independent after being expelled from the party in 2015 following an expenses scandal, and Marcus Pretzell, a former MEP for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the husband of its former co-leader Frauke Petry. Both Pretzell and Petry recently left AfD over policy disagreements to join the newly formed Blue Party. Pretzell has called for “armed force” to protect Germany’s borders from asylum seekers and embraced the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Other speakers will include senior figures from Austria’s Freedom party and the Italian Northern League. The gathering comes at a sensitive moment in Czech politics. Babiš, who vowed during the election campaign to prevent the relocation of asylum seekers to the Czech Republic, was in Brussels this week on his first foreign trip as prime minister, arguing against the EU migrant quota scheme. His minority government has 78 of 200 seats in parliament and faces a fight for survival, needing to win a vote of confidence in the coming weeks. Okamura has said the SPD will not provide the support to win such a vote because Babiš does not back his policies. Hosting a conference with foreign far-right leaders could give Okamura added clout in Czech domestic politics, according to Prof Lubomir Kopeček, a political analyst at Masaryk University in Brno. “The SPD has no great ideas in a European context, but this conference could be of symbolic use to them in the Czech Republic because it allows them to say we have colleagues in western Europe we can cooperate with, and who have similar approaches,” he said. “Okamura isn’t someone with a big vision for the transformation of Europe. He’s an entrepreneurial opportunist. For now, he says he’s xenophobic. But if Czech public opinion moves, so will Tomio Okamura. He’s much more pragmatic than, say, Wilders.” • This article was amended on 15 December 2017. An earlier version said Marcus Pretzell was an MEP for AfD. He was formerly an MEP for AfD, but is now part of The Blue Party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/19/lady-dynamite-to-bojack-horseman-how-mental-health-on-tv-got-real","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T10:00:23Z","webTitle":"Lady Dynamite to BoJack Horseman: how mental health on TV got real","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/19/lady-dynamite-to-bojack-horseman-how-mental-health-on-tv-got-real","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/19/lady-dynamite-to-bojack-horseman-how-mental-health-on-tv-got-real","fields":{"headline":"Lady Dynamite to BoJack Horseman: how mental health on TV got real","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘It’s like I was out of stories to tell myself that things will be OK.” Episode six of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s third series and Rebecca Bunch is in a psychiatric ward after overdosing on a plane. The animated, wide-eyed Bunch we’ve come to know and love has been hollowed out. She’s empty and ashamed. The only hope is a new diagnosis, which she clings on to as a renewed chance at life. The episode was praised for its candid and sensitive portrayal of mental illness, specifically the diagnosis process. Rachel Bloom, who stars as Bunch and co-created the show with Aline Brosh McKenna, told Vanity Fair earlier this year that they consulted with a team of doctors to reach the character’s diagnosis: borderline personality disorder. Bunch’s diagnosis did not mean the show suddenly veered from being a self-aware musical comedy to a show about BPD. Bunch’s life continues: Paula needs her; Nathaniel still wants to have sex with her; and there are hilarious show tunes in need of singing. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend makes anyone with a mental illness feel less like an outcast. Despite her irrational antics, it is easy to empathise with its central character. Her emotional landscape is clearly a mess. She pinballs from one situation to the next at once contagiously enthusiastic and incredibly lonely. “We know that, when done well, dramatic portrayals of mental illness – particularly those with large audiences – have the potential to improve attitudes towards those of us with mental health problems and encourage more people to seek help,” says Jenni Regan, senior media adviser at Mind. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend shows how important it is to seek professional advice, and how that is nothing to be ashamed of. While Crazy Ex-Girlfriend made a roaring impact on the 2017 TV landscape, you cannot talk about mental health and television without referencing the fearless Lady Dynamite. Another female-led comedy, it is arguably the most interesting and surreal show you can watch on Netflix at the moment. It is genre-bending plot shows that life with a mental illness can blur boundaries to create a world where pugs are wise and the past is Technicolored. Co-created by South Park’s Pam Brady and Arrested Development’s Mitchell Hurwitz, the show draws on Maria Bamford’s real-life struggles with mental illness, ranging from her type II bipolar disorder to OCD and intrusive thoughts. Like her on-screen character, Bamford spent time in a psychiatric unit. The stay and the recovery process afterwards were things Bamford was keen to get right in her performance. She told the Guardian: “I felt so ashamed at ‘losing’ my mind that when I felt better, it seemed important to share my story because I had felt alone (despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, just among public figures).” Just like Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Lady Dynamite shows us that experiencing a mental breakdown does not mean you get to put your life on hold. The world spins on, and your mental wellbeing becomes increasingly difficult to maintain. Lady Dynamite admits that mania, and the grand ideas it can inspire, has the possibility to be thrilling but is also wild and treacherous. After most episodes of Lady Dynamite, you are left giddy and spent, as if you have just come off a rollercoaster. It is hard not to agree with Maria’s desire in the show: “I just want a quiet life, with just enough work.” Another show that tackled an incredibly complicated disorder was Overshadowed (BBC Three), an eight-part series about Imogen, a teenage vlogger whose bright personality slowly erodes at the hands of her anorexia. The show never glamorises eating disorders in the way other on-screen representations have been accused of doing. In part, this is thanks to the fact that Eva O’Connor (who also wrote the play behind the TV show) plays the personification of Imogen’s eating disorder, a seemingly normal girl called “Anna”. We spot Anna in the midst of Imogen’s friends, at the dinner table, behind her in the corridor. Her presence becomes less like a shadow and more like a monster in a school uniform. For O’Connor, it was vital to show the devastating effects of anorexia: “Having lived with an eating disorder for years (I’m now fully recovered), I wanted to show how eating disorders are not just a cry for attention, or the quest for the perfect bikini body,” she says. “They alienate you from people, they destroy relationships, they strip you of any sense of self. It was also important to me that we sent a strong message of hope. Recovery is possible for everyone.” A final mention for its brave depiction of depression goes to BoJack Horseman (Netflix). Episode six of the fourth season opens with BoJack’s devastating voiceover: “Piece of shit. Stupid piece of shit. You’re a real stupid piece of shit.” The interior monologue of someone in crisis. We already knew that BoJack was plagued by self-loathing but we had never quite witnessed the relentlessness of that self-hatred. It is intrusive, persuasive, all-encompassing. In BoJack’s mind, he is stunted and stuck in his dysfunctional upbringing. This year’s TV offerings have been confessional, helpful and sensitive in their portrayal of mental illnesses. Characters were not mere stereotypes, they were whole, even when their mental landscapes were fragmented. They had a life outside of their mental health issues. These portrayals also told us that help is available. As Dagmar tells Maria at bowl-a-roke in Lady Dynamite: “The more you try and ignore a problem the bigger it gets.” Hopefully these fearless TV representations will mean the end of mental illness as mere plot point. Conditions are not handy tools to explain a character’s decision-making. They are hellish, they are real, they are complex and they are not always the whole story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/24/josiah-zayner-diy-gene-editing-therapy-crispr-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T08:30:46Z","webTitle":"‘I want to help humans genetically modify themselves’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/24/josiah-zayner-diy-gene-editing-therapy-crispr-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/24/josiah-zayner-diy-gene-editing-therapy-crispr-interview","fields":{"headline":"‘I want to help humans genetically modify themselves’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Josiah Zayner, 36, recently made headlines by becoming the first person to use the revolutionary gene-editing tool Crispr to try to change their own genes.

The former Nasa biochemist, based in California, has become a leading figure in the growing “biohacker” movement, which involves loose collectives of scientists, engineers, artists, designers, and activists experimenting with biotechnology outside of conventional institutions and laboratories. Despite warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that selling gene therapy products without regulatory approval is illegal, Zayner sells kits that allow anyone to get started with basic genetic engineering techniques, and has published a free guide for others who want to take it further and experiment on themselves. Was administering a dose of Crispr on yourself an experiment, or a stunt to show what amateur scientists/biohackers can do? Both. The technical feasibility of what I did is not under question – researchers have done this many times, in all sorts of animals. But there’s a barrier – people are afraid of it, and just talk about the possibilities in humans. I wanted to break that down, to say “Hey look, the tools are inexpensive, and somebody with a bit of knowledge can actually go through with these experiments”. I chose to start with the gene for myostatin [a protein that regulates muscle growth], because it has been extensively studied, and it produces an obvious change if it has worked. So, how is your arm looking? In similar experiments with animals, you only start to see results after four to six months of treatment. I would expect that the DNA in some of the cells of my arm has changed, but I am still working on developing assays [tests] to try and detect that. As to whether the actual size of the muscle changes, I’m more sceptical. Changing the way one gene behaves can have a huge number of knock-on effects on the way other genes are regulated or expressed. Do you really know what you’re doing? It’s a good question. These things are complicated, and obviously with things like this there are lots of unknowns. I look at what the possible negative outcomes are and ask: “Are those risks insignificant enough that I’m willing to undertake this experiment?” Based on the data I read, for a local injection the answer was yes. A treatment that blocks myostatin throughout the whole body? That would be much more hazardous – you would be messing with the muscles of your heart. You support the idea of people attempting gene therapy and other experimental procedures on themselves. What’s wrong with the existing system, where treatments are thoroughly tested by professionals before being approved for use? If we’re going to do these experiments you have to balance two things: how many people can possibly die from testing their own products or making them available prematurely, versus how many people have genetic disorders and are just dying because they don’t have access to them. I think there’s a huge imbalance, where we’re overprotective of hurting people instead of offering a chance to millions of people who are dying right now. As human beings we’re very big on freedoms, equality, equal rights. What’s more of an equal right than being able to control what genes we have? I think people should be able to choose that. I’m not saying anything I can do can help treat people, but treating things genetically is the ultimate medicine. I grew up in the 90s with the computer hacker movement, the development of the internet – the whole open-source movement was amazing. Who created Linux, the most used operating system ever? Not students from Harvard or Cambridge, but Linus Torvalds, a student in Finland working in his apartment. I don’t think for a second I’m going to be the mastermind behind a great biotech revolution, but I think there’s some brilliant person waiting to be discovered out there that could be. In another recent biohacking experiment, a man injected himself with an unproven gene-therapy treatment for HIV which had been developed by biohacking startup Ascendence Biomedical. What do you know about what they are doing, and do you support their approach? I think they’re at a lot more risk because they are trying to work in the medical field, saying they can cure people. I think that starts to get a little more ethically and morally sketchy, and the government will certainly crack down on that. The reason we have hospitals is that it’s not just one random person giving you their opinion; there is oversight, checks and balances. When people start proposing new treatments without data to back them up or without consulting people, I think “Hey, be smart”. Get a second opinion, third opinion, ask doctors, ask other biohackers. Trying a therapy that doesn’t work instead of your medication obviously could be worse. The problem is, it’s like the freedom of speech thing: it sucks sometimes. If I say I want the freedom to test something on myself, it means everybody does – even people who are stupid or want to do crazy stuff. But if you say people should experiment on themselves outside of the traditional clinical trial system, surely that’s exactly what will happen? There will be a grey area where people are halfway there, or guessing what the effects will be. Yeah. I don’t know – honestly, I would never put me in charge of running this stuff for the FDA or the government. I think there are people who know how to make the rules to protect the most amount of people. People are going to get hurt with this stuff and I feel ethically terrible about that, and I don’t know how to prevent it. I see these instances of people doing crazy stuff and I’m like, “No, that’s not what I meant! Why are you injecting things in your eyeballs?”. I have this very libertarian side of me that says people have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies. But I also have this part of me that says “Be knowledgeable! Base it on scientific data!” What do your family think of what you do? I usually hide stuff I’m about to do from them, in case they try and talk me out of it. If I decide to do something, it’s because I’ve carefully weighed up the pros and cons. They won’t understand how much research I’ve done. My mom supports me, but thinks I’m crazy. She was so sad when I left Nasa. Last year, you performed a DIY faecal transplant on yourself. How did that go? Yes, I did a DIY faecal transplant to help with my gut health issues. It still blows my mind the effect it had, and DNA samples showed I did manage to change the makeup of my gut bacteria. I don’t exactly recommend the course of action I took, because there are safer alternatives to DIY. But if people have no access to those I support their choice to try it. Faeces is quite strictly regulated in the US, like a drug, so people travel to the UK where there are clinics. Where do you and other biohackers get the equipment, tools and chemicals to conduct genetic engineering at home? People don’t know that generally the same resources that are available to scientists are available to non-scientists. I can just order DNA online and they ship it to my house. If I want to get some sequencing done I send it off to a company and they’ll do it for me. It’s really inexpensive – we’re talking $6 to get a sample sequenced, or $10 to get a piece of DNA. What are you working on next? We have always been slaves to the genomes we have, and giving people the ability to change that almost changes what it means to be human. It seems so sci-fi and made up, but we’ve been genetically modifying humans with gene therapy since the 1990s – it’s just been very few people and for medical reasons. I want to help humans genetically modify themselves. If DIY genetic engineering becomes commonplace, as you hope, what do you think the world will be like in the future? To me it’s like Blade Runner, where he goes into that back-alley science lab and there’s the guy making eyes. I imagine people going to some place like a tattoo parlour, and instead of getting a tattoo they pick out some DNA that makes them muscly, or changes the colour of their hair or eyes. DNA defines what a species is, and I imagine it wouldn’t be too long into the future when the human species almost becomes a new species because of these modifications. When scientists first started altering DNA just to make, say, tomatoes ripen differently, there was immense public concern. Do you expect the general public is going to be supportive of people modifying any organism, including people, in any way they can, in their garage? The whole thing with GMOs [genetically modified organisms] was that it was “us and them”. They have the power to modify plants and we don’t know what they’re doing, and have no control over it, and so we are against it. This technology that I’m trying to do is for all of us. Whether you’re a big corporation or somebody in their basement, you have access to this stuff – everybody does. People respond very positively to that. We’ll see what happens. I’m sure we’ll get a different response when people are doing it every day, or when the first person decides to try and give themselves a tail or something."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-and-the-history-of-a-pornography-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T21:26:41Z","webTitle":"Damian Green: timeline of how a leak led to a downfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-and-the-history-of-a-pornography-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-and-the-history-of-a-pornography-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Damian Green: timeline of how a leak led to a downfall","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Late 2007 – early 2008 A series of leaked official documents from the Home Office are published in national newspapers, embarrassing Gordon Brown’s government. The Met police are asked to investigate, and then assistant commissioner Bob Quick takes charge of the inquiry. 19 November 2008 Junior Home Office official and former Tory council candidate Christopher Galley is arrested in connection with the leaked documents, which were obtained by the Conservative party. He is released on bail. 28 November 2008 Damian Green, then shadow immigration spokesman, is arrested at home in Kent on suspicion of “conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office” and “aiding and abetting misconduct in public office” by counter-terrorism police officers in connection with the Home Office leaks. The charges carry a potential life sentence. The then assistant Met commissioner Bob Quick ordered the arrest. Late 2008 Police find “extreme” pornographic material on one of the Commons computers of Damian Green during an inquiry into the leaks. It is not reported at the time. At the time Green was a Conservative MP but he would later become minister for policing, criminal justice and victims and then work and pensions secretary. He was a friend of Theresa May’s at Oxford University and is one of her closest political allies. After managing to form a minority government after the 2017 general election, May appointed him first secretary of state, effectively deputy prime minister. 8 April 2009 Assistant Met commissioner Bob Quick is forced to resign before the leaks inquiry can be completed after he was photographed carrying sensitive anti-terror documents for a meeting in No 10. Quick later suggests he would not have had to resign if his inquiry had not arrested Green. 16 April 2009 Keir Starmer QC, then director of public prosecutions, ends a £5m five-month police investigation into Damian Green and Christopher Galley after concluding there was insufficient evidence to prosecute either man because the information leaked to Green on the government’s immigration policy was not secret and did not affect national security or put lives at risk. 24 April 2009 Home office civil servant Christopher Galley is sacked for leaking information to Damian Green on the grounds of gross professional misconduct. 12 October 2009 Two inquiries into Scotland Yard’s arrest of Damian Green and Christopher Galley conclude the investigation was ill-advised, not proportionate and undermined by procedural flaws in police inquiries. 13 February 2012 Quick submits evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics and the media’s relationship with the police in which he claims he came under pressure to drop the investigation into Green before all the evidence had been examined. Early 2015 Green meets Kate Maltby, a Conservative activist and journalist, in a bar in Waterloo, London after he invites her for a drink. Green, almost 30 years older than Maltby, is an acquaintance of her parents and the pair had met previously. On this occasion, after discussing whether Maltby was interested in a political career and sexual affairs in parliament, she claims Green “mentioned that his own wife was very understanding. I felt a fleeting hand against my knee – so brief, it was almost deniable.” 1 June 2016 Maltby, having, she says, not been in contact with Green for a year, receives a text relating to an article she had written in the Times the previous day about corsets. It read: “Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid I feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?” 1 November 2017 After a flurry of sexual abuse and harassment allegations that began in Hollywood with the revelations about Harvey Weinstein but then spread to other areas, including Westminster, Maltby writes in the Times about her 2015 encounter with Green, claiming: “He offered me career advice and in the same breath made it clear he was sexually interested.”Green calls any allegation that he made sexual advances to Maltby “untrue [and] deeply hurtful”. The same day May orders an investigation by the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, into the claims. 2 November 2017 The cabinet office launches an inquiry into Green’s conduct with Kate Maltby, the second after a similar sleaze probe was launched into Conservative minister Mark Garnier who admitted asking his secretary to buy him sex toys. Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office’s head of propriety and ethics, is appointed to lead the inquiry. Separately, a widely criticised profile of Kate Maltby appears in the Daily Mail, suggesting Maltby’s parents were “aghast at what she had done” by accusing Green, which she denies. It said she had a “flair for self-promotion” and was “keen to make her mark in politics”. The article ends with a quote from a “Tory source”, who says “she might be more careful the next time she’s asked to write a piece trashing a decent man”. 5 November 2017 A report emerges that police found porn on one of Green’s parliamentary computers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008. The Sunday Times cites a statement prepared by Bob Quick. The paper said that Quick had intended to report the discovery of pornographic material to the parliamentary authorities, but was forced to quit his job before the leaks inquiry was completed. At the time, Quick accused Tories of trying to undermine his investigation into Green by “acting in a wholly corrupt way” although he later retracted the accusation. Strongly denying the pornography allegations last month, Green called Quick a “tainted and untrustworthy source”. Quick’s draft statement, which was not reported to the leak inquiry, read: “No criminal offences were involved, but it was recognised that if similar circumstances pertained to a public servant, such as a member of a police force, this could result in gross misconduct proceedings and dismissal.” The cabinet office inquiry is broadened to include claims made about Green and pornography. 1 December 2017 Neil Lewis, a detective who examined Green’s computer, says it contained thousands of pornographic images. The officer, who worked for Quick and specialised in examining digital devices for evidence, said: “It was ridiculous to suggest anybody else could have done it.” Green repeated his denial. 5 December 2017 Quick, the former Met police assistant commissioner, demands that Green retract the “deeply hurtful allegations” that he lied about pornography on the MP’s personal computer, threatening legal action if he failed to do so. 12 December 2017 The Cabinet Office inquiry into the conduct of Green is expanded to examine whether allies of the first secretary of state influenced the Daily Mail profile about Kate Maltby. 20 December 2017 Damian Green resigns as first secretary of state. Prime minister Theresa May: “I asked you to resign ... and I have gratefully accepted your resignation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/jan/29/cities-terror-attacks-brutal-relationship-terrorism","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T07:30:41Z","webTitle":"Cities and terror: an indivisible and brutal relationship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/29/cities-terror-attacks-brutal-relationship-terrorism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jan/29/cities-terror-attacks-brutal-relationship-terrorism","fields":{"headline":"Cities and terror: an indivisible and brutal relationship","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Almost 140 years ago, a wave of bombs exploded in London. Though they killed a relatively small number of people, they attracted a lot of attention. The work of Irish extremists hoping to shift public opinion and political thinking about the future of their nation lasted several years. In October 1883, one of their bloodiest attacks injured 40 people on a tube train pulling out of Paddington station. Other targets included the offices of the The Times newspaper, Nelson’s Column, the Tower of London and Scotland Yard. Throughout the decade, there were other bombings elsewhere in Europe perpetrated by various extremist groups and hitting theatres, opera houses, the French parliament and streetside cafes. In 1920, Wall Street itself was bombed. The wave of attacks prompted concern about new technologies, such as timers and dynamite, which was said to be “cheap as soap and common as sugar”, and drew debate as to how to protect cities and mass transit systems from violence. Nearly 150 years later, a spate of recent attacks in major European cities have led to similar warnings. Experts tell us how easy it is to construct a viable explosive device with instructions from the internet, and warn of how we can, or can’t, protect our public spaces from the new tactic of using vehicles as murderous rams. After a truck was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in Berlin last year, the police chief, Klaus Kandt, pointed out that with so many potential targets – 2,500 such markets in Germany and 60 in the city alone – it was impossible to reduce the risk to zero. With so many strikes in urban settings in the last two years, residents of London, Manchester, Paris, Nice, Brussels or Barcelona (to list just a few of those places which have suffered a significant attack in the last 20 months) have had little time to step back and see this latest wave of violence in any kind of longer perspective. But this is problematic. If a longer view teaches us anything about the strange times we find ourselves in, it is that the seemingly inextricable link between terror and our cities is nothing new. Of course, there were key differences in the violence of the 1880s and 1890s. Historic attacks were mostly motivated by ideologies such as anarchism and extreme versions of socialism or nationalism, and the numbers killed or wounded were minimal in comparison to today. Today, terrorists are prepared to contemplate mass casualties on a larger scale, and religious faith plays a far more central role too. The Islamic State, among others, has demonstrated a desire to outrage, not convince; to disgust and horrify, not to influence. The systematic use of vehicles as weapons is unprecedented. Yet one element remains constant – through successive waves of leftwing, rightwing, state and non-state, European or US, Middle Eastern or South Asian terrorism, the target remains the same: the city. Why? ‘The urban area continues the rebellion’ Even in the fiercest post-colonial battles of the 1940s and 50s, where confrontations happened in the bush, they were still ultimately about gaining the control of cities. The Algerian war of independence against France saw a long and intense insurgency in the hills, forests and fields of the sprawling colony, but it was the contest for power in urban areas that was crucial for nationalist forces. The climactic battle was for Algiers, and more specifically the capital’s Casbah, the labyrinth of alleys and homes of the old city which was the base of insurgents employing terrorist tactics against the French and their supporters. One key factor was the arrival of televisions in US and European homes, and radio across the Islamic world. Those fighting colonial regimes immediately recognised the implications. No one was going to report violence in the middle of nowhere. In 1956, the Algerian political activist and revolutionary Ramdane Abane wondered aloud if it was better to kill 10 enemies in a remote gully “when no one will talk of it”, or “a single man in Algiers, which will be noted the next day” by audiences in distant countries who could influence policymakers. The most intense period of urban terrorist violence in the west was the 1970s and 80s. In 1979, 1,019 attacks were perpetrated in Europe, and around 10 every week over the two decades. If much of the attention in the early part of the decade was grabbed by aerial hijackings or spectacular operations by Middle Eastern organisations. German and Italian leftist terrorists were primarily focused on urban targets. So too were Irish, Basque, Breton and other nationalists, and their diverse counterparts in the US and Latin America. Carlos Marighella, a Brazilian communist revolutionary, turned Mao and Che Guevara’s rural-focused insurgency strategy back to front. “Beginning with the city and the support of the people, the guerrilla war develops rapidly, establishing its rural infrastructure carefully while the urban area continues the rebellion,” he wrote in 1969. Inevitably perhaps, the pioneering attacks which set new standards of lethality for terrorists – such as the bombings by Islamists of embassies and military facilities in Kuwait and Lebanon in the early 1980s – took place in cities. Even the Islamist militant violence of the early 1990s, largely focused on the overthrow of local regimes with mujahideen often based in remote areas, involved a significant component of urban terrorism exported to metropolises in western Europe. In Afghanistan in the late 1990s, run-of-the-mill extremist recruits received basic training that equipped them to act as cannon fodder on front lines locally, but the best fighters were selected to receive further instruction in terrorism and urban warfare. Unsurprisingly, the major strikes from Islamic extremists overseas targeted New York in 1993, Paris in 1994, and Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam in 1998. These heralded the new wave of terrorism of today, and obscured the ongoing threat from right wing terrorists like Timothy McVeigh, who bombed Oklahoma City in 1995. Attackers learned that the psychological impact of an attack on a population was amplified when it took place in a city. Inhabitants naturally extrapolate, if this school can be raided or this train destroyed, or a bus over there hijacked, all in my town, then it can happen to me or my loved ones, too. If the urban environment offers practical assistance to the aspirant terrorist – a degree of anonymity, ease of sourcing components or funds, proximity to others in a network, communication facilities, transport – it also offers a wealth of targets. The nature of these virtually guarantees what all terrorists seek: attention. A new wave of terrorism Simply striking in a capital anywhere is a bonus for extremists set on undermining confidence in the ability of a state to protect its citizens, or of occupying powers to keep order. Bombing campaigns as diverse as that against the British in Palestine in the mid 1940s, perpetrated by hardline Jewish activists, and that in Baghdad in 2003-2005, which was largely the work of Islamic militants aided by some nationalists and Ba’athist loyalists, show just how effective this can be. The Zionist Irgun’s bombing of the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 1946, which killed 91 people, dramatically demonstrated the organisation’s capability and the weakness of the British authorities. Just over a year later, the British announced they would effectively abandon their rule in Palestine, allowing the state of Israel to come into being. In Baghdad, almost six decades later, the early targets of the militants seemed indiscriminate – the Red Cross, the Jordanian embassy, the United Nations – until it became clear that they were informed by a careful strategy of isolating the US forces from all support or assistance in their project to control the Iraqi capital. Within 18 months, diplomats from even Middle Eastern states, NGOs and the UN had all either fled the country or were confined to the bunker of the Green Zone. The US was on its own, fighting a war it couldn’t win. But it is the strikes against ordinary civilians, in pubs and bars and hotels, on trains or buses, that stay most visibly in the public consciousness. In 2004 and 2005, militants targeted commuter transport in Madrid and London. That same year al-Qaida in Iraq launched coordinated bomb attacks on three hotel luxury hotels in Amman, Jordan, killing 60 people at weddings and receptions. In 2008 a group of Pakistani jihadists attacked a luxury hotel, a Jewish centre, tourist cafes and the main train station in Mumbai, India. More than 200 people died. In Nairobi, Kenya, around 70 people were killed in 2013 by the Somalia-based al-Shabaab group in an upscale mall. An Isis gunman shot at a nightclub in Istanbul on New Year’s Eve in 2016. Al-Shabaab struck again in October last year, killing around 500 people in a single massive truck bomb on a crowded street in Mogadishu. In all these instances, terrorists were able to dominate the news agenda for several days. That such locations are in the line of fire is easily explained, and often comes down to what the city represents. Rightwingers in the US see Washington as the seat of corrupt, evil power and New York or Los Angeles as decadent and polluting. Islamic militants see similar perils in urbanisation. Often there is a historical factor; in Afghanistan, militants see Kabul as a city that has collaborated with successive overseas powers from the Soviets to the US. Or an ethnic or religious one; in Iraq, Sunni communities now see Baghdad as a hub of Shia dominance. The texts of many contemporary extremists reveal an outright animosity towards cities and urbanisation. These are often contrasted with a lost rural idyll of social harmony and justice which, though entirely invented, is a powerful vision. Mohammed Atta, the Egyptian leader of the 9/11 hijackers was a student of town planning whose master’s dissertation focused on the destruction of old parts of Aleppo to allow modern, western-style development. He saw cities as a battlefield between the old and the new, but beyond that, between an authentic Islamic and Middle Eastern identity and a westernised, faithless one. This vision of cities as a conflict zone, a place of moral and political contest, is not surprising. If a terrorist wants to strike at a way of life, then modern cities are the places to do this. The London 7/7 strikes in 2005 took place on tube trains and on a bus. But, whether selected consciously or not, all – King’s Cross, Edgware Road, Aldgate East and Tavistock Square – were representative in different ways of the cultural diversity of the UK’s capital. Recent attacks in the Sahel have hit hotels and restaurants patronised by westerners and wealthy locals. One reason investigators cited for the selection a nightclub in Bali for an attack in 2002 was that few local people were rarely allowed in. Yet beyond all of this, there may be a more fundamental reason why cities have always been so important to terrorists and to terrorism. Most experts now date the emergence of terrorism as we know it today to the second half of the 19th century. There were earlier violent activists which some suggest qualify as terrorists – the Jewish zealots who took on the Romans in early the imperial province of Judea in the first century, the medieval Assassins of the 12th century, even the religious Thuggee cult from the 14th to the 18th centuries in what was to become India. But the consensus is that it was around the time of the Paddington station attack that the strategy of using violence to sway public opinion though fear became widespread among actors such as the anarchists, leftists and nationalists looking to bring about dramatic social and political change. This strategy depended on two developments which mark the modern age: democracy and communications. Without the media, developing apace through the 19th century as literacy rates soared and cheap news publications began to achieve mass circulations, impact would be small. Without democracy, there was no point in trying to frighten a population and thus influence policymakers. Absolutist rulers, like subsequent dictators, could simply ignore the pressure from the terrified masses. Of course, a third great development of this period was conditions in the modern city itself. Could the terrorism which is so terribly familiar to us today have evolved without the development of the metropolis as we now know it? This seems almost impossible to imagine. Even the terror of the French revolution – Le Terreur – which gives us the modern term terrorism, was most obvious in the centre of Paris where the guillotine sliced heads from a relatively small number of aristocrats in order to strike fear into a much larger number of people. The history of terrorism is thus the history of our cities. The history of our cities, at least over the last 150 years or so, is in part the history of terrorism. This is a deadly, inextricable link that is unlikely to be broken anytime soon.

The pub was the Beacon, in Buttershaw, which featured heavily in the movie version of Andrea Dunbar’s play Rita, Sue and Bob Too; we were meeting to discuss the 30th anniversary of the film’s release. Back in 1987, Costigan and the rest of the cast – Michelle Holmes, who played Sue, Siobhan Finneran (Rita) and Kulvinder Ghir, who was Sue’s Asian boyfriend, Aslam – gathered for the launch of the movie at the Brighton Film Festival. Costigan recalled that the panel was left slightly nonplussed by a question from a reporter, basically asking why the actors and the director Alan Clarke had made this film, when it could obviously have no basis in reality. People didn’t really live their lives like that. It was the executive producer, Oscar Lewenstein, who stepped in to answer: “This is a report from the frontline. We’ve just dressed it up as entertainment.” Rita, Sue and Bob Too is a bleak and powerful indictment of a society that beat its poorest and most disaffected down as low as they would go, and kept them there. But it’s also very, very funny, because life – even life lived on the edge of an abyss – is funny. You have to laugh, because what’s the alternative? But it’s a joke too far for the Royal Court theatre in London, which has announced that it is no longer going to be staging a planned production of Rita, Sue and Bob Too next year. Why? According to a statement from the Royal Court and the Out of Joint theatre company, which was putting on the production: “On our stage we recently heard 150 stories of sexual harassment and abuse and therefore the staging of this work, with its themes of grooming and abuses of power on young women, on that same stage now feels highly conflictual.” Those 150 stories were part of a day of action to confront harassment and abuse in the theatre industry, which no one could find anything but laudable. But Rita, Sue and Bob Too becoming a casualty of that feels especially ironic. When the movie came out 30 years ago, it carried the tagline “Thatcher’s Britain with its knickers down”. The main narrative revolved around aspirational upper-working-class Bob, who embarks upon a sexual affair with Rita and Sue, both in their final year of high school. Describing it like that, it almost sounds like a titillating sex comedy in the vein of Confessions of a Window Cleaner. But it’s anything but. It’s sordid, and grimy, and sad. And, yes, extremely funny. But the entire point of Rita, Sue and Bob Too is that Lewenstein was right, it is a report from the frontline. It was written by Dunbar when she was just 19, and based on her own experiences in her ultimately tragic and short life. She grew up on the Buttershaw estate, where the play – and its predecessor, The Arbor – were set, and she insisted the movie was filmed on location, using local people as extras. The play, and especially the film, were divisive in Bradford at the time. There were those who didn’t appreciate the light it shone on Bradford’s shabbier corners, but at the same time Dunbar became a cause celebre in the city. Here was one of their own, writing plays and making films, a girl from the rough end of town doing things that just weren’t the preserve of working-class, council-estate kids, with no prospects other than signing on, getting pregnant and hoping for a decent flat from the local authority. Dunbar is still held up as an aspirational icon for kids living in one of the most deprived boroughs in the country. Yes, Rita, Sue and Bob Too is about abuse perpetrated by an older man on two teenage girls. Yes, it’s shocking. No, there is no tidy resolution at the end. Dunbar wasn’t one for happy endings – she died in 1990, from a brain haemorrhage suffered while she was in the Beacon pub. She was a heavy drinker, a single mother and had spent time living in a women’s refuge. The biggest irony of the Royal Court cancelling the revival of Dunbar’s celebrated play is that this was the place that first staged it in 1982, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. And therein lies the nub of the problem. In September, Stafford-Clark was forced out of Out of Joint, where he had been artistic director since 1993, after allegations of inappropriate, sexualised behaviour. The Royal Court’s statement says: “The departure of Max Stafford-Clark from Out of Joint and the recent allegations in the media have coincided with the Royal Court’s response to the spotlight on our industry and the rigorous interrogation of our own practices.” Dunbar would possibly not be surprised that as a direct result of the misbehaviour of a man, her play will no longer be staged. Dunbar did nothing but tell the truth about life, but more than a quarter of a century after her death, her truth has been deemed unpalatable. Not because of anything she has done, but because of the actions of a man. Rita, Sue and Bob Too is an important portrait of real, harsh, brutal lives in the north, leavened by humour. Because that’s what we do in the north. Abusers in positions of power in the entertainment industry have been silencing women’s voices for decades. Andrea Dunbar refused to be silenced in her lifetime by men, she stood up and told it like it was. But now the theatre where she got her first break is doing the silencing. As when seedy Bob entices Rita and Sue into his car for urgent, loveless sex, it’s almost funny, in a horrific sort of way. • David Barnett is an arts writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/14/grenfell-memorial-service-st-pauls-cathedral-families-survivors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Grenfell memorial: emotions raw as families and survivors mourn dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/14/grenfell-memorial-service-st-pauls-cathedral-families-survivors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/14/grenfell-memorial-service-st-pauls-cathedral-families-survivors","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell memorial: emotions raw as families and survivors mourn dead","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Clutching white roses and photographs of lost loved ones, the survivors and the bereaved of the Grenfell Tower fire were joined by members of the royal family, faith leaders and the prime minister at St Paul’s Cathedral to mark six months since the catastrophe. A hour-long national memorial service on Thursday, before probably the most diverse congregation ever seen at St Paul’s, saw emotions spill over, with many wiping away tears during music, prayers and a minute’s silence to remember the 71 people who died and hundreds made homeless. More than 1,500 people gathered under the magnificent dome of St Paul’s, along with five senior royals: the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Theresa May was joined by the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. The singer Adele and actor Carey Mulligan were also present, along with uniformed members of the emergency services, volunteers from the community, and children from local schools. The leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, Elizabeth Campbell, and her colleagues stayed away at the community’s request. To open the service, a Catholic priest and an imam from North Kensington carried through the congregation a banner emblazoned with the green heart of Grenfell, which has become the symbol of the community. David Ison, the dean of St Paul’s, welcomed those in the church and “all of you watching on national television, among whom are those painfully affected who could not face such a public event”. The service was screened at al-Manaar mosque and and St Clement’s church in North Kensington. “In this service we come together as people of different faiths and none, as we remember before God those whose lives were lost, and pray for them to be at peace; as we are alongside brothers and sisters who have lost their homes and their community and those they love; as we commit ourselves to care for each other and to be united in the face of suffering and sorrow; as we seek each other’s help and resolve to build on our hopes for a future in which the tragedy that struck the people of Grenfell Tower will never happen again,” Ison said. His words were followed by a Syrian musician playing the oud, a traditional instrument of the Middle East and north Africa, where many Grenfell residents had ties. A recording of survivors and the bereaved speaking was played. “So many questions to answer,” said one; “People want justice, they want someone to pay, most of these people are angry and their anger is understandable,” said another. Their anger was acknowledged by the bishop of Kensington, Graham Tomlin, in his address. “Today, we ask why warnings were not heeded; why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to,” he said. “Today we hold out hope that the public inquiry will get to the truth of all that led up to the fire at Grenfell Tower … and we trust that the truth will bring justice.” But, he added, the extraordinary grassroots response to the disaster was “a glimpse of what our society could be like; a place where we were, for a brief moment, more concerned about our neighbour’s wellbeing than we were about our own. “As we come to the end of this difficult year, as we celebrate Christmas, as we move into a new year, nothing can remove the memory of that night – nor do we want to forget those dearly loved people who were lost. “And yet my hope and prayer is that this new year can bring new hope of a future; a vision of a city where we lose our self-obsession and listen and learn from places and people that we wouldn’t normally think of reaching out to.” He added that he hoped the word Grenfell would transform over time from a symbol of “sorrow, grief or injustice” to “a symbol of the time we learned a new and better way: to listen and to love”. Prayers were said by representatives of local faith organisations. The Al-Sadiq and Al-Zahra Girls Choir, all wearing white hijabs, performed a song called Inshallah and the Ebony Steel Band played Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah. Nadia Jafari, who escaped from the fire but lost her father, Ali Yawar Jafari, read a poem by the 13th-century Persian poet Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi called Remember Me. Children from local schools scattered green paper hearts, a symbol of solidarity with the victims and survivors, around the altar. After the service Jafari said she was close to tears when reading the poem. “It’s very, very hard. Still [my mother] cries, every day, every second when we are talking about our father; all the memories come out again. It’s six months and it’s still very hard for us,” she said. As the service began, Kensington and Chelsea council observed a minute’s silence at its town hall. Campbell said she had not attended to “respect the wishes of those involved in the service”, adding: “I want them to know that we will be thinking of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/14/dawid-malan-close-to-tears-after-maiden-century-third-cricket-ashes-test-england-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T13:13:58Z","webTitle":"Dawid Malan close to tears after his maiden century in third Ashes Test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/14/dawid-malan-close-to-tears-after-maiden-century-third-cricket-ashes-test-england-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/14/dawid-malan-close-to-tears-after-maiden-century-third-cricket-ashes-test-england-australia","fields":{"headline":"Dawid Malan close to tears after his maiden century in third Ashes Test","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dawid Malan joked about overcoming the jump from facing “78mph dibbly-dobblies” in county cricket to a phalanx of Australia fast bowlers at the Waca after a maiden Test century for England that left him close to tears upon reaching the milestone. The 30-year-old arrived at the start of the tour as one of three “no-name” batsmen in the England lineup, according to the former opener Matthew Hayden and sections of the local press. But he will leave with his reputation having leapt like the speeds he is now facing out in the middle. His unbeaten 110 in Perth – one of bravery, skill and attacking intent – was witnessed by his parents, who had flown over from South Africa to watch their son in action. When he pulled Josh Hazlewood for four to prompt the fist-pumping celebrations, his thoughts turned to them. “It was so emotional. I didn’t really know what to do,” said Malan, who embraced his mother, Janet, when he left the field at the close. “I almost started crying, to be honest. To do it in front of them, the amount of sacrifices my old man and mother have made along the way to get me here, it’s nice to repay them for all the time they’ve given me.” Malan was born in Roehampton, south-west London, but went to school in Paarl, 40 miles from Cape Town, before returning to England for a gap year of playing and coaching. His father, Dawid Sr, played league cricket in Middlesex and it was there the left-hander caught the county’s attention and turned professional. Speaking after the close on day one, and still beaming at his breakthrough innings after three previous half-centuries, Malan admitted his 11 years in the domestic system had not quite prepared him for the challenge of facing Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Hazlewood. He said: “You play county cricket and you’re more worried about your front pad getting blown off, or nicking off to 78mph dibbly-dobblies. So I’ve really enjoyed the challenge of facing these guys: not only technically, but they test your heart as well.” While a prominent Lions players in the past two years – and a consistent first-class run-scorer in the last four – it was his 78 from 44 balls on his Twenty20 debut against South Africa in June that demonstrated to the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, that his temperament might transfer to Test cricket. Sent sprawling by a Kagiso Rabada yorker on the debut that followed, and grinding out fifties against West Indies, it is fair to say he was not feared by Australia at the start of this series, with Hayden’s comments about him, Mark Stoneman and James Vince certainly registering. Malan said: “Every time you open a newspaper [here] you’re reading about how bad you are. It’s nice to tick a box and prove to yourself you can play at this level. With anything you do, it’s self-belief. You need to feel like you belong. “I might never get a run again in Test cricket but I have that belief I need to perform at this level. I was under a bit of pressure coming into the game. So it was nice to score some runs, and when the team needed it. I feel I’ve played pretty well in the other games. It was just making sure that when I did get in I was ruthless enough to get through the tough periods.” Though streaky early on when Australia’s quicks were roaring in, during the afternoon – one four pinged off the helmet and was wrongly given as runs, while a top‑edged six off Starc flew over the keeper – Malan soon settled down in a controlled innings that, with Jonny Bairstow’s 75 not out from No6, turned a troubling 131 for four into a promising 305 for four by the close. On 92 he was dropped at second slip by Cameron Bancroft off Starc. But this, explained Malan at the close, was crucial in clearing his mind before registering the first Test century by an England batsman this series. He added: “I’m thinking I’m two or three shots away from scoring a hundred, and I premeditated that shot a little bit, set him up to clip him through mid-wicket. It was good to get me back in my box. I walked out today and I thought, I’ve got nothing to lose. See ball, hit ball. It was my day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-a-close-political-ally-of-pm-but-caught-up-in-a-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T22:03:46Z","webTitle":"Damian Green: a close political ally of PM, but caught up in a scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-a-close-political-ally-of-pm-but-caught-up-in-a-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-a-close-political-ally-of-pm-but-caught-up-in-a-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Damian Green: a close political ally of PM, but caught up in a scandal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Damian Green is one of Theresa May’s closest political allies and the man credited with putting her shattered team back together again after the Tories’ disastrous general election campaign. Green, who was work and pensions secretary, was elevated to first secretary of state and touted as the man May felt she could trust the most, after the departure of her close aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. Green went to Oxford with May in the 1970s and he served in the Home Office under her until he was sacked by David Cameron. But it was several years earlier that his feud began with the former most senior counterterrorism officer Bob Quick, which formed a key plank of the Cabinet Office investigation into Green by Sue Gray. Green’s other close ally in the cabinet is David Davis, who was shadow home secretary in 2006, when Green was a shadow minister. Davis was approached by a Tory-voting civil servant working in the Home Office under Labour, who said he was prepared to leak damaging information to the Tories. The documents, which were handled by Green, made headlines in the Daily Mail, the Sunday Telegraph and other papers. The Cabinet Office called in Scotland Yard to investigate, with Quick, an assistant commissioner, assigned to the job. The civil servant, Christopher Galley, was pinpointed as the source and Quick was advised that he may have committed misconduct in a public office. Galley and Green were arrested in 2008 and police raided his parliamentary office, which caused huge political controversy. Green’s lawyers argued that the material seized in the search, including that discovered on his computers, was covered by parliamentary privilege. As recriminations flew within the Met about the handling of the case, Quick publicly accused the Tories of trying to undermine his investigation into Green and “acting in a wholly corrupt way”. He also accused them of briefing stories about his private business interests in the Mail on Sunday, which the party denied. Quick stepped down four months later over a separate embarrassing security leak. The whole matter lay dormant until this year. Meanwhile, Green became a minister under Cameron, though he lost his post in 2014. When May became prime minister, he was made secretary of state for work and pensions and then first secretary, May’s de-facto deputy. However, in the autumn, the shockwaves of the Harvey Weinstein scandal were reverberating in Westminster. Kate Maltby, who is 30 years younger than Green, described in an article in the Times how she believed Green appeared to solicit sex from her in exchange for political mentoring. The Conservative activist said she met Green in a Waterloo pub, where she said the MP offered to help her take steps towards becoming a candidate. She alleged that Green had touched her knee during the meeting, as he mentioned that his own wife was “very understanding”. Maltby described a conversation where Green repeatedly mentioned the extramarital affairs of acquaintances, then she said she “felt a fleeting hand against my knee – so brief it was almost deniable”. The activist said she avoided Green after their encounter but, in 2016, subsequently wrote a piece for the Times where she was pictured wearing a corset. Green then texted her unprompted, she said, saying: “Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid, I feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?” After the message from Green, Maltby said she did not reply but that day she privately messaged a number of friends expressing concern, including an Evening Standard journalist who published the messages earlier this month. After the article was published, he said the meeting was “two friends agreeing to meet for a regular catchup – and nothing more ... This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend”. Maltby declined to comment before the investigation was concluded. The Cabinet Office launched an investigation into Green, but more revelations then came in the Sunday Times, which published allegations by Quick that “extreme pornography” had been found on his parliamentary computer in 2008. Neil Lewis, the former Scotland Yard officer who examined the computer, then also told the BBC that the internet history on the device showed pornography had been viewed extensively. Green claimed he was the victim of an “unscrupulous character assassination” and said the claims amounted to “false, disreputable political smears from a discredited police officer acting in flagrant breach of his duty to keep the details of police investigations confidential”. The investigation has been ongoing for seven weeks, during which time both Quick and Maltby have come under fire in the press. Davis, now the Brexit secretary, is said to have privately let it be known that he would resign in protest were Green to be forced out based on Quick’s allegations alone. The inquiry also examined whether allies of the first secretary of state influenced a piece by the Mail’s Andrew Pierce that called Maltby “one very pushy lady” and said she was “determined to make it in politics – whatever the cost”. The piece, which drew significant criticism after it was published, suggested Maltby’s parents were “aghast at what she had done” by accusing Green, which she denies. Her supporters have suggested that influencing the article would be a breach of the ministerial code. Quick has come under fire for his role in the unfolding scandal, prompting Cressida Dick, the Met’s commissioner, to say that former officers who speak out about investigations could face prosecution. The former officer has in turn threatened legal action against Green for “deeply hurtful attempts to discredit me.” After the report was released, finding that Green breached the ministerial code for “inaccurate and misleading” denials about the presence of pornography on his computer, May asked her close ally to resign. The letter May sent accepting his resignation acknowledged their personal history, commending his “great wisdom, good sense and a commitment to helping the most vulnerable”. “I am extremely sad to be writing this letter,” she wrote. “We have been friends and colleagues throughout our whole political lives – from our early days at university, entering the House of Commons at the same election and serving alongside each other both in opposition and in government.” The report found Maltby’s account “plausible” but said it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion with competing accounts of a private meeting. In her reply to Green, May said everyone who “wants to play their part in our political life should feel able to do so – without fear of harassment and knowing they can speak out if they need to”.The Conservative party is still engulfed in several unresolved disputes about sexual harrassment. Junior trade minister Mark Garnier is, like Green, being investigated by the Cabinet Office after he admitted asking his former assistant to buy sex toys. Several other MPs are also still under investigation. Dan Poulter, MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, and Daniel Kawczynski, who represents Shrewsbury, have been referred to the Conservative party’s internal body after complaints were made against them. Both deny any wrongdoing. Another Tory MP, Charlie Elphicke, has been suspended by the party following serious allegations that have been passed to the police. Elphicke said he had not been informed of the nature of the allegations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/14/manu-tuilagi-on-verge-of-comeback-from-injury-leicester-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T12:48:14Z","webTitle":"Manu Tuilagi on verge of comeback for Leicester after knee injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/14/manu-tuilagi-on-verge-of-comeback-from-injury-leicester-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/14/manu-tuilagi-on-verge-of-comeback-from-injury-leicester-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Manu Tuilagi on verge of comeback for Leicester after knee injury","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Those who believe Manu Tuilagi will never again be his old dominant force for club and country could swiftly be changing their tune, according to those who have overseen his latest period of rehabilitation. The Leicester and England centre is on the verge of a return to action and his coaches believe it is his opponents who should be most apprehensive. Tuilagi has not played since the season’s opening weekend when he damaged a knee against Bath, having previously been sidelined by groin, hamstring and knee injuries. The 26-year-old centre even visited a witch-doctor in Samoa this year in an effort to get his career back on track, and is now hoping to resume playing either on Sunday against Munster or against Saracens next weekend. In the view of Leicester’s assistant coach Geordan Murphy, however, Tuilagi still has plenty of years of top-level rugby in him and, with fatherhood also beckoning next year, is due a change of luck when he pulls on a Tigers jersey again. “I’m a firm believer there’s only so much that can go wrong,” said Murphy, no stranger to injuries during his own illustrious career with Leicester and Ireland. “If he can get it all right hopefully he can add time to the end of his career. People forget Manu is only a young man. He’s got another seven or eight years in him. Hopefully it’ll teach him to listen to his body and look after it.” The remarkable impact an in-form Tuilagi can supply has not always been matched by the resilience of the ligaments supporting his powerful limbs, nor the smartness of some of his off-field decisions. His last start for England was three years ago although he did make one appearance off the replacements’ bench in 2016. In August he was sent home early from an England training camp following a late-night drinking foray with Sale’s Denny Solomona. Murphy and Leicester’s director of rugby, Matt O’Connor, both believe, however, that Tuilagi will be fine if his body can cope with the initial shock of playing competitive rugby again and he successfully channels the frustration of recent months. “It’s really tough for any player who gets a long-term injury,” Murphy said. “I always describe it as a tunnel. The first month when you’re on crutches and you’re hobbling around you just don’t see any light at the end of it. You just think: ‘How am I ever going to get back?’ It’s really nice when you hit the halfway point, can finally see that light and the improvement accelerates.” Leicester, having been well beaten in Limerick, are also hoping their Australian centre Matt Toomua and the recently arrived Wallaby hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau will soon be involved alongside Tuilagi. “The medics are very happy with Manu’s knee,” said O’Connor, who described Tuilagi last week as “the best 13 in the world” when fully fit. “They think he is well and truly over that and it is just the rigours of being back and playing. We would be a lot less concerned about his knee than the rest of him, just because he hasn’t done it.” A potential space in the matchday 23 has opened up following the broken jaw sustained last Saturday by the full-back Telusa Veainu, who also believes Tuilagi can help transform Leicester’s season. “He offers a whole different ball game, not only for us but the opposition as well,” the Tongan international said. “If they take their eye off him he’ll punish you. You have to mark up someone like Manu, which opens up a lot of space out wide.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/29/juliet-rylance-mark-bbc-new-year-playing-a-moll-in-mcmafia-the-russians-taught-us-how-to-kiss","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Juliet Rylance on playing a moll in McMafia: 'The Russians taught us how to kiss'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/29/juliet-rylance-mark-bbc-new-year-playing-a-moll-in-mcmafia-the-russians-taught-us-how-to-kiss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/29/juliet-rylance-mark-bbc-new-year-playing-a-moll-in-mcmafia-the-russians-taught-us-how-to-kiss","fields":{"headline":"Juliet Rylance on playing a moll in McMafia: 'The Russians taught us how to kiss'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For far too long, mob dramas have focused almost entirely on the Italian mafia, from The Sopranos right back to The Godfather. What has not been adequately explored is the rise of their Russian counterparts. True, TV has teemed in recent years with Russian baddie stereotypes, most notably Galina “Red” Reznikov in Orange Is the New Black, but they’ve tended to be racist creations, psychopaths-by-numbers, generally played by non-Russians. Juliet Rylance is hoping the new BBC drama series she is starring in can change all that. In McMafia, freely adapted from Misha Glenny’s mordant bestselling analysis of the new globalised world of organised crime, she plays Rebecca Harper, a woman who is waking up to the fact that Alex Godman, the love of her life, may be losing his idealistic soul to his crime family’s values, turning into the sort of thug who gets his goons to whack foes by poisoning them with polonium. This, she realises, would leave her little more than a mobster’s moll. The rounded Russia that emerges from McMafia is not just a land of sharpsuited goons or Putineseque hard men, but also the civilised home of Chekhov and Dostoevsky. And the Russians, Rylance points out, are actually played by Russians. “That kept us honest,” she says. “The two wonderful actors who played Alex’s parents would say, ‘You know, in Russia we would never say it like this’; or, ‘I would give him two kisses here.’ And the director would take all that on board.” Will lovely Alex, the English-raised son of Russian gangsters exiled to London, take over the family firm from his ailing dad? Can it be true that this banker at Goldman Sachs, played by James Norton, is going to infuse his hedge fund with laundered heroin money? Is he becoming like Al Pacino in The Godfather III (“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in)?” And, please God no, is Rylance destined to suffer the same fate as Diane Keaton? Rylance is torn about her character. “When I first read the script, I thought, ‘Come on, Rebecca. You’ve got to see something’s going awry and he’s not telling you the truth.’ Then I thought, ‘How amazing to have a character who has such confidence and feels so secure in her relationship.’” Good grief, I say to the 38-year-old, as we chat over coffee in London. While it’s true that Norton incarnates his character just as stirringly as he did hunky Prince Andrei in the BBC’s War and Peace last year, isn’t Rebecca nuts to trust Alex? “I don’t think so. It takes amazing strength of character to go, ‘I really trust this person. I’m going to believe what they tell me is true.’” Or stupid? Rylance giggles. “I think that’s a large part of who Rebecca is. She will give someone the benefit of the doubt. I like that about her.” Although she is a Rada graduate, Rylance cut her teeth in the US. “I went out for six months to see what was happening,” she says, “and ended up staying for six years. I love the theatre scene in New York, and became part of it. It’s very tight-knit community full of wonderful people. I’ve always loved that.” There was more to Rylance’s Atlantic crossing than that, though. One lure was Christian Camargo, the American actor she met in 1997, at the inaugural season of the Globe theatre in London, where she was working with her stepfather, the actor and director Mark Rylance. (She was born Juliet van Kampen to composer Claire and architect Chris, but the couple divorced when she was seven and her mother married Mark.) “Back then,” Camargo told the New York Times, “Juliet was the boss’s untouchable daughter.” Not for long. Rylance married Camargo in New York in 2008. Two years later, they performed together there as Rosalind and Orlando in As You Like It, one critic describing their on-stage courtship as “an elaborate, gender-bending masquerade”. And in 2012, she starred in and produced the film Days and Nights directed by Camargo and based on Chekhov’s The Seagull. The couple now have homes in London and Joshua Tree, California. McMafia was created for TV by Hossein Amini, who wrote 2011’s existential thriller Drive, and James Watkins, who directed The Woman in Black in 2012. According to Watkins, the drama is about the protagonist finding “the Russian bear under the bowler hat”, while Amini – a Tehran-born British-raised screenwriter – poured into Alex his own experience of exile and being an outsider at an English public school. “I was always getting called wog and darkie,” he says. “I imagined Alex used to get called yid or Russkie.” Near the end of episode one, Rebecca delivers a showpiece speech to a room full of wealthy philanthropists. She is now working for a foundation set up by a tycoon who made his billions unethically but now wants to do something good. “We live in a globalised hyperconnected world,” says Rebecca, as guests sip cocktails and rattle their jewellery. “A system designed to create wealth for all has been exploited by a few to create unparalleled inequality. The problem doesn’t lie with capitalism but with those who have put short-term gain above the good of the people.” Does Rylance believe all this dubious guff Amini wrote for her character? Does she truly believe in ethical capitalism? “I really do!” she says. “I feel, like Rebecca, ethical capitalism is really possible. And more than possible – I think it’s necessary, otherwise it’s all going down.” But, to put it mildly, a banker claiming that capitalism can give itself an ethical makeover is quite a stretch, financial greed having destroyed the global economy nearly a decade ago. “It is a stretch,” she says, “but it is possible. That said, I would also call myself a socialist. Rebecca wouldn’t. I think the only bad thing is having a fundamentalist viewpoint.” To give a sense of where she’s coming from politically, Rylance tells me that she has recently become an ambassador for Peace One Day, the non-profit organisation set up by her friend and fellow actor Jeremy Gilley to increase awareness of World Peace Day, which is on 21 September every year. “Why I’m bringing it up is because last year these studies found that Peace Day is the day when there was least violence around the world.” Why would that be? “Because two billion people were aware of Peace Day. That’s quite incredible. That tells me that wonderful Margaret Mead quote is right.” What the late American anthropologist said was: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” Perhaps, Rylance’s argument goes, good citizens can make capitalism work better for the worst off. After McMafia, we will see her again in spring – alongside Andie MacDowell and Chris O’Dowd in Love After Love, the directorial debut of Russell Harbaugh that is already being compared to Woody Allen’s Bergmanesque Interiors for its melancholy portrayal of an American family dramatically unravelling. She’s cast as another Rebecca, this time one whose father-in-law, a writer played by O’Dowd, is dying of an unspecified illness. “Russ made a beautiful book of paintings and images and films to watch and stories to read. He gave them to the whole cast. He was especially eager that we watched the films of Maurice Pialat.” Pialat is the French long-take, seedy-atmospherics merchant who gave us, among other gems, an early sighting of Isabelle Huppert and Gerard Depardieu in Loulou. “So the whole cast were immersed in that world,” adds Rylance. “That was a real gift. I hope to have that on every film.” I take a sidelong glance at Rylance. Soignée, glamorous and enviably content, she admits she’s looking forward to leaving dirty old London for the Californian desert. “The weather’s so amazing at this time of year in Joshua Tree,” she says. “We get flash floods and all these wild plants emerge. Some of the plants that are coming up right now haven’t been seen in the desert for 150 years.” As we finish up, she invites me out to stay.

That does mean that the Peterborough Chase, re-routed to the West Country from Huntingdon’s abandoned meeting last Sunday, will finally get a winner, though only five of the original 10 entries have turned up and Top Notch (2.45) should take the spoils with a minimum of fuss. The remainder of the card is far more competitive, however, with Colin Tizzard’s runners Cucklington (1.05) and Molineaux (2.10) looking like the pick of the morning prices. Cucklington is on a hat-trick and 12lb higher in the weights than for his first success of the season at Plumpton in early November, but he has been winning with something in hand and recording good times in the process. Molineux has yet to get his head in front after eight starts, but also arrives on the back of a career-best performance when third in a Class Two at Ascot. The slight drop in grade should be enough to get him onto the score sheet. Nicky Henderson is odds-on to win the Peterborough Chase and could well complete an across-the-codes double when Bardd (8.15) makes a belated debut on the Flat at Chelmsford City on Thursday evening. His recent efforts over hurdles have not built on the promise of his early outings, but his two runs in bumpers in 2016 are more than a match for any of the form his rivals can offer in the weakest race on card. Steel Train (7.15), who returned to winning form last time out, and You’re Cool (7.45), who is on a hat-trick over course and distance, will also take some beating on the same card.

Everybody loves a good book, right? But wait. What about those who don’t read? (Take it from me, these people exist. I’ve seen them. I’m even friends with a few.) Now you and me, we know that books are great. Books enrich, educate and entertain. People who read books are smarter, nicer, more attractive. People who don’t read books live grey, humdrum, fiction-free lives, bereft of that essential spark that infuses the lives of us readers, allows us to walk on clouds, hear choirs of angels and piss rainbows. Me? I have taken the title of the 10th volume in Anthony Powell’s A Dance to the Music of Time sequence – Books Do Furnish A Room – quite literally; I have shelves groaning with volumes, books in piles on the floor, books spread out in the loft like extra insulation. I love books so much that I write them too; actually, my livelihood depends on other people loving books, particularly mine. And yet. I always feel a vague disquiet when I’m confronted by assertions from avid readers, generally on social media, that those who don’t read books are in some way inferior, or if they’re feeling charitable, to be pitied. Some days you can barely move for endless tweets of that John Waters quote: “If you go home with somebody, and they don’t have books, don’t fuck ’em!” Or, at a quick glance: “Stay away from people who don’t read books.” “I feel bad for the people who don’t read books.” “NO LONGER SPEAKING TO PEOPLE WHO DON’T READ BOOKS.” “I’m so sad for people who don’t read books.” Or: “I’m not saying people who don’t read books are dumb, I just think it’s weird.” And on, and on, and on. It’s natural that readers are evangelical about books. We love to make recommendations, and receive them in turn. Like old Holden Caulfield says in The Catcher in the Rye, after a particularly good book: “You wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.” Social media gives us these chances. My Twitter is an echo-chamber of book lovers – writers, readers, publishers, agents, librarians, bloggers – but that can lull a person into a false sense that the world is full of happy bibliophiles. And that perhaps makes it harder for us to understand why people don’t read books, and even mistrust them. Which is a very curious thing. Books expand our minds and give us a greater understanding of the world around us; yet, a lot of readers persist in looking down on those who don’t read. And there might be many, many reasons for why they don’t. Definitely buy books for the non-readers who simply can’t afford them, as libraries around the UK close their doors at an alarming rate. And there are those who would read, but don’t have the time: anyone who’s brought up a child or two will know the brain-numbing exhaustion of just living through a day, the sensation of staring at a jumble of words on a page, reading the same page or paragraph or line over and over, and never getting any further. But some people just don’t need books. Perhaps they get their narrative fix from TV, or movies, or video games. They might get all the drama and passion and sense of belonging they need from sport. They could prefer the instant, real-time hit of breaking news for their view of the world, or be happy with the understanding of human nature they get from social media or real-life friends. Reading is important. Literacy skills are vital. Children’s reading drops off massively after the age of eight, which can cause problems in adult life. But being literate and having a love of books are two different things. Books might furnish your walls, and you’re fully entitled to not have sex with people who don’t own books – but this Christmas, don’t buy books to “fix” people who don’t want them. Send them to me instead.

I’ve rather let the inbox grow, and I would like to trim it. Manual deletion would take forever. Yes, I know I should have archived important, useful emails. Slapped wrists! Alan You may be surprised at how easy it is to delete thousands of Gmail messages with just a couple of clicks. The tricky bit is deleting the emails you don’t want while keeping the ones you do. Computers are stupid and do what you tell them to do, which may not be what you intended. This is why you should take a backup before embarking on an email delete-fest, but I’ll discuss that later. Otherwise, you don’t say why you want to trim your inbox. Do you want to declare “email bankruptcy” and clear out everything received after a certain date? If so, you could turn over a new leaf on New Year’s Day. Or have you, like me, run out of storage space? If so, you’ll have to keep deleting emails in order to keep using Gmail. Inbox zero Merlin Mann popularised the idea of Inbox Zero in a Google TechTalk in July 2007. Mann was a fan of David Allen’s Getting Things Done, and created the 43Folders system. Both work well for many people, but not for me. Instead, I recommend Oliver Burkeman’s Guardian story, Why time management is ruining our lives. As Mann told Burkemann: “Eventually, I realised something. Email is not a technical problem. It’s a people problem. And you can’t fix people.” Either way, you can certainly improve your Gmail inbox management, and move the clutter out of the way. Taming Gmail Start by turning off Google’s “inbox for dummies” feature. (You can always turn it on later.) To do that, go to Settings, click Inbox, and set “Inbox type” to default. Next, in the Categories section, untick all Google’s categories: primary, social, promotions, updates, and forums. Now you can see your real email … Look through your emails to find the large categories, which may well be social updates, forum comments, newsletters and so on. Go through each in turn and decide how you want to treat it. First, do you really want it? If not, turn it off at the source. Unsubscribe. Second, do you want to look at these emails later, or do you want to keep them as searchable records? If so, go to the “filters and blocked addresses” tab in settings and create a filter that labels them (Facebook, Twitter, Quora, etc) and puts them straight into a “folder” without them ever appearing in your inbox (skip inbox). Once you’ve created a filter, you can get Gmail to process all your old emails in the same way. In other words, Archive them so they disappear from your inbox. Be particularly careful with things you really want to keep, such as records of orders, invoices, payment confirmations, and so on. When you search for emails, you should use the “from:” command as well as the email address. For example, search for from:invoices@megacorp.com because otherwise you may get false positives where Megacorp’s email address is mentioned in the text. Finally, create a new label called Oldmail, or something similar, and move all the remaining mail from Inbox to Oldmail. To do this, click the down arrow in the upper left, above your list of emails, and select All. (The other options include read, unread and starred.) You will then be offered the option to “Select all 105,392 conversations in Inbox” or whatever. Select them all, then go to “Move to” and select your label/folder name (Oldmail). You have now achieved “fake inbox zero” and you can clear out any incoming emails, preferably at a set time every day. Alternatively, you could keep all of this week’s emails in your inbox, or this month’s, or this year’s, or whatever you like. To do this, use the search term before: with your chosen date, eg before:2017/12/01. Other search commands include after:, older:, and newer:. You could find last year’s emails using “after:2015/12/31 before:2017/01/01”. Saving space After a couple of hours searching and filtering, you will probably have deleted thousands of emails, but you may still be short of storage space. Most text emails are small. If you want to have a real impact, delete the emails that have attachments. For example, I used to have more than 50 emails with 10MB or larger attachments. I still have 58 emails larger than 5MB, and 496 larger than 3MB. Deleting those would save me at least 2GB. To find these large emails, use the size: command, and work your way down. Search for size:10m then try size:5m and size:2m depending on the sort of stuff you have stored in Gmail. (Google’s version, via the down-arrow in the Search box, offers “has:attachment larger:3M”.) You can also target older attachments by using a search command such as “size:7m before:2012/01/01” or “size:10m older_than:1y” etc. Delete the emails you don’t need. Unfortunately, Gmail does not allow you to delete an attachment while keeping the email. You can forward it and keep the text, but then you lose the date and any threading, if the email was part of a conversation. Dittach, which offers a Gmail tool, tells me it’s working on the problem. Also note that you may not save any space if you save an attachment to Google Drive. Google has been subtracting your Google Drive and Google+ Photos from your email storage space since it last increased the allowance in 2013. Backups Google can lock you out of your email or delete your account at any time for any reason, and you can never be certain of getting it back. Worse, your Gmail account could be hacked. It’s important to have one or more backups. My first line of defence is a backup account at Microsoft’s Outlook.com. When you have set one up, go to Gmail’s Settings and click on “Forwarding and POP/IMAP”. Set it to “Forward a copy of incoming mail to” your new account, and “keep Gmail’s copy in the Inbox”. Also, tell Outlook.com to fetch all your email from your Gmail account. (This can take some time.) If I can’t access Gmail, I can switch to Outlook.com, though I assume Gmail will start bouncing my emails once my inbox is full. You can also keep copies of all your Gmails on your PC hard drive, using an email program such as Microsoft Outlook (the Office program) or Thunderbird. Select IMAP to download copies of your emails while leaving the originals on the Gmail server. You can also use Google Takeout to download your Gmail in Mbox format, though it’s not too much use outside of Thunderbird. However, you can use Mbox Viewer to view it. There are lots of alternatives including Upsafe and MailStore Home 10, both of which are Windows only. You can also set up an automatic sync in open source Gmvault, which is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux. However, it’s a command line program, which won’t suit everyone.

Unsworth, who started work with the BBC on local radio in 1980, is to replace James Harding, who announced his departure in October. In her most recent role, as director of the BBC World Service Group, Unsworth oversaw the biggest expansion of the broadcaster’s international arm since the 1940s. “We are living through a period of significant change at home and abroad. In a complex world, the BBC’s journalism matters more than ever,” Unsworth said on Friday. Harding is to set up a media company that he said will offer “a clear point of view”, a perspective the impartial corporation is not allowed to provide. The former editor of the Times newspaper was on a £340,000 salary. The BBC said Unsworth’s salary would be revealed later “as part of the usual disclosure arrangements”. She will oversee news and current affairs programming and sit on the BBC’s executive committee. Tony Hall, the BBC director general, said: “The director of news and current affairs is one of the most demanding of any in broadcasting. News is at the very heart of the BBC. I am delighted Fran Unsworth is taking up the role. She brings a combination of excellent news judgment, authority, management knowhow, and the trust of her colleagues both in news and across the BBC.” Unsworth had been considered the internal favourite for the post. Other names mentioned included the director of radio and former Labour minister James Purnell, and the editor of News at Six and News at Ten, Paul Royall. Unsworth’s previous roles at the BBC include network radio producer in Washington DC, positions with Radio 4’s The World At One and PM, home news editor, head of political programmes and head of newsgathering. She already has experience in her new role as she was acting director of news and current affairs between November 2012 and June 2013. She was appointed director of the BBC World Service Group on 8 December 2014. In an interview with BBC NewsWatch about his successor, Harding said: “I chose Fran when I joined as my deputy and she has been an extraordinary person to work with. “For people who don’t know her, Fran’s worked at the BBC for pretty much her entire career and knows and understands it, most recently she was running the BBC World Service. “What you see with Fran is an incredibly thoughtful manager of people, a really intelligent judge of news and a fantastic ambassador for the BBC. “But most of all what she has is the capacity to enable great people to do exceptional work and when you are the director of news and current affairs - that’s the thing you really want to do. It’s not what you do, the leadership of the organisation is enabling other people to do great things and no one does that better in my experience than Fran.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/15/every-day-i-am-crushed-the-stateless-man-held-without-trial-by-australia-for-eight-years","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T17:00:32Z","webTitle":"'Every day I am crushed': the stateless man held without trial by Australia for eight years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/every-day-i-am-crushed-the-stateless-man-held-without-trial-by-australia-for-eight-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/every-day-i-am-crushed-the-stateless-man-held-without-trial-by-australia-for-eight-years","fields":{"headline":"'Every day I am crushed': the stateless man held without trial by Australia for eight years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Said Imasi is a man without a past: a man, it seems, without a future. He doesn’t know where he was born, or when. He has few documents to demonstrate who he is or where he comes from. He believes, but cannot prove, he was born in Spain’s Canary Islands, to a mother from Western Sahara – a barren, contested wedge of land in north-west Africa. He knows nothing about his father. Orphaned as a child, he was trafficked into mainland Europe where he was kept as a house slave in Belgium before escaping, living on the streets of Paris and Frankfurt, and falling in with criminal gangs in Norway. He has lived a life on the peripheries of every society he has known and concedes that includes an existence sometimes outside of the law. He admits to travelling on false passports, he says, because it is impossible for a person without a country to gain one legitimately. Imasi arrived in Australia – by plane and intending only to pass through – in January 2010. But he has been detained in this country – without allegation, charge, or trial – for nearly eight years. It has cruelled his physical health and sent him plunging into depths of suicidal depression. Imasi is stateless – there is no country on earth that accepts him as their citizen – and his case appears to have confounded Australian authorities. In five separate reports to parliament, the commonwealth ombudsman has urged the immigration department, in increasingly strident terms, to consider releasing him into the community. Each time Imasi has been refused. Now, the United Nations human rights committee’s working group on arbitrary detention has told Australia its ongoing detention of Imasi is unlawful, indefinite and arbitrary and he has been denied his right to challenge his incarceration before a court. “Seeking asylum is not a criminal act; on the contrary, seeking asylum is a universal human right,” the working group said. It said Australia’s “extraordinary lengthy detention” of Imasi, and its failure to properly assess his case, was unjustified and unreasonable. Imasi’s case was an “extreme example of statelessness”, the group found. “Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Imasi immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law.” The working group cannot compel the Australian government to release Imasi or make a final determination on his migration status but it has consistently criticised Australia’s policy fallback of simply incarcerating complex migration cases without sufficient effort to resolve them. It has repeatedly said Australia’s use of indefinite unchallengeable detention was “arbitrary”, “disproportionate” and in breach of international law. In November Australia was elected to the human rights committee, after a years-long campaign for a position on the influential UN body. Imasi speaks to the Guardian by phone from immigration detention on Christmas Island. He speaks fluent English, his “ninth or 10th language” he says, and one learned in detention. “I have no words to explain to you how difficult it is to cope in this system,” he says. “Every day I am crushed, every day is another life sentence. And there is nothing I can do.” ‘They told me I had no choices’ Imasi was born on or about 27 March 1989. He doesn’t know his exact birthdate, nor precisely where he was born. He believes he is from Western Sahara. More than 40 years of conflict has failed to find a peaceable solution to the oppressed, and essentially stateless, people of that place. But Imasi believes his mother may have travelled to the Canary Islands to give birth to him there. If that were so, he may be entitled to Spanish citizenship. But he has no way to prove it. Imasi never knew his father, who died before he was born, and believes he spent his early life, with his mother, in refugee camps in Western Sahara or Algeria. His mother died when he was about six years old. After being passed between a succession of orphanages, Imasi was trafficked into mainland Europe through Las Palmas, Madrid and to Paris, where he lived on the streets. He was kept in Belgium as a houseboy – essentially a slave – for years. He never went to school. After fleeing servitude, he fled and spent several years floating between cities, living on the streets at times, finding more stable accommodation when he could. He drifted north, across the North Sea, to Norway, arriving in 2004. It was here where Imasi lived the most stable and peaceful period of his life. Imasi says he fell in with a criminal gang, described in Australian government documents as a “mafia-style drug gang” operating across northern Europe. He was a young teenager, he says, and easily manipulated. “I was very young and I became friends with people in a small gang,” he says. “We survived, we helped each other. I was just a child. I was thinking, ‘This is what life is like.’ But it was OK. In Europe nobody locks you up. You are treated like a human being. I live a straight life, like a bird in the jungle.” Still barely a teenager, he began working as a courier for the gang. “Because I never had a family, this gang became like the family I never had,” he says. “I was living in the street, like normal, and I started doing this work, ‘take this bag’, ‘go to this city’. They gave me money, I didn’t ask questions.” In discussion, Imasi is open in admitting that the gang’s activities were outside the law and his activities too. But, at that time he says, he felt he had no choice. His only conviction came at 14, when he was arrested on a drugs charge and for a sex crime with a teenaged girl who was under the age of consent. Her father, when their relationship was uncovered, insisted on pressing charges. Imasi was incarcerated for three months. But it was through juvenile detention that Imasi’s life took on a semblance of normality. Released, Imasi was assisted to enrol in school, the first he had attended, and helped into supported accommodation. He joined an athletics club, where he showed promise as a sprinter. “They let me out in community – they give me house, give me school,” he says. “I joined a running club and met a nice Norwegian community. I started to know a lot of people.” His old running club – Asker Skiklubb – still has pictures of a teenaged Imasi competing from 2006 in its online archives. “I had a normal life,” Imasi says of that brief period in his life. “I can’t ask for anything more than that. But the gang [was] always hanging over my head. “The gang doesn’t like to lose anyone, it didn’t want to lose me.” The group that had supported him expected unswerving loyalty, Imasi says. He says he was threatened by senior gang members and feared for his life. Having lived a life outside the law, and never knowing its protection, he says he felt he couldn’t go to the police. “I didn’t feel safe. I got my friend’s passport and I thought, ‘I have to go somewhere I can be safe.’” He had learned about New Zealand at school. “I bought a one-way plane ticket.” Australia was only ever supposed to be a stopover. But it proved one that would change the course of Imasi’s life. After his flight landed in Melbourne, Imasi allegedly tried to destroy the passport he was carrying – in the name of Yassin Youssef – because he wanted to present as arriving from Western Sahara, rather than a European country from which, he felt, a claim for protection would be less likely to succeed. He was detained by immigration officers at Tullamarine. After extensive questioning over his identity, history and citizenship, Imasi was released into the community while his immigration status was resolved. He lived, briefly, in the Melbourne suburb of Flemington, before he was detained, first in Melbourne, then Sydney – before being shunted backwards and forwards between detention in those two cities, often without warning or explanation, for five years. “I said I want to go back to Europe, they said, ‘No, you’re not a citizen of any country.’ They told me I had no choices.” Imasi’s case was explored by caseworkers from the department of immigration. He was not a citizen of Norway and had no right to return there (his protection visa there expired while he was in detention in Australia), nor had he any right to enter Abu Dhabi, through which he had transited. Repeated entreaties to other governments – the embassies of Morocco and Algeria were consulted – found no obvious solution. He had no documents that could demonstrate his connection to Western Sahara or Spain. Imasi was stateless. Statelessness is recognised under international law and noted for the crippling effects it has on a person’s life. Without a place, people find themselves bounced from country to country, none willing to take responsibility, or offer sanctuary. Without the right to remain, healthcare, education, housing and the protection of the law are all near impossibilities. Australia is a party to both the 1954 convention on the status of stateless persons and the 1961 convention on the reduction of statelessness. The former provides stateless people with a minimum set of human rights, the latter is designed to ensure the right of every person to a nationality. In October 2015, Imasi was awoken at 4.30am in his room at Villawood detention centre, handcuffed and flown across the country to the remote Indian Ocean island of Christmas Island. He was given no chance to pack his few belongings and no opportunity to tell anybody where he was going. He has been in that place ever since, occasionally allowed out on excursions on the tiny, remote island but never free: he is always in the company of guards who closely watch him. He says he believes the Australian government has “given up” on finding a solution – any solution – for his case. “They say my case is complicated. I say, ‘I have been here eight years, how can you not know about me? How can it take this long?’ “They blame me. But I am not accused of anything. They have never made any allegation against me.” The refugee review tribunal considered Imasi’s case in 2010. The tribunal found he could not demonstrate a “well-founded fear of persecution” and so could not be recognised as a refugee and granted a protection visa. But it did find he was stateless and without any country to which he could return. The tribunal heard from Imasi that he had travelled on false and stolen travel documents, and had misrepresented himself. Imasi told the tribunal he feared being returned to Norway because the “mafia-style drug gang” – the tribunal’s characterisation – he had worked for had threatened to kill him. “It appears that a significant reason for his troubles is that, as an undocumented person … the applicant holds poor prospects of securing permanent residency or citizenship.” Since then, the commonwealth ombudsman has made five separate reports to parliament on Imasi’s case. Those reports – publicly published versions are anonymised – grow increasingly concerned for Imasi’s welfare and frustrated by his case’s apparent intractability. “The ombudsman remains concerned about the effect of protracted detention on Mr [Imasi’s] health,” the most recent report from February 2016 states. “The ombudsman notes that Mr [Imasi] attended a psychiatric review on 24 October 2014. This identified a significant deterioration in his mental health and a recommendation that Mr [Imasi] be placed in community detention. “Since August 2012 the ombudsman has recommended that consideration be given to transferring Mr [Imasi] to a less restrictive environment. The ombudsman notes with serious concern that Mr [Imasi] has remained in restricted detention facilities for over five-and-a-half-years and, despite DIBP’s [Department of Immigration and Border Protection] attempts to establish Mr [Imasi’s] identity and nationality, there appears to be no clear resolution in sight.” The Australian government said it was continuing its work to ascertain Imasi’s identity. However, Imasi’s latest protection claim, his third, was rejected by the department of immigration in December. The government has previously raised doubts Imasi is from Western Sahara and said he has been uncooperative, a claim rejected by the UN working group. A spokeswoman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection told the Guardian “the Australian government takes its protection obligations seriously and assesses all claims for protection through the standard statutory protection visa application process. “Statelessness alone is not a ground for engaging Australia’s international protection obligations but may be a relevant consideration in the assessment of protection claims. The immigration detention of an unlawful non-citizen is neither unlawful nor arbitrary under international law.” The department did not comment on Imasi’s case specifically. Detention has become harder, Imasi says, as the possibility of freedom has ebbed. Conditions, too, have grown more punitive, as the detention centre itself has become more militarised. “This place is now run like a prison, it feels like a maximum security prison,” he says. “Everywhere you go you feel like a caged animal. They use handcuffs all the time to move people around. “When I first came here, people were friendly, I felt safe. But now, I never feel safe, always you have to watch your back, watch who you are talking to.” Imasi readily admits he has, at times, not coped in detention. His first years of detention were marked by aggressive behaviour and violent outbursts. But these have faded, government reports say. “Mr [Imasi] has been proactive in managing his mental health and has not been involved in any major incidents in detention in the past 18 months that are relevant to his character, or suggestive of Mr [Imasi] being a compliance or security risk,” the ombudsman wrote. Bouts of anger have faded to long periods of unremitting depression, including suicidal ideation. Most dispiriting, Imasi says, has been his loss of faith in a future. “This system gives you a death sentence, every day, every night,” he says. “You don’t know who to trust. You lose your faith.” The director principal of Human Rights For All, Alison Battisson, took Imasi’s case to the United Nations. She tells the Guardian his legal representatives are now poised to bring court action in Australia, including in the high court for a writ of habeas corpus, to secure Imasi’s release. Battisson says his treatment had been an egregious abuse of process. “Said’s case is emblematic of the problems faced by the world’s most vulnerable people,” she says. “Said is a stateless person who was taken from Africa as a young child and trafficked across Europe. Said has no country of origin. He has no right to live anywhere. Instead of treating Said humanely and sensibly, the Australian government has detained him for eight years. This is unacceptable.” Battisson says Imasi has been offered jobs in the Australian community and wants contribute to society. She says he had not been identified as a security concern by any of Australia’s intelligence and security agencies, and should be released. “Said longs to be free,” she says. “Each day Said spends in detention pushes his dreams and ability to fulfil these dreams further out of reach.” The Australian government has tried to resolve Imasi’s case, Battisson says, including three times asking him to apply for a protection visa, but its rigid processes are unsuited to a case as complex as Imasi’s. She said she believes the government “long ago gave up trying to resolve his case”. “Stateless people needlessly suffer due to Australia’s inability to effectively deal with such cases. Australia must get better at dealing with cases of statelessness.” There are currently 37 stateless people in immigration detention in Australia. On average, most have been in detention more than two years. Imasi says years of his life have been pointlessly squandered to nobody’s benefit in detention. But worse is the realisation that this, potentially, is the rest of his existence as well. He faces a detention that is indefinite. “They can send me anywhere but I can’t stand to be locked up forever, thinking I will never get out,” he says. “This is torture.” “They have damaged my life for eight years. I forgive them. I want only for this to end. I want to find one day I feel like I am worth something. “I want to go free.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/15/second-cohort-of-nauru-and-manus-refugees-to-be-resettled-in-us","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T04:00:10Z","webTitle":"Second cohort of Nauru and Manus refugees to be resettled in US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/15/second-cohort-of-nauru-and-manus-refugees-to-be-resettled-in-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/15/second-cohort-of-nauru-and-manus-refugees-to-be-resettled-in-us","fields":{"headline":"Second cohort of Nauru and Manus refugees to be resettled in US","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nearly 200 refugees from Australia’s offshore detention islands of Nauru and Manus will be resettled in the United States in the new year. But the newly-reinstated travel ban imposed by US president Donald Trump is excluding certain nationalities, including Iranians and Somalis, from resettlement. Iranian refugees have been told the president’s executive order has meant “the United States government is currently undertaking an additional review of refugees resettlement from selected countries worldwide and will temporarily prioritise refugee applications from other countries”. “This means that refugees processing from selected countries, including in your resettlement case, will occur at a slower pace.” The Trump travel ban, reinstated by the US supreme court earlier this month, suspends the entry into the US of nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela. Iranians make up the largest cohort of refugees on both of Australia’s offshore processing centres. The Guardian understands about 130 people from Nauru have been accepted to move to the US, and close to 60 from PNG. The group will be the second cohort resettled under the US deal brokered in 2016, after 54 refugees went to the US in September. The majority of refugees accepted for resettlement in the current group are from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and stateless Rohingyans from Myanmar and Bangladesh. On Nauru, young men from Afghanistan and Pakistan, who arrived on the island as unaccompanied children but have since reached adulthood, have been accepted for resettlement. Some Iranian refugees have been rejected. Several families, from Iran and Sri Lanka, have also been rejected. On Manus, Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Muhamat said those accepted for resettlement had been told they will leave for the United States on 12 January. “Those who received their results today were so excited that they will fly to the US … and the others in the camps are so sad because their names are not on the list. I hope everyone will get his freedom to a safe country soon. “The US deal will take many months or years and will not provide places for everyone. We will continue our protests on Manus until there is a safe country for everyone.” Ezatullah Kakar, a Pakistani refugee, told the Guardian he was still waiting for an interview for his resettlement. His roommate has left Manus for Port Moresby, ahead of flying to the United States next month. “We are still waiting. Of course it’s hard. And it’s the same game, like other people on our boats, we were all in Christmas Island and they went to Australia and we were sent to Manus.” Kakar said the US resettlement process would likely take months for those still waiting for initial interviews. “It’s very hard; I can’t believe they are wasting all this time.” Last week, Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton said the resettlement process was the bailiwick of US authorities, but that the process was progressing. “I am hoping there can be an uplift as soon as possible but that is an issue for the United States ... and interviews continue, the background checks, and all of that process that the United States is involved in continues.” Department sources say there is increasing confidence the US will accept close to the 1,250 refugees it has previously publicly suggested could be settled, and that that figure could be reached by the end of its current annual intake, which resets in October. The 1,250 would not be enough to clear Australia’s offshore islands of refugees. There are about 1,600 refugees currently held in both Nauru and PNG. Asylum seekers found not to meet the criteria for protection under the refugees’ convention are not being considered for US resettlement. Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, said the latest cohort to be accepted for resettlement was “great news” for those selected. “But it also exposes all the problems that exist with the US deal: the selective nature of the agreement; the travel ban having an impact. People have been waiting over four years, but so many still don’t know what is going to happen to them. “The US deal is not going to provide enough places for all the people found to be owed protection. That has created enormous anxiety and distress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/15/australia-england-steve-smith-ashes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T10:26:11Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith leads Australia fightback after England’s tail is blown away","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/15/australia-england-steve-smith-ashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/15/australia-england-steve-smith-ashes","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith leads Australia fightback after England’s tail is blown away","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England had their foot on the jugular after an hour’s play but they could not keep it there for long. When England were 368 for four with two centurions at the crease the Australians were in a bit of bother. Then Peter Handscomb, who is not playing in this game, made his bid for the man of the match award. A sliced drive from Dawid Malan against a Nathan Lyon off-break went up in the air and Handscomb, briefly on the field for David Warner, sprinted to his left, dived and grabbed the ball inches above the ground. The dismissal of Malan triggered the subsidence, the first of six wickets England lost for a paltry 35 runs. That much-feted lower order, which has extricated the side from some deep holes in the past, does not function so well in Australia. There were more echoes of the Ashes tour of four years ago as the tail was swept away by the hostility and aggression of the Australian pacemen. It is not so surprising since these are fine bowlers and the pitch here has some life, but they don’t like it up ’em in the lower order. Despite excellent hundreds from Malan and Jonny Bairstow, who added 237 together, England’s highest partnership at the Waca, Australia were right back in the game, having bowled England out for 403, most definitely not an impregnable position. In a recent match here in November – of four days duration – Western Australia declared on 514 for seven against South Australia and lost. Moreover, Steve Smith later in the day came out and did his Don Bradman impersonation, clipping the ball into the gaps on either side of the wicket in his idiosyncratic way, with barely a false stroke. At the close the imperious captain was unbeaten on 92 and Australia were 203 for three. It had started so encouragingly for England as Malan and Bairstow blunted the second new ball. Australia began with four maidens and an unsuccessful review against Malan that hinted at some desperation. Then the England pair were into their stride, with Bairstow crunching two sweet drives to the off-side boundary in an over from Pat Cummins. Bairstow sped through the 90s and a hook shot off Mitchell Marsh took him to three figures for the fourth time in Test cricket. He celebrated in the approved manner, bat aloft, helmet removed and then, departing from the norm, he administered a playful, good-natured head-butt to his helmet. The Australians were in some disarray but it took only one wicket, that of Malan, for them to raise their game and swarm all over the England team. Two balls after Malan’s exit, for what may be a career-changing 140, Moeen Ali was caught at second slip from a regulation short delivery. He looked surprised by the bounce achieved by Cummins, even though he had been watching the partnership for many hours. Now the Australians were on the stampede. After two crisp boundaries Chris Woakes was caught at long leg flicking at another short ball. Any hope of a recovery evaporated when Mitchell Starc removed Bairstow’s middle stump with a full-length delivery that the batsman was seeking to clip to the leg-side boundary. Thereafter Craig Overton and Stuart Broad were dismissed fending at short deliveries, although not before Broad had walloped a mighty, wind-assisted six off Josh Hazlewood when the ball travelled 104 metres in the direction of the old scoreboard. The England total seemed to shrink after a dozen overs in which the ball seldom evaded the middle of the bats of the Australian openers. Then Joe Root turned to Overton and something happened. Overton, extracting more life than his peers, found the outside edge of David Warner’s bat. Two balls later he almost dismissed Usman Khawaja for a duck. A leading edge came back down the pitch; Overton dived to his left but the ball slipped from his grasp. Then, after a successful review by England, Cameron Bancroft was sent on his way, lbw to the lanky Devonian. Overton would now be given a long eight-over spell before tea, since he had been the solitary threatening bowler; here was more long-term good news about England’s bowling ammunition, although this was tempered when Overton left the field after bowling two overs in his second spell. He did, however, return later, albeit with a painful ribcage. England plan to assess Overton on Saturday morning after he aggravated an injury picked up from a Cummins bouncer in Adelaide. So Khawaja kept Smith company, even if he was overshadowed by him. On 28 the left-hander edged a delivery from Woakes towards Root at second slip but the England captain never spotted the ball; for his information it whistled past his left ear, much to Woakes’s exasperation. So this pair added 124, whereupon Khawaja was lbw to Woakes, who had bowled with more vim than his senior colleagues. All the while Smith was superb, delicately finding the gaps like a snooker player controlling the cue ball. It did not matter who was bowling. England set some funky fields for him, whether they were the creations of Bond, that’s Shane Bond, the bowling consultant who has now left the party, or even a mysterious M, it is hard to tell. But they did not work. Sometimes they seemed to make life easier for Smith, since there were so many gaps for him. Without ever appearing to hurry, Smith cruised along with a strike rate in the 80s. Shaun Marsh had an escape on seven when a rebound off the boot of Mark Stoneman at short leg bobbled in the air, whereupon the fielder and keeper became confused and failed to snatch the rebound. Moeen could have done with a fluky wicket. Meanwhile, Smith had issued an unnecessary reminder that he is the best batsman in this series by a considerable margin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/15/brexit-talks-eu-next-phase-brussels-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T12:45:23Z","webTitle":"EU leaders agree Brexit talks can move on to phase two","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/15/brexit-talks-eu-next-phase-brussels-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/15/brexit-talks-eu-next-phase-brussels-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"EU leaders agree Brexit talks can move on to phase two","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"EU leaders have ruled that sufficient progress has been made in the first phase of Brexit talks, allowing negotiations to move on to discussions about Britain’s future outside the bloc. While some questions over the three opening issues that have so far dominated the negotiations still remain, a joint proposal from the UK and the European commission to move the talks on has been accepted. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, tweeted: “EU leaders agree to move on to the second phase of #Brexit talks. Congratulations PM @theresa_may.” The leaders have also adopted a set of guidelines spelling out their terms for a transition period, and a rough timetable for the next few months. Initially, the second phase of Brexit talks will be dominated by discussions over the transition period, under which the UK will continue to abide by EU law for roughly two years, but not have a role in any decision-making institutions. Theresa May has been given three months to get agreement within the cabinet on the UK government’s vision of a future trade deal, after which substantive talks on the future relationship will begin. In response to the development, the prime minister tweeted: “Thank you to Presidents @JunckerEU and @donaldtusk. Today is an important step on the road to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit and forging our deep and special future partnership.” The Brexit secretary, David Davis, tweeted: “Today is a good day for Brexit and an important step for Britain. Thanks to hard work and determination, we have reached an important milestone and have achieved #sufficientprogress. There is still lots of work to come but we are ready for the next stage.” In a joint statement, the leaders of the British Chambers of Commerce, Confederation of British Industry, Federation of Small Businesses, Institute of Directors and the manufacturers’ organisation EEF warned that jobs were at risk unless swift progress was made in the second phase. “It is our collective view that the transition period must now be agreed as soon as possible, to give businesses in every region and nation of the UK time to prepare for the future relationship,” they said. “Further delays to discussions on an EU-UK trade deal could have damaging consequences for business investment and trade, as firms in 2018 review their investment plans and strategies.” Negotiators from the UK government and the commission have spent nine months wrangling over the opening issues in the negotiations: the rights of of the 4.2 million UK and European citizens who have made lives in each other’s territories; the divorce bill; and the thorny issue of how to avoid a hard border with Ireland once the UK leaves the bloc. On Thursday night the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, encouraged leaders to give May a round of applause as the British prime minister ended a short address to a leaders’ dinner. May had sketched out Britain’s hopes for the second phase including swift agreement on the terms of a transition period to give British and European businesses some certainty about the terms of trade after 29 March 2019, when the UK leaves the bloc. Arriving at the second day of the summit in Brussels on Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, said the applause had been deserved. “Some of us thought, including me, that she did make a big effort and this has to be recognised,” he said. “The second phase will be significantly harder than the first and the first was very difficult.” Asked whether, in the wake of May’s defeat in the Commons this week over Brexit legislation, the UK might still stay in the EU, he added that it “depends on the British parliament and British people”. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said European leaders had not debated with May after her address because of the rules over article 50 negotiations, under which discussions with the UK are supposed to go through the commission’s negotiator, Michel Barnier. He said, however, that after the update on the state of the negotiations “some people offered some good luck, merry Christmas remarks and there was a light round of applause after that”. The Austrian chancellor, Christian Kern, said the applause had not been very enthusiastic although he also added that it was “well deserved”. “We’re sitting in the same boat. We all have the same interests,” Kern said. “Of course we are backing her. I’m following closely the discussions in the United Kingdom but I think the achievements of Mrs May we have to respect. We have made some significant progress which is good and everybody has trust in her leadership.” Last week, after intense last-minute negotiations with the Democratic Unionist party over the UK’s plans for the Irish border, an agreement was struck between Juncker and May to allow the talks to widen to discuss the terms of a transition period once the UK leaves the EU, and the outline of a possible trade deal. The prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said Thursday night’s discussion with May had been “pretty constructive”, though he acknowledged there was some concern about “developments in London”. Of the next phase, he said: “The first real big step is for the UK to say very clearly what it wants in clear terms.” Dalia Grybauskaitė, the president of Lithuania, said she expected phase two to “probably start in March after the next summit, and once the terms of a transition period are tied down by the two negotiating teams”. The Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said he “welcomed with great courtesy [May’s] kindness in making herself available” for the summit dinner. “We know that phase two will not be more simple than phase one,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/15/talking-horses-hayley-turners-case-suggests-jockeys-get-it-tougher-than-trainers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T11:52:37Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Hayley Turner's case suggests jockeys get it tougher than trainers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/15/talking-horses-hayley-turners-case-suggests-jockeys-get-it-tougher-than-trainers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/15/talking-horses-hayley-turners-case-suggests-jockeys-get-it-tougher-than-trainers","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Hayley Turner's case suggests jockeys get it tougher than trainers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Atzeni signs with influential jockey’s agent Andrea Atzeni has joined kingmaker jockeys’ agent Tony Hind in the hope of making a charge at the champion jockey’s title next year. Asked about rumours circulating to that effect in Newmarket on Friday, Hind confirmed that Atzeni was now part of his powerful stable of Flat-racing riders. “That’s his ambition, he wants to be champion,” Hind said. “He’s asked for my services to help him carry it out.” Hind has been responsible for the champion Flat jockey in seven of the last 12 seasons. Having booked rides for the high profile pair of Richard Hughes and Ryan Moore, he then helped Jim Crowley become champion in 2016 after starting the year as a 66-1 shot. Atzeni is on offer at 25-1 for next year’s title with William Hill but those odds now seem likely to shorten. The Italian’s skills have been much admired for several years and he has been a regular winner of high-profile races, while just lacking the number of winners to make a challenge for the title. His biggest success so far has been Postponed’s King George at Ascot in 2015, part of his fruitful association with the trainer Roger Varian. He won back to back St Legers on Kingston Hill and Simple Verse, won the Racing Post Trophy four years in a row and racked up six more Group One wins this year. Atzeni is spending the winter riding abroad, most recently in Hong Kong last weekend. Hind plans to sit down with him and make a plan before next year’s title race begins in May. Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook It was interesting to see a number of folk on my Twitter timeline responding to the Hayley Turner verdict yesterday by comparing her case with that of David Evans. In most cases, the feeling seemed to be one of puzzlement as to why her punishment, a three-month suspension from riding, was so much tougher than his, a £3,000 fine. Turner was placing bets while she was licensed as a jockey and I don’t want to downplay the significance of that; it was a mistake, for which she will now pay. But she was, after all, merely messing around with fivers and tenners and there was no evidence to suggest that she was trying to profit from inside information, even though one would imagine she was as well placed as anyone to get some of that. In Evans’s case, the troublesome wager was £6,000. That’s twice as much, in one go, as Turner bet in the whole 18-month history of her Paddy Power account. Moreover, Evans was backing one of his own horses, got a better price than was available to anyone else because of his good relationship with the bookie and did so whilst knowing that another fancied runner in the race (which he also trained) would be a non-runner. Which of these cases presents the greater threat to the integrity of racing? As a punter, which of these cases worries you more? I’m guessing it’s the extremely hard-nosed trainer rather than the part-time rider who announces some of her bets on the telly. It’s just so easy to punish jockeys and British racing has made it a very comfortable habit. Jockeys get suspended every day at the races. Trainers and owners may have benefited from the infraction but generally suffer no consequence. I understand a certain reluctance to ban trainers or even suspend them from making entries because it’s not just the individual who suffers. You’re shooting a hole in a business on which many people may rely for their income. But it’s also true to say that trainers are closer to the centre of power in horse racing. Those who make and enforce the rules, I believe, would see themselves as having more in common with trainers than with jockeys. Before each race, trainers, owners and stewards mingle in the paddock, chatting away. Then the jockeys arrive and give the peaks of their caps a little tug to show respect. Oh well, on to today’s action, which centres on lovely Cheltenham. I was surprised to see Mysteree (2.30) declared for the staying handicap chase because he goes well fresh and Michael Scudamore was talking about going straight to the Welsh National. But this race, which the trainer won four years ago with Monbeg Dude, cut up so badly that he felt he had to go for it. Mysteree is pretty high in the handicap these days after a very successful last winter but he should get the testing ground he loves. The novice Wotzizname is a threat but this is quite a test for him. In the closing handicap hurdle, the market seems to expect Colin Tizzard to get improvement out of The Dutchman, who was formerly with Sandy Thomson and has had a tongue tie fitted since moving down south. But his only hurdles win was nearly two years ago and it’s not at all clear to me that he has any secrets from anyone. I prefer the 11-2 about Arthur’s Gift (3.40), who has improved for each of three runs in handicaps for Nigel Twiston-Davies, scoring twice under today’s pilot, Tom Humphries. He needs to improve for the extra half-mile but looks very much as though he will do so. He seemed to win in spite of the tight circuit and right-hand bends at Market Rasen last month. At Doncaster, I wonder if this is finally the time that Alvarado (2.10) comes good again. Odds of 7-2 are meagre compensation for backing a horse that hasn’t won for four years, although he has been placed in two Grand Nationals and two Scottish Nationals in that time. Now that he’s rising 13, I doubt that connections are saving him for those big spring targets but will take what they can. He should be sharper for his running-on third at Exeter in October and has dropped to a handy mark. He’s 7-2.

While it’s always wise as a journalist to look through helpful steers on internal polling – given these “insights” are often used shamelessly by campaigns for crude propaganda purposes – the internal consensus on both sides going into Saturday is that the incumbent, John Alexander, most likely, gets there. Anyone following politics knows political protagonists and the journalists following them can get fixated on things that really don’t matter, but in this case, the collective fixation on Bennelong over the past month reflects the fact that this contest really does matter. Not many byelections determine whether a government retains its lower house majority, but this one does. If Alexander defies the collective internal prediction, and loses the seat which he retained for the Liberal party at the last federal election, with a margin of just under 10%, Malcolm Turnbull slides into minority government. Turnbull can continue to govern in minority, but obviously the degree of difficulty for him increases exponentially, particularly in a government where people routinely struggle to get on the same page, and institutional discipline has been pretty much non-existent. The prime minister has struggled all year, battling internal divisions, buffeted by events. Turnbull has used Barnaby Joyce’s win in the recent byelection in New England and the successful passage of marriage equality legislation, as well as the government’s bare-knuckle political assault on the Labor senator Sam Dastyari, to try and stabilise his own position and push forward more positively into the new political year. A Liberal loss on Saturday night would punch a hole in Turnbull’s carefully constructed flotation device. It would not only be back to square one, it would be sub-square one. So the outcome in Bennelong is critical for Turnbull. As the prime minister would say, this is a penetrating glimpse of the obvious. Perhaps not quite as obvious is that Turnbull won’t be the only political leader having an anxious Saturday. The best-case scenario for Labor is an upset victory in Bennelong, but in the event the party’s star candidate, Kristina Keneally, falls short, there will be a number of internal and external eyes trained on the size of the swing. Internally, Labor people are talking about a negative swing of 5% or better as a benchmark – anything less than that will be chalked up as underperformance. This figure might seem arbitrary but it just reflects history. According to a research paper by the parliamentary library, looking at contests from 1901 to 2014, the average two-party preferred swing against the government of the day at a byelection has been 4%. The ABC’s election analyst Antony Green has also crunched the numbers and his figure is 5% in federal byelections since 1983. Sticking with history for a moment, both the re-election of Jackie Kelly in the Lindsay byelection of 1996, and Joyce’s recent positive result in New England, suggests contests triggered by MPs having constitutional problems are their own thing, and they can spark a local sympathy vote. The other dynamic to bear in mind is Labor’s internals have been stirred up ahead of this contest. Bill Shorten has had to move against Sam Dastyari, who is a figure of influence in the New South Wales right, and Dastyari’s factional fellow travellers, and the prominent leftwing frontbencher, Anthony Albanese, haven’t really bothered to disguise their disappointment with that state of affairs. Without over-egging the dynamic, and with due acknowledgement that Labor’s internal discipline has been solid in the post Rudd/Gillard period, let’s just observe there are a few noses out of joint in a quarter of the party which prefers to be king, and when it can’t, is more than happy to play kingmaker. Then there’s nervousness about the polls. While in polling the trend is your friend, and Labor has led decisively all year in all the major opinion polls (the government has lost 72 Guardian Essential polls on the trot), voters are not rating Shorten ahead of Turnbull as their preferred prime minister, and Turnbull’s approval ratings are a jot healthier. While there are many in the opposition who sense that government is again within spitting distance, not everyone is that confident. Voters are signalling to pollsters week-in and week-out they would throw the Coalition out and elect Labor in any federal contest held today, but do people actually mean it? Some Labor people think the polls are soft, that the strong performance on the two-party preferred measure post-election isn’t a guarantee that disillusionment against Turnbull translates into a vote for Labor when it matters – on election day. So if that’s the default question being asked – can we believe this trend, are we really within striking distance of government? – politicians and backroom types will look to any concrete field evidence they can get, and Bennelong is a valid bit of field evidence. Now, I reckon most readers will already know the stakes on Saturday night are very high for Turnbull, and many will know that Shorten will be judged too, but how many of you have thought about Cory Bernardi? Bernardi may not be top-of-mind, but he’s another political leader with a bit on the line in this particular byelection. The outspoken South Australian opened the political year with his defection from the Liberal party, and since then he’s bolted together his Australian Conservatives insurgency. The public polls suggest Australian Conservatives are doing reasonably well in Bennelong for a fledgling political movement. Logic suggests Bernardi’s party would pick up some disaffected conservative votes in this contest, given the Liberal party in NSW has been in an open state of warfare, with conservatives facing off against moderates. So a couple of interesting things to consider on Saturday night – does the vote on the right in Bennelong split, and to what degree? Also, what happens with preferences? Are they what the backroom types like to call “sticky” (which means they flow back in large part to the Liberal party) or do they, like One Nation’s preferences sometimes do, go in unpredictable directions? If Bernardi’s candidate performs well, and the preferences largely flow back, pumping Alexander’s tyres in the event the contest is tight, what then does that presage for new year realignments on the political right? Bernardi wants to position his party as the “safe” protest vote on the political right in contrast to One Nation, which has been characterised by the Liberal National party after the Queensland election as the “chaotic” protest vote, which helped to return a Labor government in the state. While a recent quality data analysis of the Queensland election shows that One Nation voters gave most of their preferences to the LNP in 37 of the 38 seats where the result came down to “a shootout” between the LNP and Labor – facts which debunk the post-election official “history” – Bernardi will continue his efforts to style his party as the home of “safe” disaffection. A solid micro-party result in Bennelong, which flows back strongly in the direction of the Liberals, will help with that styling objective and, in practical terms, it will also make Bernardi’s party harder for the Coalition to freeze out and ignore, with a fascinating state contest looming in South Australia next March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/19/how-fox-news-cried-coup-over-mueller-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T13:27:38Z","webTitle":"'Kill the messenger': how Fox News cried 'coup' over the Trump-Russia inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/19/how-fox-news-cried-coup-over-mueller-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/19/how-fox-news-cried-coup-over-mueller-investigation","fields":{"headline":"'Kill the messenger': how Fox News cried 'coup' over the Trump-Russia inquiry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Saturday, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro began her weekly show by calling for a purge of the US justice department for the second week in a row. There was, she said, “a criminal cabal” within federal law enforcement trying to undermine Donald Trump. That followed her call last week for “a cleansing … in our FBI and Department of Justice. It needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired, but who need to be taken out in cuffs.” She continued: “There were times in our history when corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive that examples had to be made. This is one of those times.” The same day, fellow Fox News host Jesse Watters suggested that the investigation was “a coup” to overthrow Trump. Fox News hosts like Pirro, Watters, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity have been vocal detractors of the Russia inquiry, Mueller and the FBI and have instead insisted that the justice department conduct new investigations of Hillary Clinton as part of an attempt to protect Trump from the inquiries into his campaign Fox News has long been considered an outlet friendly to conservatives, and its best-known hosts of opinion programs in the evening such as Hannity and former colleague Bill O’Reilly have long pushed rightwing issues. Owned by the Australian-born mogul Rupert Murdoch, the channel has a longtime viewer in Donald Trump, who often live-tweets its programming and has sat for 20 interviews with Fox News employees, far more than he has for any other outlet. Fox has returned the favor by covering the Russia investigation in a positive light for the president. In recent weeks, it has focused on anti-Trump texts sent by Peter Strzok, an FBI agent involved in the investigations of both Trump and Clinton. Fox has focused on a text in which Strzok – who also sent derogatory texts about other political figures in both parties – referred to the Russia investigation as “an insurance policy” and interpreted that phrase to mean that the investigation was an alternative way to stop Trump’s presidency if Clinton lost. Although the network had long dismissed the Russia investigation as an unnecessary distraction from what some Fox personalities viewed as the real scandals involving Hillary Clinton, the tone has changed in recent weeks with increased rhetoric about “a coup” and the threat to Trump posed by “the deep state”. The growing criticism comes at a time when Mueller’s investigation has made further progress with the early December plea agreement by the former national security adviser Mike Flynn. However, with few exceptions, congressional Republicans have yet to join the attacks on Mueller. And Fox News can play a critical role in how the investigation is perceived by supporters of Trump. It is predominantly watched by conservatives, and is a key source for much of Trump’s base. A July poll found that 33% of Republicans get their news only from Fox and indicated a deep distrust of mainstream news outlets among rightwing partisans. “It reinforces the Trump base. It doesn’t get anybody outside the silo,” said Rick Wilson, a prominent conservative consultant and vocal “never-Trumper”. “Their purpose here is not to convince other Americans that Bob Mueller is corrupt and a Hillary Clinton supporter and needs to be fired.” In his view, “the conservative media ecosystem has become a shield wall and a defense mechanism for Trump’s base rather than something that is changing everybody else’s opinions and attitudes.” Although Trump’s counsel Ty Cobb has been urging calm inside the White House and has insisted the investigation will be over in the new year, outside advisers have been taking a different tack. Breitbart, the publication run by former top White House aide Steve Bannon, has been constantly hostile to Mueller, and Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump outside the administration, has been an active surrogate casting doubt on the investigation. Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide, agreed. He told the Guardian: “The issue is Fox News and that echo chamber helps keep Republican opposition against the investigation high.” He noted this was also critical in the 1990s to bolstering conservative support for Ken Starr’s investigation of Bill Clinton. Nunberg noted: “From a practical point of view, this investigation is getting closer and closer not necessarily to the president but to [Jared] Kushner [the president’s son-in-law and adviser] and potentially damaging information. So they are taking the kill the messenger approach which is why you see all this loud hoopla over Mueller getting the emails” – a reference to a claim by Republicans that Mueller’s inquiry inappropriately gained access to messages from Trump’s transition team, which Mueller’s spokesman has denied. Pirro has become perhaps the most public face of this effort to undermine Mueller and perk up partisan Republicans. She has long had a relationship with Trump. Her ex-husband represented Trump as a lawyer and Trump appeared on her television show even before his successful presidential bid. An ex-prosecutor who uses her former title as a local judge on her television show, Pirro mounted two unsuccessful bids for statewide office as a Republican in New York before going into television. However, a number of other top Fox hosts have also joined in the campaign. Ingraham, a longtime conservative radio host who was mooted as a potential White House press secretary, has also taken a leading role pushing this narrative and claimed that Muller was trying to “undo the 2016 election”. She has bashed Mueller’s team as “obvious partisans” and said “they should all resign”. Hannity, the prominent Fox News host who has previously promoted conspiracy theories around the death of a former DNC staffer, has also actively attempted to discredit Mueller’s investigation. In a segment with Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, the FBI was compared to the “old KGB” by Jarrett. Hannity went on to make clear the comparison of a federal law enforcement agency to the Soviet secret police was “not hyperbole”. Jarrett labelled it “a shadow government”. Hannity has also called the Mueller investigation “a disgrace” and claimed that it “pose[s] a direct threat to you, the American people, and our American republic”. Last Friday, as Trump prepared to make a speech at the FBI training academy in Quantico, Virginia, the White House deputy press secretary, Hogan Gidley, went on Fox News to claim there was “extreme bias” in “high-up members” of Mueller’s team. The question is whether Fox’s ardent defense of the president will have a political impact. Nunberg was skeptical. “First of all, if and when Jared is indicted, the president’s in a very precarious situation … I happen to believe there’s nothing Fox News or Rupert Murdoch can do about it.” Wilson noted that Fox’s pushback also revolved around what he called “a daily bullshit tornado” whereby conservative media outlets “throw out every crazy conspiracy theory they can in hope something will hold together”. The result is that the stories become “completely over the top and crazy”. As he put it: “It’s not just about opposing Hillary Clinton but Hillary Clinton, George Soros and al-Qaida combining to overthrow President Trump.” This article was amended on 19 December 2017 to correct a misspelling of Fox News host Jesse Watters’s name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/19/techapella-a-cappella-facebook-google-twitter","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"Welcome to Techapella, where top firms trade hashtags for harmonies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/19/techapella-a-cappella-facebook-google-twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/19/techapella-a-cappella-facebook-google-twitter","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to Techapella, where top firms trade hashtags for harmonies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What’s the first thing that comes into your head when you think of Silicon Valley? It might be computer programming, or social media, or internet bazillionaires. It’s probably not an a cappella Destiny’s Child mash-up where the opening lyrics of Bootylicious have been altered to include the names of technology companies. “Apple, can you handle this? Twitter, can you handle this? Facebook, can you handle this? I don’t think you can handle this.” Techapella is an annual Christmas concert where the in-house a cappella teams from all of the major technology companies showcase their singing capabilities. Software engineers, data scientists, accountants, marketers and sales reps from across Silicon Valley’s fiercely competitive technology industry have over the last few years formed groups including Facebook’s the Vocal Network, Googapella, Twitter’s Songbirds, LinkedIn’s InTune and Apple’s Keynotes. The groups meet each week in boardrooms and music rooms on their respective campuses to prepare for a dramatic end-of-year crescendo: two public concerts held in celebrated music halls in the San Francisco Bay Area. “I didn’t expect us to have an a cappella group, let alone everyone in Silicon Valley,” said Remy DeCausemaker, open source program manager at Twitter and beatboxer in the Songbirds. DeCausemaker joined Songbirds on his first day working on the company. “I’d just got my badge and picture taken and someone mentioned a bunch of clubs including an a cappella. I was like: ‘Whoa, what?!’ “People don’t usually equate hardcore engineering and the arts. It’s very cool to see brilliant technical people one moment solving database scalability problems and the next moment saying: ‘I think you’re half a step flat on this note here’.” He’s not the only one surprised to find so many aca-people within these companies. “The second I heard about Techapella, I was like: ‘Yes!’ This is one of the major final frontiers for a cappella,” said Deke Sharon, the “father” of modern a cappella and this year’s Techapella emcee. Sharon, who is musical director of the movie franchise Pitch Perfect as well as TV shows like The Sing-Off, said a cappella provided an important antidote to our increasingly digital lives. “Right now in our society, people are divided and feeling disconnected. They don’t know their neighbors and they don’t feel this connection to society,” he said. “There’s no better way to connect to other people and create something wonderful than to get together with others and sing.” Allie Polubiec, a front end engineer at Facebook and soloist in the Vocal Network, agrees. “It’s physically exhausting working at a computer day in day out. I need time to rest and stretch other muscles,” she said. “Singing is just good for you. Psychologically, there’s something very cathartic about using your voice and expressing your inner joy,” added Rico Rodriguez, a software engineer at LinkedIn. Rodriguez is one of the original members of the Techapella community in the Bay Area, having started in Google’s group Googapella more than five years ago. When Googapella’s co-founder Laolee Xiong was hired by Facebook, he launched the Vocal Network and the two groups arranged the first Techapella winter concert in 2013. Since then the Techapella scene has exploded, with about 10 teams performing in the 2017 concerts. “Techapella has grown so much over the last five years” said Xiong. “I’m excited to see where it’s going to lead to.” The dorky reputation of a cappella has been mitigated by pop culture portrayals of the phenomenon in shows like Pitch Perfect and Glee. “A cappella has a history of being nerdy, but I think it’s actually going in a cooler direction,” said Alex Feldman a Dropbox software engineer who leads the cross-company group Internote, made up of individuals from companies including Google, Lockheed Martin, OpenAI and various startups. “You can tell my sister who is in four different punk bands in LA that I’m coming for her!” DeCausemaker agrees: “So much of the world is filters and hashtags. A cappella is raw. I think it shows that nerds and geeks are well-rounded people and we’re helping to break stereotypes,” he said. Techapella diverges from pop culture tropes insofar as it’s resolutely not a competition, with the exception of a friendly beatbox battle during the show’s interlude. “My entire tenure has been more defined by a cappella than the work that I do. It was the thing that kept me at Google for as long as it did and it was the thing that keeps me at LinkedIn,” said Rodriguez. “So really, I’m just a singer – and I code as a side job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/13/republicans-in-congress-reach-deal-on-tax-plan-to-slash-corporate-rate-by-21","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T23:13:25Z","webTitle":"Republicans in Congress reach deal on tax plan to slash corporate rate to 21%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/republicans-in-congress-reach-deal-on-tax-plan-to-slash-corporate-rate-by-21","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/republicans-in-congress-reach-deal-on-tax-plan-to-slash-corporate-rate-by-21","fields":{"headline":"Republicans in Congress reach deal on tax plan to slash corporate rate to 21%","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Republicans in Congress reached a deal on final tax legislation on Wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that would slash taxes for wealthy Americans and lower the tax rate for corporations. Under an agreement between the House of Representatives and the Senate, the tax plan would reduce the corporate tax rate to 21%, one percentage point higher than the 20% rate earlier bills had proposed. It would still mark a dramatic fall from the current rate of 35%, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years. As they finalized the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, Republicans wavered for weeks on whether to slash the top income tax rate for the wealthy. But in the end, they agreed to cut it to 37% from the current 39.6%. This was despite criticism from Democrats that the Republican plan tilts toward the rich and corporations, offering little to the middle class. The agreement would also gut part of Barack Obama’s healthcare law by repealing the so-called “individual mandate”, which requires individuals to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. It also authorizes oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic national wildlife refuge. Republicans cautioned details were still being finalized. A final bill could be formally unveiled as early as Friday, with decisive votes coming next week in both chambers. The deal was reached one day after the Democratic candidate Doug Jones pulled off a stunning upset in the Alabama Senate race, escalating pressure on Republicans to send the tax bill to Donald Trump’s desk by the end of the year. Republican leaders already have more work to do to persuade holdouts in both chambers, where separate tax bills were passed along party-line votes over the past month. In both the House and the Senate, a number of Republican lawmakers voted for initial versions of the tax bill but cautioned their support was conditional upon what would be included in a final plan. In remarks at the White House, Trump said the tax plan was “bigger than anything ever done in this country”. The president appeared with several middle-class families who he said would benefit from the tax bill. The Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office, both nonpartisan research units of Congress, have forecast that rich taxpayers and businesses would gain disproportionately from the debt-financed Republican proposals. Democrats on Wednesday called on Republicans to postpone a vote until after Jones is seated in the Senate. “It would be wrong for Senate Republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the newly elected senator from Alabama the opportunity to cast his vote,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, told reporters on Capitol Hill. Although Jones is unlikely to be sworn in before January, his victory narrowed a tenuous Republican hold over the Senate from 52-48 seats to just 51-49. Republicans are relying on a process known as “budget reconciliation” that enables them to pass a bill with a simple majority vote. As a result, they already have few votes to lose. Under the current numbers, Republicans can afford to lose just two votes in the Senate – a scenario in which vice-president Mike Pence would act as tie-breaker. If Senate Republicans do not pass the tax bill prior to Jones’ arrival, they would be able to lose just one vote. John Thune, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, told Politico that Jones’ win made the GOP agenda “a little bit more complicated”. “The margin’s narrower. It was already narrow,” said Thune, a senator from South Dakota. “And every senator is a king or queen on almost every issue, and that probably only enhances that leverage that an individual senator has, going forward.” Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/13/manchester-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T22:43:00Z","webTitle":"Romelu Lukaku strikes and Manchester United beat Bournemouth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/13/manchester-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/13/manchester-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Romelu Lukaku strikes and Manchester United beat Bournemouth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After the tunnel bust-up with Manchester City on Sunday came this muted Manchester United display. They claimed victory but José Mourinho’s side are misfiring as their cross-town rivals continue to coast, winning a record 15th consecutive match at Swansea City. The anomaly about this performance and the virtual no-show on Sunday is how Arsenal were taken apart at their own ground by United in the preceding match. But the requisite quality is lacking for them to consistently dominate. United are 11 points behind City. Of the title race, Mourinho said: “If it is over now I go on holiday to Brazil or Los Angeles.” Mourinho also has concerns over Eric Bailly. The centre-back has not played since 5 November, having injured an ankle on duty with Ivory Coast. The manager is hopeful he will not be ruled out for the rest of the season. “I don’t want to be pessimistic, I want to leave it with the doctor,” the Portuguese said. “I think it’s serious. We are trying a conservative treatment but if the conservative treatment does not work he might have a surgical procedure. Probably the doctor can inform, it is not a problem for me [for the doctor to clarify] – I don’t want to speak about it. But today we played with [Chris] Smalling and [Phil] Jones, [Victor] Lindelof on the bench, Marcos Rojo is injured but nothing really big. During the season we have problems with central defenders, but Chris Smalling is playing amazingly well, so we are fine.” Mourinho also faced questions over the continued absence of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was a left out of the squad for a seventh time in the past eight matches. Asked to explain the forward’s omission, the manager said: “I can only have six players on the bench and I try to have some balance. I have Ashley Young to cover the wing and full-back position, [Ander] Herrera is a midfield player, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] is a striker, [Marcus] Rashford is a second striker and a winger. To have Mkhi means I don’t have one of them and I believe the others deserve to be there.” Both Mourinho and Eddie Howe made four changes. For United out went Rojo, Young, Herrera and Rashford and in came Luke Shaw, Phil Jones, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata. For Bournemouth, Dan Gosling, Harry Arter, Adam Smith and Callum Wilson replaced Steve Cook, Lewis Cook, Andrew Surman and Jermain Defoe. The visitors were bright in a high‑tempo start. United had a fluid look, with Lingard once more the No10 and with Mata flitting around from his right-hand berth. Wilson’s pace appeared Bournemouth’s best hope of turning United and he forced a first corner by leaving Jones on his backside. The ensuing play led to another Bournemouth corner, then a prolonged passage of pressure from the visitors. This climaxed in Gosling selling Shaw a dummy and firing at David de Gea, who beat the ball away. On 25 minutes United struck via Romelu Lukaku. Anthony Martial moved along the left and fed Mata. The Spaniard lifted the ball into the area and United’s No9 rose to head past a leaden-footed Asmir Begovic. Puzzlingly, there was next to nothing of a celebration from Lukaku for what was only his third goal in 15 games, and his first in five in the Premier League. Later, Lukaku went on a run that was halted, and United were twice caught offside when in threatening positions, as the half fizzled out. As against City, however, Mourinho’s men had failed to spark. The question of the second half, then, was whether they would be able to up the entertainment. They began by being boxed in just outside their area, which did not augur well. Still, a sprightly run and cross down the right from Lukaku was encouraging, and Martial made a similar move along the left flank. The Frenchman next pinged a ball in to Lukaku whose touch teed up Mata for a first-time effort which was blocked. United’s problem was a lack of conviction where it matters: in front of goal. One illustration came when Lukaku teed up Martial but the No11 skied horribly from close range. The Belgian had been booked for a challenge on Harry Arter late in the first half, but Howe believed this should have been a red card, claiming an 18th‑minute challenge on Nathan Ake also deserved a booking. “He should have been off the pitch,” Bournemouth’s manager said. United managed to cling on until the final whistle – De Gea’s knees repelling a Defoe effort – but all is not well with Mourinho’s team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/26/180bn-investment-in-plastic-factories-feeds-global-packaging-binge","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T07:00:42Z","webTitle":"$180bn investment in plastic factories feeds global packaging binge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/26/180bn-investment-in-plastic-factories-feeds-global-packaging-binge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/26/180bn-investment-in-plastic-factories-feeds-global-packaging-binge","fields":{"headline":"$180bn investment in plastic factories feeds global packaging binge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The global plastic binge which is already causing widespread damage to oceans, habitats and food chains, is set to increase dramatically over the next 10 years after multibillion dollar investments in a new generation of plastics plants in the US. Fossil fuel companies are among those who have ploughed more than $180bn since 2010 into new “cracking” facilities that will produce the raw material for everyday plastics from packaging to bottles, trays and cartons. The new facilities – being built by corporations like Exxon Mobile Chemical and Shell Chemical – will help fuel a 40% rise in plastic production in the next decade, according to experts, exacerbating the plastic pollution crisis that scientist warn already risks “near permanent pollution of the earth.” “We could be locking in decades of expanded plastics production at precisely the time the world is realising we should use far less of it,” said Carroll Muffett, president of the US Center for International Environmental Law, which has analysed the plastic industry. “Around 99% of the feedstock for plastics is fossil fuels, so we are looking at the same companies, like Exxon and Shell, that have helped create the climate crisis. There is a deep and pervasive relationship between oil and gas companies and plastics.” Greenpeace UK’s senior oceans campaigner Louise Edge said any increase in the amount of plastic ending up in the oceans would have a disastrous impact. “We are already producing more disposable plastic than we can deal with, more in the last decade than in the entire twentieth century, and millions of tonnes of it are ending up in our oceans.” The huge investment in plastic production has been driven by the shale gas boom in the US. This has resulted in one of the raw materials used to produce plastic resin – natural gas liquids – dropping dramatically in price. The American Chemistry Council says that since 2010 this has led to $186bn dollars being invested in 318 new projects. Almost half of them are already under construction or have been completed. The rest are at the planning stage. “I can summarise [the boom in plastics facilities] in two words,” Kevin Swift, chief economist at the ACC, told the Guardian. “Shale gas.” He added: “There has been a revolution in the US with the shale gas technologies, with the fracking, the horizontal drilling. The cost of our raw material base has gone down by roughly two thirds.” The findings come amid growing concern about the scale of plastics pollution around the world. Earlier this year scientists warned that it risked near permanent contamination of the planet and at a UN environment conference in Kenya this month the scale of plastic in the sea was described as an “ocean armageddon”. In June a Guardian investigation revealed that a million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute with most ending up in landfill or the sea. Earlier this month, UK environment secretary Michael Gove said reducing plastic pollution was a key focus, adding that he had been “haunted” by images of the damage being done from David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II TV series. However, campaigners warn that despite the rising tide of concern, powerful corporations are pressing ahead with a new generation of plastic production facilities that will swamp efforts to move the global economy away from single use, throw away plastic products. Steven Feit, from the Centre for Environmental International Law which has researched the impact of the US shale boom on plastics, said: “The link between the shale gas boom in the United States and the ongoing – and accelerating – global plastics crisis cannot be ignored. “In the US, fossil fuel and petrochemical companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars to expand plastic production capacity... All this buildout, if allowed to proceed, will flood the global market with even more disposable, unmanageable plastic for decades to come.” Athough the majority of the new investment is in the US, the impact will ripple outwards in the form of vast new supplies of raw materials for plastics being transported to Europe and China. Petrochemical giant Ineos has been shipping natural gas liquids from the US to cracking plants in Europe and the UK on huge “dragon ships” for the past year. Last month the company announced it will ship the first NGLs from the US to China in 2019 where it will be turned into plastic resin at a new cracking facility in Taixing China. Roland Geyer, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, was the lead author of a study earlier this year revealing that humans have produced 8.3bn tonnes of plastic since the 1950s, with the majority ending up in landfill or polluting the world’s oceans and continents. The report warned that plastic, which does not degrade for hundreds of years, risked “near-permanent contamination” of the earth. He said he was deeply troubled by the expansion in plastic production. “I am now all but convinced that the plastic waste/pollution problem will remain unmanageable without serious source reduction efforts,” he told the Guardian. “Building out production capacity is obviously the opposite of source reduction.” But experts believe the new facilities will lock in an increase in plastic production for years to come. Matthew Thoelke, executive director at IHS Markit analysts in Germany and an expert in the global chemical industry, said the expansion in the US would be a critical part of a 40% increase in global plastics production over the next decade. “This will help meet growing demand for plastic in the existing big markets of the US, Europe and China as well as a predicted steep increase in demand in India and south east Asia,” he said. But the American Chemistry Council said the plastics boom had brought huge economic benefits to the US creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and allowing the manufacture of a wide range of important products from medical supplies to auto parts, piping to technology. Steve Russell, vice president of plastics for the American Chemistry Council also defended the environmental impact of plastic, citing a study from 2016 that found using plastic reduces environmental damage. “Advanced plastics enable us to do more with less in in almost every facet of life and commerce. From reducing packaging, to driving lighter cars, to living in more fuel-efficient homes, plastics help us reduce energy use, carbon emissions and waste.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/14/north-korea-nuclear-fears-boris-johnson-gavin-williamson-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T00:29:16Z","webTitle":"UK and Japan to discuss security issues including North Korea nuclear threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/14/north-korea-nuclear-fears-boris-johnson-gavin-williamson-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/14/north-korea-nuclear-fears-boris-johnson-gavin-williamson-japan","fields":{"headline":"UK and Japan to discuss security issues including North Korea nuclear threat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Foreign secretary Boris Johnson and defence secretary Gavin Williamson are to meet their Japanese counterparts in London on Thursday for talks expected to be dominated by concern over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un has presided over a series of missile tests that have alarmed Japan, South Korea and the US. North Korea fired a missile over Japan in September. Johnson, speaking ahead of the meeting with Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono and defence minister Itsunori Onodera, which is to be held at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, said: “I look forward to deepening our security and defence cooperation so that we can tackle together the shared challenges ahead, including crucial international security issues such as DPRK [the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea].” The UK has so far had little involvement with North Korea, though it did send four fighter jets for joint exercises with Japan last year. Britain is planning to send a warship to the region next year, though at the time of the announcement the deployment was said to be aimed at deterring moves by Beijing in the South China Sea rather than North Korea. Echoing Johnson, Williamson said: “The security of the Asia-Pacific region is important to us all. I look forward to welcoming our Japanese partners to discuss tackling the threats facing them and the international community.” As well as North Korea, the two sides will discuss further military cooperation, including joint exercises, and collaboration on counter-terrorism and cyber threats. US president Donald Trump has threatened unilateral action against North Korea, which a fortnight ago claimed to have successfully tested an intercontinental missile capable of reaching anywhere in the US. The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, offered on Tuesday to begin direct talks with North Korea, dropping a US demand that it must first accept it will have to give up its nuclear weapons programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/16/memphis-inner-city-rugby-calvin-gentry","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T07:00:55Z","webTitle":"'Rugby saved my life': Memphis inner-city project tackles social change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/16/memphis-inner-city-rugby-calvin-gentry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/16/memphis-inner-city-rugby-calvin-gentry","fields":{"headline":"'Rugby saved my life': Memphis inner-city project tackles social change","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Rugby’s a game for gentlemen played by hoodlums,” says Calvin Gentry. “I play like a hoodlum.” Gentry is the star of The Rugby Boys of Memphis, a very American film about a game invented in Britain and played around the world which screened at the Tribeca festival and is now available via Amazon Prime. He underlines the point by putting a lower-case spin on the most famous team name in rugby. His high school, he says, has diversified the game in Tennessee simply by showing up to play – by “being an all black team”. The film cuts rugby action with a tour of South Memphis, one of the most impoverished places in all the 50 states. A break down the blind side at the West Tennessee championships; a drive-by of a corner store where Gentry has seen “many people shot”. Broken-down buildings next to vacant lots; tackle practice on muddy ground at night, flying bodies floodlit by the full-beam lights of cars. There is also the award of Gentry’s rugby scholarship to Arkansas State, the Varsity Cup finalists for whom he is now a powerful No8 forward. “I honestly feel rugby saved my life,” he says. That salvation came through Memphis Inner City Rugby, a nonprofit founded in 2012 by Shane Young and Devin O’Brien, two twenty-somethings who worked for Teach for America, loved the game and wanted to use it for good. Looking to expand the project, they staged an event in New York this week. At face value, the fundraiser on the 20th floor of a downtown tower was far removed from the muddy fields of South Memphis, where 200 high-schoolers now play rugby union in fall and spring. Phaidra Knight, new member of the World Rugby Hall of Fame, mingled affably. So did Todd Clever, the most-capped men’s Eagle. The retired WWE champion John Layfield, become a rugby evangelist, conducted a successful auction. The raw appeal of MICR was, however, very close to the surface. O’Brien is from New York and has moved back, to manage the Coney Island Brewery. But he remains a driver of MICR and his opening remarks had a strongish tinge of a sermon. Young is from New Jersey and played rugby in Florida but still teaches and coaches in Memphis. His exhortations from the stage were sprinkled with very Tennessee “y’alls”. Later, in a side room, Young was equally passionate if softer spoken. He explained how this unlikely evening came to be. “We applied to the Walton Family Foundation,” he said, “they came back to us with a grant for $10,000 and said this is restricted funding, you don’t use this on your programme, you use it to stage an event that will raise more money.” And so The Rugby Boys of Memphis was screened while New York rugby lovers drank bourbon and ate the culinary miracle that is deep-fried mac n’cheese. By the end of the night, $20,000 had been raised. “We’ve gotten the best of American rugby and a WWE champion, JBL, here to support a bunch of kids in Memphis,” Young said, with a smile of happy surprise. “It’s powerful. Rugby leads you to some strange places.” ‘The pathways through rugby are becoming real’ Five years ago, Young and O’Brien brought rugby to a place that would be strange to most of its fans worldwide. Partnering with Power Center Academy, a Memphis high school, they lured students by pretending the first meeting was about football, a sport the school could not afford to run. In contrast, rugby required only a ball and a patch of grass. The students took the deception well and the MICR programme built from there. It now includes academic requirements, mentoring and even the provision of yoga, to help calm everything down off the field. Gentry is not the only player who has come through and secured a college place: among others, Donovan Norphlet and JaVoni Merritt are at Life University in Atlanta, long a power of American rugby. Young enthused over the “pure American-bred determination, athleticism and winning mentality” of the young men and women he has introduced to the game. “These are not football players turned into rugby players,” he said, citing World Sevens player of the year Perry Baker as a famous example of that development path. “We are intercepting them before they get to football. “To be frank, American football is on a very quick decline especially with the youth because of the concussion issue and the politics of it. The pathways to college through football are becoming scarce. The pathways and opportunities through rugby are becoming real. When we can bring that to the city of Memphis, that’s a real engine of change for rugby and also for the city.” Asked about his next aim, Young said he wanted MICR to reach 14 schools by 2021, up from from three now. The programme currently runs six teams, three for boys aged 14 and up and three for girls the same. “JaVoni was our first female athlete to leave with a scholarship, last year,” he said, stressing the importance of the women’s game as well as the need to monitor progress after high school is over. “Of the alums that are in college, we’re learning quickly that we have to reach further into their lives. When you are someone going to college from a low-income household or an impoverished community, the challenges you face are not the same challenges that I faced, for example. “I could take risks, I could waste money, I could fail a class, and because I come from a well-to-do family, I would be all right. For our kids, just giving them rugby in high school and saying ‘Good job’ can often lead them right back to where they came from. “We have high expectations for our young men and women. They can matriculate through some of the nation’s best colleges but they just need support because of economic conditions and some of the academic shortcomings they experience coming from a disadvantaged city like Memphis.” Gentry also spoke to the crowd in New York, alongside Young and Clever. He was the first person in his family to go to college, he said. He had found the academic side a challenge, failing most classes in his freshman year. A fourth person on the stage, he said, had been there to help him out. Allison Polly, executive producer of branded content for Pepsico, was part of the New York panel. The company paid for The Rugby Boys of Memphis. When Gentry found himself unable to pay $632 of college fees, the drinks giant paid that too. Pepsi, Polly said, is looking to turn The Rugby Boys of Memphis into a scripted full-length feature. The prospect is an intriguing one, perhaps a rugby version of The Blind Side, the story of the Tuohy family and their discovery and sponsorship of the football star Michel Oher. The Tuohys have supported MICR. But five years at the sharp end of American life have made Young as cautious as he is ambitious. “There are preliminary discussions taking place with writers and directors to possibly make a [feature] film,” he said, picking his caveats with care. His smile, though, betrayed how far his project has come – like the young athletes it has reached."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/14/star-wars-the-last-jedi-mark-hamill-carrie-fisher-good-kisser","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T07:23:09Z","webTitle":"Star Wars' Mark Hamill – ‘I said to Carrie Fisher: I’m a good kisser – next, we’re making out like teenagers!’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/14/star-wars-the-last-jedi-mark-hamill-carrie-fisher-good-kisser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/14/star-wars-the-last-jedi-mark-hamill-carrie-fisher-good-kisser","fields":{"headline":"Star Wars' Mark Hamill – ‘I said to Carrie Fisher: I’m a good kisser – next, we’re making out like teenagers!’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Han Solo is dead and Princess Leia, heartbreakingly, died almost a year ago, when Carrie Fisher died after becoming ill on a flight from London, as she was going home for Christmas. Which means, out of the original Star Wars trio, the most holy of cinematic trinities, Luke Skywalker is the last one standing. This is not how anyone expected it to end, least of all Luke himself, Mark Hamill. So, while the latest entry in the Star Wars canon, The Last Jedi, written and directed by Rian Johnson, is great fun – as exciting and inspired as its predecessor, JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens, but a lot funnier and without all the heavy-lifting of exposition and character setup that Abrams’s film had to cram in – it is also very poignant. No one could have foreseen Fisher’s death and, in fact, she was going to be the centre of the next movie, just as Ford was the heart of The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi is very much Hamill’s film. But there are moments in this movie that feel, in retrospect, breathtakingly prescient. The scenes between Luke and Leia after their long separation made my throat catch. I cannot imagine what it must be like for Hamill to watch them, his last on-screen moments with the woman who, for 40 years, was his on-screen sister and his off-screen friend. “It’s devastating and I still haven’t come to terms with it,” he says, when we meet in a hotel in central London, hours before the UK premiere. “Gosh darn it, I still think of her in the present tense, you know? If she were here right now, she’d be behind you giving you bunny ears and me the middle finger because she was all about having fun all the time. Whenever I was on set, I would go straight to her trailer with my dog and hang out with her and her dog.” Hamill and Fisher bonded almost instantly when they met, after being cast in Star Wars, and Hamill suggested the two of them go out for supper to get to “know each other a bit”. Within 10 minutes, Fisher, who would become one of Hollywood’s consummate memoirists, was telling him such intimate details about her father Eddie Fisher’s infamous affair with Elizabeth Taylor that Hamill felt the hairs on his arms stand up. Shortly before she died, Fisher published her memoir about making the Star Wars movies, in which she revealed that she had had an intense and rather tragic affair with Ford, when she was 19 and riddled with insecurities, and he was 33 and married. Did Hamill know what was going on? “Marcia [Lucas, Star Wars’ editor and George Lucas’s then wife] told me after we finished filming. I’m glad I didn’t know before, as it probably really would have affected me. By the time I found out, I just thought it was hilarious. But you know men – even if we don’t want to have a relationship, it’s just in our nature to jockey for affection,” he says. But it sounds like there was some jockeying going on anyway, even if neither of the men was aware of the game. It turns out that Fisher kept one last secret. “Carrie and I were attracted to one another, but I knew from previous jobs that it would have been a bad idea [to get involved with someone on set]. But Carrie and I found pretexts. I remember one time – I’m sure alcohol was involved – we were talking about kissing techniques. I said: ‘Well, I think I’m a fairly good kisser. I like to let the women come to me rather than be aggressive.’ And she said: ‘What do you mean?’ Well, next thing you know we’re making out like teenagers!” Wait a minute. Luke and Leia – got it on? During the filming of the first Star Wars? “Oh, yeah! Are you kidding me? We were all over each other!” he cackles. “But the one thing that drew Carrie and me back from the precipice was we kind of became aware of what we were doing and just burst out laughing. Which was unfortunate for me because the rocket launch sequence had been initiated,” he grins. And just like that, I spit my water all over Luke Skywalker’s knee. Whereas in his 70s youth, Hamill, who was born and raised in California, was bright-eyed and blond, like Björn Borg’s earnest younger brother, he now has a handsome grizzle to him, with a rather endearing paunch. He is a little shambly and a lot rambly, and where he once looked callow, he now looks kind. Which he is, urging me to have the comfortable armchair while he takes the desk chair and sweetly encouraging my hackneyed Star Wars analogies about Donald Trump and Darth Vader, all of which he must have heard a million times before. (Hamill is a very vocal Trump critic, a fighter in the resistance both on and off-screen.) He is a testament to the value of the quieter life: while Ford and Fisher went on to become Hollywood superstars, and had the requisite Hollywood divorces along the way, Hamill lives with his wife of 40 years and their three children in a house in Malibu, and he looks happy and healthy. While he has done theatre and voiceover work, including playing the Joker in Batman: the Animated Series, he is only known, really, for one movie character, and he is good with that. Ford generally looks as if he would rather have a root canal without anaesthetic than talk about Star Wars, but Hamill is as much of a nerd as the fans, and could talk about it all day. Yet our conversation keeps going back to Fisher. After they got their make out session “out of our system”, he says, they became lifelong friends. “I wasn’t her best friend – she had so many friends and I’d go to parties with her and I would be the only one there I’d never heard of. But there was a comfort level that we’d achieved because she knew I wasn’t ever angling for a favour or trying to get her to introduce me to this agent or this director. We became like real siblings over the years,” he says. And just like siblings, they could also infuriate one another. He would occasionally accuse her of being self-centred (“Although, come on, what actor isn’t,” he concedes), while she sometimes thought he could be a bit of a stick-in-the-mud. When George Lucas told them that Disney was making another trilogy, Fisher immediately slammed her hand down on the table and announced, “I’m in!” (She then asked if there were any roles in it for her daughter, Billie Lourd, a hustling stage mom to the end.) When Lucas left the room, Hamill turned to her and hissed: “Carrie! Poker face!” “But, as usual, she was miles ahead of me because she said to me: ‘Mark, what kind of roles do you think there are in Hollywood for women over 50?’ And I thought: ‘She’s right again.’ Women have it so much harder,” he says. As time has passed, it has become only more apparent how much Hamill, Fisher and Ford resemble their Star Wars characters. “George [Lucas] casts people who are so close to what he wants so he doesn’t have to go in and do a lot of backstory and motivation,” Hamill says. “Carrie was Hollywood royalty, Harrison had been around and was” – he now breaks off to do a bang-on imitation of a grumpy and mumbling Ford – “an excellent eye-roller. And I was bright and bouncy, and fairly clueless.” But when they were cast, it was Hamill who was seen as the bigger star as he had more acting experience. So, whereas Ford got a grand total of $10,000 for Star Wars, Hamill got $650,000 plus 0.025% of the movie’s profits (which presumably explains the massive Malibu house). Forty years later, when they reunited for The Force Awakens, their pay cheques reflected how the situation had changed: Ford reportedly got $25m plus 0.5% of the profit and Hamill got what was described as “a low seven-figure salary”. The general theory about why Hamill’s career didn’t take off the way many expected after Star Wars is that directors couldn’t see past Luke Skywalker. When he asked Miloš Forman if he could audition to play Amadeus, after having played the role on stage, Forman laughed and – according to Hamill, who does a very funny imitation of the Czech director – said: “No, no, no! Because the people are not to be believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart!” And yet the people are to be believing that the Han Solo is anyone he wants to be. Surely Hamill must have found this infuriating? “Well, it is what it is. It’s been so illuminating to me that I don’t need the spotlight, you know, and the bows and all that. I was just grateful to get the opportunities,” he shrugs. Really? “Sure! I look at how Star Wars has become a part of the pop culture and it is just astonishing to me. People tell me stories about getting through their mother’s terminal illness or naming their kids Luke and Leia and I’m just taken aback at how it’s inspired people,” he says with so much wide-eyed sweetness that I actually believe him. But being known for one character has made Hamill, understandably, protective of the franchise. Although he knows it now has to be handed down to the younger generation, the “irrational side” of him winces a little: “Once I was the orphan discovering hidden powers, but that’s someone else now. I was the cocky pilot, but they got that covered, too. Once I was sneaking around in enemy territory, now it’s other characters. It’s not rational, but I feel like a bunch of strangers are rummaging around in my toy box, playing with my toys,” he says. Given that he is now acting in movies written by Johnson and Abrams, who were kids when the original movies came out, does he feel as if he is acting in their fan fiction? “Yeah, kinda!” he laughs. “I said to Rian: ‘I’m sure 30 years ago you were playing with little figures of me, making up stories on a little play set. And now here it is, writ large.’” But Johnson’s toys presumably didn’t argue back, as Hamill made a point of doing. When he first read the script, he disagreed with “almost everything” Johnson had written, starting with Luke’s self-imposed isolation on an island on the planet of Ahch-To. “Even if I was traumatised by something, I might take a year of meditation, but he would double down and come back harder. Jedis don’t give up!” he says, switching, as he often does when talking about Luke, between the first and third person. “But it’s not my story any more and I just have to accept that. And I then bonded very deeply with Rian, but I had to let him know how I felt.” Yet, whether it is Johnson’s script or Hamill’s maturity, he has never been better than he is in the new movie, playing the grumpy elder statesman, alternating easily between solemnity and wisecracks. It is a truly triumphant comeback, and, given that Fisher won’t be back in the next Star Wars, it seems a safe bet that Hamill will be, although he is coy about answering. But the question makes him think, inevitably, about Fisher again. “You know, as tough and verbally caustic as she was, the way she used words as a weapon, there was also a side to her that was really vulnerable, like a little girl. And that brought out the protectiveness in me,” he says. “I was just appalled that they didn’t let it rest in peace and they were talking about her autopsy and all of that stuff. When I think of her I don’t think of her … of her … failings. I think of how triumphant she was. She could be completely infuriating, but she could also make you feel like the most important person in the world. I mean, if I’d had a relationship with her, it would have been like a full-time activity because she was too much for me in every regard: she was too creative, she was too smart. She was just the best.” And he suddenly looks completely stricken, like a brother who has lost his sister, a man who has lost his friend. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is in cinemas now This article was amended on 14 December 2017, to correct the suggestion that Carrie Fisher died on a flight from London.

Frustration was chief among them on the night Albion set an unwanted club record of 16 games without a win while climbing out of the relegation zone. For the second time in four days Liverpool were held at home by a well-drilled defensive unit and Klopp confronted a referee on the final whistle. His team had been on the wrong end of a crucial call once again, with Dominic Solanke having a late goal disallowed for handball, although the Liverpool manager confirmed he approached the referee, Paul Tierney, to complain about the amount of injury time as well as to discuss the substitute’s 82nd-minute effort. Dejan Lovren penalty outrage it was not. Solanke thought he had scored his first Liverpool goal when Joe Gomez’s low cross deflected off Ahmed Hegazi, struck him on the chest and then a raised arm en route to Ben Foster’s goal. Tierney and his assistant decreed otherwise, and rightly so. Alan Pardew’s side rode their luck on occasion but worked tirelessly and defended expertly for a point on the night they set the longest winless streak in the club’s 139-year history. “I looked along the line and the assistant didn’t move, which usually says something is amiss,” the Baggies new manager said. “After it has hit Ahmed, Solanke has swung an arm, it’s hit him and gone in. It is a brave call for an assistant referee to make that in front of the Kop; the right decision but still a brave decision. Maybe it was the slice of luck we deserved.” Klopp claimed the ball had struck Solanke’s chest but was unsure about the arm. The Liverpool manager said: “I’ve seen a few replays, there’s an arm, but I’m not sure he touches the ball. I’m not sure. I’m sure it’s not on purpose. It must be a really good assistant that made the decision. He will be happy if there was a hand involved. That’s another moment where we had no luck.” A Solanke shot that was cleared off the line by Hegazi moments later was another although, to use Klopp’s words, this was a “stiff” and “static” Liverpool performance. Their “rotated four” – Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum – were back in the starting line-up after being benched against Everton. The rest did not inspire an urgent or incisive display and Klopp spent much of the first half imploring his front two, Firmino and Mohamed Salah, to switch places more frequently to break an Albion defence marshalled superbly by Jonny Evans. Alongside him Hegazi was also commanding. Salah pierced Pardew’s back-line with an exquisite diagonal ball across the Albion penalty area towards Firmino. Allan Nyom’s failure to intercept offered the Brazilian a clear sight of goal but his first-time shot sailed beyond both Foster and the far post. That was as close as Liverpool came to breaking the deadlock before half-time. Salah was a foot away from connecting with an inviting cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold that sailed behind Hegazi, his international team-mate, and Coutinho shot straight at Foster from distance. Otherwise Liverpool’s attacking play lacked its usual urgency and rhythm with Sadio Mané struggling to get involved. Albion, though reverting to a back six at times, did not sit deep for the entirety of the contest and struck the bar when Hal Robson-Kanu curled a 25-yard effort over Loris Karius, deputising for Simon Mignolet, who suffered a swollen ankle against Everton. The visitors were also a threat from Grzegorz Krychowiak’s set-pieces. Claudio Yacob forced Karius to save well with a glancing header from a corner by the impressive Poland midfielder – “he showed his international class,” said Pardew – and Hegazi should have done better with another delivery to the back post. Thereafter it was back to absorbing Liverpool pressure for Albion. Klopp’s team built up ominous momentum in the second half but the all-important breakthrough eluded them. Their manager was more resigned than incandescent this time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/13/southampton-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T21:44:40Z","webTitle":"Riyad Mahrez sparkles as Leicester cruise to win at Southampton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/13/southampton-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/13/southampton-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Riyad Mahrez sparkles as Leicester cruise to win at Southampton","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This time Southampton should be grateful for Claude Puel’s restraint. The Frenchman could have cackled heartily after this win but decided not to take leave of his manners. His team had already made his point in thoroughly satisfying fashion anyway, staging a masterclass in sharp attacking at the expense of the club who sacked him six months ago partly on the grounds that his style was boring. The boos at the final whistle could be translated as English for “touché”. Puel, determined not to rub his revenge in those faces, said: “Of course it was a strange feeling to come back here but it was nice to see familiar faces. My feeling was always to keep positive with Southampton. I kept a good relationship with a lot of people here. I tried to give my best when I was here and we had some fantastic games and developed some players. For me it was a great introduction to the Premier League and all this work perhaps allowed me to become a better manager.” The boos were also a denunciation of Southampton’s ineptitude and they spell trouble for Mauricio Pellegrino. Rather than deliver more thrills, the Argentinian has served up inferior results to the ones Puel produced during his season on the south coast and a lower goals-per-game average. Leicester are eighth in the table which, funnily enough, is the position to which Puel led Southampton last season in addition to guiding them to their first major final for 14 years. Southampton are eight points below Puel’s side and fretting about the possibility of sinking lower. “I have to say sorry to our fans because you can lose games but not in this way,” said Pellegrino, who said his side’s haplessness came as a shock after the weekend’s encouraging draw with Arsenal. “This performance surprised everybody. It was not about tactics or a technical problem, we were really bad from beginning to end.” That was slightly harsh. Because Southampton started as if intent on proving their attacking capability and they made a convincing case for about two minutes. A couple of corners put the visitors in early difficulty, with Maya Yoshida nearly forcing the ball over the line from one. But then Leicester took over. Riyad Mahrez opened the scoring in the 10th minute, firing a low shot into the net from 25 yards. It was his fourth goal since the appointment of Puel and his gleaming play here was not confined to goal-scoring, as he teased his opponents with beguiling runs and cunning passes. Soon after the Algerian’s goal Shinji Okazaki attempted a cover version but Southampton’s goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, was back on song. When Okazaki beat the goalkeeper in the 22nd minute, Mario Lemina whacked the ball off the line. Not until the half-hour did Southampton’s lone striker, Charlie Austin, get a sniff but Kasper Schmeichel batted his shot from the edge of the area. Leicester raced down the other end and almost scored, Forster denying Jamie Vardy. Mahrez pulled the ensuing corner to the edge of the box where Christian Fuchs met it with a thumping volley. Forster parried the shot but Okazaki poked in the rebound. “Boring, boring Leicester,” chanted the away fans, followed by the mocking inquiry: “Are you glad you sacked Puel?” Moments later those fans were celebrating again as the home defence folded in the face of a routine free-kick lofted into the box by Mahrez. Harry Maguire took it down on his chest and teed up Andy King, who was free to tap in from close range. Pellegrino, knowing he had to do something to save face and perhaps also his job, switched to a two-pronged attack for the second half, replacing Oriol Romeu with Manolo Gabbiadini. But Leicester continued to tear through their hosts. Eventually Southampton stammered a retort when Yoshida headed in from a corner by Ryan Bertrand. They nearly cut the deficit further but Schmeichel saved well from Austin. Soon Leicester settled the argument, with witless abetting from the hosts. Mahrez pounced on a sloppy pass and released Vardy, whose cross was turned into the net by Okazaki. The final whistle was met with Southampton fans venting their dismay. This time that must have been music to Puel’s ears."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/13/tottenham-hotspur-brighton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T22:05:49Z","webTitle":"Serge Aurier’s slice of luck helps Spurs to victory over Brighton and into top four","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/13/tottenham-hotspur-brighton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/13/tottenham-hotspur-brighton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Serge Aurier’s slice of luck helps Spurs to victory over Brighton and into top four","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tottenham Hotspur clawed their way back in to the top four with an unspectacular but uncompromising display against a typically dogged Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. The visitors gave their all and were in turn given full respect by their hosts, but a wonderful fluke from Serge Aurier and a Son Heung-min header late in the second half ultimately left them coming up short. Chris Hughton’s best-laid plans went awry thanks to a cross that went under the bar; Aurier’s looping ball from the touchline evading the fingertips of Matt Ryan in the 40th minute. It was the game’s decisive moment. Up until that point Brighton had largely kept Spurs at arm’s length. But they had expended a lot of energy trying and, in the end, a 2-0 scoreline felt about right. “Yes of course, a bit of luck helps a lot,” Pochettino said after the match. “You know that when the opposition is so close and so deep and want to play only to defend it is not easy. I think the team created a lot of chances and deserved to score before, but that is football. I am so happy, very pleased for the victory and then the performance.” Pochettino insisted he was not criticising his opponents. “I am not going to complain about how another team plays,” he said. “I need to think about how to help my players, how to help them to make the right space.” It appeared, however, that he had altered his approach to try to crack the Brighton nut. In the first half set-pieces were rarely taken directly, and were instead pushed to the edge of the box for shots or shorter, faster crosses. In possession, too, there were more crosses and more shots, an apparently determined attempt to force deflections which might knock the Brighton defence momentarily out of shape. When it came to the opening goal, nothing could be done because it was not deliberate. It sprang out of a moment of wonderful skill, Aurier fooling José Izquierdo with a feint before driving his cross up over Ryan and into the far post. Son’s second came in the closing moments of the match, a stooping header at the near post from Christian Eriksen’s free-kick. Harry Kane hit the post with his own dead ball just minutes before that but had Tomer Hemed done better with a close‑range effort in the 70th minute, itself the result of a deflection, the game might have panned out very differently. Chris Hughton’s team now have just two points from the past six matches but they still find themselves in 13th position with home games against Burnley and Watford next. “We’re a newly promoted team and we went through a really good period,” Hughton said. “Now, results-wise, we’re in a difficult period. “What we have to accept is that this is going to happen in a season and what defines you is how you come through it. Hopefully we’ve seen enough positives tonight to take forward.” For Spurs, the positives were the energy of Erik Lamela, who lasted 74 minutes on his first start since last year, and the physical determination with which they went about their task. They will need all that and more on Saturday when they travel to the Etihad Stadium to face the record-breaking Manchester City, but Pochettino was in typically blithe mood when asked about the challenge (although notably less so when asked how Dele Alli had felt about being left on the bench for this match). “Look, I am so positive,” the Tottenham manager said of the Manchester City game. “I am a positive person, I am so happy because we won and the three points are so important for us. “What is going to happen on Saturday? Who knows. We are going to enjoy it because it is a fantastic challenge. We are going to play the best team in England this year and one of the best in Europe. And we are going to go to Manchester thinking we can win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/13/donald-trump-attacks-media-fake-news-underlines-democracy-david-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T22:05:23Z","webTitle":"Trump undermines democracy with media attacks, says Cameron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/13/donald-trump-attacks-media-fake-news-underlines-democracy-david-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/13/donald-trump-attacks-media-fake-news-underlines-democracy-david-cameron","fields":{"headline":"Trump undermines democracy with media attacks, says Cameron","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Cameron has accused Donald Trump of undermining democracy by attacking the media, saying the true threat posed by fake news lay with Vladimir Putin, his twitter bots and Russian efforts to use corruption as a weapon of foreign policy. The former British prime minister also accused Russia of winning the right to stage the 2018 Fifa World Cup via corruption. Giving his first British public lecture since his resignation in the wake of the Brexit referendum defeat in 2016, Cameron also defended multilateral institutions such as the European Union, warning isolationism driven by anti-globalisation endangered the world’s security. Giving a lecture in London to Transparency International, he said: “Just as with all our biggest challenges – on trade, on terrorism, on climate change, on global poverty – we need to work with other nations if we want change. We cannot do this alone.” Cameron warned that Trump’s attacks on news organisations such as CNN and the BBC were not just tactically wrong but dangerous. He accused the US president of “an attempt to question the whole legitimacy of organisations that have an important role in our democracy”. Cameron said: “Let me put it like this: President Trump, ‘fake news’ is not broadcasters criticising you, it’s Russian bots and trolls targeting your democracy pumping out untrue stories day after day, night after night. “When you misappropriate the term ‘fake news’, you are deflecting attention from real abuses. Ignoring what’s happening on social media is facilitating a form of corruption that is undermining democracy.” He then directly challenged the way in which Russia won the right to stage the 2018 World Cup describing the event as a fiasco. “President Putin actually boycotted the whole thing because he said it was riddled with corruption,” Cameron said. “He was right – it was.” Adding he was putting it as diplomatically as he could, he said: “I am sure he wasn’t completely surprised when Russia actually won the bid. You couldn’t make it up. In the years since, 10 of the 22 members of that Fifa executive committee were indicted or punished.” Cameron made the global fight against corruption one of the themes of his premiership, and it was the major issue of his chairmanship of the G8 in 2015. He also staged a corruption summit in 2016 at which world leaders made a series of pledges to clamp down on money laundering and kleptocracy. In his lecture he defended his record as premier, saying he persuaded British Overseas Territories, often seen as tax havens, to set up central registers of beneficial ownership that were open to law enforcement agencies. In the UK he introduced a public register on beneficial ownership. But legislation promised by Cameron in 2015 on a public register of foreign companies owning property in the UK or seeking public sector contracts has been delayed, with the government promising this week to introduce a draft law in this parliamentary session. Overall, No 10 has not given the impression of wanting to give global leadership on the issue and Cameron pointedly referred to his corruption summit as the high water mark of UK government action. He warned that the fight against corruption needed international cooperation and institutions to succeed. Returning to some of the themes that lost him his premiership, he insisted: “I am not some starry-eyed Davos-devotee who thinks there is nothing wrong with globalisation. Of course we need to help those left behind economically, with better skills, more apprenticeships and higher minimum wages. And we cannot ignore those who feel left behind culturally; whether by immigration that has been too high, or by international organisations – yes, including the European Union – that have been too high handed.” But he urged: “Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater, including market economics, institutions with rules and openness to the world. These are things that make us strong. “The things the wave of anti-globalisation is in danger of ushering in – isolationism, protectionism, unilateralism – endanger our countries and our world. And they particularly threaten the fight against corruption. “The cancer of corruption is developing, metastasising and becoming more commonplace, more complex, more multi-layered, elusive and ingrained,” he said, adding that the best antidote was “transparency, real democracy and accountability”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/13/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T21:53:17Z","webTitle":"David Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/13/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/13/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"David Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Near-perfect performances of this nature tell us little but rather enforce what we already know: this freewheeling Manchester City team are coasting towards the Premier League title. The scary thing is, on their way to comfortably dispatching Swansea City to rack up a record-breaking 15th successive league victory, at times they were merely going through the motions. David Silva continued his purple patch in front of goal by scoring either side of Kevin De Bruyne’s free-kick before Sergio Agüero wrapped up a ninth away win in the league this season. If Pep Guardiola’s side do indeed, as he believes, have so much more to give, it is going to be a joy to witness. For Swansea, who remain rock bottom, this was the harshest of reality checks after defeating West Bromwich Albion here five days ago. Paul Clement had warned his players there was no margin for error against free-scoring opponents such as these and they did not help themselves, repeatedly gifting the ball to a Manchester City side so slick in possession. When the visitors had it, Swansea simply could not get it off them. “It wasn’t nice to see that, but if you’re a Manchester City supporter it must be a pleasure,” Clement said. “To be on the receiving end of that was very difficult. I would say they are one of the best sides I have ever come across.” Guardiola made four changes from the side that won the derby against Manchester United on Sunday but this was same old swashbuckling City, with Bernardo Silva, in particular, excelling on his return. He easily wriggled free of Jordan Ayew before teeing up Agüero to nod on to the roof of Lukasz Fabianski’s goal before another superb left-foot delivery supplied David Silva, captain in the absence of Vincent Kompany, for City’s inevitable opener in the 27th minute. The Swansea defence, though, allowed David Silva far too much time and space inside the six-yard box to prod home. Seven minutes later it was 2-0, when De Bruyne fired a free-kick low beyond Fabianski, who was deceived by the ball’s thudding bounce en route to goal. There was a warm embrace between Guardiola and his assistants Domènec Torrent and Mikel Arteta, wearing a woolly hat fresh from his brush-up in the Old Trafford tunnel, but these celebrations were decidedly low-key. “There are no problems this time,” Guardiola said with a wry smile in his post-match press conference. Swansea were desperately short of quality although Wilfried Bony, at least, relished the physical battle with Eliaquim Mangala, a one-time City team-mate. But the hosts looked and played like a team bottom of the table, bereft of confidence despite that win here last weekend, typified by Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll running the ball straight out of play. The latter was unsurprisingly taken off at half-time, and replaced by Tammy Abraham. Abraham barely had time to take off his tracksuit bottoms when David Silva fired narrowly past Fabianski’s post in pursuit of a third just after the interval. Swansea puffed out their chests for a moment but it was soon again one-way traffic. Bernardo Silva, who ran rings around Olsson all night, played in Agüero who forced Fabianski into a smart right-handed stop. For City, a third goal was only a matter of time, and when Sterling sped into the box, jinking inside Kyle Naughton, there was David Silva to take on the baton, holding off Roque Mesa – too frightened to fell his countryman – before dinking the ball in for his fourth goal of the season. “He [Silva] is a real leader – he never hides on the pitch,” Guardiola said. “I am so happy, we have always spoken about him scoring more goals but he has absolutely everything – sometimes he was thinking more the pass. He scored the winning goal at Old Trafford and now two more goals. We cannot just depend on just Gabriel [Jesus] or Sergio. We are scoring goals from set pieces again, and we have many options to score goals and that is so important for us.” This was cruise control for City, with Guardiola happy to withdraw Fernandinho on the hour. Kyle Walker was rested altogether, with the towering Danilo ably filling the void at right-back. Jesus, too, was kept fresh for Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. An episode of City keep-ball shortly afterwards was equally galling for Swansea, though they would have scored but for some Ederson heroics, with the wrongfooted City goalkeeper getting two hands to Roque Mesa’s fierce deflected effort from the edge of the area. But City were largely untroubled, basking in victory by then. Guardiola introduced Oleksandr Zinchenko, handing the 20-year-old Ukraine international his league debut. Then came Ilkay Gündogan, replacing the again imperious De Bruyne. Ki-Sung Yeung had a late effort hacked away by Nicolás Otamendi but it was already game over for Swansea, with Agüero angling in a fourth goal, his 13th of the season. Manchester City had outclassed their opponents – again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/15/i-wrote-about-farmers-suicides-and-the-reaction-has-been-overwhelming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"I wrote about farmers' suicides – and the reaction has been overwhelming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/15/i-wrote-about-farmers-suicides-and-the-reaction-has-been-overwhelming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/15/i-wrote-about-farmers-suicides-and-the-reaction-has-been-overwhelming","fields":{"headline":"I wrote about farmers' suicides – and the reaction has been overwhelming","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On 6 December, The Guardian and EHRP published our piece Why are America’s farmers killing themselves in record numbers? We hoped for a reaction, but the feedback we received was beyond any expectations we might have had. Today when I spoke with farm psychologist Dr Mike Rosmann, who featured heavily in the piece, he was wading through a slew of new messages and responding to an email from a farmer in Europe. Since the story was published, Rosmann says “the faucet has turned on”. He has received hundreds of comments and requests, online and by phone, many of which he says are from farmers reaching out for support. In the past week, we’ve heard from farmers in the US, Canada, India, UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Italy. Audra Mulkern, the photographer for this story and my storytelling partner, heard from Australian farmers about the multi-year drought causing distress. “My grandparents were a team,” one person wrote, “One would cut hay and the other would rake it. We (grandkids) were right beside her hand unloading and stacking the hay sometimes more than a thousand bales a day. The day the shelves are empty is the day people will realize how important farmers are.” On her blog, a young Canadian farmer wrote: “As I sat thinking about why the article upset me so much other than the obvious reasons I realized that at this moment in time; when it comes to farming I feel like I am digging my own grave to follow my dreams.” “Thanks for shining light on the issue of suicide,” wrote one psychiatrist. “I hope to get more Mental Health services going in my farm community.” We’ve heard from countless consumers who want to know how to help. We’ve heard from organizations now brainstorming new rural helplines and outreach initiatives. We’ve heard from other journalists covering the rural crisis, organizers adding sessions on stress management to farm conference schedules, and agricultural sales representatives who want to know how to look for warning signs among their farmer clients. Rosmann has heard from people who want to produce art and other media about the farmer suicide crisis, people who want to donate computers to farmers for Skype therapy sessions, and survivors who want to donate their time and stories to help prevent future deaths. But perhaps most importantly, we’ve begun to hear from legislators. US Senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota wrote: “When you’re from a farming community, you understand the stresses that many farmers face every day. But outside rural America, so many aren’t aware about how difficult it is to work as a farmer ... “We need to support farmers who feed our country and the world, and that includes making sure they can get the mental health services they need, even if they live in remote areas. To make that possible, it means increasing health care coverage and affordability for these self-employed and small business producers – through private health insurance, Medicaid expansion, or Medicaid – and increasing the mental health workforce in rural communities so farmers have access to help. “Additionally, the federal government needs to keep supporting farm programs that help farmers during tough times – that’s why I pushed for Congress to expand and strengthen the ELAP program and pressed for FSA offices to get fully staffed when farmers need assistance during the drought. The first step is awareness about these challenges, and now we need solutions.” JT Wilcox, a fourth generation farmer and a Washington state representative, says he’s motivated to work on a bill for behavioral healthcare programs for farmers in his state, similar to the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) mentioned in the article. As of 12 December, two other Washington state representatives have offered to work on the bill with Wilcox. He said: “I’ve told people that the stress in politics is like a vacation compared to some of the years I spent in our family business. In the four generations we’ve operated, each generation has come within weeks of losing the farm. Few understand the weight of generations and history on people who are faced with economic forces totally out of their control.” Dr Rosmann says it’s time for legislative action, and that farmers and consumers should contact legislators, at both state and federal levels, to demand policy that provides behavioral healthcare for people working in agriculture. This has been a five-year project for me, and I have been overwhelmed by the response. As is true with all projects you care about so deeply, I did not get to write everything that I wanted to. I did not get to write about the rancher whose hair fell out in clumps because of stress. The widow whose farm was foreclosed on in the 1980s even though they had never missed a payment. The farmer who fell to the ground and sobbed when his cows were taken to auction. The dairy farmer and mother of 14, who said, “You cannot have commerce. You cannot have academia without the stability that farmers provide – food.” There are so many stories, and I believe they are all critical to hear. Because even for those of us not farming, farmer suicide touches us, too. The crisis lives on our supermarket shelves, in our bags of rice and flour, in our steaks and cotton T-shirts, the ethanol powering our cars. We are not removed from it. This is our story, too. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

May was applauded at the dinner on Thursday evening after she thanked EU leaders for their help in concluding the first phase of Brexit talks, in a sign of general relief and approval for May. “She is our colleague. Britain is a member state. We are not only trying to be, but we are polite and friendly people,” European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said as he left the summit. The prime minister’s setback in the Commons on Wednesday evening had provoked questions in Brussels over Downing Street’s ability to negotiate the second phase of talks, along with hope in some quarters that the UK may eventually reverse its decision to leave the bloc. As leaders prepared to agree on Friday morning that sufficient progress had been made in the first phase of the negotiations to move the talks on, concerns were further raised over whether May had sufficient grip to offer an agreed UK position on the future. The EU has set the British cabinet a three-month deadline to provide clarity on its approach to a future trade deal. After the dinner, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she it was clear May had done enough to move talks on, but warned time was running out. “There are still a lot of problems to solve. And time is of the essence.” On Wednesday, MPs voted by 309-305 to limit ministers’ power to make sweeping changes to the law before parliament has approved a Brexit deal. The cabinet is yet to have a substantive discussion about any future trade arrangement with the bloc. Over dinner, however, the British prime minister reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to delivering a smooth and orderly exit from the EU. May told the leaders that the British government “makes no secret of wanting to move on to the next phase and to approaching it with ambition and creativity”. “I believe this is in the best interests of the UK and the European Union,” May said. “A particular priority should be agreement on the implementation period so that we can bring greater certainty to businesses in the UK and across the 27.” While conceding that the future negotiations were likely to be difficult she also insisted the UK and the EU had demonstrated what could be achieved with commitment and perseverance on both sides. Arriving at the summit on Thursday, after attending a memorial to those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire, May had told reporters the government was still “on course to deliver Brexit”. She said: “I am disappointed with the amendment but actually the EU withdrawal bill is making good progress through the House of Commons.” Government sources suggested they were happy for the EU to offer what is expected to be a vague declaration on the future trading relationship on Friday, as they felt their hands had been tied in the first phase by strict guidelines set by the EU in April. The two sides appear to be sticking to very different arguments about the scale of the trade arrangement that is likely to be in place by March 2019. EU negotiators have suggested it will merely be a political agreement that will be fleshed out with detailed negotiations during the transition phase. British ministers insist that the substantial agreement must be complete by the Brexit deadline. The UK has also insisted that preliminary talks on trade could start earlier in the new year. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said on Thursday that he did not expect talks about trade to start until the spring. “The indicative timetable is that we will spend the next three months or so working on the withdrawal agreement, putting into a legal, international agreement what was agreed last week, talking a bit about the two-year transition phase,” he said. “And once we have that done, we can then talk about the new trading relationship.” Despite the May’s comments, the Austrian chancellor, Christian Kern, said he still believed Britain could still change its mind about Brexit. “I hope that it could be reversed because there will be a lot of big issues and challenges that will not be easy to solve,” he said. “There will be a lot of tensions in the domestic political area in Great Britain.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, whose country is an advocate for a close relationship with the UK after Brexit, was among those who praised May. But he called on her to swiftly set out a vision of the future to allow substantive talks on trade to start. Rutte said: “I still think she has a formidable stature here and last Friday showed all of us that we should not underestimate Theresa May. She’s a formidable politician.” Asked whether he believed May could still deliver on her promises, he said: “Yes, I do think so, because I believe in UK society and also in the political circles there’s widespread support for a reasonable negotiated exit of Britain from the EU.” In response to David Davis’s suggestion that last week’s agreement between the UK and EU had no legal standing, Rutte added: “An eyebrow was raised here and there because of that comment but I think it makes it more necessary to have as soon as possible that deal of last Friday in legally binding text so that we cannot have a misunderstanding exactly what was agreed.” The Conservative leader in the European parliament, Ashley Fox, said he was disappointed by those who had voted against the government on Wednesday night, adding: “It is not going to help the UK negotiate a good deal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/14/twitter-response-to-brexit-interference-inquiry-inadequate-mp-says","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T14:32:58Z","webTitle":"Twitter's response to Brexit interference inquiry inadequate, MP says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/14/twitter-response-to-brexit-interference-inquiry-inadequate-mp-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/14/twitter-response-to-brexit-interference-inquiry-inadequate-mp-says","fields":{"headline":"Twitter's response to Brexit interference inquiry inadequate, MP says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Twitter has been attacked for its “completely inadequate” response to a parliamentary committee seeking answers about Russian misinformation operations during the EU referendum. In its submission, sent on Wednesday, the company listed just six Russian tweets that were promoted as paid advertisements on its platform during the referendum period. All six tweets were sent by the English-language broadcaster Russia Today, which spent just over $1,000 (£750) promoting them to British users to spread awareness of its news coverage. But Damian Collins MP, chair of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport committee, said Twitter’s response failed to address any of the substantive issues raised. Instead, the company has simply replied to a far narrower request from the Electoral Commission, which was exclusively concerned with spending. “The information you have now shared with us is completely inadequate,” Collins said. “In the letter I sent to you on 3 November I requested ‘that Twitter provides to the committee a list of accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and any other Russian linked accounts that it has removed and examples of any posts from these accounts that are linked to the United Kingdom.’ “Whilst the inquiry currently being conducted by the Electoral Commission is extremely important, it is completely separate and different in nature to the inquiry that my committee is undertaking,” Collins added. “It seems odd that so far we have received more information about activities that have taken place on your platform from journalists and academics than from you,” the letter concluded. “If Twitter is serious about cooperating with the work of this committee and tackling the spread of disinformation then you should provide me with a full response to the clear questions that I set out … no later than Monday 15 January.” Collins’ condemnation of Twitter’s response comes a day after Facebook faced a similar dressing-down. It too had submitted to the committee a copy of its response to the Electoral Commission, focusing exclusively on paid advertising on its platform, of which it found just $0.97 (£0.72) worth aimed at British users. “Facebook conducted its own research to identify tens of thousands of fake pages and accounts that were active during the French presidential election,” Collins said on Wednesday. “They should do the same looking back at the EU referendum and not just rely on external sources referring evidence of suspicious activity back to them.” The two social networks’ response to the UK parliament stands in stark contrast to the wealth of information they provided to the US Congress. Following a congressional hearing into Russian operations targeting the 2016 presidential election, Twitter provided Congress with a list of 2,752 accounts that it believed were run from the IRA, a St Petersburg-based “troll army”. Facebook identified 470 accounts and pages run by the group, which had between them spent more than $100,000 on adverts, and provided examples of many of the adverts to Congress, as well as the metadata detailing how much they cost and how many views each received.

No thanks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This Friday is the deadline for purchasing 2018 health insurance in the US, after which the uninsured will be subject to a penalty. Last week I wrote about the terrible “choices” on offer, and – sorry to bang on – after a few more days spent investigating the options, I am still trying to figure out how any of this can be legal. On one site, along with filters determining age, gender and pre-existing conditions, a drop-down menu asks potential customers to identify, on a scale of one to five, what “overall quality rating” they would like in their healthcare, a hideous parody of choice that seems designed to add insult to injury. Rubbish, please; I’d like rubbish-quality healthcare because I’m too feckless to aspire any higher. Maternity coverage in many policies is capped at $5,000, which will barely get you through your first trimester in New York. There are policies on offer that dangle cheaper premiums as long as claimants promise not to get cancer for the first 12 months of coverage. In others, there is the option to take cancer off the table entirely, for a slight drop in premiums. I think this opt-out is the most shocking detail of all, asking people to take tremendous risks – why go to a check-up, when you can’t afford to get ill? – and in the event of a serious diagnosis, all but guaranteeing bankruptcy. I got briefly excited that I had found a loophole in the system with something called “healthcare sharing”, a “membership” service that on first glance seemed to avoid some of the pitfalls of the rest of the marketplace. Then I got to the small print: “As a religious organisation, members are required to agree with the organisation’s Statement of Beliefs [including] we believe that our personal rights and liberties originate from God and are bestowed on us by God.” Hmmm. The term “faith-based insurance plans” made me nervous, and that’s before I got to the part explaining that policy holders didn’t pay premiums, but rather made “love offerings” that weren’t subject to state regulation. Eventually, I rang a broker. He read me a list of unappetising options and, when I started to rant, said wearily: “There’s no point getting mad about it; this is just the way it is.” Later, I ran into my neighbour in the hall. “So I’m looking at an $800-a-month policy with a $5,000-per-person excess,” I said miserably. She looked surprised. “Wow,” she said, “that’s a really good deal.” Alabama on my mind So the bottom of the barrel has finally been found: you can beat a Republican in Trump country as long he’s a suspected child molester. That the defeat of Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race has been cause for such elation this week is a depressing measure of how bad everything else is, although the New York Times optimistically predicted the beginning of a turnaround. Meanwhile voting analysts tried to figure out which part of the electorate can now safely be ignored. Was this the end of the “white working class” as a demographic power bloc, and the rise of black women, whose turnout almost certainly enabled Moore’s defeat (a staggering 98% of black female voters supported Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, giving him a higher share of the vote than Obama won in either of his two presidential elections)? Or did the fact that 63% of white women and 72% of white men backed Moore promise us another Trump term in the White House? Gaga for Hamilton At a batmitzvah this weekend, the 13-year-old girls on the dancefloor went crazy for Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, but the song they really lost their minds to was the title track from Hamilton. Thirty kids in early adolescence jumping up and down, baring their orthodontics at each other and screaming at the tops of their lungs: “How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore / And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten / Spot in the Caribbean by providence impoverished / In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?” Out of the window, the New York skyline twinkled under snow.

On a blackboard in one of the meeting rooms, the targets of a different passion are spelled out. From uncovering the scale of plastic pollution in the oceans to targeting the textile waste of the fashion industry, MacArthur, who in 2005 broke the solo record for sailing round the world, is dedicating her life to saving it. Now 41, MacArthur dreamed of being a sailor aged four when living in landlocked Derbyshire, and saved up her school lunch money to buy her first dinghy. The same single-minded drive to achieve her goals is clear in the way she tackles the dream that has consumed her since her early 30s: to help stop humanity using up the world’s finite resources. Indeed, it is unlikely her new passion would have emerged without the experience of her first. “There were lots of subconscious things that happened that I was quite unaware of when I was racing; there were things I would write in the log,” says MacArthur. “I was racing round the world to try and beat the record, I was completely and utterly fully immersed in the record, I was thinking of nothing outside that … but every now and then I would write something down. “I remember quite poignantly writing in the log on the boat; ‘What I have got on the boat is everything.’ It really struck me that you save everything, everything you have, because you know it’s finite, you know there isn’t any more. What you have on that boat is it, your entire world.” Back on dry land, away from the intensity of racing, MacArthur began to process the thoughts she had on the water. Her newfound fame suddenly became an opportunity. In the winter after the round-the-world race, MacArthur spent two weeks on an island in the Southern Ocean to film a programme about the albatross. “It gave me time to reflect and it made me think even more deeply about resources,” she said. “You see the empty whaling stations down there and you realise that was just a resource – they pulled out 175,000 of them … and then there weren’t any to pull out.” “The basis of my thinking was completely around resources. It was around the pure fact – stemming from what I had learned on the boat – that resources are finite. The more I learned, I just saw this as the greatest challenge I had ever come across. If we are using these resources in a very linear fashion we are going to use them up at some stage, and no one knows exactly when.” MacArthur realised that if she was to capitalise on her moment of fame, her days as a competitive sailor would have to end. MacArthur researched how best to move away from the disposable economic model to one in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible, then recovered and regenerated into other products and materials. She decided to dedicate herself to acting as a catalyst for change – a task that required her single-minded attention. “It wasn’t like I was looking to stop sailing, I never thought I would stop sailing ever, ever, ever, no way,” she said. “I would have argued 10 years ago I would be racing in 20 years’ time. It was the hardest decision I have ever made to walk away, but I realised I was at a position in my life where doors had opened that I wasn’t expecting to open and I could use that ... that now was the time.” Within two years of launching her foundation, MacArthur was presenting an analysis on the circular economy to the World Economic Forum. Seven years later, the team has grown from the yachtswoman and a couple of friends to a 100-strong staff on the Isle of Wight, where she lives with her partner and young baby. Today she still sails, but just as a hobby. The foundation’s groundbreaking investigation into plastics produced shocking findings: 95% of plastic packaging material – worth $80-120bn each year – is lost to the economy after a single use, and after 40 years of recycling only 5% of plastic is recycled into a similar quality item. Perhaps the most devastating statistic was the finding that if plastic leakage is not quenched, by 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic than fish by weight. MacArthur believes it is through global partnerships and “incredibly frank conversations” with industry that change will naturally come by proving that more money can be made from circular rather than linear economics. “We are trying to change a system, not one business. We need to change the way people think, the way things are designed, the materials that are put into them,” she said. Her optimism is such that she believes change will happen through collaboration, and she has numerous leading companies, from Nike to Unilever, Google and Renault, as partners. MacArthur is reticent about a more interventionist, polluter-pays approach, in which companies are forced to move to a less wasteful model through taxation, fines and charges. “There are mechanisms to speed these things up, regulation or policy change,” is as far as she will go. Even with plastic packaging, the material which, according to her research, is part of a system that is the hardest to change, she shies away from punitive incentives. MacArthur says some companies are getting on top of the issue – for example, Unilever, which has pledged to make all plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. “It’s shocking, its horrendous, it’s getting worse not better … but this is a systemic failure and we are trying to go back to the beginning of the pipe and stop that systemic failure through redesigning the system,” she said. “It is by working with these companies, with policy makers, with cities, with innovation to design bio-benign products – that we will tackle this. There isn’t a company out there which wants to see its logo in the ocean or in a river.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/15/this-may-be-a-turning-point-in-treating-neurodegenerative-diseases","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T17:37:04Z","webTitle":"This may be a turning point in treating neurodegenerative diseases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/15/this-may-be-a-turning-point-in-treating-neurodegenerative-diseases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/15/this-may-be-a-turning-point-in-treating-neurodegenerative-diseases","fields":{"headline":"This may be a turning point in treating neurodegenerative diseases","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"They are diseases that threaten more than physical health: memories, personality, and the ability to move and speak are incrementally stolen. And until this year neurodegenerative diseases, from Alzheimer’s to ALS, had been entirely unstoppable. However, a breakthrough in Huntington’s disease this week suggests this bleak picture could be about to change. The landmark trial was the first to show that the genetic defect that causes Huntington’s could be corrected, raising hopes that the drug will become the first to slow the progress of the disease – or even stop it. The Huntington’s results alone would have been remarkable enough, but they come just a month after the same experimental class of drugs were revealed to help patients with a different degenerative disease, called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Babies with the most severe form of SMA normally never develop the strength to sit up or roll over, but after four years on the drug, some of these children are starting to stand and take their first steps with a walker. The two trials have triggered a wave of optimism that drugs built on similar principles could be used to target a wide range of deadly brain disorders, possibly even Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. “I don’t want to overstate this too much, but this could be a turning point,” said Prof John Hardy, a neuroscientist at University College London who was awarded the Breakthrough prize for his work on Alzheimer’s. Hardy describes the results as potentially the biggest advance for neurodegenerative disease in 50 years. “If it’s worked for one, why can’t it work for a lot of them? I am very, very excited,” he added. The power of this new class of drugs – called antisense oligonucleotides – comes from their unique ability to home in on genetic flaws and shut down their destructive effects at source. They work by intercepting messenger molecules known as RNA, which are responsible for translating instructions in the genetic code into proteins. The synthetic DNA used in the treatments can be built in the lab, like Lego, meaning that scientists can now use nature’s own machinery to intervene and switch the production of proteins on and off. In Huntington’s, the drug called Ionis-HTTRx works by killing off the messenger molecule that is responsible for producing a toxic protein called huntingtin. A larger trial is expected to show whether this also slows or reverses the progression of the disease. The SMA drug, Nusinersen, has already crossed this milestone. When babies were injected with the medicine in a phase 3 trial, they not only stabilised but began to gain strength. In fact, the success was so striking that the trial was stopped early so the babies who had been placed on a placebo treatment could be immediately switched to the drug. “It’s a sentinel moment,” said Richard Finkel, the paediatric neurologist at the Nemours Children’s Hospital in Orlando, Florida, who led the trial. “Having spent 30 years telling parents that we had nothing to offer their baby except for comfort care, basically sending them home with a death sentence, having something that can be offered to them is remarkable. It’s not a cure, but it’s a great first step.” The SMA drug works in the reverse direction – instead of blocking the production of a bad protein, it manages to restore the body’s ability to make a protein that is essential for the survival of neurons in the base of the brain and spinal cord. Preliminary results from a new trial suggests that when the drug is given before symptoms appear (typically about three months old) its effects can be even more profound. Babies in the latest trial, who were given the drug from shortly after birth, are, incredibly, showing no physical signs of their illness. They have learned to sit and roll over, and two of the three babies Finkel is treating were walking at their first birthday. “The [third one] is a little hesitant, but she’s healthy as can be,” he said. “These babies are doing remarkably well.” Finkel said there is now a strong case for adding SMA to the panel of diseases such as cystic fibrosis that are routinely screened for at birth because, for the first time, there is a treatment. Since bad proteins, or missing proteins, lie at the heart of all neurodegenerative diseases, a race is now underway to find new targets that synthetic DNA drugs could be applied to. A protein called synuclein is implicated in Parkinson’s and the production of amyloid and tau are known to run out of control in Alzheimer’s and some other dementias. However, it is not yet clear whether blocking these substances in the brain will help – and the many previous drugs aimed at doing so have failed in clinical trials. Tim Miller, David Clayson professor of neurology at Washington University in St Louis, led the preclinical testing of a drug aimed at lowering tau in the brain. In mice, it reversed the animals’ brain damage, halted memory loss and extended their lives. The biotech company Ionis, which was behind the Huntington’s success, is now carrying out a clinical trial of the treatment in early Alzheimer’s patients that is expected to end in 2020. Miller describes the recent results in SMA and Huntington’s as a “massive deal”, that have added to his confidence in trying the approach for other degenerative diseases. He is also involved in a trial for a genetic form of ALS. “We don’t know whether there will be success yet,” he said. “I want to be a little bit careful, because we just don’t know yet.” If the drugs were ultimately shown to help treat the kinds of dementias that affect millions of people, it would pose a new problem of economics rather than science. DNA strands cannot be conveniently packaged into a pill form, and the drugs have to be spinally injected in order to have an impact in the brain. In a recent talk, Hardy estimated the current cost of treating a single patient with this kind of drug at $750,000 per year. Of course, the figure would come down if more patients were treated, he said, but from a high starting point. There would also be the question, ethical and economic, of whether treatments that just slowed the progress of dementia, potentially prolonging the period of decline, could be justified. “These are very complicated questions,” said Hardy. “It’s going to be a challenge for neurologists and the health service in general.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/14/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-storms","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T20:00:04Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend: share your songs about storms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/14/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-storms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/14/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-storms","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend: share your songs about storms","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There’s a storm brewing this week and we’d like to hear your musical nominations to accompany it.

The report found that print sales of literary fiction are significantly below where they stood in the mid-noughties and that the price of the average literary fiction book has fallen in real terms in the last 15 years. The growth in ebook sales in genres such as crime and romance has not made up for the shortfall in literary fiction, prompting ACE to outline ways it intends to support affected authors. “It would have been obviously unnecessary in the early 90s for the Arts Council to consider making an intervention in the literary sector, but a lot has changed since then – the internet, Amazon, the demise of the net book agreement – ongoing changes which have had a massive effect,” said ACE’s literature director Sarah Crown. “It’s a much more unforgiving ecosystem for authors of literary fiction today. We inevitably end up with a situation where the people best positioned to write literary fiction are those for whom making a living isn’t an imperative. That has an effect on the diversity of who is writing – we are losing voices, and we don’t want to be in that position.” Carried out by digital publisher Canelo, the report analysed sales data from Nielsen BookScan and found that between 2007 and 2011, hardback fiction sales slumped by £10m. Paperback fiction had a more extreme dip, seeing declines almost every year after 2008. In 2011, paperback fiction sales were £162.6m; by 2012, they were £119.8m. The few literary works that have sold more than 1m copies include Atonement by Ian McEwan, The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini, The Time Traveler’s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger and Life of Pi by Yann Martel. Last year’s bestselling literary novel was Kate Atkinson’s A God in Ruins, which sold 187,000 copies – roughly half the 360,000 copies of Elizabeth is Missing by Emma Healey, the bestseller of 2015. The researchers looked at the 10,000 bestselling fiction titles over the last five years and found: “Outside of the top 1,000 authors (at most), printed book sales alone simply cannot provide a decent income. While this has long been suspected, the data shows unambiguously that it is the case. … What’s more, this is a generous assessment. After the retailer, distributor, publisher and agent have taken their cut, there won’t be a lot of money left from 3,000 sales of the 1,000th bestselling title. That we are returning to a position where only the best-off writers can support themselves should be a source of deep concern.” The novelist Kit de Waal, whose 2016 debut My Name Is Leon was a bestseller, was one of many writers interviewed for the report. “A career in writing is really, really difficult,” said De Waal. “There is zero chance of taking two years out of life to concentrate on writing for many people. All the big questions for writers from my background are about writing in your spare time. If you have to take time to write, you are living on the poverty line. All the things that would feed you as a writer – lectures or writers’ groups – cost something. If you are truly broke, it’s too much.” One reason suggested by the report for the decline in literary fiction sales is the recession, happening at the same time as the rise of cheap and easy entertainment. “In comparison with our smartphones, literary fiction is often ‘difficult’ and expensive: it isn’t free, and it requires more concentration than Facebook or Candy Crush,” the report’s authors write. ACE said that “historically, there has been an assumption that literary fiction fell within the sphere of commercial publishing, and therefore required little in the way of direct intervention from the Arts Council”. It is now proposing to support more individual authors through its grants for the arts programme, to prioritise its funding of diverse organisations, particularly outside London, and to increase its support for independent literary fiction publishers – one of the few bright areas noted by the report, which pointed to “a flowering of new independent presses devoted to literary fiction”. It is also intending to begin discussions with the government about the introduction of a tax relief for small publishers, and to support opportunities for reader development. “There’s a belief that everyone can read, so everyone is a reader, but in reality, we’re on our phones all the time, on Twitter all the time,” said Crown. “We need to recognise there are other demands on people’s time, and we are saying that there is something so unique and important and necessary and fundamental about literary fiction in particular, that we need to focus on it and support it.” However, literary novelist Will Self was not hopeful about the sector’s future. “Literary fiction is already being subsidised – think of all of the writers who are continuing to make a living now by teaching creative writing. They represent a change taking place in literature … It’s now more like quilting,” he said, describing books written on creative writing courses as “collective undertakings”. “I think that creative writing programmes are a force for conformity and lack of experimentation,” said Self. He predicted that “as it becomes clear that the massive amounts of writers who are enrolling in these courses are going nowhere [serious fiction] will be a ‘conservatoire’ form, practised by young ladies and gentlemen, and followed by a select group … like classical music or easel painting.” The print publishing industry was buoyed in 2015 when it was revealed that physical book sales had risen for the first time in four years. An increased appetite for cooking books and colouring books among consumers was credited for the shift, which continued in 2016 as ebook sales shrank 4% and print jumped 2%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/15/schools-approach-to-mobile-phones-varies-widely-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T12:43:11Z","webTitle":"A tool or a distraction?

How UK schools' approaches to mobile phones vary widely","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week the French government announced a ban on students using mobile phones in schools, following through on a pledge made by Emmanuel Macron during his presidential election campaign. The new law will allow phones to be brought into school, but prohibit their use even during breaks. The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said the measure was a “public health message to families”. Though not everyone agrees. In 2015 the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, lifted a 10-year ban on phones on school premises to “enable parents to stay in touch with their children” and “end the inequity under the current ban, which was enforced mostly at schools with metal detectors in low-income communities”. The debate about access to mobile phones in schools is ongoing in the UK, where more than 90% of teenagers have mobiles. A recent study by the London School of Economics found that in schools where mobiles were banned, the test scores of 16-year-olds improved by 6.4% – the equivalent of adding five days to the school year, economists reckon. There is no law in the UK prohibiting phone usage in schools and the Department for Education, the National Union of Teachers and the National Association of Head Teachers all say it is a decision for each school. Policies across the UK are inconsistent, ranging from outright bans at some schools to the inclusion of phones as part of lessons in others. Shiplake College, independent, Henley-on-ThamesAny pupil caught with a mobile phone on them between 8.15am and 5.45pm is given a detention. The headmaster, Gregg Davies, said there had been a significant difference in pupil behaviour since the policy was rolled out at the start of the year. “[Before the ban] I went round one lunchtime [and] was just amazed at how many boys and girls were sitting, just communicating solely with their phone. I just felt, if we’re not careful, they’re going to lose the ability to socialise with each other.” Davies said the school was clear that the mobile phone can be a “brilliant tool” in the classroom, particularly because it’s easier to carry around than a laptop. “But phones were vibrating when a text came in or an Instagram. It was distracting the learning.” Students at Shiplake can carry phones on them if they are not seen, but most put them in lockers because they say the temptation is too great. “One of our biggest sayings is ‘choice, risk, consequence’. So yes they can carry their phones round, that’s their choice, but if they take it out they risk being caught.” Initially, most pupils were against the ban, but six months on two-thirds prefer it, Davies said. Fortismere, state comprehensive, north London Students in years 7-11 are banned from bringing mobile phones to school. Since the ban was enforced in September last year, any student seen in possession of a phone at school has had the device confiscated. According to Fortismere, one of the leading state schools in the country, phones “are a distraction” and there are serious concerns about potential inappropriate use. If a phone is confiscated, it is not returned directly to the student. Instead, parents are invited to collect it after 24 hours. Sixth-form students, meanwhile, are permitted to carry phones on site but should keep them in their bags during lessons. Brighton college, independent Pupils returning in September were weaned off their mobile phones with the help of Trivial Pursuit, Monopoly and Cluedo, which pupils were encouraged to play in free time instead of indulging in social media or watching YouTube videos, in an attempt to revive socialising without screens. Mobile phone use by children in years 7, 8 and 9 is banned. Year 10 pupils have three days a week with no phones and year 11s one day a week. “Our strategy is to wean pupils off their addiction to mobile phones while they are still relatively young, gradually allowing them more freedom to use phones as they get older so that they learn how to be responsible users,” said the headteacher, Richard Cairns, when the policy was rolled out. Pupils hand in their phones at 8am and can retrieve them at the end of the day. Sixth-formers are permitted to have mobile phones during breaks, but never outdoors. Cairns said he hoped the move would give parents concerned by the addictive nature of mobile phones “the impetus to follow suit at home and even in the holidays”. Henbury, state academy, Bristol On the way to school students are busy on their phones, checking social media, listening to music, playing games. But the mobiles are tucked away in bags or pockets as soon as they arrive at school. “Our policy is really simple,” said the headteacher, Clare Bradford. “We see it, we hear it, you lose it.” There are exceptions. “If they are doing something in a lesson where the use of a phone would be handy – to take a picture, do some filming or even look something up, then the teacher may give permission for phones to be used. But that’s it.“Some of the students say it would be nice to have their phones out at break time. When we did allow this we found there was no conversation. They were just playing games on their phones and it was really boring.” The ban on phones also ensures that online bullying cannot take place during the school day. Students have mixed views on the policy. Thea, 12, said: “If they were allowed in the classroom people would be distracted and not pay attention. But at breaks and lunchtimes I think we should be allowed them. We should be given the responsibility.” Detroy, also 12, argued that the mobile phone could be a brilliant educational tool. “I think we should be allowed our phones to make notes and recordings,” he said. “I totally disagree with the policy.” Stroud high school, state grammar, Gloucestershire The school is holding a “digital detox” week in January where students can choose from a series of challenges ranging from putting all devices away from 6pm to breakfast the next day to not using phones at all for seven days.

In what amounts to a significant upgrade in operational capability, the force will also extend the role of armed officers to allow them to attend more non-firearms calls. The changes come after a turbulent few months for the force, with a string of high-profile suspensions, and morale among rank-and-file officers low, according to the Scottish Police Federation, because of poor resourcing and equipment in disrepair. Announcing the new training and deployments, the deputy chief constable for crime and operational support, Johnny Gwynne, said: “Our officers are facing increasing threats of violence from people with knives and other bladed weapons. We’ve also seen an increase in the number of officers attacked while carrying out their everyday duties.” One officer was stabbed in the back in an incident at an Edinburgh college earlier this month. There have been almost 1,000 assaults on officers across Scotland in 2017, compared with 764 in 2016. A recent survey for the Scottish Police Federation found that nine out of 10 officers wanted to be equipped with a Taser, while one in eight believed that existing personal protective equipment was ineffective. Taser use will be reviewed next autumn, and the specially trained officers will continue to be referred to Scotland’s police watchdog, the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, if they discharge the device. Currently, only armed response vehicle officers are trained to use Tasers, and there have been only three discharges this year. Gwynne added that while the terror threat to Scotland had increased over the past year, his primary concern was officer safety. “What really worries me is officers going home with a hole in them because someone’s stabbed them.” He noted that the force had lost 3,000 officer days over the past three years because of assaults while on duty. “This is not just about protecting officers but making them more available.” He said the current model for deploying armed response vehicle officers was inefficient, and that they should be available to respond to a wider range of incidents including road crashes and medical emergencies. Gwynne insisted Police Scotland had carried out extensive engagement with politicians, stakeholders and local communities before making these operational changes, and acknowledged the previous public outcry over police officers carrying weapons to everyday incidents. He admitted: “Previously we have not engaged as well as we could have when making decisions about how they are deployed.” He also confirmed that the plan to equip more officers with Tasers was set in motion by the chief constable, Phil Gormley, who remains on special leave pending the investigation of a string of misconduct allegations against him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/17/the-unseen-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"The Unseen review – nothing to see here","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/17/the-unseen-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/17/the-unseen-review","fields":{"headline":"The Unseen review – nothing to see here","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When Gemma (Jasmine Hyde) and her husband, Will (Richard Flood), lose their young son in a grim accident, death colours their marriage.

Michael King said nurses, taxi drivers, hospitality staff and council workers were among those assisted by his office after being made homeless and placed in often squalid and unsafe temporary accommodation by local authorities. “People are coming to us not because they have a ‘life crisis’ or a drug and alcohol problem, but because they are losing what they thought was a stable private-sector tenancy, being evicted and then being priced out of the [rental] market,” he said. King said the common perception that homelessness was about people with chaotic lives who slept rough no longer held true. “Increasingly, [homeless people] are normal families who would not have expected to be in this situation,” he said. The ombudsman’s report came as the latest quarterly homelessness statistics showed another year-on-year rise in the number of households classed as homeless. There are 79,150 homeless households in temporary housing, including 6,400 in bed and breakfast accommodation. Homelessness of all kinds has increased for six consecutive years in England, prompting a highly critical National Audit Office report in September that said social security cuts and ministers’ failure to get a grip on a “visibly growing problem” was costing the taxpayer £1bn a year. The homelessness charity Crisis said: “As social housing declines, welfare cuts bite and private renting costs soar, people who were less likely to become homeless in the past are now being pushed further to the brink of losing their homes.” The ombudsman investigates individual complaints about public services and registered social care providers, and fines councils thousands of pounds when complaints are upheld. In 2016-17, the ombudsman received 450 complaints about council homelessness services, with 70% of those investigated upheld. King was particularly critical of local authorities he had investigated that rehoused homeless families in damp, filthy and dangerous temporary homes. “You do not have to look to Victorian fiction to see totally Dickensian housing conditions,” he said. “Dreadful” cases of homeless families being put up in substandard accommodation landed on his desk every week, he said. Examples include: A couple with two young children who spent 26 weeks in a single room in a B&amp;B. Although they reported that the shower did not work and the room was infested with cockroaches, the council failed to ensure repairs were made. A mother whose baby had type 1 diabetes was placed in a dirty and unhygienic B&amp;B room without access to cooking facilities. The baby contracted an infection and ended up in hospital. The hospital blamed the housing, saying the mother was unable to properly feed her baby. A disabled single parent with four children was put up in B&amp;B accommodation for nearly two and a half years after her benefits were capped. The council ignored letters from medical professionals outlining concerns that living in the property was affecting the family’s health. Some councils routinely flouted homelessness law, with many placing homeless families with children in B&amp;B rooms for longer than the legal six-week limit, a practice that had a “devastating impact” on many tenants’ lives, King said. The situation had deteriorated in the four years since the ombudsman last examined it. “Sometimes it is an authority which has just made a mistake and does not understand the law. In other cases, it is a conscious attempt to manage a problem they are overwhelmed by. In some cases, they say they just do not have the staff to meet the number of applications,” he said. Although some councils had changed their homelessness policies after being admonished by the ombudsman, King said, “we still see too many families left in situations which are simply unacceptable in modern society”. Asked whether government cuts to council budgets had undermined homelessness provision, King said: “What local authorities tell us when we investigate is that they are working with increased pressures and fewer staff, fewer landlords are willing to take homeless tenants, there are increased evictions and less temporary accommodation available.” One-third of cases analysed by the ombudsman’s team involved councils in south-east England, often in affluent areas with high housing costs such as Berkshire, Sussex and Kent. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association housing spokesman, said: “Councils are facing immense pressures when it comes to temporary accommodation, having to house the equivalent of an extra secondary school’s worth of homeless children every month, and the cost of providing temporary accommodation has trebled in the last three years.” A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesperson said councils had a duty to provide safe, secure and suitable temporary accommodation. “Tackling homelessness is a complex issue with no single solution, but we are determined to help the most vulnerable in society,” they said. “That’s why we are providing over £1bn up to 2020 to prevent and reduce all forms of homelessness and rough sleeping. We are also bringing in the Homelessness Reduction Act – the most ambitious legislation in decades that will mean people get the support they need earlier.” • This article was amended on 15 December 2017.

Paul Golding, 35, is expected to appear in court on 10 January after he was charged “with using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour” following speeches at a Northern Ireland Against Terrorism rally in Belfast on 6 August. His deputy, Jayda Fransen, 31, charged on Thursday with the same offence, is expected to appear in court on Friday, in connection with an incident in Belfast on Wednesday. Golding was arrested on Thursday morning after he accompanied Fransen to her first appearance at court in Belfast, where she was facing two charges related to a speech she made to about 50 people outside Belfast city hall on 6 August. The judge, Fiona Bagnall, considered police and prosecution bail requests to limit Fransen’s involvement in any further rallies and her use of social media. Bagnall did not limit Fransen’s social media activity, but said she was not to be within 500 metres of any demonstration or parade in Northern Ireland. Fransen’s lawyer told the court that she intended to plead not guilty to two charges relating to behaviour intended to or likely to stir up hatred. Her case relating to the August speech is expected before the court again on 9 January.A police spokeswoman also said inquiries were continuing into a report received regarding a video, featuring Fransen, which was posted on social media from Belfast on Tuesday. A diplomatic row erupted between the UK and the US this month after the US president, Donald Trump, retweeted videos posted on Twitter by Fransen. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, criticised Trump over sharing the far-right group’s propaganda. “I am very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,” she said at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2017/dec/16/weekend-reading-grenfells-memorial-and-a-near-miss-in-alabama","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: Grenfell’s memorial – and a near miss in Alabama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2017/dec/16/weekend-reading-grenfells-memorial-and-a-near-miss-in-alabama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2017/dec/16/weekend-reading-grenfells-memorial-and-a-near-miss-in-alabama","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Grenfell’s memorial – and a near miss in Alabama","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘We’ll live with this a long time’ As the catastrophic fire recedes from the immediate moment, survivors and locals take stock and share their hopes and fears for the future Doubts likely to linger The British rider’s world has not fallen in following revelations of his failed drugs test but he will start next season embroiled in controversy, writes Sean Ingle The other America The UN’s Philip Alston wants to know why 41m Americans are living in poverty.

What’s that? Oh, I’m most terribly sorry, we’re not at the Oval at all. We’re at Old Trafford so there aren’t any buses. Anyway England are 43-2 with Joe Root rebuilding the innings on 17 not out and someone whose name I can’t pronounce is bowling. Which reminds me of the time when I once went to Alf Gover’s cricket school for a lesson and Alf never appeared because he had got himself locked in the lavatory. Where was I? Oh yes, it dawned on me one day this summer that I ought to retire. So I rang up Adam Mountford at the BBC to tell him and he said he thought that was a good idea too, which rather took me aback. But everyone has been so lovely to me since then and it was such a thrill to be allowed to ring the five-minute bell at Lord’s during my final Test match. As I was making my way to the ground that morning, Aggers told me the story about the time Dickie Bird rang the bell six times instead of the regulation five and jolly nearly caused a diplomatic incident. I suppose that in an ideal world I would have played cricket for a living rather than commentating on it but riding my bicycle into the side of a bus when I was at school rather put paid to that, as I was never the same batsman afterwards. Though I did go on to play some first-class cricket for Cambridge. Happy days. Which reminds me of the time Keith Miller turned up late for a day’s play after spending the night with a gloriously upholstered barmaid. If my memory serves me well, I even dropped him on 3 after which he went on to score a simply marvellous unbeaten hundred. The two years I spent working in the City were the most miserable of my life and I was delighted to be offered a lifeline writing match reports for the Times. My first game was supposed to be Sussex v Kent at Hove but I had misheard the editor on the phone and thought he said Essex and so went to Colchester instead. I then had to drive like the wind, via my club in London to pick up a couple of bottles of the finest 1959 Chablis, to get to the south coast where I made it for the final session of play. Back in those days, no one seemed to mind if you didn’t know what you were doing so I duly made up the day’s cricket I would like to have seen. My first radio commentary stint was alongside John Arlott, affectionately known as Arlers. It’s a longstanding tradition that everyone in the commentary team is given a nickname. That’s why we have Johnners, Blowers, Aggers, Daggers, Staggers, Shaggers and Tuffers. The producer is Peter Baxterers which always makes Vaughaners choke with laughter on his chocolate cake. I can’t remember very much about my first game as Arlers asked me to help him carry two suitcases up to the commentary box on the first morning. Inside were several cases of vintage claret and we were squiffy for the entire five days. At a guess, Australia won by an innings and 112 runs, though that may not be right as the Test was between England and New Zealand. In the early 1990s I was asked to do a bit of television commentary for Sky but it wasn’t a terribly successful venture as I hadn’t realised people would be expecting me to report accurately. On radio a chap can get away with saying Jimmy Anderson has just edged a single to third man when in fact he missed the ball completely because the listener is none the wiser either way. So I was relieved when Baxterers invited me back to TMS otherwise yours truly would have been out of a job. Over the years I have been lucky enough to travel all around the world to watch cricket. India is a lovely place. I remember going tiger shooting with Lord Tennyson and collapsing in stitches when he killed the goat by mistake. Pakistan can be a bit hairy as a chap needs to smuggle a case of whisky into his luggage to make the tour go with a swing, and I did once have a bit of fun relating the size of women’s boobs in the crowd to the size of their earrings. But now I must leave you, my dear old things. It’s all been the greatest of fun. For me, if not always for you. Pip pip, Blowers.

If only","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Commons has amended the EU withdrawal bill to ensure that it will get a vote on any final deal with the EU. So has parliament “taken back control”? Far from it – for two reasons. First, any such vote will be on the UK’s withdrawal agreement. By the time it comes, perhaps at the end of 2018, it will be difficult, maybe impossible, to make more than cosmetic changes. There will be no appetite in Brussels or among the EU27 member states to renegotiate. And if parliament did reject it, the impact would not be to stop Brexit, but rather to ensure that Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. Remember, as a result of parliament’s own decision to authorise the government to send the official article 50 notification, we automatically leave the EU on 29 March, 2019, with or without a deal. Moreover, there is a more fundamental problem. The withdrawal agreement will cover the topics of phase 1 of the negotiation – the deal that was agreed in principle, at a political level, last week. That is, it will cover citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border issue. It will also address the “transition” period we are about to negotiate. Why would parliament want to reject an agreement on any of these? On money, parliament won’t vote to pay more than we agree, and the EU27 certainly won’t accept less. On citizens’ rights, most MPs are happy with the basic principle that EU citizens should be allowed to stay, and don’t understand the technicalities. Voting down an agreement, adequate or otherwise, will do nothing to keep the Irish border open. And while some Brexiteers are understandably unhappy with a so-called “transition” – why would they not be, as it means merely all the rules and obligations of EU membership, but without a voice or a vote – nobody really has a better alternative. What parliament really wants – and quite right too – is a say about the much more fundamental question that will be discussed in phase 3 of the negotiations – what will the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU look like? Will we seek to maintain, as far as possible, the current degree of economic integration with the EU, even after we leave its political structures? That is, do we seek to remain, formally or through some alternative arrangements, in the EU single market and/or customs union? Or do we seek to disengage and negotiate a “deep and comprehensive trade arrangement” with the EU – that is, a comprehensive free trade agreement, with nothing like the degree of regulatory convergence implied by the single market. The latter would mean a very significant increase in barriers to trade – formal and informal – with our largest trading partner, but on the other hand offers the opportunity to shape our own regulatory framework and to conclude trade deals with the rest of world. That is a genuinely meaningful choice. It is not one that was on the referendum ballot, and there are former remainers and leavers on both sides of the divide. It is not one that has ever been properly debated or decided, either in parliament or the country. Much of the debate has been of the “cake and eat it” kind. Indeed, Theresa May has so far refused to even have a proper discussion in cabinet, since she knows there is deep disagreement. On this, the most fundamental issue, the EU27 aren’t seeking to impose their views. As EU representatives have said repeatedly, we have a binary choice to make, but it is our choice. Indeed, at the European council this week, heads of government will say that negotiations can now move to the next phase; but they will also say that discussions on the “framework for the future relationship” can only begin after the UK makes clear what it actually wants. The ball is in our court. But this is not something that parliament will be able to vote on in when it gets its “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement. By then it will be too late. The UK’s negotiating position on this all-important aspect of Brexit will have to be set out in the next couple of months. If parliament actually wants a meaningful voice on this – perhaps the most important single choice about the future of the UK economy since the mid-1970s – it needs to act now. It should insist that, before we table anything in Brussels for the phase 2 negotiations, there should be a proper debate in parliament. Let’s settle the things we didn’t and couldn’t decide in the referendum. Do we care more about the freedom to set our own regulations or about being part of the largest single market in the world? Do we care more about ending free movement or about preserving free trade with Europe? Do we care more about “frictionless” borders in Ireland and Dover or about trade deals with the US? These are vitally important political and economic questions, with no “right” answers. And they shouldn’t be left to a weak prime minister and her divided cabinet and party. Now is the time to take back control. • Jonathan Portes is senior fellow of UK in a Changing Europe"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"community/2017/dec/15/the-governments-played-us-for-fools-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T12:17:18Z","webTitle":"'The government's played us for fools': your best comments on the Guardian today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/dec/15/the-governments-played-us-for-fools-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/dec/15/the-governments-played-us-for-fools-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","fields":{"headline":"'The government's played us for fools': your best comments on the Guardian today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Readers have been discussing the latest on the EU27 summit, as well as the benefits of counselling and Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year: youthquake.

EU leaders arrive at summit to discuss Brexit progress EU leaders have ruled that Brexit negotiations can move on to discussions about Britain’s future outside the bloc. Guardian readers have been discussing the progress so far. ‘No matter how you voted in the referendum we’ve all been played for utter fools’ This is the tragedy and the black comedy at the same time, isn’t it - May and her cabinet, after 18 months, have not even discussed a preferred outcome or direction for Brexit. Logically, there can be no talk of negotiation all this time if there is no clear goal towards which you’re negotiating. So what have Davis and co been doing all this time? We, the country, not matter how anyone voted in the referendum, are continually played for utter fools by this sick gang of pantomime public servants. 149222 A moment that changed me: when deep sadness drove me to counselling Guardian sports feature writer Sachin Nakrani wrote about how counselling helped him come to terms with sadness. Readers have been sharing their own stories. ‘Companionship needs to be incidental, not just taken like medicine’ That was the first of these articles on loneliness that clicked with me at all, thank you, Sachin. The one thing I know about loneliness, and which this article makes clear, is that companionship needs to be incidental, not just taken like medicine. And that’s why Men’s Sheds work - you don’t go there to be friends with the others because you haven’t any friends yourself, you go there for the workbench and the tools and to make things. And once there, you become friends with the others, via the work and in a proper social context, not a therapeutic or medical one. Personally I feel the same about exercise. I want to go for a walk, or dig at my allotment or whatever. I don’t want to go to a gym and get on a treadmill. Too many of the supposed cures for social isolation and loneliness - and depression - are like the treadmill at the gym, imo. What we need are many more routine opportunities for the social equivalent of the walk or gardening. Tenthred ‘Youthquake’ named 2017 word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries Readers have been talking about the word of the year, what it means and how, for many, this is the first time they’ve ever heard it. ‘Surely this reflects the deep divisions in society?’ First time I’ve come across this word. Don’t understand why they think it sounds an optimistic note. Having been a youth and having since matured, I regard youths as “work in progress”. Their judgement is not really to be relied upon when it is highly likely to change as a result of greater experience. Furthermore, to the extent that it is a phenomenon at all (is it?) it surely reflects the deep divisions in society. cynicalshrink ‘Give young people today a platform and they will start protesting without think of the ramifications’ I remember being young, not so long ago, almost yesterday as I approach my 70’s. I thought I knew so much only to realise I only knew so little of life. But in comparison to today’s youth I was savvy, street wise and knew so much general knowledge with the benefit of a balanced education provided by the state. I see my nieces and nephews at Uni and there knowledge is limited, their ability to think clouded and judgement suspect. Give them a platform and they will start protesting without think of the ramifications or the rights of others to disagree. They need ‘safe corners’ to retreat to when upset.

It is a two-hour drive from the city of Antalya, along a coastal road in Turkey nestled between the sparkling blue of the Mediterranean and, in the distance, the imposing Taurus mountains. There, in the town of Demre – called Myra in antiquity – lived St Nicholas, celebrated by Christians as a gift-giver. In the sixth century, a church was built here in his name. Its austere interior is punctuated by exquisite frescoes, and twin marble pillars still stand where the altar once was, gleaming in the sunlight flooding through its windows. A statue of a bearded and hooded St Nicholas surrounded by children stands near the entrance of the monastery complex. But it is not what lies above the ground that has sparked renewed interest in the life of the saint whose generosity gave rise to Santa Claus. Since claims emerged of a newly discovered chamber beneath the church, an archaeological debate has raised questions on the ultimate resting place of his remains. Theologians say the most logical possibility is that his body was smuggled to Italy in the 11th century. But Turkish officials believe his remains may lie beneath the Byzantine church. “There is something under there and we don’t know what it is,” said Cemil Karabayram, the head of the monuments authority in Antalya. “St Nicholas lived and died here, and he might still be buried here.” Turkish archaeologists claim the remains that were smuggled out to Bari and Venice belonged to an anonymous priest, while the real body stayed behind in a hidden chamber. Antalya is Turkey’s most popular tourist destination, attracting more than 9.25 million people in 2017. Russian tourists, who made up nearly 15% of visitors this year, often visit the St Nicholas church, which was first restored by Tsar Nicholas I. Turkey is keen to promote further tourism to the area, particularly in off-season months. That vested interest has provoked doubt among those who say that the evidence the bones in Bari are authentic remains the strongest possibility. “I remain sceptical about the new claims to the real tomb,” said Adam C English, the chair of the department of Christian studies at Campbell University, and author of The Saint Who Would be Santa Claus: The True Life and Trials of Nicholas of Myra. “We have yet to see what will be found under the floor of the church, but they would need to find some kind of incontrovertible evidence to make a serious challenge to the established and well documented tradition.” That tradition is based on accounts of a raid by sailors from the city of Bari. According to Nicephorus, a man apparently commissioned by religious and city officials in Bari to write the first account of efforts to reclaim the body, the sailors removed his remains from the church after the pope, during a visit to the city, had a vision of St Nicholas asking to be moved from his resting place. Turkish officials support a rival claim that the monks tricked their captors into taking the body of another priest. “The priests that took over died and were buried here and there are many graves,” said Karabayram. “The original bones were protected, and the Bari ones belong to another priest.” English said that such a deception by the monks would not have remained secret for very long. “The tomb had been an international pilgrimage site for 700 years by the time the Barians arrived in 1087. The church had been built to house the tomb, so it would have been well marked and obvious to anyone visiting.“So, the monks deceived both the Barians and the Venetians, and everyone else? And if they did, why did they not announce later that they still had the bones and still welcomed pilgrims to see them? Or, why are there not substantial sources that give this other narrative?” The account that his remains were moved to Italy was strengthened by researchers at Oxford University who recently dated a bone fragment allegedly belonging to St Nicholas to the 4th century, around the time of his death. The mystery is not about to be settled soon. Turkish authorities do not want to damage the church or the mosaics on its floor. If approval is granted for a dig into the chamber, it will only take place in a garden outside by the courtyard, and may be years in the making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/15/french-school-bus-train-crash-death-toll-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T11:04:19Z","webTitle":"French school bus-train crash death toll rises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/french-school-bus-train-crash-death-toll-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/15/french-school-bus-train-crash-death-toll-rises","fields":{"headline":"French school bus-train crash death toll rises","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The death toll from a crash between a school bus and a train in southern France has risen to five after one passenger died of their injuries. Four teenagers died on Thursday in the crash at a level crossing in Millas, near the city of Perpignan. Eighteen others were injured, several of whom remain in hospital in with life-threatening injuries. Authorities in the Pyrenees-Orientales region had made a statement earlier on Friday saying six children had died, but later corrected it, saying the death toll was five. An inquiry into “manslaughter and accidental injury” has been opened by the local prosecutor Jean-Jacques Fagni, who promised families of the victims that investigators would establish the exact cause of the collision. The impact was so severe that it virtually ripped the bus in half and forced the train off the tracks. Police interviewed the express train driver on Friday morning but were unable to speak to the bus driver, a 48-year-old woman who is in hospital with serious injuries. The school bus was 12 miles (20km) west of Perpignan, in the Pyrénées-Orientales, heading towards Villefranche-de-Conflent when it was hit. It was carrying pupils from the Christian Bourquin secondary school who were heading home to two villages, Saint Féliu d’Amont and Saint Féliu d’Avall. The mayor of Saint Féliu d’Amont, Robert Olive, said the scene of the crash was a “horrific sight”. “I don’t know what happened, but the school bus had been actually cut in two by the passing train,” Olive told the local radio France Bleu Roussillon. “The bus appeared to have exploded. People were being very dignified but everyone was shocked.” The government announced it was sending a special representative to the area to help the victims’ families. The prime minister, Édouard Philippe, who met victims’ families in Perpignan, described the accident as a “terrible drama”. “The circumstances have not yet been determined and will be the subject of a legal inquiry to throw light on the circumstances of the drama.” He said the severity of the crash had made it difficult to identify some of the victims. President Emmanuel Macron expressed his condolences on Twitter. “My thoughts go out to the victims of this terrible accident involving a school bus and their families. The state is doing everything in its power to support the rescue operation.” The accident happened at an automatic crossing on a two-lane road as the bus crossed a single-track railway line secured by a simple striped barrier and warning lights in each direction. A spokeswoman for France’s national rail company, SNCF, said the train was travelling at 50mph at the time of the accident, and had 25 people on board. Three of them were slightly injured. “The railway crossing was a normal one, well equipped and lit up. Several witnesses have confirmed that the barriers were down, so they were working, but all this will be the subject of an inquiry,” she said. About 95 firefighters, 10 rescue vehicles and four helicopters as well as emergency medics attended the scene. Witnesses from the train told the local newspaper L’Indépendant they had felt a “very violent impact”. “We thought the train was going to come off the rails and turn over,” one passenger named Barbara told the newspaper. “Afterwards there were helicopters mobilised to take away the injured.” The incident is one of the worst in France involving a vehicle carrying children since 1982, when a holiday coach caught fire at Beaune, in central France, killing 53 people, including 44 children. In 2016, France recorded 111 collisions between trains and vehicles at railroad crossings, killing 31 people. About 90% of crashes involve cars or light vehicles, and in almost all cases the vehicle driver is found to have been responsible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/15/mike-pence-holy-land-visit-disarray-jerusalem-recognition","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T13:00:03Z","webTitle":"Mike Pence's Holy Land visit in disarray after Jerusalem recognition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/15/mike-pence-holy-land-visit-disarray-jerusalem-recognition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/15/mike-pence-holy-land-visit-disarray-jerusalem-recognition","fields":{"headline":"Mike Pence's Holy Land visit in disarray after Jerusalem recognition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The lights are already illuminated on Bethlehem’s huge Christmas tree in Manger Square. Nearby, at the narrow entrance to the Church of the Nativity, holiday pilgrims queue daily for their chance to descend into the cramped subterranean shrine said to be the birthplace of Jesus. One person, however, who will not be entering the church, barring a last-minute diplomatic miracle, is the US vice-president, Mike Pence. A proposed visit to Bethlehem and the Nativity church – now cancelled – had been intended as the highlight of a tour of the Middle East next week. That tour has been thrown into disarray by Donald Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and the consequent refusal of Palestinian and many Christian leaders to meet Pence. Part of the reason is that Pence – who stood next to Trump during his announcement – is seen by Palestinians as having been a key influence on Trump regarding the decision, and appears to have made little effort to repair the damage. At the time of writing, Palestinian officials insisted, there were no contacts with Washington regarding a visit to the city. The cancelled schedule for Pence’s trip to Bethlehem, described in detail to the Guardian, now stands as a cautionary metaphor for the diplomatic shambles unleashed by Trump’s announcement. Pence had hoped to draw attention to a key area of concern for the evangelicals who supported the Trump presidency – the plight of Christians in the Middle East. The draft schedule had envisaged that the vice-president – himself a committed evangelical – would arrive first in Bethlehem at the compound of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, either by helicopter or by car for an official reception. Then Pence would travel the few miles to the West Bank city’s historic Manger Square, from where Christmas festivities are broadcast live around the globe every year. It would have been closed to tourists during Pence’s visit, and he would have been greeted by the spiritual heads of the different Christian traditions that administer it as he made his own private tour. “There was a plan A and a plan B,” one source told the Guardian, “but what was being discussed was a visit to the church.” After Trump’s announcement, the official schedule for Pence’s visit to Egypt and the Holy Land now looks a decidedly one-sided affair. He will meet the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, but not the Coptic pope, who cancelled following the Jerusalem announcement. There are meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and president, Reuven Rivlin, but not with Abbas. Visits to the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem and to the Western Wall are planned, but no Christian sites are listed. Instead, say informed sources, some local Christian leaders have been invited to an official reception at the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, although as of Friday it was not clear if any would attend, amid pressure from Palestinian political leaders to maintain the boycott of Pence’s visit. First to cancel his invitation was Abbas. “There will be no meeting with the vice-president of America in Palestine,” Abbas’s diplomatic adviser Majdi al-Khaldi explained bluntly after Trump’s speech on 7 December. A day later Egypt’s Coptic church, whose adherents have been a frequent target of recent attacks by Egyptian Islamic militants, said it was “excusing itself from hosting” Pence. In Jerusalem itself, the guardian of the most sacred site in Christianity – the Church of the Holy Sepulchre – a Muslim functionary who holds the keys said he would refuse to meet Pence if he made an official visit. On Sunday, Christian Palestinians voiced their disapproval by protesting outside the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem after worship. Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy to Washington, said that when the trip was first announced in the autumn Palestinians were happy to welcome Pence and help arrange meetings with local Christians. “Then on Wednesday [6 December], Pence stands behind Trump as he announced Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and then he released statements saying this is not political, or legal or even security based, but this is biblical and this is about the word of God. If you believe you know [God’s] will then it shuts the discussion,” Zomlot said. Ironically, perhaps, Trump’s announcement – and Pence’s involvement – may have damaged the interests of evangelicals in the Holy Land. “One of the things on the agenda for Pence’s cancelled meeting with Abbas was formal recognition of the status of some evangelical churches. Abbas was happy to discuss it,” one official told the Guardian. “Now it is not going to happen.” On Sunday, the White House criticised the Palestinian leadership for their snub of the vice-president, accusing Palestinians of turning their backs on the possibility of dialogue. “It’s unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region, but the administration remains undeterred in its efforts to help achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians and our peace team remains hard at work putting together a plan,” a Pence spokesperson said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/24/francois-doumen-king-george-chase-kempton-park-bewildered-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T08:30:46Z","webTitle":"François Doumen gloomy over future of King George VI Chase at Kempton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/24/francois-doumen-king-george-chase-kempton-park-bewildered-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/24/francois-doumen-king-george-chase-kempton-park-bewildered-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"François Doumen gloomy over future of King George VI Chase at Kempton","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"How much poorer would be the recent history of British jump racing without the contribution of François Doumen, the effortlessly charming trainer who used to come over several times each winter and carry some of our best prizes back across La Manche. Had it not been for the particular qualities of Kempton Park, now under threat of development as it prepares to stage the latest running of the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day, he might never have had a runner in this country. Thirty years ago, Doumen was feeling a little frustrated about the prospect of having to keep his star steeplechaser, Nupsala, in his box through the winter months, when the ground at the main French jumps tracks was certain to be far too soggy for a horse who liked decent ground. But he had an enlightening conversation with the British trainer Oliver Sherwood, who had finally given up on trying to buy Nupsala. “I told him that, nine times out of 10, Kempton has pretty decent ground, unless it rains on the day,” Sherwood recalls. “It certainly doesn’t get heavy like Newbury or Chepstow.” “It was, I would say, good luck,” says Doumen, his effervescent good humour travelling easily down the phone from his home north-west of Paris. “I didn’t have a clue about racing in England at that stage. I told Oliver: ‘The problem in France is that, after October, Auteuil is such a bog that I don’t have anything to do with that horse.’ He said: ‘Why don’t you go to Kempton Park?’” Doumen ended up winning the King George five times in the next 13 years, matching what was then the trainer’s record for the race, set by the great Fulke Walwyn. He won other banner events at the free-draining, gravel‑based track, such as the Feltham, the Adonis, the Rendlesham and the Racing Post Chase. He won elsewhere in Britain and even bagged a Cheltenham Gold Cup but Kempton held its special place in his affections and he even named a dog after the Sunbury course. “Every time I see Oliver since then, I embrace him,” says Doumen, reflecting on what flowed from that one conversation. “I just don’t know what to do with him. That was lucky. If it had been raining, I would maybe never have been there, we would never have won the King George and I might never have gone back.” Doubtless there are trainers in Lambourn and the West Country who would have been perfectly delighted had Doumen never set foot in this country but racegoers in the 90s would have been much less entertained and a good few of them would have missed out on some major paydays from the likes of The Fellow, Algan, Val D’Alene and Baracouda. Doumen had a pretty big payday from Nupsala, thanks to an English‑based owner who owed him money. The Frenchman asked for the sum to be staked on his horse two days before the 1987 King George, when 50-1 was apparently available. “Believe me, I never dared to bring this money back to France because I was not such a successful trainer and I thought the tax people would get on me. So, as I was going to Miami [for another horse race], I had the money transferred to a bank in Miami like a bloody drug dealer. And I used that money for holidays only, for 10 years.” The great man, who announced his retirement in August, sounds baffled by the idea that the Jockey Club might be about to close Kempton and use it to build homes. “For English racing, I’m very, very surprised,” he says. “I suppose we have so many economic problems in France and I guess these things can happen in England as well. We already lost Enghien. And you never know, there are talks about some big tracks maybe going.” There is a sting in the tail for those who are determined to keep Kempton open because Doumen senses that the track’s popularity has been on the wane. “Last time I went, the atmosphere was not at all any more the same. All I knew was Kempton Park, the royal box and the Queen Mother and that enormous buzz that was there for Boxing Day, and the last time I went it was just so-so, it was not at all the same, they were not the same people running the place and I didn’t find it as exciting.” The Jockey Club made itself unpopular in January when announcing it would seek planning permission to build on the site. Sherwood calls it a “diabolical” idea and “a PR disaster” to close the track that hosted so many cherished Christmas victories achieved by Arkle, Desert Orchid, Kauto Star and others. Unsurprisingly, the Club now drops the deadest of bats on media inquiries, saying nothing has changed and that it has been “in listening mode” while awaiting the outcome of the planning process, which could drag on for years. All that listening does not seem to have led to a change of mind, however. Campaigners have been heartened by a recent review of the green belt, which concluded that Kempton fits all the relevant purposes of green belt land. “This is a new confirmation, they can’t say it’s out of date and our QC thinks the methodology is robust,” says Alan Doyle, the driving force behind Keep Kempton Green. “We’ve got a pretty good chance of stopping development. It’s 50-50, which means it’s all to play for. The arguments are all on our side. “We’re going to fight this and fight this as much as we can. The Jockey Club thought they’d be finished developing by now. This all started about four or five years ago. And we haven’t lost yet. But it’s going to be tough because they will also have some highly paid lawyers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/24/we-cannot-break-our-promise-to-take-in-child-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:05:36Z","webTitle":"We can’t break a promise to take in child refugees | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/24/we-cannot-break-our-promise-to-take-in-child-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/24/we-cannot-break-our-promise-to-take-in-child-refugees","fields":{"headline":"We can’t break a promise to take in child refugees","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Is the plight of lone child refugees yesterday’s news for this government? Is it hoping that the public will simply stop caring and the outrage, the headlines and the problem are just going to melt away? It appears that the Home Office isn’t filling the spaces reserved for unaccompanied child refugees under the Dubs scheme. This year, the places, which were expected to number around 3,000, were announced to be limited to 350. After a public outcry and intervention from the House of Lords, this was increased to 480. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, now says that the number of unaccompanied children arriving in the UK specifically under the Dubs scheme is “over 200”, which sounds carefully vague. (The government has been steadfastly unco-operative about committing to numbers.) Yvette Cooper, in the role of chair of the Commons home affairs committee, says that government promises are looking “hollow” regarding unaccompanied child refugees (who are at grave risk of trafficking and other exploitation) and that the Home Office response is “completely inadequate”. It also sounds chaotic, the mess further complicated by the government saying that there were already around 4,000 lone asylum-seeking children in care in the UK. This figure, if accurate, was brandished at Cooper and the committee as if it were someone else’s doing – that it somehow wasn’t the government’s fault that there was such widespread disorder. Similarly, when Cooper pointed out that 3,000 unaccompanied child refugee places could still be made available by local councils, should further central government funding become available, the response was that this wasn’t an actual target, just a figure relating to the maximum number of child refugees who could be helped. But, or so went the implication, they sure as hell wouldn’t be. Well, thanks for clearing that up. Merry Christmas! It bears repeating that the figure of 3,000 lone child refugees wasn’t plucked out of the “handwringing do-gooder” ether. It was part of the original campaign for the Dubs amendment – in that it was deemed fair and appropriate for Britain to help 3,000 of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied child refugees, in the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. (Of course, there are innumerable other child and adult refugees.) To give it some context, around 200,000 asylum seekers were accepted into the UK over a three-year period after the break-up of Yugoslavia. When the figure of 3,000 was so drastically reduced, there was widespread public disgust bordering on national shame. How could the UK restrict the Dubs scheme to helping such a small number of vulnerable, unprotected children? Let’s be clear, nobody, among campaigners or the public, said: “Let everybody in the world come here if they want to”; “Ignore British citizens in need – I prefer helping foreign people!”; “I insist that you let in grown men with beards, and wives, as ‘child refugees’ under the Dubs scheme.” Or write your own ludicrous rightwing smearing of “woolly liberals” that kicks off whenever helping refugees is on the agenda. Rather, there was a very specific reaction to the predicament of lone child refugees – kids who’d gone through so much and were at such high risk. This seems to be the very gut instinct that this government would prefer the British public to forget it ever had. Which makes it even more important for them to be held to account, not just by the Commons committee, but also by public vigilance. The government can’t make insincere “oh dear” noises about lone child refugees and then not even meet the puny total it permitted via the Dubs scheme. It should also respond to ongoing concern about all the other child refugees languishing in dangerous, unsuitable camps and shelters across Europe. As 2017 draws to a close, it would be nice to think that the lone child refugee crisis is top of the agenda for 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/24/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-aung-san-suu-kyi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:05:36Z","webTitle":"Parents demand Aung San Suu Kyi is cut from children’s book of role models","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/24/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-aung-san-suu-kyi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/24/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-aung-san-suu-kyi","fields":{"headline":"Parents demand Aung San Suu Kyi is cut from children’s book of role models","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is one of the most popular children’s books of 2017, a collection of stories about female role models from Amelia Earhart and Marie Curie to Hillary Clinton and Serena Williams, inspiring girls to aim high and challenge the status quo. But Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, likely to be in many Christmas stockings, has run into controversy because of one of the 100 women included in its pages. When the book was written last year, Aung San Suu Kyi was deemed a worthy subject: winner of the Nobel peace prize and epitome of courage in the face of oppression. But her fall from grace over her response to violence against Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims, described by the UN as possible genocide, has triggered calls for her to be taken out of future editions. In response, the authors, Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, are considering removing her from reprints. The book, aimed at children aged six and over, devotes two pages to each of its role models, including commissioned illustrations by female artists. It quotes Aung San Suu Kyi as saying: “Since we live in this world, we have to do our best for this world.” It charts her story from her protests against the junta through 21 years of house arrest to her release and leadership: “She won the Nobel peace prize, and inspired millions of people in her own country and across the world, all without leaving her house.” On the book’s Facebook page, Lenka Uzakova wrote: “As much as 99 per cent of book is inspiring, I found it absolutely disgusting that you have included someone suspected of genocide in the book. Aung San Suu Kyi has no place between those women. Someone who does nothing and perhaps is directly involved in massacres, rapes, burning of kids alive … I am speechless she is in the book.” Another parent, Gerri Peev, said: “I bought this book for my three-year-old daughter as an antidote to the tyranny of ‘pink princess publishing’. It is filled with inspiring female role models who don’t rely on a prince to sort their lives out. I was dismayed to see this page effectively canonising Aung San Suu Kyi. I hope the publishers issue another edition, updating her fall from grace over the Rohingya massacre.” Labour MP and shadow justice minister Yasmin Qureshi, who has raised concerns in parliament about the Rohingya crisis, said: “I often wonder how it can be possible to go from being one of the most admired and respected civil rights champions, a symbol of courage, patience and principle, to someone who shows such lack of compassion. “I have no doubt that history will remember her as the leader who watched on while mass killing, systematic rape and ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands who were forced to live in squalid refugee camps. I’d encourage the authors to consider that there is an entire generation of young Rohingya children who are stateless and hopeless, suffering a miserable existence. Aung San Suu Kyi’s refusal to condemn makes her complicit.” In a statement the authors said: “We’re monitoring the situation closely and we don’t exclude the idea of removing her from future reprints.” Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls was first published in the US and is described as the “most-funded original book in the history of crowdfunding”. It is published in the UK by Particular Books, part of Penguin Random House. Last week Blackwell’s named it as its book of the year, beating among others Arundhati Roy’s The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has won more than 120 international honours, including the Nobel prize, was last week stripped of her Freedom of the City of Dublin award and earlier lost her Freedom of Oxford accolade. The Dublin decision came after musician and activist Bob Geldof returned his own Freedom of the City in protest. St Hugh’s College Oxford, where Aung San Suu Kyi studied, has taken down her portrait. It is estimated that 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have been forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh since the crackdown by Myanmar’s security forces began. Last week the aid charity Médecins Sans Frontières reported that at least 6,700 Rohingya, including hundreds of children, were killed in the first month of the crackdown. Criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi’s response intensified last week when it emerged that two Reuters journalists have been detained and face 14 years in jail for reporting on the crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/23/two-heterosexual-irish-men-marry-to-avoid-inheritance-tax-on-house","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T10:03:42Z","webTitle":"Two heterosexual Irish men marry to avoid inheritance tax on property","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/23/two-heterosexual-irish-men-marry-to-avoid-inheritance-tax-on-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/23/two-heterosexual-irish-men-marry-to-avoid-inheritance-tax-on-house","fields":{"headline":"Two heterosexual Irish men marry to avoid inheritance tax on property","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two Irish men have married in Dublin to avoid paying €50,000 in inheritance tax on a house. Best friends Matt Murphy and Michael O’Sullivan are both heterosexual, but decided to get married when they discovered how much tax would have to be paid on the house Murphy, 83, intended to leave in his will to O’Sullivan, 58, who is his carer. Same-sex marriage was legalised in Ireland following a referendum in May 2015. “I’ve known Matty for 30 years. We became very friendly after my second relationship broke up,” O’Sullivan, a father of three, told the Irish Mirror. “I have been bringing Matt out in my car to various parties and all that kind of thing. He became friends with all my friends, they all loved him.” Each man went through some tough times, with O’Sullivan becoming homeless and Murphy suffering from giant cell arteritis, which affects the optic nerve. “I stayed over with him for a while and eventually Matt said ‘Why don’t you come and stay here?’ I would go over and stay with him the odd time but never full time.” Murphy could not afford to pay O’Sullivan as a carer. “Eventually Matt said the only way he could pay me was to leave me the house. He said he would give me the house so I have somewhere to live when he goes.” However, O’Sullivan knew that would mean a huge tax bill and the house would have to be sold to pay it. He said Murphy “was chatting a friend down the country in Cashel, Co Tipperary, and she jokingly said we should get married. “Then one night he turned around and said it to me and I said I would marry him.” O’Sullivan paid tribute to Ireland’s LGBT community. “The equality gay and lesbian people did for this country, that they fought hard for, they were discriminated against for most of their lives, they got equality for themselves but also for everybody else.” The couple got married in a former hospital on Dublin’s Grand Canal Street, followed by a meal for five at the nearby Gasworks bar. O’Sullivan was previously married to a woman. It is Murphy’s first marriage. During the wedding ceremony O’Sullivan spoke of his husband’s great kindness, the Irish Times reported, while Murphy sang Willie Nelson’s Let the Rest of the World Go By: “With someone like you, a pal good and true / I’d like to leave it all behind and go and find / A place that’s known to God alone.” O’Sullivan said after the ceremony: “I love Matt and he loves me, as friends.” • This article was amended on 28 December 2017 to correct the title of the song “Let the Rest of the World Go By”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/dec/23/arsene-wenger-ainsley-maitland-niles-arsenal-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger gets away with gamble on Ainsley Maitland-Niles | Nick Ames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/23/arsene-wenger-ainsley-maitland-niles-arsenal-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/dec/23/arsene-wenger-ainsley-maitland-niles-arsenal-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger gets away with gamble on Ainsley Maitland-Niles","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Perhaps, in the kind of skewed reading that meetings between Arsenal and Liverpool have come to invite, this fixture was the perfect laboratory for a young full-back making his way. By the time Ainsley Maitland-Niles, 20 years old and making his third Premier League start, left the field he could at least assure himself that nobody would have noticed any ragged edges very much. He and his colleagues had been powerless to prevent Roberto Firmino’s equaliser, but the fact that it was the 45th goal in the last 10 meetings between these old rivals spoke more loudly. They have contrived an environment in which anything goes; this, on a wild night that lacked only one final late twist, was a perfect time to be tested in the deep end with scant risk of flailing more than anyone else. Arsenal had lost their three previous encounters with Jürgen Klopp’s side, all of direct consequence to top-four races this season and last, by an aggregate of 11-4. The sense of jeopardy was heightened before kick-off through Arsène Wenger’s persistence with Maitland-Niles, a converted midfielder whose steady displays against West Ham United and Newcastle did not necessarily inform what might pass here. Maitland-Niles’s task was, at least, spelled out in bold: go head-to-head with Mohamed Salah, a man who – depending on which reviews you read – was in form redolent of Luis Suárez or even Cristiano Ronaldo. Maitland-Niles could not keep Salah quiet; on the Egyptian’s current form, barely anyone could. There were moments to cling on to, though: a sharp recovery and dispossession early on when Salah appeared to have rounded him in the way that so embarrassed Bournemouth’s Charlie Daniels last Sunday; a hearty thud of the ball against his opponent’s shins and out for a goal kick as he marauded in search of one last plot twist. The sense persisted, though, that he was a hostage to forces beyond him. Maitland-Niles could not be blamed for Liverpool’s opening goal, when Arsenal lost possession during a rare attack and James Milner’s pass into the space behind him allowed Salah a run at Laurent Koscielny; his role in the second, losing the ball near his opponents’ corner flag, was clearer but even then Arsenal should have been in better shape to prevent it travelling 100 yards into their net. For 53 minutes they were so uncertain, timid, caught between poles – seemingly obsessed with preventing the counter-counter and radiating discomfort whether in or out of possession. At that stage the Emirates Stadium crowd, whose growls had grown with every incisive Liverpool break, every move between their front four that bursted with invention and information, would have taken any kind of lift. Thoughts drifted to Sead Kolasinac, who had been deposed again by Maitland-Niles; in a performance so shy of character and personality, would a rumbustious surge up the left tramline, the kind of move the “Tank” showed to be his speciality during the season’s early weeks, have provided exactly the kind of morsel Arsenal might seize on? In the event it was a moment of inattention from Joe Gomez, with a far starker example of what happens when a full-back switches off, that gave Arsenal their way in. Simon Mignolet’s flap from Granit Xhaka and Mesut Özil’s clipped finish turned everything around within five minutes and, at that moment, Wenger’s latest experimentation appeared – whether by accident or design – to have paid off. Firmino’s goal, looping in off Petr Cech and partially digging Liverpool out of a situation they should never have found themselves in, made sure nobody watching could get carried away. Those on the pitch continued to: the match retained its basketball-like elasticity until the death, Maitland-Niles eventually walking off inscrutably, perhaps quietly satisfied or perhaps a little punch-drunk. It had been a hiding to nothing and, if we put Liverpool’s implosion to one side, left Wenger’s judgment open to question. “His pace against Salah, who is quick and moves a lot,” was the reason the manager gave for his selection; that hardly needed explaining but no amount of speed could mitigate for the lack of protection from his team-mates, which was in evidence twice during the first half when he was left two-on-one for successive back-post headers from Firmino. The frenzied, midfield-less nature of proceedings meant this could never be the time to pass one-off judgment – not on Maitland-Niles, not even on the careless Gomez. Perhaps Wenger does know what he is doing with Maitland-Niles, who he toughened up with a loan to Ipswich – and Mick McCarthy’s school of hard knocks – in 2015-16 and has since sought to make the latest remodelled full-back in a long, generally illustrious line. On a night like this, though, you would be forgiven for thinking the entire concept of defence had gone out of fashion forever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/24/medieval-panel-paintings-beetles-bats-infestations-east-anglia","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:05:36Z","webTitle":"Beetles and bats threaten treasures of the medieval parish churches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/24/medieval-panel-paintings-beetles-bats-infestations-east-anglia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/24/medieval-panel-paintings-beetles-bats-infestations-east-anglia","fields":{"headline":"Beetles and bats threaten treasures of the medieval parish churches","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"They have survived the religious purges of the Reformation, the sectarian violence of the English civil wars, even the widespread whitewashing of church walls in the 19th century. But now hundreds of priceless medieval panel paintings in churches across East Anglia – depicting gruesome scenes from hell, biblical figures, English monarchs and angels and apostles – face a new and potentially deadly threat: deathwatch beetles. Infestations of insects and bats are among the problems increasingly bedevilling Britain’s ancient, leaky churches which are struggling to pay for repairs as congregations and income dwindle. Deathwatch beetles are boring through wood, creating holes twice the size of those made by woodworm; bats are urinating over paintings, causing white spotting and chemically altering the paint; while moisture and fluctuations in humidity are also causing paint to flake. Various bodies, including the Hamilton Kerr Institute at Cambridge University and the Church Buildings Council, are involved with a major project to save these treasures. They have submitted a bid for about £1m to the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council, warning of the need to investigate, safeguard and record these treasures “before they are lost due to theft, neglect or lack of awareness”. A decision is expected shortly. Their submitted bid notes: “East Anglia is extremely rich in late-medieval painted wooden church screens. Examples are found in more than 40% of the medieval churches, putting the lie to the received wisdom that all pre-Reformation art was violently smashed.” Most are rood screens. Sited between the nave and chancel and formerly topped by a crucifix (rood), more than 500 examples survive – many stripped of their paint – within the historical dioceses of Norwich and Ely, “in higher density than anywhere else”. Around 200 of 350 medieval paintings in Britain are in East Anglia. The report notes: “These objects are extremely vulnerable… Screens are threatened by humidity, temperature, light and degradation from pests. Without a conservation strategy, they will be lost for ever.” Dr Lucy Wrapson, a Hamilton Kerr senior conservator, said “there’s really no question” that paintings will be lost: “You lose paint over time, and once you lose it, it’s irreplaceable. It’s a slow drip, drip, drip. Unless you’re able to keep the building intact and drain the rainwater, they can be terribly vulnerable to damp and environmental problems.” While there are “very good” examples of medieval paintings in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, that there’s nothing comparable to East Anglia’s collection, Wrapson said: “Barton Turf and Ranworth are among the most exquisite screens in Norfolk, and Bramfield in Suffolk is also a gem. They are all beautifully painted in bright oil colours using pigments such as vermillion. The lower parts of these screens have the painted figures of saints and angels along the dado.” At Ranworth, images include dramatic figures of St Michael and St George slaying their respective dragons. At Barton Turf, they feature St Apollonia, patron saint of dentistry, holding a tooth in her pincers. Astonishingly, despite their importance, these paintings have yet to be studied properly in their entirety. Wrapson and Paul Binski, professor of medieval art history at Cambridge University, are planning the first corpus of British medieval panel painting. Wrapson said: “Nobody realises how much of this stuff there is out there. It’s not collated in one place, so a lot of scholarship doesn’t happen. We really want to know what’s there.” She has, for example, discovered a portrait of Henry VII on the North Tuddenham rood screen. St Sebastian has been given the “pinched face” features of the king, who was on the throne at the time of its making. The project involves Tobit Curteis, a leading architectural conservator, who said: “There are some stunners out there. You walk into these little isolated churches and there is this absolutely remarkable painting sitting there... We have this fantastically important collection of artefacts and the wider public doesn’t know they are out there. These paintings of angels, saints, dragons would have been an absolutely core part of the colour, mystery and magic of the medieval church. They’re sitting in these churches, often with a congregation of a dozen. They are incredibly sensitive and vulnerable, the sort of paintings that would normally be hanging in museums. Yet here they are, in some of our oldest and most difficult to look after churches. They are desperately in need of care and conservation. Otherwise they will deteriorate and disappear, which would be a complete tragedy.” Part of the project is to make people more aware of their significance. Wrapson despairs at past decisions to hammer nails into screens, poke wires through them and even spray silver paint over Christmas decorations draped on them. Asked why the paintings are now at risk, Curteis said: “With the declining church population, it is harder to raise money to look after these buildings.” Beyond leaking roofs and water coming up through the walls, he said that deathwatch beetles tend to colonise moist wood: “They eat their way through the structure when they’re hatching. In some cases, they eat so much it becomes structurally unstable and it collapses. When you see a panel which has been attacked by deathwatch beetle, it’s peppered with holes like a shotgun blast. If you can control the moisture in the timber, the beetles choose not to live there. “Bats urinate and defecate as they fly. The material they produce is extremely caustic. It burns into the paint layer.” Attempts are being made to combat bats with measures like false ceilings. He added that these paintings have survived 500-600 years: “If they deteriorate over 25 years, that is phenomenally fast... Will we lose some of these artworks before our grandchildren are around to see them? Yes. There is an opportunity now to take action – but that takes a lot of time and effort.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/24/leigh-fermor-greece-british-musuem-art","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:05:36Z","webTitle":"How an idyllic Greek hideaway inspired a British war hero and travel writer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/24/leigh-fermor-greece-british-musuem-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/24/leigh-fermor-greece-british-musuem-art","fields":{"headline":"How an idyllic Greek hideaway inspired a British war hero and travel writer","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Oh, to have been a fly on the bougainvillea-clad wall as the drinks flowed and the sun sank behind the beautiful house tucked away in a remote part of Greece. One night a visitor might find Stephen Spender or Louis MacNeice. Another, Lawrence Durrell and John Betjeman. But always holding court, cigarette in hand, ouzo glass raised, would be Sir Patrick “Paddy” Leigh Fermor, the war hero and travel writer often said to be the inspiration for his friend Ian Fleming’s most famous creation, James Bond. In the late 1950s, the house Leigh Fermor built with his wife Joan in Kardamyli, a seaside village located in the Mani peninsula, in the southern Peloponnese, became a haven for writers and artists drawn to its owner’s extraordinary charisma and the wild, arid beauty of the surrounding landscape. It was here that Leigh Fermor, who died in 2011 aged 96, built his close friendship with two men – the Greek artist Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghika, who lived on Hydra before moving to Corfu, and the British painter, John Craxton, who lived for a time on Crete. Now the remarkable friendship is to be explored in a new exhibition at the British Museum that will open next spring. Charmed Lives examines the influence that post-war Greece had on the three men and brings together in the UK for the first time their artworks, photographs, letters and personal possessions. Among the items on display will be Leigh Fermor’s typewriter (which he never managed to master), his binoculars and a Leica camera belonging to Joan, a professional photographer. Striking paintings of Greek landscapes and local people by both Craxton and Ghika will feature alongside extracts from Leigh Fermor’s many books. Sir Michael Llewellyn-Smith, a former British ambassador to Athens, who knew all three men and is one of the exhibition’s curators, conceded many would be drawn by the cult of Leigh Fermor, a polyglot and autodidact once described as “a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond and Graham Greene.” “There’s a tremendous fashion for him,” Llewellyn-Smith said. “In a way you’d expect it to diminish over time but the opposite is happening and it’s very difficult to explain. I don’t think it’s fully related to his work. It is for some people but there are others who are attracted by the legend.” Much of Leigh Fermor’s legend is burnished by his epic walk from the Hook of Holland to Istanbul, made as an 18-year-old, and his heroics during the second world war when, leading a group of Cretan resistance fighters, he captured the German commander General Heinrich Kreipe in one of the most audacious acts in the history of the Special Operations Executive. While his postwar books such as A Time Of Gifts cemented his legend and led to Leigh Fermor being regarded as one of the great travel writers, it transpires that the real-life 007 also dabbled as an artist and several of his works will be on display in the exhibition. These include six portraits of Cretan resistance fighters painted in 1942. They are the only ones out of around 20 similar paintings to have survived. The majority were destroyed as the Germans advanced. “Paddy had an extremely acute visual sense and was himself an artist, an amateur,” Llewellyn-Smith said. “When he was walking across Europe, when he was 18 to 20 years old, around Vienna he had virtually no money and so he started drawing portraits of people to get enough to get a crust of bread or more.” Llewellyn-Smith said the fact that all three men had died only relatively recently –Ghika in 1994, Craxton in 2009 – meant there was much to be gained by producing an exhibition of their lives and friendship now. “A lot of people who knew them are still around, and therefore for those organising the exhibition, such as myself, it was possible to talk to them and get their memories and anecdotes. This couldn’t have been done if the exhibition had been delayed by many years.” The organisers say they hope it will offer visitors an opportunity to reflect on Greece’s enduring role as a source of artistic inspiration. It may also offer a subtle reminder that British-Hellenic relations can be about more than that most famous of British Museum attractions, the Parthenon marbles. “This period when these three men got to know each other was a period of artistic and literary collaboration, almost a renaissance between British and Greek artists and writers,” Llewellyn-Smith said. “It didn’t have anything to do with politics and returning sculptures to Greece. That’s a different century.” It may also offer clues as to why, despite smoking around 80 cigarettes a day, just like Fleming’s Bond, Leigh Fermor managed to live so long. “When he was in the Peloponnese he would go for walks every day in the mountains behind the house and he’d swim for half an hour every morning,” Llewellyn-Smith said. In his will, Leigh Fermor gave the house to the Benaki museum in Athens with instructions for it to be turned into a writers’ retreat. While some of Leigh Fermor’s devoted fanbase have grumbled about the pace of its renovation – which at one stage appeared to have fallen victim to Greece’s economic woes, – there are hopes the exhibition may elicit funds to speed things up. If so, it would mean that more than half a century on from when Leigh Fermor built his idyll, it will once again help nurture a new generation of artists and writers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/last-minute-christmas-shopping-click-and-collect-on-christmas-day","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:05:36Z","webTitle":"Festive preparations on the edge as overworked families make last-minute dash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/last-minute-christmas-shopping-click-and-collect-on-christmas-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/last-minute-christmas-shopping-click-and-collect-on-christmas-day","fields":{"headline":"Festive preparations on the edge as overworked families make last-minute dash","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Hundreds of harassed parents are pushing their shopping opportunity to the limit by picking up online orders on Christmas Day as families prepare for one of the most last-minute festive seasons ever. With the big day falling on a Monday this year, many left their festive preparations later than ever, waiting to pick up food and gifts until after finishing their working week. After a tough run-up to Christmas for high street retailers, corner shops are expecting a sales bonanza on Christmas Eve as their ability to stay open longer on a Sunday gives them an edge over supermarkets and other large stores limited by legal trading limits. The Co-op is predicting a 41% sales uplift and will have 2,000 stores open until 9pm on Christmas Eve or later to cope with increased demand. Chris Whitfield, Co-op’s director of retail and logistics, said he thought Christmas Eve this year could be a record-breaking day for the chain as he predicted milk, mince pies, prosecco, ice cubes and carrots would be the most sought-after items. “Christmas Eve is typically our busiest sales day of the year but this year small stores will have an added advantage because of longer Sunday trading hours. “Some shoppers will be caught unawares that larger stores will close early,” Whitfield said. Small shops that remain open on Christmas Day will now be able to offer not only basics such as milk but also a last chance to slip presents under the tree. Last year CollectPlus, which works with a network of 7,000 stores that act as pick-up and drop-off points for online orders from the likes of John Lewis, House of Fraser, Asos and Office, said almost 500 people picked up parcels on Christmas Day. “We expect to see hundreds of Brits picking up their online shopping on Christmas Day again this year,” said Neil Ashworth, chief executive of CollectPlus. He added that last year more than 130,000 people collected parcels from CollectPlus stores in the three days leading up to Christmas, including over 35,600 people who picked up parcels on Christmas Eve. “Click-and-collect on Christmas Day doesn’t surprise me at all. It’s a potential marriage saver,” said Andrew Starkey, head of e-logistics at online retail trade body IMRG. Improved delivery options are partly driving the change in behaviour. Argos boasts that shoppers can order up until 1pm on Christmas Eve for same-day delivery. Starkey said more retailers were able to offer last-minute deliveries because they are storing stock in smaller local warehouses and because capacity in their distribution network had been freed up because more shopping had been brought forward into November by Black Friday. “As you get nearer to Christmas the volume has already gone through the system,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/24/queens-christmas-message-article-of-christian-faith","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T09:59:47Z","webTitle":"How the Queen  – the ‘last Christian monarch’ – has made faith her message","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/24/queens-christmas-message-article-of-christian-faith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/24/queens-christmas-message-article-of-christian-faith","fields":{"headline":"How the Queen  – the ‘last Christian monarch’ – has made faith her message","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"To the royal household, it is known as the QXB – the Queen’s Christmas broadcast. To millions of people, it is still an essential feature of Christmas Day. To the Queen, her annual broadcast is the time when she speaks to the nation without the government scripting it. But in recent years, it has also become something else: a declaration of her Christian faith. As Britain has become more secular, the Queen’s messages have followed the opposite trajectory. A survey of the broadcasts made during her 65-year reign reveals that for most of the time the Queen has spoken only in passing of the religious significance of Christmas. There have been references to presents linking contemporary Christmas to the three wise men, for instance, alongside trips to Commonwealth countries, family events such as weddings and funerals, and there were observations about contemporary society. In 1966, for example, she spoke of the progress of women, and in 1972, she commented on Britain joining the European Community in language that would make any Remainer proud. But for the past 17 years, her messages have taken on a different tone, with the Queen explaining her own personal faith – “the anchor in my life”, as she described it in 2014. Last year she said: “Billions of people now follow Christ’s teaching and find in him the guiding light for their lives. I am one of them because Christ’s example helps me see the value of doing small things with great love, whoever does them and whatever they themselves believe.” The turning point in the content of the broadcasts was the millennium. Her broadcast in 2000 was devoted to an account of Christ’s life and teaching which, she said, “provide a framework in which I try to lead my life”. This personal commentary has continued ever since. According to Ian Bradley, professor of cultural and spiritual history at the University of St Andrews and the author of God Save the Queen – The Spiritual Heart of the Monarchy, “this truly makes her Defender of the Faith” – a reference to the title that all monarchs have used since it was first bestowed on Henry VIII in 1521 by Pope Leo X before he broke with Rome. Indeed, Elizabeth II’s faith impresses the papacy today, so much that one senior Vatican official described her to me as “the last Christian monarch”. Explanations for these overtly Christian messages vary. Some royal watchers suggest that it was the Queen’s decision to use the 2,000th anniversary of Christ’s birth as an opportunity to speak openly about Christianity. Others saw the hand of George Carey, then archbishop of Canterbury. Bradley sees the influence of Prince Philip at work. “After her very personal account in 2000, she was encouraged to continue because I’m told she received 25 times more letters than usual from the public in response to that Christmas message than others, and she had huge support from the Duke of Edinburgh.” But Stephen Bates, a former royal correspondent and author of Royalty Inc: Britain’s Best-Known Brand, believes it was the death of the Queen Mother that changed her. “She loosened up after her mother’s death. The Queen Mother kept a beady eye on her and now she is more relaxed,” he said. “She expresses more of what she feels. I think this openness about her own commitment is part of it as well.” Before 2000, the Queen’s most explicit commitments of faith were made during a 1947 radio broadcast, when she spoke of dedicating her life to service, and ended it by saying, “God help me to make good my vow” and at her coronation service. Accession to the throne also meant she became supreme governor of the Church of England, the established church, and since then her public life has been inextricably shaped by religious occasions: being seen by TV audiences at church at Christmas and Easter, distributing Maundy money on Maundy Thursday and attending the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. But it is the Christmas broadcast where the personal, as well as public, is evident. No government official is involved. Instead, those who cast an eye in advance over what she has written will be her private secretary, now Edward Young, as well as the Duke of Edinburgh. Lord Chartres, the recently retired bishop of London, has long been the go-to theological adviser to the royal family and is believed to proffer advice as well. Regular themes include forgiveness, reconciliation, compassion and, most often, service. Lord Williams of Oystermouth, who, as Dr Rowan Williams, served as archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, said that at times Lambeth Palace was consulted. “We were occasionally asked for any thoughts we might want to throw in.” Last week, the BBC admitted that it has been reflecting a secular version of Britain and needs to do more to hold up a mirror to faith in Britain. According to Williams, the Queen has been bridging the divide. “I think that as there has been less overt Christian ‘messaging’ in the general cultural environment, the Queen has deliberately decided to fill the gap,” he said. The recent messages always refer to Britons of other faiths, too. Williams also sees a link between the recent Christmas messages and a landmark speech the Queen made in 2012 at Lambeth Palace at the start of her diamond jubilee year, when she described the Church of England as, in effect, an umbrella under which other faiths could shelter. “I think it is related to her position as supreme governor and in line with her speech at Lambeth in 2012 about the Church of England’s responsibility to be a positive gatekeeper for faith at large in the nation, without sacrificing its particularity,” he said. The tradition of the royal Christmas message was begun in 1932 by the Queen’s grandfather, George V, and continued under her father, George VI. “George V wasn’t particularly devout but the Queen’s father was,” said Bradley. They began as radio broadcasts but became televised in 1957 and have been recorded at Buckingham Palace – once, famously, by David Attenborough in 1986 in a stable at the Royal Mews –Windsor Castle and Sandringham in Norfolk. With the Queen now 91, thoughts turn to the succession. The Prince of Wales has become more public in confessing his own faith in recent years. Last week, at a service for persecuted Syrian Christians, he said: “We must do what we can to support our fellow Christians.” It looks likely, then, that as king he will follow his mother and make his Christmas message a personal credo. THE CHANGING MESSAGE 1952 ‘Let us set out to build a truer knowledge of ourselves and our fellowmen, to work for tolerance and understanding among the nations and to use the tremendous forces of science and learning for the betterment of man’s lot upon this earth.’ 1966 ‘In the modern world the opportunities for women to give something of value to the human family are greater than ever, because, through their own efforts, they are now beginning to play their full part in public life.’ 1972 ‘Britain and these other European countries see in the Community a new opportunity for the future. They believe that the things they have in common are more important than the things which divide them, and that if they work together not only they, but the whole world will benefit. We are trying to create a wider family of nations and it is particularly at Christmas that this family should feel closest together.’ 2000 ‘To many of us our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ’s words and example.’ 2013 ‘For Christians, as for all people of faith, reflection, meditation and prayer help us to renew ourselves in God’s love, as we strive daily to become better people. The Christmas message shows us that this love is for everyone. There is no one beyond its reach.’ 2014 ‘For me, the life of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, whose birth we celebrate today, is an inspiration and an anchor in my life. A role model of reconciliation and forgiveness, he stretched out his hands in love, acceptance and healing. Christ’s example has taught me to seek to respect and value all people, of whatever faith or none.’ 2016 ‘Billions of people now follow Christ’s teaching and find in him the guiding light for their lives. I am one of them because Christ’s example helps me see the value of doing small things with great love, whoever does them and whatever they themselves believe.’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/22/princess-michael-apologises-wearing-racist-jewellery-meghan-markle-christmas-lunch","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T09:54:34Z","webTitle":"Princess Michael of Kent apologises for 'racist jewellery' worn at lunch with Meghan Markle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/princess-michael-apologises-wearing-racist-jewellery-meghan-markle-christmas-lunch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/princess-michael-apologises-wearing-racist-jewellery-meghan-markle-christmas-lunch","fields":{"headline":"Princess Michael of Kent apologises for 'racist jewellery' worn at lunch with Meghan Markle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Princess Michael of Kent has apologised after wearing a blackamoor brooch to the Queen’s Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace, attended by Prince Harry’s fiancee Meghan Markle, who is of mixed race by virtue of her white father and African American mother. The royal, who is married to the Queen’s cousin, was photographed wearing the brooch depicting a black figure on her coat as she arrived for the annual gathering on Wednesday. She was later criticised online for wearing “racist jewellery”. Markle is understood to have met Princess Michael of Kent at the lunch, but it is not known if she was wearing the brooch at the time. A spokesman for the princess said: “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offence.” It is not the first time the princess has been accused of racism. In 2004, she reportedly instructed African American customers in a New York restaurant to “go back to the colonies” in an argument about noise. The princess, whose father was an SS officer, denied the incident a few months later in an interview with ITV, saying: “I even pretended years ago to be an African, a half-caste African, but because of my light eyes I did not get away with it, but I dyed my hair black. “I had this adventure with these absolutely adorable, special people and to call me racist: it’s a knife through the heart because I really love these people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/05/brazil-political-scandal-nelson-nahim-sexual-exploitation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T19:24:42Z","webTitle":"Brazil seethes as man jailed for sexual abuse of teenager joins congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/brazil-political-scandal-nelson-nahim-sexual-exploitation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/05/brazil-political-scandal-nelson-nahim-sexual-exploitation","fields":{"headline":"Brazil seethes as man jailed for sexual abuse of teenager joins congress","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Just when it seemed that Brazil’s scandal-plagued political class could not be any less popular, the country is incensed at the revelation that its congress will soon include a man jailed for the sexual exploitation of underage girls. Nelson Nahim, a politician from Rio de Janeiro state who is affiliated with President Michel Temer’s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was handed a 12-year sentence in 2016 for submitting a 15-year-old girl to prostitution/sexual exploitation, rape and intimidating behaviour. As a “substitute” lawmaker for a coalition of parties, he will take the seat vacated by Brazil’s new minister of labour, Cristiane Brasil, when congress returns from recess next month, but he officially becomes a deputy when she takes up her new role next week. Adding fuel to the fire, Brasil herself was in 2016 ordered to make payments to a former driver whom she had employed without proper papers. Brasil is also the daughter of a politician jailed in a previous scandal. “It provokes nausea and vomit,” José de Lima, a retired Brazilian living in Florianópolis in the south of the country, wrote on a Facebook group page. “The current Brazilian congress will always be capable of getting worse.” Documents submitted to court described Nahim, 60, as a regular client of a prostitution ring in the Rio town of Campos dos Goytacazes between 2008 and 2009, in which underage girls were kept behind bars and forced to consume drugs in order to have sex with clients. According to prosecutors, Nahim had sex with two 15-year-old girls at a country house he owned. He denies the allegations. “There was a chain of sexual exploitation in Campos,” said Ludimila Rodrigues, one of a group of prosecutors who worked on the court case. “He was one of the clients of this network of prostitution.” In 2016, Judge Daniela de Souza sentenced 12 of those involved to prison and two to open prison regimes. Nahim was handed 12 years but served four months before being released on appeal by a supreme court judge. In a statement at the time, the court in Rio that sentenced Nahim highlighted his “relationship with a 15-year-old teenager known as ‘Barbie Girl’, with whom he had sexual encounters,” adding: “The teenager enjoyed differential treatment for being Nahim’s favourite.” Nahim, who also sat briefly in congress as substitute for another lawmaker a year ago, said in a Facebook post that he would prove his innocence. “I thank God and on assuming the mandate of a federal deputy I will fight for the population and show my innocence with documents,” he wrote. Brazilian lawmakers are no strangers to controversy and have faced charges ranging from corruption to murder. One lawmaker, Celso Jacob, last year attended Congress on day release from prison, where he is serving a sentence for administrative fraud when he was a mayor. Nahim is estranged from his brother, the former Rio state governor Anthony Garotinho, who was jailed with his wife, Rosinha, in November for electoral crimes, and briefly replaced Garotinho’s wife as mayor of Campos. The couple were later released. Cristiane Brasil’s father, Roberto Jefferson, was also jailed for his role in the “Mensalão” vote-buying scandal, which almost brought down the leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2005. Jefferson cried on discussing her appointment with reporters and said it had “rescued the family”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/23/talking-horses-the-worlds-end-long-walk-hurdle-ascot","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T00:47:00Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: The World’s End could take on favourite Unowhatimeanharry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/23/talking-horses-the-worlds-end-long-walk-hurdle-ascot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/23/talking-horses-the-worlds-end-long-walk-hurdle-ascot","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: The World’s End could take on favourite Unowhatimeanharry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Today’s ITV4 races Familiarity, as well as talent, has quite a bit to do with which horses end up at the top of the market in high-profile jumps races and so of course Unowhatimeanharry is favourite for the Long Walk Hurdle, Ascot’s centrepiece contest today. But it may be worth taking him on at 12-1 with a promising young talent in The Worlds End (2.25). Some will look at his effort at Haydock last month, when he was beaten 33 lengths into eighth on his first step outside novice company, and put a line through him. He certainly needs to do an awful lot better if he’s to take a hand in this Grade One. But he had excuses that day, starting with the extraordinarily testing surface. He did easily the best of the four who carried more than 11 stone in that handicap, fading from two out when the lack of a previous run may have been a factor. His seasonal reappearance in 2016 was the only other time when he has completed a hurdle race and been beaten. He was still in contention when falling two out in the Albert Bartlett and battled well to win the equivalent race at Aintree in April. With some doubts about the leading contenders, I’m happy to take a chance on him here. It may be our last chance to get double-figure odds about him for some time. Unowhatimeanharry ran well enough in defeat at Newbury last time but he clearly has his limitations and is a short price in view of the weak recent form of his stable. Lil Rockerfeller has a modest strike-rate, while L’Ami Serge is a tricky customer. 1.50 Ascot Having taken time to warm up after leaving his native France, Casse Tete stormed home at Sandown in March and will be hard to catch if resuming in similar form. He comes from the Gary Moore yard that now seems to be hitting its stride. 2.10 Haydock There was a lot to like about the course and distance success of Limited Reserve last month and he is surely one to stick with on an 8lb higher mark. The form of his earlier Ascot second could hardly have worked out better. 2.25 Ascot A real eyecatcher on both his starts this season, On Tour should go close here. He made up a lot of ground to win tidily on his reappearance at Aintree and was then going well when unseating four-out at Newbury in the race won by the very useful Gold Present. He gets to run here off the same mark. 2.45 Haydock From a handicapping perspective, Full Irish rather gave the game away with his Lingfield success last time. Still, few of these rivals offer much threat and he should be able to follow up. 3.35 Ascot This could work out well for a strong-travelling sort like Charli Parcs and he deserves his place at the head of the betting. Well thought-of at Nicky Henderson’s yard, he ran to a high level when second to High Bridge at Newbury, giving that rival half a stone. Bleu Et Rouge is respected as a Grade One winner last year who still looks on a fair mark.

Juan Ángel Napout, the former president of South American football’s governing body (Conmebol) and José Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil’s football federation were both found guilty of racketeering and wire fraud conspiracies following a five-week trial in New York City. A verdict on their co-defendant, Manuel Burga, the former head of football in Peru, is pending. The convictions add to the 23 guilty pleas prosecutors have already been secured against individuals and entities accused of bribery in the government’s sprawling investigation of corruption at football’s governing body, Fifa. Over 40 people and companies have been charged as part of the investigation, which the US attorney’s office says remains ongoing. The case was the first to come to trial since a dramatic dawn raid at a hotel near Fifa headquarters in Zurich revealed the investigation to the public for the first time. The trial, which lasted five weeks and saw 28 witnesses testify for the prosecution, revealed a web of corrupt practice that prosecutors say spanned several decades and resulted in at least $150m in bribes. The bribes were paid to the defendants in exchange for the rights to the region’s premier tournaments including the Copa América and the Copa Libertadores. During closing arguments US prosecutors totaled the amounts each of the defendants had been owed in bribes between 2010 and 2016. Napout’s was a total of $10.5m, Marin’s $6.5m and Burga’s $4.4m. All three were charged with racketeering conspiracy, with Napout and Marin now convicted as Burga’s case remains before the jury. Napout was also convicted on two counts of wire fraud conspiracy in relation to the Copa América and Copa Libertadores bribery schemes. Marin – who was also accused of taking bribes for the rights to the Copa do Brasil, Brazil’s domestic knockout tournament – was convicted on six counts in total. None of the three men called any witnesses in their defence. Although lawyers for each acknowledged the bribery schemes had existed, they claimed their clients had not been part of it and described the charges as government overreach. The verdict will be seen as a stunning success for prosecutors, whose years-long investigation sent shockwaves around the world of international soccer. The trial saw a host of former soccer executives and sports marketers testify against their former colleagues. Alejandro Burzaco, the government’s star witness and the former CEO of an Argentinian media company that paid millions in bribes gave four days of evidence accusing all three men of taking multiple illicit payments. Burzaco estimated he had paid $160m in bribes throughout his career to dozens of officials in exchange for broadcast and marketing rights. The former CEO also told the court he was aware that Julio Grondona, formerly Sepp Blatter’s number two at Fifa until his death in 2014, had taken at least $1m in exchange for his vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup. The Argentinian also alleged that some of the world’s top broadcasters he had partnered with, including TV Globo in Brazil and Fox Sports in America, were complicit in some bribe payments. Both companies deny the allegations. The trial unfolded under heightened security at a federal courthouse in Brooklyn amid concerns over witness intimidation. Burga, the defendant still awaiting a verdict, was accused by prosecutors of making throat-slitting gestures towards Burzaco during his testimony. Burga denied the allegations through his lawyer. After the guilty verdicts were read on Friday afternoon, Judge Pamela Chen ordered Napout, 59 and Marin, 85, be remanded in custody before sentencing as both were deemed flight risks. As the order was made, three plainclothes US Marshal officers unveiled their badges and entered the court and surrounded both men, who appeared stunned at the officers’ presence. A spokesperson for Fifa said the organization would now “seek restitution and recover any losses caused” as a result of the two men’s conduct while in office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/22/stoke-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T18:06:42Z","webTitle":"Stoke City v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/stoke-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/22/stoke-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Stoke City v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mark Hughes may be confident he will still be in charge if Stoke City lose to West Bromwich Albion but one thinks the last chance saloon could run dry if the Welshman suffers a fourth successive defeat.

One: that the upcoming child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge has a birthmark on their chest in the shape of the Union Jack, and two: that it will be a white Christmas this year. In London, that’s a forlorn hope – if you see white stuff falling out of the sky, it’s more likely to be because a banker has accidentally knocked his stash of cocaine out of the window. But around much of the rest of the country, there’s genuinely a chance this year that people will wake up in a landscape covered in what I like to call “God’s dandruff” (I don’t get invited to many winter wonderland parties). Of course, with snow, like all things, comes danger. You can slip on icy roads, or get your tongue stuck on icy lampposts, or get snow fatigue from looking at too many Instagram photos of your friends’ pets playing in snow. There is, however, one snow threat that is too often overlooked by the mainstream media, and it’s something that I would like to rectify today: what to do when the snowman you spent all day building is imbued with the magic of the witching hour and comes to life. There’s a lot of false information surrounding this issue, and I’m sorry to say that most of it comes from the 1982 public service video The Snowman. This film would have you believe that the safest course of action is to go out to the snowman, invite him inside, and allow him access to your father’s false teeth. I cannot stress hard enough what a terrible piece of advice this is. I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again – the child in that film is a reckless idiot who quite frankly is lucky to have survived the night. You might not be so fortunate – which is why we are proud to present a comprehensive guide for what to do in the event of SSS (Sudden Snowman Sentience). Call the police Upon seeing that the snowman you have built has come to life, calmly walk to the phone and dial 999. Inform them of your exact whereabouts, and tell them to bring several industrial hairdryers to the scene. The police are specifically trained to deal with this situation – they know what to say so as not to provoke the 300lb snowmonster that has been suddenly granted the gift of consciousness by unknown supernatural forces. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to approach the beast yourself, even if he doffs his cap deferentially to you. Keep in mind that mere seconds ago, he was nothing more than a lump of ice and compacted snow, and now, quite suddenly, he has been given the terrible curse of thoughts, emotions and free will. Ignore any attempt he makes to communicate with you, and do not answer any of his questions, such as “why do I exist”, “what is my purpose”, “what kind of God would allow this to happen” or “why won’t you let me die”. Do not invite him in Do not allow the snowman to breach the perimeter of your property. For one thing, it’s after midnight – you are under no obligation to entertain anyone between the hours 8pm and 8am, be they human or unfathomable snowbeast. Second, snowmen are walking sacks of water damage: don’t blame me when you get warped floorboards and a ruined sofa. Third, you are responsible for any melting that occurs on the property, and that’s a lawsuit waiting to happen. Sure, it’s fun when he’s putting on blusher and dancing in a pair of braces, but it’s less cute when he’s suing you for loss of 30% of his body weight because you forgot to turn the radiator off. Do not allow him to ride a motorbike This is a basic one. I’m annoyed I even have to point out that this is a bad idea. If your snowman comes to life, the last thing you want to do is give him a motorbike. He’s less than 10 minutes old, he’s not insured and the roads are treacherous at best. If there was any justice in the world, The Snowman should have ended with both of those characters getting into a fender bender and getting a six-month suspended sentence for reckless driving. Fly responsibly If the snowman grabs your hand and starts to sprint towards the sky, he is about to make you fly. There is nothing you can do to stop this. If you stand still or try to resist, he will rip your arm off. All you can do is run with the snowman, pray that the flight will be brief and uneventful, and attempt to tighten your dressing gown – if it comes undone over London, you are still liable for indecent exposure. By the way, during your journey, try not to refer to it as “walking in the air” (either in speech or in song). It’s very ambulatory-centric language and is considered incredibly rude, and a very condescending way to talk about the miracle of wingless flight. You’re actually flying, like Superman. “Walking in the air” makes it sound like you’ve got up to use the toilet on an airplane. You wouldn’t refer to swimming as “walking in the sea”, or bungee jumping as “walking downwards into the earth very very quickly”. Stay safe There are still so many questions within The Snowman cinematic universe that haven’t been answered, even 35 years on. How do the other snowmen know Santa Claus? Who built the other snowmen? Why is the boy the only child there? Do they all only live for one night? Why is Santa bald? But the thing that sticks out, to most people, is the ending – where the child runs down the stairs to see the melted snowman in a heap on the ground. Most take this to be a comment on the fleeting nature of childhood, and the realisation that at some point, we must all grow up. To those people I say – wake up, sheeple. Obviously the snowman couldn’t have melted from natural causes – how do you explain the still-unthawed snow on the ground surrounding him? It’s clear that the snowman was neutralised, most likely by goons of Santa Claus, who was angry that he had compromised the secret of his sentience to this little boy. The snowman at the end is yet another victim to the deep state of Big Christmas. The point is, when we interact with sentient snowmen and Father Christmas, we are dealing with forces beyond our control and understanding. Any wrong move could cause a diplomatic incident between humanity and snowmanity. That is why, this Christmas, if you see a sentient snowman, do the right thing and alert the authorities. Stay safe out there this Christmas. • Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/23/trump-taxes-judiciary-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T09:48:40Z","webTitle":"Long after Trump is gone, we'll still be fighting him | Corey Robin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/23/trump-taxes-judiciary-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/23/trump-taxes-judiciary-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Long after Trump is gone, we'll still be fighting him","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week, after the victory of Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama’s senatorial election, the media began reporting that the Republican party was facing an epic disaster. Citing insider talk of a “political earthquake” and a “party in turmoil,” the Washington Post anticipated a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2018. A year that began with dark premonitions of a fascist seizure of power, an autocrat’s total control of the state, seemed ready to end with sunny predictions of the Republican party losing one branch of the federal government to the opposition and a stalled rightwing agenda in Congress. One week later, after the victory of the Republican tax cut, the media has changed its tune. “The Republicans demonstrated their control of Washington on Wednesday,” the New York Times gushed. Trump, a Times headline read: “Flexes Republican Muscle”. Axios’s Mike Allen swooned over “Trump’s triple dip”: the tax cuts, opening up the Arctic national wildlife refuge to oil drilling, and getting rid of Obamacare’s individual mandate. Last week, it was all over for Trump. This week, he’s the emperor of the future. Unless the Republicans suffer another reversal in the next few days, expect the year to end with claims – exultant from the right, fearful from the left—of the coming rightwing-a-palooza. 1. Even an idiot can cut taxes Nothing in the tax cut changes my view that the Republican party and the conservative movement are weak and incoherent. Everything that was true last week is still true today. This is a massively unpopular president leading a massively unpopular party. Despite having total control of the federal government, that massively unpopular party has lost two significant elections in southern states, failed to repeal the signature achievement of the Obama administration, and, despite grand resolutions, has yet to push through any of the spending cuts it has long dreamed of. The party’s greatest (and only) legislative accomplishment this year is the passage of a massively unpopular bill that most people don’t even think will help them. Back in January, I wrote Trump would find it nearly impossible to move legislation though Congress, revise US foreign policy, or remake the Republican party in his (or Steve Bannon’s) image as a pseudo-workers’ party of economic nationalism. I did predict, though, that he and the Republicans would enjoy two key victories: tax cuts and deregulation. With the passage of the tax cuts, that’s turned to be true. But it didn’t take any gift of prophecy to see it. Like Trump, George W Bush lost the popular vote in 2000. Unlike Trump, Bush only won the electoral college because of the US supreme court. Despite that added spice of illegitimacy, despite having smaller majorities in both houses of Congress (razor-thin in the Senate, almost razor-thin in the House), Bush still managed to push through massive tax cuts – and, unlike Trump, got 40 Democrats to vote with him. A full six months sooner than Trump did. Cutting taxes is in the Republican DNA. Even an idiot can do it. 2. When Trump’s tweets fade, his judges will still be here If I had a chance to revise my January list of Trump’s expected successes, I’d have added one item: appointing judges. Since the spring, it’s been clear that Trump is stacking the judiciary at a record rate. It’s true that in this past week, Trump was forced to withdraw three of his nominees to the federal bench. (Reagan, by contrast, didn’t suffer a major defeat on that front till 1986, when the Senate judiciary committee refused to approve a nominee by the name of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III.) But overall, Trump has been reshaping the judicial branch with uncharacteristic dispatch and focus. Liberals and leftists often worry about Trump’s assault on the independence of the judiciary, his contempt for the rule of law, and his attack on the constitution. Those fears fit with a view of Trump as an extra-parliamentary street fighter, a fascist or proto-fascist rallying the masses against democratic norms and established institutions. Yet long after he’s gone, what we’ll be hearing from Trump won’t be his nasty tweets or vicious speeches. The voice we’ll be hearing – the signal act that will most preserve his legacy, that will most impose his present will on future prospects – will be that of the judges he’s now appointing. Independent judges, applying their understanding of the constitution to their interpretation of what the rule of law requires, over and against the wishes of whatever a future Congress or president may enact. 3. The Four Horsemen of the future During the first and second terms of Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency, the US supreme court struck down bill after bill that Roosevelt and the Democrats had passed in their desperate bid to bring some semblance of democratic control to the American economy. So odious, revanchist, and out of step were the court’s anti-New Dealers, they were dubbed the Four Horsemen. Sporting names like Pierce Butler, James McReynolds, George Sutherland and Willis Van Devanter, they looked like they had walked off the set of Gone With the Wind. A throwback in every way, they had been appointed at least a decade – in some cases, two – before Roosevelt’s transformative election of 1932. Collectively, they ruled for 85 years. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Four Horsemen of the future. 4. What a bad judge looks like Up until this week, I’d have cited rightwing judge Alex Kozinski of the US court of appeals, one of the most influential justices on the federal bench, as an example of what to expect from the Four Horsemen of the future. Sure, he’s 67, but with his insouciant wit and boyish enthusiasm – captured in this creepy clip from 1968 – he seems to possess the eternal youth and vigor of the prototypical Trumpist justice. But after having been accused of sexual harassment and misconduct by 15 women, many of them former law clerks and employees, Kozinski resigned from his position on Monday. Still, his record – and retirement – offers us a preview of the future. One of Kozinski’s most prominent accusers is Heidi Bond, who’s given a fuller description of Kozinski’s rule, sexual and non-sexual, in the workplace. One day, my judge found out I had been reading romance novels over my dinner break. He called me (he was in San Francisco for hearings; I had stayed in the office in Pasadena) when one of my co-clerks idly mentioned it to him as an amusing aside. Romance novels, he said, were a terrible addiction, like drugs, and something like porn for women, and he didn’t want me to read them any more. He told me he wanted me to promise to never read them again. “But it’s on my dinner break,” I protested. He laid down the law – I was not to read them anymore. “I control what you read,” he said, “what you write, when you eat. You don’t sleep if I say so. You don’t shit unless I say so. Do you understand?” Kozinski’s demands may seem peculiar, but the tyranny is typical. Employers control what workers read, when workers shit, all the time. But Kozinski has the added distinction of being one of the leading theoreticians of the first amendment. And not just any old theorist: he’s a libertarian theorist – Kozinski has a cameo in the film Atlas Shrugged: Part II – who claims that the first amendment affords great protection to “commercial speech”. Where other jurists and theorists claim that commercial speech – that is, speech that does “no more than propose a commercial transaction” – deserves much less protection than political or artistic speech, Kozinski has been at the forefront of a rightwing movement claiming that the first amendment affords the same levels of protection to commercial speech as it does to other kinds of speech. Because, as he put it in a pioneering article he co-authored in 1990: In a free market economy, the ability to give and receive information about commercial matters may be as important, sometimes more important, than expression of a political, artistic, or religious nature. Watching a commercial about asphalt? Vital to your wellbeing and sense of self. Deciding what books you read during your dinner break? Not so much. Government regulations of advertising? Terrible violation of free speech. Telling a worker what she can read? Market freedom. So that’s how we end 2017: on the one hand, a declining movement of the right, increasingly unpopular with the voters, trying to claim a long-term hold on power through the least democratic branch of government. On the other hand, a rising movement of women and the left, trying to topple ancient and middle-aged injustices, one nasty man at a time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/22/worcester-london-irish-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T22:16:22Z","webTitle":"Worcester’s Josh Adams deepens Premiership gloom for London Irish","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/22/worcester-london-irish-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/22/worcester-london-irish-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Worcester’s Josh Adams deepens Premiership gloom for London Irish","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Aviva Premiership season has barely reached its halfway point but the odds on London Irish escaping relegation are already starting to lengthen. There was only one winner of this pre-Christmas basement battle with Worcester, now a full 10 points clear of their struggling rivals, and the Exiles will need something truly remarkable to avoid a swift return to the Championship. Worcester, who have picked up 17 points from their last five Premiership games, were far from perfect but two tries from their in-form wing Josh Adams and the accurate boot of Chris Pennell proved sufficient to inflict Irish’s 10th defeat in 11 league games. Irish’s director of rugby, Nick Kennedy, made no attempt to sugarcoat the bitter pill, conceding his team had been “very poor” and fallen short of the required level. “It’s very disappointing and frustrating…we’ve obviously given ourselves some work to do,” he said. In many ways this was a microcosm of the visitors’ season: more injury woe, a slow start and only the occasional flicker of real quality. This season’s Premiership is no place to be even fractionally off the pace and, with the exception of the dangerous Alex Lewington, the Exiles have found the step up in fitness and skill levels difficult to bridge. “I wouldn’t have minded losing if we’d come out and thrown some shots but we didn’t,” said Kennedy. “It’s a big hill, not a mountain, for me but we know we need to get better very quickly. There’s a gap in the league we did not want and the players have two choices now. They can wake up and feel sorry for themselves or do everything they can to fight and win the next game.” Even before kick-off there was an ominous start to Irish’s evening when it emerged their captain, Fergus Mulchrone, and the All Black prop Ben Franks had been injured in the morning’s captain’s run. The Exiles have endured relentlessly grim luck with injuries and, without seeking to make excuses, Kennedy admitted preparations had been disrupted. With Worcester on the brink of confirming that their director of rugby, Gary Gold, will be departing sooner than planned to take up his new role as the US Eagles head coach, this was also a result that will be greeted with some relief in Northampton, who remain 14 points ahead of Irish and in control of their own destiny. A mere five minutes had elapsed when a neat left-footed chip behind the defence from Ryan Mills was neatly finished off by Adams in the left corner and Pennell’s conversion increased the visitors’ discomfort. In full flow the Warriors look a more than decent side, particularly with Hougaard back at scrum-half and the underrated Mills helping to pull the midfield strings. They have also suffered more than their fair share of treatment room agony and the premature departure of their unlucky tighthead, Nick Schonert, with another ankle ligament injury underlined the Premiership’s heavy attrition rate. It had a sizeable effect on a previously one-sided contest after Pennell had extended the lead to 10-0 with an excellent long-range penalty. First Greig Tonks clawed back three points with a 35th-minute penalty before Lewington showed rare pace to score a stunning solo try, regathering a bouncing ball ahead of a dawdling Adams. It was suddenly Worcester’s turn to fret, albeit briefly. In the final seconds of the half some space materialised in the Irish midfield and Adams, now the league’s leading finisher, redeemed himself with his eighth Premiership try of the season. The second half proved rather less eye-catching, aside from a spat involving Donncha O’Callaghan and the former Australian hooker Saia Fainga’a. The Irish lock appeared to take a tug at the ex-Wallaby’s dreadlocks at one point, prompting Fainga’a to retaliate with a swipe to O’Callaghan’s face. But the referee, Wayne Barnes, in charge of a record-breaking 191st Premiership game, opted not to show either man a card. Irish will probably need to win at least four of their last 11 fixtures to stand even a chance of survival, starting at home to Newcastle next Saturday. Worcester will head to Saracens under the command of the experienced South African Alan Solomons, drafted in to assist Gold back in October. The latter is not yet entirely writing off Irish – “They’ll never give up the fight” – but the Warriors can now look forward to Premiership rugby next season regardless of who is in permanent charge.

After the success of The Good Immigrant (edited by Nikesh Shukla) and titles like Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, there has been a renewed push to rectify the problems of an industry that has too long ignored narratives outside the white experience. Out of the thousands of titles published in 2016, a Bookseller study found that fewer than 100 books were published by non-white Brits. Sharmaine Lovegrove is one of the women single-handedly changing the face of the industry. She runs Dialogue Books, a new, inclusive publishing imprint from Little, Brown with a focus on BAME, LGBTQI+ and disabled writers. She scored a hat-trick of acquisitions on one day last summer, all of which she will publish in 2018. Her work complements that of the Jhalak prize – a competition set up to address the lack of diversity in British publishing and infamously reported to the Equality and Human Rights Commission by Tory MP Philip Davies, who claimed it was discriminatory against white people – which will be heading into its second year. Meanwhile, 2018 also looks set to be a solid year for strong titles written by and/or about black women. Mixed-race Ghanaian-English journalist Afua Hirsch publishes her debut nonfiction work, Brit(ish), which meticulously unpicks the complex psyche behind black Britishness. It begins by exploring her husband’s experiences of growing up black British in Tottenham, compared with hers: “When it comes to identity, I tell him, he was born with the equivalent of a silver spoon.” In July, Slay in Your Lane, a guide to life for British black women by Elizabeth Uviebinene and Yomi Adegoke , will also make an appearance. “Calling it the ‘Black Girl Bible’ was intentional,” says Uviebinene, talking about the cover slogan. “We hope it will reassure you that you’re not alone.” The pair interviewed dozens of inspirational black British women, from Jamelia to Malorie Blackman, and have collated them to form some of the first literature on living as a modern black British woman. There are chapters on physical and mental health, dating, education and media representation. Other titles to look out for in 2018 are intersectional feminist anthology Can We All Be Feminists? by black teen activist turned editor June Eric-Udorie, and Young, Gifted and Black, a children’s book by Jamia Wilson and Andrea Pippins on black heroes. Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff Ellen McDougall shaking up theatre At her grandmother’s house recently, Ellen McDougall came across a programme she’d written for a show she staged as a child. She gave the opening and closing speeches, and made her sister and cousin dance and play the violin. “I’d positioned myself as the curator and made those two, who had no interest in performing at all, just do all the stuff,” she laughs. “It’s really funny to meet yourself like that: oh hello, eight-year-old Ellen, you did know what you wanted to do.” McDougall, who grew up in north London and went to Edinburgh university, began her career as assistant director for Katie Mitchell, Marianne Elliott, Punchdrunk, and Sean Holmes – “all very different directors, which meant that I could have quite a mongrel way of thinking,” she says. Her own shows have become known for her intelligent and highly individual approach, whether using balloons as soldiers in Henry the Fifth, making Tolstoy feel modern in Anna Karenina, or sharing a picnic with the audience in Jose Saramago’s The Unknown Island. McDougall’s career stepped up a gear in 2017, when she became artistic director of the Gate, a 75-seater that has long punched above its weight. There are big shoes to fill, mind: former artistic directors include Stephen Daldry, Erica Whyman, Carrie Cracknell, Thea Sharrock… We meet in a small room that houses the Gate’s archive, and McDougall’s eyes shine as she talks about its history, her fingers clearly itching to rifle through those box files. “I’m drawn to undiscovered international classics, which has always been the bread and butter here,” she says. But the space itself excites her too, its bijou size no restriction to ambition. “I’ve always loved how intimate that space is; you can look everyone in the eye. And because the space changes for every show, it’s always a surprise when you come up those stairs. Nothing is a given.” The year starts with a revival of Anna Deavere Smith’s Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992, “a very early verbatim play, written in response to the riots in LA”, yet which still, McDougall says, feels “incredibly relevant”. That’s followed by Trust, a new play by German writer Falk Richter, which finds parallels between our addiction to capitalism and a troubled relationship: “how bad does it have to get before we break up?” Finally, there’s Effigies of Wickedness, a cabaret of queer, political songs banned by the Nazis, which will be directed by McDougall. Oh, and it’s a collaboration with English National Opera, whose home, the Coliseum, is 30 times the size of the Gate. “That fills me with joy as a collaborator,” she grins. “Do the wacky choice.” Artistic directors like to talk partnerships, diversity, outreach, but you sense McDougall really means it. She’s put internationalism at the heart of her programming: every production features an international writer, director or designer. It’s an artistic choice – “some of the best work I’ve seen is made in a completely different way” – but also a political one. “It feels like an incredibly important gesture right now,” says McDougall. “You can make wonderful things if you work with people who aren’t the same as you. Let’s look outside what we know.” Holly Williams A fresh take on Moroccan food When Nargisse Benkabbou arrived in London seven years ago, she was taken aback by how Moroccan food was understood in the UK, compared with Belgium where she grew up. “What really struck me was how people mixed it up with Middle Eastern food,” says the 31-year-old, whose parents moved to Brussels from Fez in the 1970s. “At university, my friends would tell me, ‘I love hummus, what’s your recipe for hummus?’ I’m like, ‘I love hummus too, but it’s not Moroccan. Morocco is in north Africa.’” Benkabbou decided to make an intervention. She had come to London to do a master’s in public policy. Her initial plan was to work in a charity or thinktank specialising in women’s rights, but she struggled to find the right job and became disillusioned with the corporate world she ended up in. What she really wanted to do, she tells me when I come to lunch at her flat in west London, was write about food. She’d loved helping out in the kitchen as a kid, and after leaving home she discovered she was good at cooking for friends. The idea of starting a blog and writing a cookbook seemed like a fantasy, but then she told herself: it can’t harm anyone if you try. And, she says, “when I realised there were not enough places online where you could find good, modern Moroccan recipes, I thought, I have to do it – it was a bit like a duty.” Benkabbou quit her job in 2013, did a three-month course at Leiths and launched My Moroccan Food in 2015. This colourful, inventive blog caught the eye of a UK publisher, and now Benkabbou is putting the final touches to her first cookbook, Casablanca, due out next May. Acting as an ambassador for Moroccan food seemed daunting at first. “Morocco is a huge country with diverse cuisines,” she says, “and there were so many recipes I didn’t know.” Luckily, she had her mother and a brigade of aunts, all excellent cooks, to consult. As a consequence, both blog and book feel personal, reflecting her own experience and family background rather than striving to encapsulate an entire country. She also kept the recipes accessible, which sometimes meant putting a western spin on Moroccan classics, or vice versa. Some of this comes through in our lunch, which begins with a beetroot and goat’s cheese salad to which Benkabbou adds candied walnuts and an orange blossom dressing. We also have garlic and cumin roast lamb, served with yoghurt and mint sauce, bread, and a jar of her mother’s homemade harissa. In the book, among more traditional tagines and couscous dishes, you’ll find chicken traybakes and a merguez burger with preserved lemon guacamole. Did she worry what the purists might say? “I did a bit, when I first started my blog and would get messages saying that a taco has no place in Moroccan food,” Benkabbou admits. But she is adamant that there’s nothing wrong with mixing up cuisines, so long as you’re transparent about it. “I never try to sell a recipe as traditional when it’s not,” she says. “I’m very clear if it’s fusion food, if it’s modern, if it has a twist.” She feels she’s only begun to mine this fertile territory at the intersection of north African and western cuisine. It helps that there’s a lot more of Morocco to explore. “I’m not so familiar with cuisine of the south, the desert,” she says, her face lighting up. “I know they make bread that’s baked in the sand and tagines that cook for 20 hours.” She smiles. “I’d really love to explore that.” Killian Fox Dolly Alderton’s millennial memoir There are many eye-boggling moments in Everything I Know About Love, the debut memoir by 29-year-old Dolly Alderton. There’s the evening where she’s so drunk she mistakes Oxford Circus for actual Oxford, then takes a £300 cab to Birmingham for a shag. An attempt at “Tinder tourism” in New York culminates in two terrifying French blokes unsuccessfully pressuring her to have a threesome. Her co-ed boarding school had a bar for sixth-formers. Yet despite the vogue for grisly memoirs by young women, Everything I Know is refreshing because Alderton doesn’t sensationalise or moralise her experiences. “It’s easy with memoir to be fairly binary about the moral of the story,” she says over a mince pie in her Camden flat. “‘She was insecure and she became whole’ – but that’s not how life goes. I’m not going to not write about what I see as a lot of joyful flaneurism because I’m a woman and [a more sanitised picture] would be easier for people to digest. Because some of it was bad and sad, and some of it was really fun.” As a former Sunday Times dating columnist and Made in Chelsea story producer, Alderton knows readers may expect “madcap tales of running around London with my skirt over my head, from Tinder date to Tinder date,” though anyone who’s read her witty, intuitive journalism and heard her politics and pop-culture podcast The High Low will recognise the unfairness of the stereotype. She’s also expecting questions about what anyone would want to learn from a 29-year-old. “You could see the title and think that it’s me being a guru,” she admits. “But I hope the scribbles on the cover” – through “parties, dates, friends, jobs, life” – “give a clue to what’s inside, which is really someone still trying to work it out.” Hence the anecdotes, to illuminate the inevitable fuckups on the path to self-respect: realising that too much people-pleasing leaves you empty, that drinking to numb anxiety makes it worse. Everything I Know isn’t an infantilising “adulting” book, but a sensitive and funny account of growing up millennial. Alderton’s focus is close and personal, interwoven with astute observations on modern womanhood. A chapter about her eating disorder finds roots in the biblical legislation of women’s appetites, and her newly engaged best friend promising her “nothing will change” provokes a sharp diatribe about the undervaluing of female friendships compared with heterosexual couplings. Female friendship is the true romance of Everything I Know. Alderton hadn’t previously seen their bond reflected in art, “the frivolity, intimacy, knowing each other really well in a way that’s almost uncomfortable”. She’s not worried about baring her life, because her sense of self is sturdy these days. If someone criticised her based on the memoir, “I now know that I could go, OK, well, you’re wrong. That’s not who I am.” A Desert Island Discs aficionado (in 2014, her essay on the Radio 4 series won her a prestigious Telegraph prize), Alderton took solace from memoirist Diana Athill’s episode. “She said, you have to expose indecent truths. So I tried to hold those words close, and thought, if you do a PR job on your 21-year-old self, people are going to see it. And they’re going to think that’s way worse than thinking Oxford Circus is Oxford.” Laura Snapes A new generation of music festivals With Glastonbury in a fallow year, 2018 seems as good a time as any to explore the burgeoning UK festival scene. The most interesting addition to the calendar is All Points East, organised by Goldenvoice – the same people behind Californian behemoth Coachella – spread over 10 days in London’s Victoria Park. The event kicks off at the end of May with a three-day festival-within-a-festival boasting a dreamy line-up including Björk, LCD Soundsystem, Lorde and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. As if that wasn’t enough, it continues the following weekend with concerts headlined by the National (plus the War on Drugs and Future Islands) and Nick Cave (plus Patti Smith, St Vincent and more). More related events are still to be announced. Also in London will be the Cure’s 40th anniversary concert in Hyde Park in July, with support from the likes of Interpol and Slowdive, while Ibiza regular DJ Artwork is launching a one-day event at Three Mills Island on 11 August. Meanwhile in Staffordshire and Chelmsford, V festival will be rebranding with a new name (how much else will change has yet to be seen), and pop punk fans will be delighted to hear that Slam Dunk (held across three dates in Hertfordshire, Leeds and Birmingham) has got Good Charlotte and Jimmy Eat World on headline duties. Tara Joshi Artist Tacita Dean takes over London Tacita Dean, at 52, is our great poet of art film. Over the years, she has turned her meditative vision to some of the grandest of dramas – heartbreak, shipwreck, a total solar eclipse in the deserts of Wyoming – and some of the smallest, including the elegiac fading of diurnal light in an empty restaurant. This spring, in an unprecedented collaboration, three major museums at once will all focus on different aspects of her art. The National Portrait Gallery presents her intimate and pensive portraits of fellow artists, including Merce Cunningham, Cy Twombly, Claes Oldenburg and David Hockney. The tradition of still life is explored in a show at the National Gallery, featuring, among others, Dean’s brilliant take on nature morte. And the Royal Academy has her landscape works, including a beautiful early film in which the faint breeze passing over its surface transforms a lake from still landscape to moving pictures. Each show includes several new works, from a study of portrait miniatures to a colossal vision of the world, featuring the poet Anne Carson and the actor Stephen Dillane. These shows are unmissable, and so geographically close you can see them all in a day. Laura Cumming Young women with attitude on screen Cinematic stories that centre around young women are still few and far between, though there are three to keep an eye out for next year. Greta Gerwig’s hotly anticipated directorial debut, Lady Bird, looks at the fragile relationship between the title character (Saoirse Ronan), a pink-haired Californian with big dreams of college on the east coast and the brash confidence of a 10-year-old girl, and her well-meaning, disapproving mother (Laurie Metcalf). As a coming-of-age film (and early 00s period piece), it’s both vividly mapped and beautifully specific, though it’s Gerwig’s treatment of the class anxieties experienced by Lady Bird and her family in post 9/11, pre-financial crash suburban Sacramento that made the film rattle in my bones after its initial giddy, teen-movie high wore off. Playwright Cory Finley’s macabre Thoroughbreds is a slick, drily funny two-hander led by Olivia Cooke and Anya Taylor-Joy as Amanda and Lily, spoiled schoolfriends, estranged because one of them killed a horse. Both performances are cold thrills: Taylor-Joy is jumpy and coltish, all hot, nervous breathing and tense neck muscles, while Cooke is coolly indifferent to the point of sociopathy. We can also look forward to Laetitia Dosch’s cyclone of a performance in Jeune Femme, Léonor Serraille’s comedy drama about an unruly, uncompromising young woman who struggles to gather the rapidly unspooling threads of her life in Paris after being dumped by her boyfriend of 10 years. Simran Hans A batch of grime debuts Grime had a phenomenal year in 2017, with Stormzy – a GQ cover star, no less – leading from the front, even daring to put a gospel-tinged song on his album. This time around, the mainstreaming of grime is happening on its own terms – a swelling bell curve that’s bringing the UK’s loudest, busiest homegrown genre off the streets and into international acclaim. It feels like Stefflon Don is already a name rather than merely a star in waiting: crossover chart artists like Yxng Bane are not exactly up’n’coming any more; both are set to release something big next year, and tour properly. In a genre arguably focused on tracks, a brace of MCs, rappers and producers are now poised to drop debut full-length outings. Whether you call them albums or mixtapes, an absolute blizzard of verses is about to hit in 2018. All eyes are on former sparring partners (on the track Thiago Silva) Dave, still only 19 and a hugely versatile lyrical talent – and west London MC AJ Tracey, fresh from an EP – Secure the Bag – whose widescreen ambition bodes well for a longer project. Joining a surge of female voices, south Londoner Ms Banks recently toured the UK with Cardi B, is set to join Nicki Minaj on her not-yet-officially-announced UK jaunt next year, and has “a highly anticipated forthcoming project” ready to drop next year. Kitty Empire Giant leaps in space exploration Fifty years on from the release of Stanley Kubrick’s sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey, it looks like space will loom large in 2018. China is expected to launch a lunar probe next year, which is set to become the first to land on the far side of the moon. The Chang’e-4 probe, which is named after the goddess of the moon in Chinese mythology, will make a soft landing and carry out the first ground-based explorations of the hemisphere that is never directly visible from the Earth (sometimes known as the moon’s dark side, although it is no darker than the near side). The mission could allow the first exploration of the moon’s South Pole-Aitken basin, one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system, which could uncover clues about what the interior of the moon is made of. It also signals China’s future ambitions in space exploration. Across the Pacific, Elon Musk’s company SpaceX is planning a private mission to fly two space tourists around the moon aboard the company’s Dragon 2 spacecraft. It is also set to become the first private company to launch astronauts to the International Space Station next year. This will give the US a means of getting people into space again – since they retired their space shuttle in 2011, only the Russians have had this ability. Hannah Devlin Beast: a remarkable first film Michael Pearce can pinpoint the moment he knew he wanted to be a film-maker: it was when a tutor at his art school on the island of Jersey showed him Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. “I was 16, and it blew my mind. Within a couple of weeks I had decided to be a director rather than a painter.” The impact of the film on him was perhaps magnified because it was so hard to see non-mainstream movies on an island that, he says, has always struggled to have a vibrant cultural scene. Pearce’s striking debut film, Beast, is set in Jersey and draws from his strong impressions of growing up there, “both positive and negative”. The story, which explores the relationship between a troubled young woman (an extraordinary performance from Jessie Buckley) and a local man (Johnny Flynn) who may or may not be very bad news indeed, was loosely based on a real event. “There was a guy in the 1960s who was dubbed the Beast of Jersey, who was a serial sex attacker. It was really horrific – he would wear a mask, a wig, a whole outfit and he would break into people’s homes, kidnap their children, take them into the woods and assault them. When I grew up in the 80s, he was part of the folklore of the island, like the bogeyman.” Pearce had what he describes as an idyllic childhood growing up on the west coast of Jersey, close to where the film was shot. It felt, he says, like a very safe, almost fairytale environment. He describes the impact that learning about the Beast had. “I thought, if this could be somewhere dangerous, then anywhere could. I am interested in that loss of innocence when you are a kid, when you realise that monsters do exist and they are other people.” Despite its very specific insular island setting, Beast has connected with audiences at festivals around the world. I meet Pearce in Macau, China, where the film is screening in competition, following its premiere at Toronto and subsequent showings in London, Stockholm and Torino; next year, the film will continue its journey to Rotterdam and Sundance before being released in the UK on 27 April. Variety described the film as a “prickly, twistily effective first feature” and praised Buckley’s “remarkable” performance. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that “the combustible chemistry between the two leads would be sufficient to power a small factory, let alone a film”. Musing on the film’s enthusiastic reception, Pearce says, “I think it was Elia Kazan who said that 50% of a director’s job is casting.” He concedes that maths may not have been Kazan’s strong point, but adds, “But you get the point. I am very interested in making the audience complicit – creating a strong empathetic bond between them and the central characters at the beginning. That was certainly something we were thinking about when we were casting Jessie – she is such a grounded, relatable presence on screen. You are on her side. And that gives you liberty for her to make quite a lot of mistakes.” Johnny Flynn, with his peculiar chameleon, shape-shifting quality, is equally crucial to the film’s troubling allure. “I wanted to maintain this umbilical cord between the audience and the characters,” says Pearce, “but I wanted to stretch it as far as possible before it breaks.” Wendy Ide The Rhythm Method’s debut album Two years ago, the Rhythm Method had their eyes on the prize. “I want to be Rod Stewart!” frontman Joey Bradbury told i-D. The duo had signed for publishing with Universal, been tipped in the hip Dazed 100 list, and thought fame was theirs. As it stands, Bradbury, 28, lives at home in Putney, and producer Rowan Martin, 27, is dodging debt in Archway. They’re repulsed by the industry they wanted to infiltrate. “I don’t think I’ve ever met an A&amp;R man that isn’t a complete creep, and I’m a man. Dread to think what they’re like with women,” says Bradbury, drinking in their favourite Ealing wine bar. Now they see themselves as “a grassroots movement, almost like the Momentum or the Jeremy Corbyn of music,” says Bradbury, his laugh a bassy gurgle. Their rinky-dink singles form the root of this connection. With the geezer charm of Mike Skinner, Bradbury chronicles modern life’s endearingly crap parts over Martin’s chintzy house and Pet Shop Boys-lite productions (singing the odd chorus, he also sounds spookily like Neil Tennant). “Things can only get bitter, the accumulator-winners, the yellow-label dinners and the original sinners,” Bradbury riffs on Party Politics. Often they’re joined by singer Zoee, who adds a lovers-rock lilt to Cruel, a song about interdependency: “When did my saucepot become a sore spot?” The Rhythm Method are rampant nostalgists, but not the blue-passport variety. They long for the return of “the middle” – mainstream entertainment that credits its audience with a brain, like Victoria Wood or Aztec Camera. Martin mentions a recent night in a pub with Squeeze and Dexys on the jukebox. “People of 18, people of 60, all singing along. Really, what the Rhythm Method is about is trying to add to that pantheon, because I don’t think anyone else is trying.” They squeeze their mission between day jobs. Bradbury has been a barber for a decade, inspired by the Specials’ Terry Hall saying he’d always dreamed of being a musician or a hairdresser, and Martin asks if I know anyone after cheap transcription. The Rhythm Method are working-class, and suspicious of their privileged peers. Bradbury recently tweeted, wryly, “We’re an unsigned band out here on that struggle. Just us, our management, our media strategist and the family wealth we play down.” “There are bands that claim to be representing the working class, but they’re definitely not working-class,” he says. “A few years ago I was very bitter and would hate people instantly for being posh, particularly if they were in bands, but now I’m more open-minded. Just be honest about it.” They’re also unconvinced by the angry young men being tipped as the voice of British youth. “It’s too easy an emotion,” he says. “You can express anger without shouting, and sadness without crying. You can be funny about both those things, which is our ethos.” Bradbury and Martin are effortlessly charismatic, and their array of strange 2017 support slots – Enter Shikari, Wolf Alice, Madness – shows the reach of their wit, even if Madness’s fans booed them off. Done glad-handing, they’re taking their cues from fellow DIY acts Stormzy, Chance the Rapper, and, uh, Vic and Bob, as they prepare to release their debut album, likely through British indie Moshi Moshi. They’re upping their merch game, starting a podcast, “embracing the non-musical elements”, says Bradbury. Maybe grassroots movement is underselling it: “It’s a whole entertainment package.” Laura Snapes Gripping drama on the small screen The year starts with a bang, thanks to the debut of McMafia on New Year’s Day, 9pm on BBC1 – in what has become known as “the Sherlock slot”. No Baker Street sleuthing here, though. McMafia is a stylish eight-part gangster saga, based on journalist Misha Glenny’s book, starring James Norton as a man reluctantly drawn into the family business – which just happens to be violent international crime. Another homegrown thriller heading our way is BBC Two’s Collateral, written by playwright David Hare and starring Carey Mulligan as a Met detective investigating the murder of a pizza delivery man and its spiralling repercussions. If you prefer real-life peril, a killer flu pandemic is currently top of the government’s civilian risk register, and in spring, the ambitious interactive project BBC Pandemic will chart the spread of a highly infectious disease to show just how scary it could be. In lighter (but not much lighter) news, Emmy-winning director Cary Fukunaga – who directed the superlative first series of True Detective – returns with Netflix black comedy Maniac, adapted from a Norwegian series, starring Jonah Hill and Emma Stone as patients in an 80s psychiatric institution. There’s frankly absurd amounts more to look forward to, including the final series of Game of Thrones, Suranne Jones in Sally Wainwright’s period lesbian drama Gentleman Jack, the return of Making a Murderer and Jodie Whittaker’s debut at the Tardis controls in Doctor Who. Better clear your diaries and some hard-drive space. Michael Hogan Liam Young: a fresh political voice When Liam Young was nine, he solemnly informed Tony Blair of his intention to succeed him as prime minister. At 14, he borrowed his mum’s credit card to join the Labour party and was chucked out because he was too young. At 21, the plumber’s son from Lincoln is continuing on his precocious course with the first political manifesto to emerge from the #jezwecan generation. Rise, which will be published in March, chronicles the two campaigns that saw Jeremy Corbyn elected and reaffirmed as Labour leader, and investigates the causes the party will have to embrace if it is to hang on to the young voters who have done so much to turn its fortunes around. At 9am in his publisher’s office, Young is every inch the up-and-coming politician. It’s hard to believe he is only 21, though this has nothing to do with his hairline, which he jokes is inherited from his dad, and everything to do with his presentation. He is conservatively dressed, impeccably fluent and personable, with a seasoned opinion-maker’s confidence in the formulation “I believe…”. Yet he is also very much a creature of the youth phenomenon whereof he writes: a working-class boy, who went to local Catholic schools and worked his way through university; a social media whiz whose way with a tweet caught the attention of the “old” media. Though his mum and dad weren’t political, his grandparents were, with his maternal grandad, Roland Hurst, rising to become mayor of Lincoln at a time when the city council was solidly, if not unproblematically, Labour. While still a student at the London School of Economics, Young was invited to write opinion pieces for the Independent and the New Statesman, earning himself the soubriquet “Corbyn’s fanboy”. He is not a member of Momentum – “I’ve only ever belonged to the Labour party” – but is a supporter of its work. Young’s research for Rise included a social media call-out to young voters for their views on 15 key questions. The 4,000 replies, many of them essay-length, converged on a single point: “For the first time in decades, we were asked. And we responded.” It’s not that he thinks Corbynism is an end in itself. Rather, he argues, the Labour leader is “a solution through which young people became their own champions”. He now shares a flat in Stockwell with a university friend and has a proper paying job as adviser to Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad. He stood for selection as Labour candidate in Lincoln himself this year, and got down to the last three, but – having seen parliament from the inside – is not convinced it’s where it’s at: “It’s this incredibly archaic place that stifles innovation.” As he embarks on this new life as an author, he’s assessed the risk of being demonised and concluded that he has nothing to hide “except that I started drinking at 14, which was far too soon, and would get me in trouble with my mum”. And insurance against getting uppity or out-of-touch is laid on for free in his grandparents’ house, where the home fires of political debate will always burn and Corbyn was for a long time He Who Shall Not Be Named. Claire Armitstead Singer Rina Sawayama on tour With clean-cut songs that recall the harmonious, baroque sheen of TLC and ‘NSync-era pop (even, at times, Mariah and Destiny’s Child), there’s a lot of buzz surrounding London-via-Japan artist Rina Sawayama. While she’s been making music for several years now – notably, she was in a hip-hop duo with Wolf Alice’s Theo Ellis when the pair were at university together – it was 2017’s mini-album Rina, featuring tracks such as Alterlife, that attracted special acclaim. Highlighting her dazzling brand of slick J-pop-influenced music, the release is an ode to 90s/00s-style R&amp;B, replete with licks of over-the-top guitars and cyber-tinged warmth. Some of the hype is also down to her unique style. Sawayama has amassed a notable following in the fashion world: she has been featured in Vogue and V magazine, among others, and was one of the eight creative talents in the Versus Versace fall/winter campaign. Last year she collaborated with Taiwanese artist John Yuyi on a series of portraits interrogating Asian beauty standards, a subject she is outspoken about. Her sparkly, uplifting sound is all held together with an unfaltering, sweet but disarmingly powerful voice that sings of romance, fame, and preoccupations with self-image. Sawayama’s music speaks to millennial anxieties and nostalgias, and her song Cyber Stockholm Syndrome tackles our strange digital-age addictions: “I’m not here for love tonight/ The way you touch just don’t feel right/ Used to feeling things so cold/ Happiest whenever I’m with you online.” Tara Joshi The V&amp;A in Dundee opens If Abu Dhabi can have a Louvre, why shouldn’t Dundee have a Victoria and Albert Museum? This autumn, eight years after the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma won a competition to design it, just such an institution is due to open, on the banks of the magnificent, if windswept, river Tay. Also billed as “Scotland’s first design museum”, it promises to “present the brilliance of Scottish creativity and the best of design from around the world,” combining exhibits from the V&amp;A mothership in London with others from collections across Scotland. The rugged design, in which stone panels are hung on sloping concrete walls – there are no pure verticals – is intended to represent a Scottish cliff face. Its gestation hasn’t been easy. Originally designed to stand in the river, its site was relocated on shore to save money, despite which its budget almost doubled from £45m to £80m. Its intended opening date of 2014 proved optimistic. This year we’ll find out if the museum, one of the most ambitious cultural projects in recent times, has been worth the effort. Rowan Moore The return of Steve McQueen Since becoming the first black film-maker to win a best picture Oscar – for his lauded, impassioned Solomon Northup study 12 Years a Slave – Steve McQueen has kept a pretty low profile. A striking 2015 music video for Kanye West aside, the Turner prize-winning artist turned director has been linked with several intriguing projects (a mooted Paul Robeson biopic, a scrapped HBO drama series) that haven’t come to pass. But he’s set to return with a bang in 2018: scheduled for release in mid-November, a full five years after 12 Years a Slave hit US cinemas, his fourth feature film will be the female-powered heist thriller Widows. An American reworking of the 1980s ITV miniseries scripted by Lynda LaPlante, the cast is headed by Viola Davis as one of four criminal widows banding together to finish the job begun by their slain husbands. The enviable ensemble includes Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, Colin Farrell and Liam Neeson, with Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn joining McQueen on script duty. He’s joining the prestige TV revolution, too: also on the docket is an ambitious six-part BBC drama, studying a London West Indian community over the course of three decades – beginning in 1968 with Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood” speech. Guy Lodge Dance’s daring new talent When 23 year-old dancer Harriet Ellis was rehearsing 5 Soldiers with Rosie Kay Dance Company, she spent a week attached to the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. The soldiers made a point of saying how much they admired the young dancer’s grit, how prepared she was to take the bruises and the exhaustion and crack on. These qualities are evident in her dancing. Cool of gaze, economical of movement, and as sharp and fast as a sparrowhawk, Ellis is a dancer for all seasons. In RKDC’s MK Ultra she was half lethally swaying cobra, half weirded-out pop princess. In 5 Soldiers she was punchy and taut-wired, her femininity and vulnerability locked tight inside herself. “The female officers all told me how much they identified with her,” says choreographer and director Rosie Kay. “Harriet’s attitude is: if anyone dares me, I’ll do it.” Ellis graduated from Bird College of Dance in 2016. She lives in Stourbridge outside Birmingham, and for now is happy to spend as much time on stage as she can. “Maybe later I’ll try screen work, but who knows?” she says. Who indeed. Watch her. She moves fast. Luke Jennings Gaming enters its Battle Royale era In terms of raucous, blinding popularity, one game dominated 2017 more than any other: PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, a game in which a hundred players drop from a plane on to a deserted island, where they must scavenge resources and fight one another to be the last man standing (a riff on the Japanese novel and film Battle Royale). Seven Guinness world records fell at its hand (astonishingly, the game is technically still a work-in-progress prototype), including that of first videogame to reach two million concurrent players on Steam (gaming’s equivalent of the iTunes store). It takes time, in a medium where virtual worlds take years to build and populate, for a good and successful idea to become a trend, but there is no doubt that a slew of video games made in the Battle Royale mode are incoming. Some are already out. The first, Fortnite, a cartoonish, kid-friendlier counterpoint to PUBG’s muted realism is doing a roaring trade. Grand Theft Auto V has an automobile-heavy take on the design, while Ark: Survival of the Fittest casts players as dinosaurs, duking it out in the Jurassic era. Many more variants will follow in 2018 as the trend grows into a phenomenon until finally, inevitably, it becomes passe.

The question, instead, was always Where Isn’t Trump? All roads – public debate, private argument, artistic endeavour – seemed eventually to lead in his squalid direction; his gravitational pull irresistible, his fleshy presence horribly ubiquitous. It wasn’t just the explicit satire of, say, Saturday Night Live that kept the US president front and centre in cultural life. Lee Hall’s triumphant reworking at the National Theatre of Network, Paddy Chayefsky’s 1976 film about mass media and demagoguery, held a more subtle mirror up to the age of Trump. Shakespeare’s history plays acquired fresh and often unsettling relevance (watch out for the Bridge theatre’s production of Julius Caesar, opening in London next month). Even War for the Planet of the Apes teemed with apparent parallels in its post-apocalyptic vision of walls, segregation and deportation. Yet it was Hulu’s television adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale that jangled the nerves most vividly and to such startling effect. Set in the near future, it imagined Gilead: an authoritarian mutation of the United States, in which the constitutional apparatus has been forcibly dismantled and replaced by the patriarchal rule of “Sons of Jacob”, stripping women of all rights and enslaving those who remained fertile as handmaids, serially raped in a pseudo-biblical “ceremony” to provide the childless governing caste with progeny. The Handmaid’s Tale was ostensibly televisual fiction. Yet in its uncompromising exploration of fear and power and its abuse, it also captured the lightning of the moment in a bottle of dystopian genius. It was nothing short of mesmeric, all the more so on repeated viewings. When the series was ordered in April 2016, Trump was the frontrunner to win the Republican nomination but not quite the presumptive candidate. It was still orthodox to assert that Hillary Clinton would trounce him in the election itself. His unapologetic misogyny had been perfectly clear at the first Republican contenders’ debate in August 2015, in which he sparred with the moderator, Megyn Kelly, and insulted Rosie O’Donnell. But the notorious Access Hollywood tape – “grab them by the pussy” – did not become public until October 2016, by which stage The Handmaid’s Tale was already in production. Yet, through luck, intuition or a combination of the two, the series became a disturbing text for our times. Produced by Atwood, author of the original novel, and Elisabeth Moss, who played the lead character, June/Offred, it did more than a thousand news bulletins to capture all that was most toxic about the new populist right and the shredding of constitutional norms. When the book first appeared in 1985, it was hailed as an ingenious thought-experiment and, of course, a bleak warning. Atwood’s point was that all the practices she described in fictional Gilead were actually taking place somewhere in the world. She was right, too, to draw attention to the strong strain of Puritanism embedded in American culture by the first settlers – at least as powerful as the Enlightenment values usually associated with the founding fathers. But context is all. What seemed a cautionary tale then feels more like a deafening klaxon now. Why? Because the world of Offred, though still notionally a fiction, has migrated from creative construct to the realm of the thinkable. Gilead’s use of technology to subordinate women overnight seemed all too close to the bone in the year in which the power of digital manipulation and cyberwarfare to distort the democratic process became chillingly apparent. If the roots of pluralism, minority rights and constitutionalism were as shallow as Trump clearly believed, then anything was possible. And that is not all: just as the series acted as a mythic commentary upon the culture wars of the Trump era, it also prefigured the fightback of the #MeToo movement. Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey broke the Harvey Weinstein story in the New York Times in October. But the global phenomenon spawned by their initial investigations was luminously foreshadowed in The Handmaid’s Tale – and in one particular scene. In the final episode, Offred and her fellow handmaids are assembled to stone one of their number to death. In a moment of beautifully captured solidarity, they refuse to comply, each dropping her stone as the scandalised guards and the supervising “Aunts” look on. The shot of their rebellious march away from the execution site to the strains of Nina Simone might be the backdrop to all that followed in the real world. Not that the story ends there. “There will be consequences,” says Ann Dowd’s Aunt Lydia. “Believe me.” As in art, so in life. If you doubt that the #MeToo movement has sown male resentment, look at some of the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) sites and Reddit threads, and think again. There are T-shirts for sale online that bear Gilead’s theocratic greeting, “Under his eye”. Do you think it is women who are buying them? Twenty-six years ago, Susan Faludi warned in Backlash that the struggle for gender equality was only just beginning. Just as many on the alt-right envy Islam’s segregation of women, so there are men, seething as never before, who privately regard Atwood’s Gilead not as a dystopia but an inspiration. As I overheard one say after watching the first few episodes: “When does it start getting bad?” Atwood’s novel is opaque about Offred’s fate but ends with an arch postscript – the minutes of an academic conference in 2195 – implying that Gilead eventually collapses. In contrast, the television series returns in the spring to resume the story of the characters she created more than 30 years ago. The spark of hope at its heart is the notion that history is not preordained, that its unfolding depends upon human agency and courage: nolite te bastardes carborundorum (“don’t let the bastards grind you down”) is the scratched graffito written by one of Offred’s predecessors. The secret package given to her by the resistance contains not a bomb but something much more potent: the letters of scores of handmaids, breaking their silence. Small wonder that this extraordinary series gripped our imagination this year and, I expect, will do so again in 2018. As Atwood has remarked of her novel: “You don’t write these things hoping they become more relevant.” Alas, that choice is not in the writer’s hands. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/24/tyson-warne-mcg-ashes-england-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T12:00:50Z","webTitle":"From Tyson to Warne the MCG has provided some classic Test performances | Simon Burnton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/24/tyson-warne-mcg-ashes-england-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/24/tyson-warne-mcg-ashes-england-australia","fields":{"headline":"From Tyson to Warne the MCG has provided some classic Test performances","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"England have won 36.1% of their 61 matches at Trent Bridge and 36.4% of their 77 Tests at Old Trafford; they have played 55 times at the MCG and won 36.4% of those. If it does not feel quite as homely as Nottingham or Manchester, Melbourne has been the site of many great English moments – as well as, inevitably, a few grisly nightmares. Perhaps the greatest of those 55 Tests, and surely the most thrilling, came in 1982, with England 2-0 down after three matches but the destination of the urn still undecided. It was, the England spinner Geoff Miller said, “the best and most exciting Test match I ever played in”. Australia’s final pair, Allan Border and Jeff Thomson, needed 74 runs to win the match and with it the Ashes. England’s tactic was simple: offer Border easy singles and wait for Thomson to get himself out. “There was no pressure on me,” Thomson would later tell Cricinfo. “Everyone expected me to play a stupid shot and get out. But it didn’t happen that way. I can still picture the England side’s growing anxiety. They had stupid fields, bowled badly and everything was in the batsmen’s favour.” Slowly, the target got closer; England took the new ball with Australia 33 runs from victory, but still the wicket they needed would not come. Eventually, Australia needed four more runs to claim victory. Thomson was on strike, and Ian Botham bowling. “I thought I would get a single, so AB could hit the winning runs,” Thomson said. “It was a half-tracker and a bit of an away swinger. A bad ball really. I just tried to push it out for a single rather than smash it.” It caught his edge and flew to Chris Tavaré at second slip. He could not hold it but the ball popped up behind and Miller caught it at first slip. “I couldn’t talk about it for years,” Thomson said. “It was one of the all‑time low moments in my life.” That match still sits joint-third on the list of closest Test finishes, of which nine of the top 15 came in Ashes contests. The 1998 MCG Test is at No13, another slender England victory – by 13 runs – memorable for Alec Stewart’s first Ashes century, Mike Atherton’s first Test pair and a classic last-innings collapse by Australia. Set an eminently achievable target of 175 the home side fell from 130 for three to 140 for seven and 162 all out with Dean Headley achieving career‑best figures of six for 60, his only Test five-for. The finest English bowling performance in Melbourne, however, came in 1954-55 when Frank “Typhoon” Tyson, described by Don Bradman as “the fastest bowler I have ever seen”, finished the match with a spell of six for 16 in 6.3 eight-ball overs to tilt the series in England’s favour. The Guardian’s Denys Rowbotham wrote that this was a victory “so violent and unexpected … that three hours after its accomplishment the mind and senses have not quite recovered from the shock of it”. Brian Statham took five wickets in the first innings and Rowbotham noted: “The speed of both bowlers was simply too much for the Australian batsmen’s techniques,” a now unlikely sounding occurrence that they have avenged many times since. In March 1977, the MCG hosted a special one‑off match to celebrate the centenary of the first ever Test. The victors, Australia, were the same in each match. Much more remarkably, England’s margin of defeat in both games was 45 runs. There was some drama along the way, though: Australia were skittled out for 138 on the first day, with the opener Rick McCosker’s dismissal particularly unusual: he mistimed a hook and was hit in the face by a Bob Willis bouncer, which not only broke his jaw but the ball also dropped on to his stumps. Richie Benaud opined: “There has never been a more disastrous day for Australian cricket in the 100 years the game has been fought between the two countries,” but the following morning Dennis Lillee took six wickets as England were bowled out for 95. In the second innings three Australians scored fifties and Rod Marsh hit an unbeaten 110, while McCosker, swathed in bandages, unexpectedly returned at No10 to hit a doughty 25. England’s target was 463 – 60 more than the record successful chase at the time in Tests. Derek Randall made 174, in terms of balls faced the longest England innings in Melbourne, and at 346 for four the improbable was suddenly possible. Randall’s innings proved in vain but was unforgettable (though for sheer endurance Bob Cowper’s 12‑and‑a‑half‑hour triple century in a draw in 1966 puts it to shame). The MCG was Shane Warne’s home ground and it was where he took his 150th, 350th and 700th Test wickets. The last of these was a particularly emotional moment, coming in December 2006 soon after he had announced his retirement from international cricket. “There are some special days that happen in your life and some special things that happen and that is definitely one of them,” he said. “The birth of your children, getting married, playing your first Test, they’re pretty special. From an individual point of view that’s got to be one of the best days I’ve ever had.” Another came at the same ground 12 years previously when Warne claimed his only Test hat-trick as England, chasing an unlikely target of 388, were bowled out for 92. It was the MCG’s fifth Test hat-trick, all taken in pursuit of the Ashes, but the first for more than 90 years. The one Englishman on that list is Willie Bates, another spinner, whose performance in 1883 must rank among the finest in Melbourne: coming in at No8 in the first innings he scored 55, the second-best score of the match, and he then took seven wickets in both Australia innings, including a hat-trick in their first knock. On another tour of Australia five years later, Bates was struck in the face by the ball during a nets session, the injury leaving him with vision so badly affected that he never played first-class cricket again. He died, aged 44, 12 years later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/22/west-ham-newcastle-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T18:19:35Z","webTitle":"West Ham United v Newcastle United: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/west-ham-newcastle-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/22/west-ham-newcastle-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"West Ham United v Newcastle United: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"West Ham have climbed out of the bottom three after picking up seven points from their past three games and another win against Newcastle United at the London Stadium will bolster the belief they were right to hire David Moyes.

It happened in the way that these things now happen; courtesy of wildlife enthusiast Jennifer Garrett and a photograph taken by Anna Francis, an image of said spikes, vicious-looking things firmly attached along whole branches, began to circulate on Twitter. Cue – to my mind – justified outrage. If modifying nature in order to inflict harm on animals going about their ordinary animal business is not bad karma, I don’t know what is. Before too long, the creator of the spikes, David Jones, was on Radio 4, defending the Defenders®, as they are called. His line of argument was ingeniously counterintuitive – they are, he said, “the humane solution”. But how could this be so? Well, he pointed out, better than being shot (not by him, I should add, but by notional pest control services). He knew, he added, of a manor house with a tree in which had been counted no fewer than 32 pigeons. 32! (Is that a lot? If you need four and twenty blackbirds simply to make a pie, and if blackbirds are roughly the size of pigeons, it doesn’t sound like a full-on avian invasion.) Being poked with a spike is undoubtedly better than being shot. But it does indicate somewhat stunted aspirations. Could there be a third way? I propose not one solution but a trio for the residents whose cars are being protected from pigeon excrement: they could purchase a waterproof car cover (there’s one for £26.99 at Argos, and if you get a wiggle on, it could probably still end up under a loved one’s tree tomorrow); they could fill a bucket with soapy water and look for a scout on a bob-a-job week; or they could chill out. After all, what manner of person drifts off to sleep thinking: “I may have contributed, quite literally, to driving the birds from the trees, but at least my BMW 4 Series Coupé will be spotless for my weekend drive to Chipping Campden?” However, good though it might be that these bird-botherers have come to public attention – indeed, a petition is now on the go demanding their removal – there is the awkward fact of their having been in situ for a considerable time. What was happening in the leafy suburb of Clifton that rendered its inhabitants, not all, presumably, car-fetishisers unable to cope with the basic universal truth of animal digestion, silent on the matter? Perhaps they weren’t; perhaps there have been all manner of protests only now being transmitted to a wider audience. But as we look around us – from spikes in doorways and armrests on benches to prevent anyone reclining on them to campaigners and charities gathering more stories of distress and disorientation on the streets and appealing more desperately for our help, we might examine more closely our concept of hospitality. It is not, clearly, only a matter of the food, drink and company we offer to visitors, nor even the conviction with which we support measures to improve the circumstances of, for example, displaced people or those living in poverty. It is also about noticing; about seeing, one day, that a tree has sprouted sharp, uncomfortable prongs and wondering why; about registering, as you make your final Christmas preparations, that more than a year after the government agreed to open our borders to nearly 500 unaccompanied child refugees, the first two have just arrived. It is also about realising what a broader idea of hospitality might be; whether, for instance, it accepts that a man who makes spikes to keep birds off trees would indeed prefer that to them being shot and is carrying out the work that he has been asked to, for reasons that make sense to those with a different view of the matter. Not just hospitality, in other words, but generosity – a trust in others’ good faith and a belief that they are doing their best. The Greeks, as the phrase goes, have a word for it: xenia, the courtesy and friendship you extend to those you don’t know and that is returned to you by them. We could look at almost any part of our lives and wish that there were evidence of more – even any – xenia. I think of it every time I walk past a nearby block of flats sporting a notice that reads “Private property: no loitering”. The pavement isn’t private property, I reason, and what counts as loitering? Then I remember that I’m not the one being kept awake at night by loiterers who surely can’t be entirely imaginary. It is easier to quarrel over the colour of passports than it is to hold the Home Office to account over its policies towards immigrants and asylum seekers. It is easier to direct your anger at Nigel Farage, or to Momentum, or even to the impotent, frothing headline writers of the Daily Mail, so obsessed with rooting out traitors and malcontents, than it is to think about what will move us away from this painful, zero sum game of mistrust and accusation. The culture of denunciation rather than disagreement is a dangerous one. There are situations – of abuses of power, of corruption, of violence, many of which we have seen this year – that require denunciation, in which anger is a proper response and anything less is a form of appeasement to oppressors. But there is also, surely, a way that we might adopt the basic principles of xenia – offering support, showing friendship, expecting it in return – that might free us from thinking the worst, narrowing our options, cutting off those who might help us to see the world from a different perspective. This is immensely pious and we fear piety – or virtue-signalling, as we now call it. I’ll take the risk and hope it will save me from shouting at a screen, terminally furious and frustrated, unable to change a damn thing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/27/what-is-the-best-christmas-movie-muppets-google-autocomplete","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T08:00:12Z","webTitle":"What is the best Christmas movie?

You asked Google – here’s the answer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ah, the eternal festive question. The one that shakes loved ones out of the cosy harmony of a turkey coma and into a sherry-fuelled yelling match. It’s no great surprise that we’re so fiercely protective of our favourites. Often they are bound up with our happiest memories – childhood Christmas Eves waiting for Santa; Sundays on friends’ sofas sipping mulled wine; crying at sentimental slush with the one that magicked your cynicism away. They mean a lot. Plus, they span such a broad stylistic spectrum that there’s arguably a “best Christmas movie” for every age group, mood and hangover stage. You just have to pick from the right category – black-and-whites for Sunday nights, mindless comedies for Boxing Day etc. So to pick up the ultimate accolade, a has a lot of boxes to tick. For a start, there needs to be a heartwarming lesson that helps to transform our hero. It should bring the whole family together. (Because when else do you have four generations in one room, all desperate for the sweet respite of a TV zone-out session?) The music should be an essential part of your festive playlist. And call me a stickler, but it should be set at Christmas. So with that in mind, let’s pit some festive favourites against my Scroogely stringent criteria… The old classic It’s comforting to think that even 70-odd years ago, before the pressure of Instagramming umpteen pumpkin spiced lattes arose, people were still finding Christmas a bit much. Which could well explain the enduring popularity of Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life. Yes it was nominated for five Oscars, and stars the great James Stewart, but it is the film’s message – that we are loved, and our lives matter more than we could imagine – that makes it one of the best. Not the very best, though. However many times you repeat “golden age of cinema”, I’m afraid there are few teenagers willing to sit through a black-and-white lesson in perspective. Honourable mention: Holiday Inn – Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby and the first outing for White Christmas. The schmaltz-fest If you spend December welling up at supermarket adverts and hugging everyone in sight, your top pick is probably Love Actually – the film hell-bent on cramming as much love (and as many national treasures) as possible into two hours. It has important lessons aplenty (girls love drummers), and since it is set during Advent, it packs in the festive tropes. There’s a nativity play, the nightmare of secretly shopping for your receptionist while your wife’s lurking … and that’s where Love Actually loses the top spot. Because in among the love, there’s also a fair bit of crappy behaviour. Turns out, I’d rather not watch a man cracking on to his best friend’s new wife, or a brilliant woman accepting life with a philandering husband. I know, bad things happen. But isn’t Christmas the one time we can all pretend that people are good, things end happily, and we’re not about to be plunged into a nuclear winter? Honourable mention: The Holiday – Jack Black tickles the ivories, a lonely old guy gets his mojo back, and Jude Law plays a decent human being (almost) convincingly. The screwball comedy For some, Christmas is all about the fun. Office parties, ridiculous jumpers, a friend’s transformation from shrinking violet to Enforcer of Charades. And there are plenty of films to help you get your silly on – so many, indeed, that this category is topped by two films: parentless high-jinks fantasy Home Alone; and Elf, which sees Will Ferrell, well, Will Ferrelling about as Buddy, a Santa’s helper transplanted to New York. Both teach their characters about the importance of family, but – aside from the opening track on John Williams’s Home Alone score – there’s not much for your festive playlist. Near misses. Honourable mention: Scrooged – Bill Murray as a vile TV exec and modern-day Ebenezer. The wild card When you’ve overdosed on Christmas spirit, Die Hard is your best bet. Totally justifiable as festive viewing since it’s set at a Christmas work do (albeit one caught up in a terrorist siege), it’s a welcome antidote to all the syrup. And let’s face it, nothing says Christmas like the message “now I have a machine gun, ho, ho, ho” written in blood on a dead guy’s jumper. But I can’t give it the top spot because there’s no uplifting lesson – other than the fact that your lame office party could have been much, much worse. Top marks for inventive ways to make it snow, though. Honourable mention: Trading Places – Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy are the perfect double act as a yuppie and a street hustler who switch lives over Christmas. The ‘Oh … this’ll do’ Oliver!, The Wizard of Oz, The Wrong Trousers (insert Julie Andrews). I’m talking about the films that have nothing to do with Christmas other than the fact that they’re on, ad nauseam, every December. If one of these is your favourite, I’m afraid it’s because you’ve been subject to a sort of festive water torture and have finally broken. Honourable mention: Oh … anything. As long as you’ve seen it before, and there’s a cheese board within reach. The grown-up cartoon Disney’s Frozen may be filmic kiddy crack, but its intergenerational jokes, progressive characters and empowerment anthem Let It Go have made it a hit with just about everyone. It also has two transforming protagonists, two cheering messages – “be yourself” and “if in doubt, try love”, and a multi-platinum soundtrack. But it’s not actually set at Christmas, and that just won’t do. Honourable mention: The Nightmare Before Christmas – Tim Burton’s gorgeous, ghoulish stop-motion animation. And so, the winner is ... Get ready to go at it in the comments, because my top pick isn’t an Oscar winner or a box-office smash. It’s The Muppet Christmas Carol. This film has it all. There’s one of the best hero transformations in the history of culture, let alone the festive film annals, and an absolute belter of a soundtrack. I defy you to listen to One More Sleep ’Til Christmas without feeling a shiver of childhood excitement. Jim Henson’s furry miscreants are their usual charming, goofy selves, meaning uninitiated little ones will be as enchanted as grandparents who remember them from the 50s. And Scrooge is played by Michael Caine. Not just any old Caine, either. But Michael Caine just before the Michael Caine renaissance of the late 90s. There he is, defrosting his Oscar-winning acting chops via a little sing-song with Kermie. But the biggest reason for this film’s victory is that it will swell your heart like no other. Listen to the ghost of Christmas present singing that “Wherever you find love, it feels like Christmas”; watch Scrooge shower his neighbours with kindness, and marvel as they return it tenfold – I guarantee that, just for a moment, you’ll feel like us humans aren’t such a bad bunch after all. Runner-up: Miracle on 34th Street – the 1994 version – because Richard Attenborough is the most perfect Father Christmas the world will ever know (apart from the real one, of course). • Lucinda Everett is an arts writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/31/arborealists-art-trees-2017-into-woods-trees-photography-illustration-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"The Arborealists: The Art of Trees 2017; Into the Woods: Trees in Photography/ Trees in Illustration – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/31/arborealists-art-trees-2017-into-woods-trees-photography-illustration-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/31/arborealists-art-trees-2017-into-woods-trees-photography-illustration-review","fields":{"headline":"The Arborealists: The Art of Trees 2017; Into the Woods: Trees in Photography/ Trees in Illustration – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The Arborealists are a loose collective of artists who like to paint trees. They came together in 2013, though at whose behest, exactly, I’m unable to say: not only is the catalogue that accompanies their first London show one of the most confusing such documents ever written, but on the afternoon of my visit there is no information on its walls either – not even the names of the artists (though I’m told this will soon be rectified). What I can say is that they take some of their inspiration from the Brotherhood of Ruralists, the 70s anti-modernist group of which Peter Blake and David Inshaw were probably the most famous members: their instincts are, in other words, broadly Romantic, though this doesn’t preclude the possibility of abstraction in their work. Challenging as an exhibition like this is to review effectively (it includes the disparate work of some 22 Arborealists), as a tonic for calm it works like a dream, the artistic equivalent of the Japanese practice of forest bathing. Yes, it has its sinister corners, not least Joanna Greenhill’s 2015 film Grey Cranham, in which a pair of headlights appear in the darkness at the edge of a forest (it plays on a loop in the basement); and a couple of the canvases, all twirling roots and amber halos, do bring to mind, rather unfortunately, the covers of old prog rock albums. But for the most part, the room is inspiritingly lush, a verdant realm in a more than usually urban patch of London. Even more cheering, some of these artists can really paint. I can’t remember the last time I found so much skill in so modish a private gallery. Hannah Brown’s Victoria Park 7 (oil on marine plywood and oak, 2015) is masterly in its balance of light and shade, the merest hint of autumn – and perhaps something nastier and more melancholy, too – in the afternoon shadow that creeps over a pond and towards a group of sun-dappled limes. So, too, is Golden Birch (oil on gesso board, 2016) by Ffiona Lewis, a painting so gorgeously illuminated – the canopy it depicts is not green, but a dazzling sunflower yellow – I found myself closing my eyes for a second as if to bask in its radiance. For the artist, trees are an infinite subject, one that embraces not only light and colour, but heady symbolism, too (the tree of life, the tree of knowledge). From a distance they may resemble cathedrals; close up, they’re cities teeming with activity. Blaze Cyan’s monochrome etching Wellington Woods II has a feeling of distant rafters, the tops of the trunks of his Scots pines aimed vertiginously at a blurry sky, while Michael Porter’s mulchy Forest Floor (oil and acrylic on canvas, 2011) zooms in microscopically on bark and fungus: think Richard Dadd’s Fairy Feller minus the satyrs and centaurs. To stare at this painting for an extended period is to lose yourself, to be both giant and elf simultaneously. A few of the Arborealists bring man explicitly into the equation, sometimes to brilliant effect. Jemma Appleby’s charcoal drawing Maxwell Stein (2013), for instance, depicts a famous bungalow by Frank Lloyd Wright in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. But while the architect intended the building and its grounds, designed for two teachers, to be an affordable utopia, in Appleby’s telling, the looming trees, now fully mature, suggest encroachment, the loss of certain cherished ideals. The Arborealists exhibition has a pair of nifty, if entirely coincidental, companions at the V&amp;A, where there are currently two shows marking the 800th anniversary of the Charter of the Forest, sealed by Henry III, and the launch last month by the Woodland Trust of a new Charter for Trees, Woods and People. The first is titled Trees in Photography, and includes images by Ansel Adams, Gustave le Gray and Alfred Stieglitz. The second is Trees in Illustration, which you’ll find in an obscure corridor beyond the jewellery galleries, and which you’ll probably have to yourself for as long as you choose to linger there. Not that this is a bad thing. Among the treasures on display are drawings, etchings and watercolours by Paul Nash, Beatrix Potter, Arthur Rackham, Eric Ravilious, EH Shepard and Margaret Mary Tempest (the artist best known for illustrating Alison Uttley’s Little Grey Rabbit books). I love looking at William Russell Flint’s intensely realised illustration (for a 1911 edition of Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur) of la Belle Isoude preparing to impale herself on a sword attached to the trunk of a plum tree (she has been misinformed of the death of her lover, Sir Tristram, but will shortly be saved by her husband, King Mark); its gnarled, twisted contours seem to reflect all of her agony, the ghastly churning in her guts. I’m happy, too, to see George Edward Mackley’s engravings for Forestry Commission guides, made between 1958 and 1961. What work there is here: each one is so detailed, every oak leaf, every fern frond, clearly visible to the eye. Most of all, though, I’m taken with John Morton-Sale’s 1933 frontispiece for a novel called A Country Holiday by Arthur Davenport. A pair of teenage boys, whose backs we see only in silhouette, contemplate woodland so thick, barely any light penetrates; the very air they breathe seems to be mossy and brown. Are they lost? Or are they trapped? When the book was published, this strikingly atmospheric watercolour was accompanied by the line: “The silence that followed was broken by the sudden snapping of twig.” But such is Morton-Sale’s achievement that his picture maintains its eldritch power even when it appears without any caption. Taking in the scene, I fancy I can almost hear that alarming crack, and just for a moment a sudden chill creeps across my forearms. • The Arborealists: The Art of Trees 2017 is at Bermondsey Project Space, London, until 13 January Into the Woods: Trees in Photography/ Trees in Illustration are at the V&amp;A, London, until 22 April/23 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/31/matthew-bourne-cinderella-observer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"Matthew Bourne’s Cinderella review – still having a ball","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/31/matthew-bourne-cinderella-observer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/31/matthew-bourne-cinderella-observer-review","fields":{"headline":"Matthew Bourne’s Cinderella review – still having a ball","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Matthew Bourne’s latest revival of Cinderella is an ambitious production, even by the choreographer-director’s own elevated standards. Created in 1997, the piece is set in the London blitz, to a soundtrack which overlays Prokofiev’s famous ballet score with the overhead grumble of Heinkel and Dornier bombers, and the terrifying whistle of their falling cargo. Darkly atmospheric designs by Lez Brotherston further charge the piece with danger. Life is precarious, death strikes at random. Cinderella (Ashley Shaw), the daughter of a buttoned-up widower, is a slave to the whims of her stepfamily, and in particular of her spoilt drama queen of a stepmother (the scene-stealing Michela Meazza). Cinderella is also required to minister to her daft stepsisters and horrible clumping stepbrothers, one of whom has a fetishistic thing for her shoes. Into this dingy mise-en-scène stumbles a wounded and traumatised RAF pilot, Harry (Andrew Monaghan). He and Cinderella are swiftly smitten, and embark on their respective transformative journeys. Monaghan strikes a fine balance between chivalry and damaged vulnerability, and dances with a suitably airy dash. Shaw gives a beguiling performance as the mousy, put-upon Cinders, and her yearning duet with a tailor’s dummy (echoing the broomstick dance in Frederick Ashton’s 1948 Cinderella ballet) is as enchanting as it’s funny. I’ve never been wholly convinced of the character of the Angel (Liam Mower), who like the Fairy Godmother, leads Cinderella to eventual happiness. Mower is a highly accomplished dancer, but something in his silver-suited persona strikes a false, anachronistic note. The ballroom scene to which he guides Cinderella, here a dream sequence set in the ill-fated Café de Paris (bombed with much loss of life in 1941), is cleverly imagined but seems to go on for ever, with consequent loss of tension. Prokofiev’s score is sumptuous, and shot through with haunting darkness, but for long periods in Act 2 there seems to be more of it than Bourne knows what to do with. This matters less than it might because the work is so visually absorbing. The blackout-curtained interior of Cinderella’s family house is contrasted with the defiant glitter of the Café de Paris; the streets are a dreamscape of bombed-out tenements and teetering masonry; gasworks and barrage balloons are silhouetted against livid skies. Bourne has never been a man for messages, but Cinderella’s theme of love lost and found during wartime has a comforting resonance in our own anxious era. • Matthew Bourne’s Cinderella is at Sadler’s Wells.

Rejoice!","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This is the season of peace and goodwill to all men. All men, at least, who share the same agenda as the speaker. Christianity – any religion, really – is an effort to gather as many men as possible under a shared set of beliefs, values and priorities. That’s why religions are always in competition with each other. That’s why, internally, they’re always undergoing schisms. All ideologies have this in common, even liberalism, which exhorts everyone above all to value individual freedom. Things get tricky, though, when one individual freedom contradicts another. Which happens a lot. So a highly liberalised society such as ours is a dynamic maelstrom of hotly erupting trickinesses. People tend to point the finger for the obviousness of this at social media, because it makes the tendency so very visible. My own belief is that this is “blaming the messaging service”. I didn’t hear any edition of the Today programme this week, due to deciding recently that it harshed what little zen I possess too early in the morning. But thanks to the internet I did get to hear about one controversy the radio show had unleashed, in a tweet from the National Secular Society: “We’ve written to the BBC over last Thursday’s episode of the Today programme, which amounted to a PR exercise for the C of E.” As a Scottish secularist, I feel the society’s pain. And yet … just turn it off, National Secular Society, and go about your business. It’s literally Christianmas, FFS. Lump it. Peace and goodwill to all men. And all women. And all the gender non-binaries out there. That stuff. But, no. They have written a letter to the BBC: “The bias and deference towards the Church of England demonstrated in this show suggests a ‘cosy relationship’ has developed between the BBC and the church, which undermines public confidence in the BBC’s commitment to impartiality.” A cosy relationship “has developed”? Eh? What does the NSS chief executive, Stephen Evans, imagine? That 50 years ago the BBC wouldn’t have dreamed of being bold enough to slot in the archbishop of Canterbury for 15 minutes at Christmas, but has in recent decades been emboldened by the Tudor cult’s increasing monopolisation of the levers of power? The only reason for giving the C of E any attention at all these days is because you can’t help feeling a bit sorry for it. Bless it. Cue outrage. Yes, I know, the Church of England still plays a disproportionately large part in the UK’s constitutional structure, especially considering that it’s now remarked on only when it manages to hit the headlines with a thrilling conference about the trouble with homophobia in the ex-colonies. Or the daring suggestion that poverty is rotten. But here’s the thing: the BBC’s “commitment to impartiality” is a delusion, and in having a C of E fest at Christmas the BBC is doing what it says on its tin. The British Broadcasting Corporation is entirely partial, and is conceived as such. It’s British. It sees everything through a prismatic lens marked UK – or, more specifically, England. The myth of BBC impartiality is just a sisyphean rock that the corporation and its staff toil over hourly in pursuit of that Great British tradition of self-censorship in the face of anything a bit nasty that probably ought to be faced up to. It’s this “impartiality” that makes Radio 4 sound, most of the time, like it’s being broadcast from 1952. In a good way, mostly. Sometimes. When I’m Sorry, I’ve Haven’t A Clue’s on. But it limits the organisation hugely. Pseudo-impartiality both pampers the content of the BBC and provides ammunition for anyone who wishes to pursue their own agenda in criticism of it. Is the BBC biased to the left? Is it biased to the right? Well, that depends on where it stands compared with where you stand, in your hard-won aura of individual freedom. In short, BBC impartiality is yet one more unhealthy national mirage. Don’t get me wrong. I love the BBC. I love liberalism. I love secularism. I even quite love Britain. But these things all have flaws, contradictions and, sometimes, impossibilities. You don’t get points for loving perfection. Love is hard work. It requires the heavy lifting of constantly remembering and diligently adjusting for the fact that not everyone is like you. Which is undoubtedly a good thing, unless you happen to be, for example, Jesus Christ himself. Ha! And so back to Christmas. Have a good one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/22/what-next-for-spain-and-catalonia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T17:46:41Z","webTitle":"What next for Spain and Catalonia? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/what-next-for-spain-and-catalonia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/22/what-next-for-spain-and-catalonia","fields":{"headline":"What next for Spain and Catalonia?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The victory of pro-independence parties in Catalonia’s election (Report, 22 December) is a slap in the face for Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. Those seeking independence won enough votes to secure a majority in the regional parliament and give new momentum to their political struggle for independence from Spain. The three pro-independence forces together took 70 seats, two above a majority required in the Catalan parliament. It was a truly amazing result given the circumstances, with the regional government removed and Catalan parliament dissolved following the first independence referendum in October – a referendum that witnessed extensive violence when Mr Rajoy deployed riot police to try and prevent people voting. With direct rule imposed by Madrid and Catalonia’s political leaders in jail and exile, Mr Rajoy was clearly doing all he could to staunch the pro-independence movement. Mr Rajoy has become Spain’s answer to Theresa May. He gambled in calling an early election to end the political crisis, a move that has clearly backfired. Against all the odds, the pro-unionist coalition of parties was defeated by pro-independence parties, and Mr Rajoy’s ruling Popular party was left with only three seats from 11 held in the previous parliament. The Spanish government, which initially staunchly resisted talks with the Catalan government, must now look to sit down with it and try and resolve a situation which, despite Madrid’s best attempts, is simply not going away. Alex Orr Edinburgh • Will Rajoy now take the path of dialogue rather than confrontation? And will other European leaders put pressure on Spain to go ahead with reform of the Spanish constitution as an alternative to Catalan secession? The key clause in the 1978 constitution referring to Spain as a unitary state was the army’s price for staying out of politics and agreeing to the transition to democracy.

What’s working well with your class? What should you abandon in favour of another approach? What do you want to achieve this year? We asked readers for the tips that have made them happier and more effective at school in 2017, and were inundated with responses. Here are a few of our favourites. Working with students I asked my class to mark my teaching I have two hugely passive year 8 classes, and no matter what content I delivered or how I arranged their seats, they seemed to remain passive. A passive class is probably harder to manage than an unruly class – the silence can be scary and daunting. You’re constantly assessing their learning and telling bad jokes in the hope of even one reaction. Enough was enough. So I asked my pupils to mark my teaching. I created a quiz on SurveyMonkey and included questions about what sort of activities they would like. I took on their feedback and implemented it into lessons. Success! My passive class was now enthusiastic. Jasmeet Kaur, RE teacher, London I shake each child’s hand before lessons After reading When the Adults Change, Everything Changes by Paul Dix, I started shaking each child’s hand as they came into lessons. Something as simple as greeting them individually has totally changed the atmosphere in my class. Children went from running in and chatting to walking in calmly and sitting down, ready to start learning. I’m slowly introducing other ideas from the book too. Shannon Poulter, primary school teacher, Bedford I encourage my best students to help struggling classmates I’ve found student learning has vastly improved by asking them to help others who are struggling in lessons. Some initially asked why they should, but I reassured them they’d get better marks – I’d be watching, and teaching others can help us learn better. Now a struggling student will raise their hand and two top students will jump up to run over and help. They speak the same language and understand each other better. They are all happy and engaged, and I often don’t have to step in at all. Increasingly I have to remind them to leave at the end of class so I can enjoy my lunch in peace – they all want to stay. Frank Brown, IT teacher, Sydney, Australia Lesson planning I now plan lessons in five minutes The five-minute lesson plan has enabled my preparation time to be more concise and focused. It gives each lesson a clear structure, is easy to follow (especially for teachers who are covering), and there’s still the option of making last-minute changes. It’s helped my work-life balance enormously. I now plan for only a fraction of the time I used to. Cutting down planning time has also meant I have more time for fun at the weekend. Overall, I’m a better, high-spirited and enthusiastic teacher as I now have the energy to turn my plans into fun lessons. Primary school teacher, Kent I’ve found an easy way to keep my students challenged I always give my students a few challenging questions to put in the back of their book. If they complete the task in class they have something to work on without me having to organise something extra for every lesson just in case. Maths teacher I plan a half-term of lessons in advance Having some basis on which to plan most subjects, rather than starting completely from scratch, has been a great help to me. I’ve made great use of the previous year 4 teacher’s planning at my school, adapting her work to suit my interests and the needs of the children I’m teaching. I also make sure each half-term of lessons is planned (albeit not to perfection) in advance in the holidays. I then go back to that each weekend to plan for the week ahead, and tailor it according to the children’s progress. When I go to planning meetings with my mentor, I’m prepared weeks in advance and have enough time to sort out queries before I teach the lesson. Although I’m spending 11 hours a day at school, and up to four hours working at the weekend, I feel completely organised and in control of my teaching. I could not be happier. NQT, London Marking I’ve implemented marking codes Over the summer I devised a list of common “what went wells”, which were all allocated a letter, and a list of common “even better ifs”, which were allocated a number. Students stick this list in the back of their exercise books. When I mark their books I now simply write a code instead of a long-winded explanation. This has saved me so much time I can’t believe it. I can now mark a set of key stage 3 books in 25 to 30 minutes. Before, it would take over an hour. If the codes don’t apply, then of course I give the student individual feedback, but 99.9% of the time there is a code for the job. History teacher, Lincolnshire I mark in class, with the children I recently changed my approach to marking. After a writing exercise in English, for example, I take a group of seven children and I mark with them. We decide together what was great and what could be developed further. The other children do the same in their groups, using codes I’ve given them. The next day, I’ll work with a different group until I’ve made it around the class. I also mix up the children so mixed abilities mark together. The progress and quality of work has been astonishing and my workload has been significantly reduced. Marking is now meaningful, and the children read and respond continuously. Rebecca Pogose, primary teacher, Oxford Work-life balance I get up an hour earlier If you can’t work well in the evenings, get up an hour earlier and work before your day starts. I do this twice a week and it has made me much more organised. I get up, make a cup of tea and have a focused hour before my children even stir. I seem to get more done in the mornings than in the evenings. It doesn’t work for everyone. But if you resent working in the evenings, it’s an easy habit to adopt. And I am not a morning person. Genevieve Nickolls, English teacher, Wales I’ve started saying no more often I’ve toiled away in teaching for the past five years, with no shortage of successes – but I’ve finally grown the confidence to say no. I’ve said no to the senior leadership team, to my head of department (which caused a degree of tension), to parents, and anyone else who placed demands on my time that I was not happy with. It’s really helped me focus on my priorities at work and has allowed me to use my time much more wisely. It’s also proved to be handy advice for my school’s NQTs when they feel overwhelmed. History teacher I take 10 minutes at the start of my day for mindfulness Every day, I take 10 minutes to sit outside my classroom with a large pot of coffee, listening to the mindfulness app Headspace. I’m out there no matter what the weather, and my colleagues respectfully ignore me until I’ve completed it. I end my day with a 9pm work curfew. I also have at least three evenings a week with no work. I have been teaching for 28 years and feel more relaxed now than at any other time of my career.

He benefited from – or perhaps shamelessly exploited – chart rules that count streams and sales of multiple versions of the same song towards its chart placing. Sheeran released six versions of Perfect to aid its chances of getting the festive top spot: the original, an acoustic version, remixes by Robin Schulz and Mike Perry, and two duet versions with A-list names: Beyoncé and Andrea Bocelli. Sheeran also features on the No 2 song, River by Eminem. The rapper scored the Christmas No 1 album for Revival, its commercial fortunes left undented by generally negative reviews. The original version of Perfect is taken from Sheeran’s album ÷, which is the biggest-selling record in the UK this year, and features other enormous hits in Shape of You and Galway Girl. A campaign to get Wham!’s Last Christmas to No 1, 23 years after it was pipped to the top by Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? – and one year on from the death of George Michael – didn’t quite succeed. The song reached No 3, with Mariah Carey’s festive perennial All I Want for Christmas Is You at No 4. The era of streaming means that there are numerous other Christmas classics coming back into the charts this year, with the Pogues’ Fairytale of New York at No 7, Band Aid at 12, Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree at 14, and a further 11 festive hits in the top 40.

But the craft has often had a different character outside Europe – notably in African cultures, where looser and more intuitive percussion traditions evolved alongside ceremonies, celebrations, rituals and the expression of emotion. The jazz drummer Sunny Murray, who has died 81, was a particularly free-thinking descendant from those African origins. The American writer Amiri Baraka called him “a conductor of energies”, and Murray’s playing did indeed evoke for many the impressions of restless seas, buffeting winds or the ebbs and flows of feelings, rather than the snap and patter of drummers organising action by playing rudiments. Moreover, Murray did not seek to “accompany” partners in a co-operative way, but instead inhabited a parallel world which other improvisers could enter, wrestle with, find solace in or leave at will. The rise of more loosely structured, freely improvised jazz in America in the 1960s made Murray’s emergence and eventual acceptance possible. In combination with two of free-jazz’s most radical innovators – the pianist Cecil Taylor and the saxophonist Albert Ayler – he became a significant influence on both ensemble improvisation and the rhythmic evolution of solo-jazz phrasing. Murray was born in Idabel, Oklahoma. His father, James, was a preacher and labourer, and his mother, Myrtle (nee Rice), a music-loving domestic worker. Growing up in Philadelphia, Sunny took up the drums at the age of nine. He had a stormy, gang-blighted adolescence in one of the city’s toughest districts, served a two-year sentence at a reformatory, experimented with the trumpet and trombone, and moved to New York in 1956. He found a drumkit abandoned in a club after a police raid, began studying percussion techniques more seriously, supporting himself by working in car-washes and a steel factory (losing part of two fingers in the latter) and by the end of the 1950s was performing with the swing trumpeter Henry “Red” Allen and the saxophonists Rocky Boyd and Jackie McLean. But when he met Taylor, who wanted a less explicitly rhythmic and pulse-rooted approach than was common among drummers at the time, Murray’s creative life was transformed. Inspired by Taylor’s fusion of blistering classical-keyboard virtuosity and wilful experimentation with harmony and improv-narrative shape, and by the drummer Elvin Jones’s tonal range and melting of rudiment-patterns into a lava-like flow, Murray left orthodox jazz behind – and most of his former employers along with it. After their first chance meeting, Murray had to hunt for the reclusive Taylor’s whereabouts in New York. He eventually occupied a loft in the same building – and would play for the pianist while he lay in bed. One day Taylor got up to join him at the piano, and, as Murray related to the writer Val Wilmer, simply said, “I want you to play something like you never played before.” Wilmer reported in her book As Serious As Your Life (1977) that Murray then took three years to fully appreciate that Taylor was drawing him away from time-keeping towards a completely different conception of drumming. He performed with Taylor on the composer Gil Evans’s album Into the Hot (1961), and joined the pianist and his saxophonist Jimmy Lyons on a Scandinavian tour marked by a sensational Taylor-led recording (Nefertiti, the Beautiful One Has Come) at Cafe Montmartre, Copenhagen, in which the sense of a new musical era being born transcended the shortcomings of sound quality. Ayler joined the trip, and Murray worked regularly with him from December 1963. Murray contributed to the volatile Ayler’s most enduring legacy, by playing at his majestically unfettered best in 1964 and 65 on the albums Witches and Devils, Spirits Rejoice, Bells, and Spiritual Unity. Murray began working and recording as a band leader with American free-jazz luminaries including Archie Shepp, Lester Bowie, Roscoe Mitchell and Malachi Favors. DownBeat magazine gave him a New Star award in 1966, but Murray marched to the publication’s offices to burn it because there was no cash attached – a protest at the Cinderella status of adventurous jazz-making that many practitioners readily identified with. Murray worked with a creative mix of European and US musicians after his relocation to Paris in 1968, and in the 1990s he made powerful original music with the free-jazz saxophone improviser Charles Gayle. Murray also struck up a productive relationship with the British saxophonist Tony Bevan and the double bassist John Edwards, documented on the unexpectedly intimate and delicate album The Gearbox Explodes (2006) and the studio session I Stepped Onto a Bee (2010). Strength and intensity at the drumkit were the variables that mattered most to Murray – and he felt convinced in the late 1960s that he was the one drummer capable of conveying the new levels they had then reached in jazz. He was also uncompromising about the pressures he would apply, both to himself and to collaborators. “When this is over,” he said to Wilmer, describing a playing situation with an aspiring young drummer, “he realises that he is in a completely different state of being, confronted with not just the sound of drums but the sound of the crashing of cars and the upheaval of a volcano and the thunder of the skies. He never imagined himself being locked in a room with these kinds of sounds.” Murray is survived by his partner, Isabelle Soumilliard, three sons, James, Haniff and Oforie, and a daughter, Pia, two grandchildren and his half-brother, Conny. • Sunny Murray (James Marcellus Arthur Murray Jr), drummer, born 21 September 1936; died 7 December 2017 • This article was amended on 22 February 2018.

In 2017 there were 23 new bills introduced in 18 states attempting to prohibit the practice of Islamic religious law, or sharia, in US courts. The rash of new bills brings the total number of such legislative efforts since 2010 to 217 in 43 states, according to the Haas Institute at UC Berkeley which monitors the anti-sharia movement. Legal experts point out that the bills are superfluous, as the US constitution is the supreme law of the land and any foreign laws are subservient to it. Sharia itself is less a set of laws than religious guidelines, one of which requires Muslims to be law-abiding according to the rules of whichever country they find themselves. But Elsadig Elsheikh, director of the global justice program at the Haas Institute that carried out the research, said the purpose of the bills was to spread fear about Muslims living in America and to portray them as untrustworthy and out of step with American values. “Even if these bills do not become law they help to subject Muslims to surveillance and other forms of exclusion and discrimination,” he said. Of the 23 bills introduced to state legislatures this year, only two became law – in Arkansas and Texas. Four new states joined the growing list of legislatures where anti-sharia legislation has been attempted: Colorado, Connecticut, North Dakota and Wisconsin. All but one of the bills were introduced by Republicans. The exception was in Idaho where a committee with an unknown party affiliation was behind the move. Heidi Beirich, an expert on anti-Muslim hate groups at the Southern Poverty Law Center, sees the rash of state bills as signs that the provocative language coming out of Trump’s circle is having an impact. “At the state level, the number one push for anti-Muslim activists is anti-sharia bills. It’s a recurrent effort.” Trump himself called for all Muslims to be barred from entering the US when he was a presidential candidate, a sentiment that he has only barely tempered in his drive for a travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries. Several of the individuals he chose as key advisers also have a controversial track record. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist in the White House, once wrote a film script that warned of the country turning into the “Islamic States of America”. The short-lived national security adviser Michael Flynn called Islamism a “vicious cancer” inside all Muslims that has to be “excised”, while former White House aide Sebastian Gorka was once fired by the FBI as a counter-terrorism lecturer for his Islamophobic views. Charles Turner, who is researching a doctoral thesis on anti-Muslim legislation at the University of Utah, said that the plethora of bills had been “enabled by Trump and his close team. This is an expression of rightwing Republicanism that chimes with their populist base.” The anti-sharia movement became a force in the US after 2010 in the wake of the furor over the plan to open a Muslim community center in downtown Manhattan. Islamophobes led by Pamela Geller dubbed it the “Ground Zero mosque” and said it was a “beachhead for Islamic supremacism”. Further fuel was poured on the anti-sharia fire by the Birther movement – with Trump as one of its most prominent advocates – that promulgated the conspiracy theory that President Obama was a Muslim. Since 2010 a concerted network has been created pushing anti-sharia bills in state legislatures. An anti-Muslim lawyer, David Yerushalmi, gave a boost to the efforts by composing draft legislation called the American Laws for American Courts, Alac, that has provided the template for at least 140 of the bills that have been introduced. Most of the recent bills are careful not to refer overtly to sharia or Islam, as to do so would be to expose the legislation to the scrutiny of federal courts on grounds of religious discrimination. Instead, they talk of “foreign laws” being banned in US jurisdictions. None the less, they have the potential to wreak damage. Nikiya Natale, legal director of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that anti-Muslim sentiment was growing in Texas which this year passed its third anti-sharia law. “These laws further marginalize and ostracize the Muslim community. Republicans are playing to their base, particularly in smaller rural white towns, and Trump has made Islamophobia normal, mainstream.” Amid the ongoing push for legislation, observers of the trend see some cause for optimism. The fact that only two of the bills passed out of 23 this year is evidence in itself that the anti-sharia movement is fighting an uphill battle. Many of the most virulent Islamophobes around Trump – notably Bannon, Flynn and Gorka – have all been forced out of the White House. “There’s something heartening coming out of all this,” Beirich said. Given Trump’s controversial leadership, some monitors had expected to see an even greater surge in the number of bills in 2017 which increased from 14 last year but did not reach the 2011 peak in the wake of the Manhattan controversy of 56 pieces of legislation, according to the Haas Institute. “Given the support coming from the highest office in the land, we expected to see an even greater increase in anti-sharia legislation at state level,” Elsheikh said. He added that a combination of legal challenges and popular protest not least by Muslims themselves was dampening the impact of the Islamophobe movement. “There has been a healthy mobilization of the Muslim community who are becoming more engaged and less apologetic, especially second-generation Muslims. They are more determined to demand their rights,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/22/manchester-united-ryan-sessegnon-prepare-bid-fulham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T15:08:01Z","webTitle":"Manchester United prepare £25m bid for Fulham teenager Ryan Sessegnon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/manchester-united-ryan-sessegnon-prepare-bid-fulham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/22/manchester-united-ryan-sessegnon-prepare-bid-fulham","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United prepare £25m bid for Fulham teenager Ryan Sessegnon","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester United are preparing an opening offer of initial £25m for Fulham teenager Ryan Sessegnon, with José Mourinho prepared to allow Luke Shaw to leave Old Trafford in order to sign the England youth international. Sessegnon, 17, who finished as joint-top scorer at the European Under-19 Championship in June with three goals, has been tracked by United’s scouts for some time and has also attracted interest from Tottenham and Real Madrid. The European champions have watched the defender on several occasions this season and are understood to be monitoring his situation, while Spurs had a bid potentially worth more than £20m with add-ons rejected in the summer. Despite usually operating as a left-back, Sessegnon is also capable of operating further up the field and has gained a reputation as one of English football’s brightest attacking talents. He became the became the first 17-year-old to score a hat-trick in the top four divisions of English football since Dele Alli when he inspired Fulham’s 5-4 victory over Sheffield United in November. Fulham have indicated that it would take a bid in excess of £30m to tempt them into selling their prized asset, with manager Slavisa Jokanovic admitting on Thursday that he is unsure whether Sessegnon will remain at Craven Cottage. “In this moment, I am not thinking of being without him for the season, but it is not under my control,” he said. “All the questions are what the value of this player is, but myself, as a coach, I prefer to stay with the more important players for the competition that is ahead of us, but on the other side I can understand the business side too. If we want to be competitive we must keep our important players.” Should United have a bid accepted, Tottenham are expected to renew their approach but have also enquired about Shaw, who has fallen out of favour at Old Trafford under Mourinho. The 22-year-old has played just 328 minutes in the Premier League so far this season having joined United from Southampton in 2014 for £30m, although any move for Sessegnon is not believed to be contingent on him leaving. Tottenham are also interested in signing Sessegnon’s twin brother, Steven, who also plays for Fulham and starred for England’s Under-17s in their World Cup victory earlier this year. Along with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, Mauricio Pochettino also retains an interest in Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha but Crystal Palace are adamant that the £50m-rated forward will not be sold in January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/22/moscow-clash-exposes-tory-dilemma-over-russian-meddling-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T15:57:03Z","webTitle":"Moscow clash exposes Tory dilemma over Russian meddling claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/22/moscow-clash-exposes-tory-dilemma-over-russian-meddling-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/22/moscow-clash-exposes-tory-dilemma-over-russian-meddling-claims","fields":{"headline":"Moscow clash exposes Tory dilemma over Russian meddling claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s efforts to stabilise UK relations with Russia have become an increasingly difficult balancing act due to the continuing allegations of Moscow’s interference in British democracy. The government’s natural instinct is to go all out in denouncing Russia’s cyber disinformation war, but at the same time the Tories cannot go so far as to suggest the credibility of the EU referendum result in 2016 was tarnished by Russian interference. The dilemma was exposed during the extraordinary press conference given by Johnson and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow on Friday. The mood turned spikiest when Lavrov denied claims the Kremlin had interfered in democratic elections using online propaganda and trolling and accused Johnson of being a “hostage” of untrue western narratives. When he claimed Johnson himself had confirmed Russia had not interfered in the UK’s election and the referendum, Johnson interrupted to clarify: “Not successfully.” Johnson said had Russia been successful “that would have been an entirely different matter”. The suggestion that Russian interference would matter more if it had produced a different democratic outcome has in recent weeks become the official UK government line. Johnson stuck to the narrative at the press conference and in an interview with the Russian media on the eve of his visit. It is self-evident that propaganda is less significant if it is ineffective, such as being confined to a few Facebook posts. Equally, many Eurosceptic MPs said in a Commons debate on Thursday that it was absurd to ascribe disillusioned fishermen voting leave to a Russian tweet. But for many MPs from all political wings Russian interventions in the Baltics, Balkans or major European elections are seen as disturbing – even if they do not “succeed”. Even the impeccably Eurosceptic Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin questioned the government’s purist criteria for success, pointing out that if an intervention provoked consternation and the questioning of the democratic process then the Russians had had a measure of a success. The culture select committee chairman, Damian Collins, said an intent by a foreign power to change a democratic outcome could be as disturbing as its success in doing so. He pointed out that many users of social media platforms “do not understand the way in which they can be targeted and the reason they receive the information that they receive. That creates confusing echo chambers where people are not exposed to a plurality of views but are systematically targeted – not just with fake news but with hyper-partisan content. It is being done for propaganda reasons and political reasons by foreign actors. If we do not see that as a threat to the democratic institutions of this country and a threat to the western way of life, we are deluding ourselves.” The question remains whether the UK government could be doing more to expose the scale of the problem rather than leaving the task to ill-equipped parliamentary inquiries. It is tempting, as the Russian embassy in the UK daily contends, to see concern about Russian fake news as the product of a paranoid cold war mindset. The UK has many reasons to want to work with Russia, notably to try to understand its ambitions in the Middle East, especially for a Syria peace conference. Intelligence cooperation is currently at the bare minimum. But EU ambassadors based in the UK, sympathetic to the British government, are unambiguous about Vladimir Putin’s hostility towards the west and want the UK to use its huge cyber capabilities to expose what the Russians have been doing to try to spread division and ambiguity in western societies. Concern about the authenticity of the Brexit result should not be a reason to hold back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/19/public-death-sentences-people-china-desperation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T06:44:39Z","webTitle":"Public death sentences for 10 people show China's desperation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/19/public-death-sentences-people-china-desperation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/19/public-death-sentences-people-china-desperation","fields":{"headline":"Public death sentences for 10 people show China's desperation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A public trial in a Chinese sports stadium at which 10 people were sentenced to death shows the desperation of government officials, experts have said, as negative reaction spread online. Thousands – including children in their school uniforms – crowded into a stadium at the weekend to watch 10 people be sentenced in a public trial in Lufeng, southern China. The accused were then immediately taken away and executed. Officially, China has banned public trials outside courtrooms, according to regulations from the judiciary, prosecutors’ office and police. But local authorities are still meting out their own brutal brand of justice. “There’s still a disconnect between elites at the national level who tend to be more liberal and want reform, and local officials who want harsh punishments,” said Michelle Miao, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “There’s still a lot of support in local governments for these type of public trials.” The aggressive measure is a sign that local authorities are frustrated and desperate in their fight against drugs, Miao said. Indeed, the public sentencing was held in one of the country’s most notorious crystal meth manufacturing areas. But given the attention of the most recent public trials, Miao expects officials in Beijing will try to rein in the practice, especially as reactions to the display have been largely negative. The Beijing News, a liberal-leaning newspaper under a state radio broadcaster, published a commentary titled: “Stop staging the drama of public death sentences.” “As the most severe sentence, the death penalty must have a minimum amount of humanitarianism,” the opinion piece said. “It is necessary to prevent personal humiliation and other extrajudicial punishments, otherwise it is a serious shame on the serious rule of law.” Many posts on Chinese social media were more forceful in their condemnations, with some saying public trials “showed a fair legal system had completely vanished”. “If the morals of our time are already so depraved that we thirst for public sentencing, then we can try public executions too,” wrote another commenter on a Chinese version of Twitter. But others supported the practice, arguing that convicted criminals had no right to be treated with respect because of the harm they had caused. Over the past decade, China has attempted to reduce the use of capital punishment, beginning with the requirement in 2007 that all death sentences be reviewed and approved by the Supreme People’s Court. The court has advocated a strategy of “kill fewer, kill cautiously” and reportedly rejected about 10% of death sentences in a single year. China’s highest court approved the death sentences carried out in Lufeng, according to local media reports. The government has also reduced the number of offences punishable by death, although China maintains the death penalty for a host of non-violent offences, such as drug trafficking and economic crimes. “Drug-related offences do not meet the threshold of the ‘most serious crimes’, to which the use of the death penalty must be restricted under international law,” said William Nee, a researcher at Amnesty International. “China should thus immediately end the use of death penalty for drug crimes, which is an abhorrent and bloody stain on China’s human rights record.” China executes more people than all other countries combined and last year the country carried out about 2,000 death sentences, according to estimates by the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights organisation based in the United States. That figure is down from roughly 12,000 executions in 2002."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/20/the-chink-in-the-me-too-armour-morgan-spurlock-and-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T00:47:10Z","webTitle":"The chink in the Me Too armour: Morgan Spurlock and a self-fulfilling prophecy | Ruby Hamad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/the-chink-in-the-me-too-armour-morgan-spurlock-and-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/the-chink-in-the-me-too-armour-morgan-spurlock-and-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy","fields":{"headline":"The chink in the Me Too armour: Morgan Spurlock and a self-fulfilling prophecy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It has long been a wry joke in progressive circles that satirical website the Onion is losing its raison d’être, as the line between reality and parody gets increasingly blurred. And so it is with the Onion’s spinoff ClickHole, which presents satire in clickbait form. About one month ago, ClickHole published one of its most astute pieces ever, As A Male Feminist, I Think I’d Absolutely Crush It If I Ever Had To Publicly Apologise For Sexual Misconduct. It is especially biting satire, targeting both men who treat feminism as a career move and online culture that praises men for the most rudimentary of feminist sentiments: “I would immediately admit to the charges leveled against me … whether it was lewd comments, groping, public masturbation, coercing female employees into sex for promotions, or something even worse, I would own up to it because, as a progressive, I do not want to contribute to a culture that discredits women for speaking up. I read enough feminist think-pieces to know that it’s important to believe women, and in my apology … I would own that shit.” As long as three years ago, I was already (half)joking about the Onion’s ability to “predict” the future of feminism. And here we are again – one month after ClickHole’s satirical take on Me Too, documentary director Morgan Spurlock has pre-emptively admitted to and apologised for years of sexual misconduct and revealed that he has been accused of rape. “I’m part of the problem,” Spurlock “bravely” confesses. “I hurt them. And I hate it. But it didn’t make me stop. The worst part is, I’m someone who consistently hurts those closest to me. From my wife, to my friends, to my family, to my partners &amp; co-workers. I have helped create a world of disrespect through my own actions.” As feminists, we must be honest: in recent years our preference for the online world over the real one has helped foster an environment where men assume that merely admitting to abusing us is praiseworthy and requires no further action. Weeks before ClickHole’s parody and Matt Damon’s praise of Louis CK’s admission, I was stunned by the amount of male confessions on social media receiving gratitude and praise from women. Perhaps we were primed for this by rapist Tom Stranger who turned confession into a literal performance, apologising to his victim on stages all over the world, while she repeatedly forgave him, and the inevitable media storm that implied the rest of us should follow suit. “I’d check off all the boxes that feminist Twitter looks for in an airtight apology,” ClickHole’s unflinching observation continues. “The internet would find my epic honesty so refreshing that my redemptive arc would be put on a fast track … bloggers would be publishing headlines like, “Now THIS Is How You Do An Apology.” This is how low the bar is in progressive advocacy. Public performances of “wokeness” (are we still appropriating this word?) are accepted in lieu of meaningful actions. In the social media age, words replace deeds and double standards are applied according to who the culprit is. “If I had to guess, I’d say all the employers that had fired me would quietly invite me to return within a month or two,” ClickHole goes on. But when it came to Democrat senator Al Franken, it didn’t take that long, nor did it happen quietly. Prominent feminists such as Kate Harding came to his sort of-defence immediately, claiming it was “better for women” that he not resign, since there are likely to be countless other Democrats with similar skeletons waiting to be exposed. And with that, Harding inadvertently reveals the chink in the Me Too armour: by focusing on a succession of individuals – both perpetrator and victim – and applying the strictest standards only to those within its ideological and political ranks, the Me Too “movement” prevents itself from laying foundations for long-term systemic change. Harding has a point about the men waiting in the wings to take Franken’s place, but is her defence materially any different to Kate Winslet’s defence of Woody Allen? It was Franken himself who wryly observed that Me Too’s winds of change blow only in one direction, and indeed they have bypassed not only Woody Allen but the likes of Donald Trump and Roy Moore. Yes, Roy Moore lost at the ballot box, but not before white voters proved in droves their willingness to overlook accusations of sexual assault of underage girls, as well as racism and sexism, providing their idols promise to maintain white domination. Some women will benefit from these winds; privileged white women mostly, many of whom will insist they represent us all. They don’t. It was black women, followed closely by black men, who defeated Roy “America has not been great since slavery” Moore in Alabama. It was not Me Too, and it certainly was not white women who nonetheless claimed the victory as a “turning point.” Naturally, ClickHole saves the best for last. “If I really wanted to hit it out of the park, I would insist that I didn’t deserve a second chance … I would just go away forever, with my badass apology as the unforgettable send-off people would be talking about for years. As a feminist, it’d be the least I could do.” There is, apparently, no limit to how little men must do to claim the title “feminist.” Meanwhile, online culture gets ever less forgiving of women who stray even slightly from prevailing progressive sentiment. Years of work to the cause is rendered immaterial, entire reputations are smeared and careers derailed, as women find themselves “cancelled” on the basis of a single statement. We must raise the bar or be crushed under it. • Ruby Hamad is a freelance writer and a columnist for SBS Life"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/19/leicester-city-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-quarter-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T22:33:36Z","webTitle":"Leicester City 1-1 Manchester City (3-4 on pens): Carabao Cup quarter-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/19/leicester-city-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-quarter-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/19/leicester-city-v-manchester-city-carabao-cup-quarter-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City 1-1 Manchester City (3-4 on pens): Carabao Cup quarter-final – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After a rousing fightback - aided by a questionable penalty - Leicester flopped to a tame exit, with Vardy and Mahrez’s missing in the shootout.

ET 9 min: Mahrez curls a freekick to the back post. Maguire sends a downward header several yards wide. ET 7 min: Mahrez is having a party. He’s jinking and teasing his way into the box, looking for an opening while also daring Man City players to try tackling him, at the risk of bringing him down. Eventually, and under much duress, Man City players manage to shoo him away. ET 5 min: Walker is shown a yellow card after going down in the box under a tackle by Dragovic. And it was the right decision, even if you can understand Walker trying it on after the penalty that was given against him earlier. Two wrongs just make one wrong bigger. ET 4 min: Walker shows his speed and alertness to reach the ball before Okazaki after a slip by Adarabioyo hinted at an opening for Leicester. Meanwhile, Arsenal are the first team into the semi-final of this season’s League Cup: they’ve beaten West Ham 1-0 today. ET 2 min: Walker flies down the right and chips in a lovely cross to the near post. Jesus, leaning back, gets a nice header on it, but Hamer makes a comfortable save. ET 1: Man City do the honours. Danilo, by the way, was booked for protesting against the award of that late penalty. This is Leicester’s to lose now: they have something close to their first team on the pitch for extra-time, while Guardiola threw on a couple of teenage debutants towards the end, not suspecting that extra-time would be needed. 90+8 min: The more replays I see of that penalty, the less convinced I am that there was a foul or even much contact. I’d like to hear Gray’s explanation for exactly what sent him tumbling. Vardy hammers it hard and low into the corner, beyond the dive of Bravo. Game back on! Gray went down under as Walker chased him into the box. I’m not sure that was a foul but no matter, Vardy is going to have a chance to take this into extra-time ... 90+5 min: Man City are keeping the ball down the Leicester end, much to the irritation of the home fans. Resurrecting the discussion about Pep’s four competitions, Nathan Walsh points out that “It should also be noted that Copa del Rey is two-legged from when La Liga teams enter in the round of 32 till the final. And the super cup (Supercopa) is also two-legged. So not really a dramatic difference in # of games compared to England.” 90+3 min: Mahrex sweeps a freekick beyond the back post Maguire rises high but can’t direct his header on target. Man City substitution: Dele-Bashiru on, Foden off. And just as that substitution is made, the fourth official announces that there will be at least eight minutes added time. Pep’s expression suggests he hadn’t seen that coming! Which is understandable: I’m not sure where the officials found that time from. I’d like to think they stopped their watches every time the ball went dead, but if that were the case, there’s be about 35 minutes added on. 90 min: Gray slaps a low pass across the face of goal ... Vardy stretches to meet it six yards out .... but misses it by inches! 89 min: Okazaki can’t quite control a pinged low pass by Fuchs. Adorobioyo and Walker combine to snuff out the danger. Man City substitution: Nmecha on, Diaz off. That’a senior team debut for the 19-year-old forward. 85 min: Man City have no intention of simply hanging on. They take the play down the other end, and Maguire has to slide in to divert the ball wide before Foden can get on the end of a low cross from the left. 83 min: Walker is now on for Mangala. 82 min: Brilliant by Mahrez! This time he gave young Zinchenko a lesson, shimmying past him in the box befre flashing in a low shot/cross from the right. Bravo parries ... and then pounces on the rebound before Vardy. 80 min: Man City are reduced to 10 players while Mangala is off the pitch receiving treatment (in fact, it looks like he’ll be replaced by Walker). Toure goes to centreback in the interim. He is immediately caught dawdling on the ball by Vardy. But Leicester fail to do anything with it. 78 min: Mangala jumps bravely to win a header above Vardy before banging his nose into the striker’s bonce. Blood streams down in crimson tribute to his courage; then the medics scamper on to stop all the gushing. 77 min: Maguire does well to beat Jesus to a pinged low cross by Silva. 75 min: Mahrez tries to coax Zinchenko into diving in for the ball so that he can be easily eliminated just to the left of the Man City box. But the youngster is too wily for that and bides his time ... before making a well-timed intervention and nicking the ball off the 2016 Premier League player of the year. 73 min: Gundogan bangs over a freekick from the right, near the corner flag. Jesus flicks it on at the near post in a move inspired by Guardiola’s mentor, George Graham. But no one got on the end of it to complete the hommage. 70 min: Mangala heads Fuchs’ cross out for a corner as the pressure from Leicester increases. 67 min: Chilwell overhits an attempted pass to Vardy. If he’d got the right weight on that, the striker would have been clear on goal! 66 min: Manuel Lagos has sent this wikipedia link to League Cup competitions from around the world, for anyone interested. Feel free to forward it on to Pep Guardiola. 65 min: Gundogan booked for a suspected dive. 64 min: Mahrez rolls a freekick to Maguire, who tries to blem it into the net from 30 yards. It does’t even make it into the box before it’s blocked. 63 min: Play is becoming more open and tempers are rising: League Cup fever has finally taken hold! Mangala cops a telling off for a forceful clash with Okazaki. The home crowd boo because they think the Frenchman should have been booked but, in fact, he did nothing wrong: the collision was robust but fair. 61 min: Silva dashes in behind Fuchs and down the right wing ... and all the way into the box. From near the byline he tries to knock a lateral pass to Jesus, who would just have to tap it into the net from close range .. but Silva pulls the pass behind him! 60 min: Bravo rushes out of his area to smash the ball out of play just before Mahrez could collect the pass over the top. 58 min: Man City play the ball calmly out from the back despite frantic pressing by Leicester. Bravo was particularly cool as Vardy bore down on him. Leicester substitutions: Mahrez and Vardy on, Albrighton and Iheanacho off. Both of the departed duo had decent games but the changes should amount to an upgrade. 55 min: Mahrez is warming up for Leicester. They’re not giving up on this yet ... 53 min: Jesus flips the bal around to Gundgoan and spins and dashes for the return pass. Hamer dashes out to get there first, with Jesus partially impeded by Dragovic. 50 min: Fuchs launches another throw into the box. Zinchenko heads it away again, but only as far as the edge of the box. Chilwell jumps in to send a diving header ... over the bar. 49 min: Fuchs hurls a long throw from the left into Man City’s six-yard box. It causes all manner of bother until Zinchenko nuts it away. 47 min: Jesus gets told off by the ref for clipping Maguire from behind. By the way, have you seen the first batch of entries to the Guardian’s latest list of the world’s top 100 players? It was compiled with input from a dazzling array of experts, including bona fide footballing aristocracy such as Ronaldo, Hernan Crespo and Barney Ronay. Go on, have a gander: 46 min: The second half has started so it must finish. “Regarding the four competitions, surely Pep meant the league, the FA cup, the league cup, and the FA Community Shield (or whatever it’s called these days)?” suggests Justin Kavanagh. “And before you say that that last one isn’t really a competition but a one-off match, bear in mind that you have to win the league (or the FA Cup) to qualify for it, which is more than can be said for the so-called Champions League. Si, Pep knows his English football.” Again, nothing unique about that: lots of countries have equivalents of the Community Shield, including Spain. Guardiola’s reserves have the lead thanks to a lovely goal but Leicester have taken a decent fight to them since then so this tie is still alive. A thunderous half-time team-talk from Claude Puel could be all it takes to trigger a turnaround .... 45+1 min: There will be at least one more minute before the break. “Do you want a fight?” blurts Sam Hughes à propos of je ne sais quoi. Are you asking whether I hope this match descends into violence? Or are you challenging me to a duel? If it’s the latter, meet me tomorrow at 10am on Winnie the Pooh Street in downtown Warsaw. I’ll be the bloke in the black suit of armour. 43 min: Albrighton bangs another beautiful cross over from the right. No one had anticipated it, bizarrely, so it runs all the way over to Fuchs on the far side. He sends it back into the danger zone, Mangala completely miskicks but Zinchenko manages to whack it away. 42 min: In today’s other game in this competition, Arsenal have taken a 1-0 lead over West Ham thanks to Danny Welbeck. 40 min: Leicester continue their resurgence as Iheanacho collects the ball some 25 yards out and goes for a goal himself, forcing another decent save fro Bravo. “Who else apart from England has a League Cup?” fumes Oleg Giberstein. “England is the only one who has four competitions - and it’s a silly thing to do!” And yet here you are, following the coverage of this League Cup tie. Although apparently you don’t follow the equivalent competitions in France, Scotland and Portugal, to name a few others. 36 min: Fuchs drops in a fine corner into the six-yard box. Bravo comes off his line and punches well away. 33 min: Fuchs releases Chilwell down the left and the youngsters plays a low ball over to Iheanacho. The Nigerian swaps clever passes with Okazaki in the Man City box, as the defence scramble to cover. Then Iheanacho gets off a a quick first-time sidefooted shot from 10 yards ...and Bravo plunges low to his right to make a smart one-handed save! That’s much more like it from the hosts! 31 min: This Man City side have really begin the thrum in the last 10 minutes or so. Leicester are looking all out of ideas at this point. “When Pep said ‘here you have four competitions” what did he mean?” asks Raimond Skrupsk. I’m guessing he meant the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League, which is, of course, three domestic competitions and a continental one. Which is certainly not unique to England. 28 min: After cute work by Diaz, Foden curls a delicious cross in from the left. Leicester put it out for a corner with great difficulty. But they clear the corner more easily. Gundogan won the ball in the centre circle and embarked on a long run forward. Jesus dragged a couple of defenders away with a decoy run. Then, as he approached the box, Gundogan poked a ball through to Silva, arriving in support to his left. And the Portuguese poked the ball past the advancing Hamer and into the net. Swift and deadly. 23 min: Danilo leaves a back pass short, obliging Bravo to charge out of his area and try to punt clear. Iheanacho chases after it ... the keeper gets to it first and boots the ball away and then jumps to avoid a hefty collision with Iheanacho, which suggests the ref didn’t see quite what happened: the striker did nothing wrong “The action photo at the top of your blog suggests that the EFL is still using the ball that Pep Guardiola called “highly unacceptable” after a match in a previous round,” chirps Peter Oh. “Please keep an eye on Pep for any expressions of contempt, disgust, or nausea when an errant ball goes into the away side’s technical area.” He was actually asked about that before this match and said he is now happy with the ball: he didn’t say why. 20 min: Man City take a corner short and work the ball eventually to Foden, who tries a long-range shot. It takes a nick off Iborra and dribbles out for another corner. Adarabioyo shows strength and determination to get to the out-swinger before Fuchs, but he heads wide from eight yards. 19 min: Gundogan exchanges passes with Silva down the right an then shapes to cross. But instead he goes for a cheeky lob and darn near catches Hamer out from 25 yards! The keeper backpedals quickly and pushes it over the bar for a corner. 17 min: Zinchenko - playing out of position at left-back, much like Fabian Delph - gets caught by a quick ball over the top. Albrighton sprints down the right and delivers a typically fine cross. Okaaki, scampering in at speed, can’t get above the ball to guide his header downwards from nine yards. 14 min: Panic breaks out at the back for Leicester! Hamer came to intercept near the edge of the area but the ball rolled out so he could not pick it up, and Gundogan stole it and got off a quick shot. Maguire - the only defender between Gundogan and the goal - blocked the shot. Hamer got back in time to thwart Silva’s follow-up effort. 12 min: After much drab probing, Man City get in, courtesy of an error by Fuchs. Silva darted in to the left of the box and fired at goal, obliging Hamer to make a decent save. 8 min: Amartey does well to muscle in front of Diaz and regain possession before the tricky winger could cross from the left. 6 min: Top pressing by Leicester, as iheanacho and Albrighton threaten to dispossess Mangala at the edge of his own area. But the defender uses his strength to hold them off and create just enough room to boot the ball out for a throw-in, which is less than Leicester looked like they might get. 4 min: “If you squint, Man City’s no35 looks a bit like de Bruyne,” notes Michael George, and he’s not wrong The No35 is the 21-year-old Ukrainian left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko. But if you’re looking for someone who could produce deliveries as sumptuous as De Bruyne today, Marc Albrighton could be your man. 2 min: A pattern has formed: can you guess what it is? That’s right, Man City are dominating possession and the home City are coiling deep and looking to counter, presumably. 1 min: Leicester kick off ... and big the ball straight out of play: that’s surely a deliberate ploy to annoy Pep - such waste can only hurt his brain. The teams stride out on to the pitch and strike their photo poses. Leicester are in Tardis blue, while City wear a lighter shade. All is as it should be. Some players are wearing gloves because it’s cold, which seems perfectly sensible. Here’s Guardiola on why he changed his lineup so much: “We’re going to try to reach the semi-final ... you cannot play four competitions with the same guys. All around the world countries have three competitions, but here you have four.” Asked what particular advice he has given 17-year-old Phil Foden today, he replies: “Nothing. Play like he knows how to play. Do what he has to do.” Puel has also spoken. Brace yourselves for fireworks: “It’s a good opportunity for us. We have to put in a good performance of course. Of course it’s difficult.” And there was plenty more where that came from. You’ve had enough, haven’t you? So then, we’ve got two improvised teams and apparently City have decided to not even fill their bench, plumping for just the six substitutes rather than the permitted seven. Guardiola has also gone for an inexperienced defence. I don’t really get why Puel hasn’t gone full gun against them: Leicester aren’t in Europe, nor are they in relegation bother, and if they get through this tie, there’s a fair chance of them going on to win the whole shebang. I know their fixture list is chock-a-block but it’d have been nice to see them give this one their full attention. But hey, maybe their backup players will seize this opportunity to prove their worth. Leicester: Hamer; Amartey, Dragović, Maguire, Fuchs; Albrighton, King, Iborra, Chilwell; Okazaki, Iheanacho. Subs: Jakupović, Simpson, Benalouane, Gray, Mahrez, Vardy, Ulloa Man City: Bravo, Zinchenko, Adarabioyo, Mangala, Danilo, Touré, B. Silva, Gündogan, Foden, Díaz, Jesus Subs: Ederson, Walker, Sané, Nmecha, Duhaney, Dele-Bashiru. Well lookee here, suddenly it’s up to the League Cup to make English football appear competitive again. With Manchester City drumming out party beats on the bowed heads of everyone in the Premier League - 16 rhythmic thrashing in a row and counting - this is the only domestic competition in which Pep Guardiola’s jolly artistes have been knocked a little out of their groove, Wolves holding them to a frustrating 0-0 in the last round before losing on penalties. What chance Leicester going the whole hog today and knocking them out of the actual tourney? Very little, if we are to judge by Leicester’s most recent performance, which was an outstandingly limp display against Crystal Palace. But perhaps that was but a glitch and they will today return to playing the slick jive that Claude Puel had taught them prior to that? Remember that the Frenchman came within one bad refereeing decision of winning this competition last season, which is a lot closer than Guardiola has got so far to lifting an English trophy, although City are, of course, on schedule to clinch this season’s Premier League by early January or thereabouts. Today’s lineups will probably show this competition isn’t a priority for either City but it’s not one they’ll want to sacrifice cheaply, all the same. In other words, belter ahoy! Maybe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/19/steve-smith-goes-to-another-level-as-australia-mould-into-cohesive-unit","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T06:29:41Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith goes to 'another level' as Australia mould into cohesive unit | Geoff Lemon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/19/steve-smith-goes-to-another-level-as-australia-mould-into-cohesive-unit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/19/steve-smith-goes-to-another-level-as-australia-mould-into-cohesive-unit","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith goes to 'another level' as Australia mould into cohesive unit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the Ashes of four years ago rolled on, there was talk about whether it might feature the worst Australian side to dish out a five-Test whitewash. Four years later, the same question has arisen about the current team. It’s understandable how an England supporter could look at the patchy careers of the Marsh brothers, the Hail Mary pick of Tim Paine, the untested Cameron Bancroft, the injury histories of the fast bowlers, and the fact Peter Handscomb was discarded, and ask how the hell this lot has managed to beat their team. The glow of retrospect makes the class of 2013-14 champions, but before the series that team had more question marks than the Riddler’s leotard. David Warner was a loose unit back from suspension. Shane Watson was slated for being unreliable and was batting first drop. Chris Rogers was questioned for longevity, Steve Smith was unproven, George Bailey played cameos, Brad Haddin was a happy slasher. Mitchell Johnson, the eventual destroyer, was the most erratic of all. Ryan Harris was held together with baling wire, Peter Siddle was unfairly cast as a plodder, Nathan Lyon was perennially unsure. Perception, it turns out, doesn’t often tell the story. Here we are, a new team bar Lyon, Warner, and Smith. But the first three Tests have gone the same way as last time. The Ashes regained by Perth, thumping margins of victory, an England team unsure of how to even begin getting one over Australia. So how did this happen? What we’re witnessing is something special on two counts. The first is a solitary batsman operating at a level of achievement with little precedence. When Smith comes to the crease these days, big runs are an assumption rather than a possibility. When he went to stumps at 92 not out in Perth, the overnight discussion was about his double or triple century, not anything so mundane as three figures. “I’ve been lucky enough to see all of his Test hundreds,” said his coach Darren Lehmann. “Seeing him evolve from that first Test hundred at the Oval to now – he just changes his own plans according to what the bowlers are doing and what the wicket’s doing, and what the game needs. He’s gone to a another level.” For all the Bradman comparisons, Smith could justifiably share the Don’s newspaper headline: “He’s out!” His dismissal in itself is now news. He makes a century almost every second Test he plays. His average is the second best in history. It’s not just dominance in the game, it’s dominance in presence. The last individual batsman to draw such focus was probably Brian Lara in the 1990s. But he had a sense of being under siege, making up for inadequate team-mates. Perhaps this makes his achievements more laudable, but Smith’s are more effective. Where Lara had his back to the wall, Smith can advance. He can because of an asset few have had. The other special thing we’re seeing in this series is a three-part bowling attack combining genuine quality with genuine pace. Patrick Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood have devastated. On the first day at Perth, they had the fastest average bowling speed as a trio since records were kept. Of course the great West Indies attacks of yesteryear would have competed, but few since. Smith was right to single them out after the win, because he’s been able to bat in the full confidence that his team-mates will do a job. “Our bowlers, to take 20 wickets in every game. we haven’t won a toss, we’ve probably had the toughest of the conditions to bowl in. The three quicks and Nathan Lyon have done a fantastic job to take 60 wickets over the last three games.” It was telling that Smith also praised his medical staff, who kept the injury-prone Starc and Cummins together through three Test wins. People love to beat up on sports scientists and medical management when players are rested or injured, but they made a lot of moves over the last couple of years to ensure these bowlers would be primed for the Ashes. James Pattinson was the other one they wanted ready: three out of four isn’t bad. It’s compelling when you consider what these players go through. “Fast bowling is hard work,” says Jason Gillespie. We just see big blokes bang it in and challenge the speed gun. We don’t see Starc worry about breaking his foot again as he lands eight times his body weight. We don’t see Pattinson going to New Zealand to have his back fused. We don’t see Cummins doing rehab for so long he had time to get a university degree. You take a thoroughbred like the latter and ask him to bowl bouncers all day. It’s tough. The other key is Lyon, enabling fast bowlers to operate at max effectiveness by controlling the other end. England’s spinner Moeen Ali has contained no one. At the same time, Lyon makes his own danger. He leads the world for wickets this year, with 60 and a Test to come. In the comparisons to 2013-14, an interesting one is that all 100 wickets fell in a five-Test series for the first time. This time, we’re on track to see it again. Around Smith and his bowlers, the others have filled necessary gaps. Everyone has contributed at least one score. Lehmann’s take on his panel’s controversial selections was typically simple: “We were just going with gut feel to be perfectly honest and really pleased for the players that they turned up and played really well.” It means the resulting success involved good fortune more than canniness. But all the many varied shades of selection debates before the event become monochromed down to the starkest black and white afterwards: the choices either worked or they didn’t. Now that the job is done, you may see a loosening of approach in Melbourne and Sydney. “It’s a lot more relaxed, which is a good thing,” said Lehmann. “Ashes cricket is high pressure, everybody is nervous every ball, every session. It’s been that way for 15 days so far, so they can go and express themselves a little bit more. We’ll be playing the same brand of cricket but obviously with less pressure on us. it’ll be interesting to see how we respond to that.” If this team was a motley collection, that pressure has moulded them into something cohesive. It will be interesting to see whether a release allows the individual components to flourish or prompts them to come apart. This group may not be so concerned about a whitewash as their vengeful counterparts from four years earlier. But they certainly want more players who can influence games on the regular. That period of development starts now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/this-year-lets-not-hide-sicknesses-from-friends","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"This year, let's not hide our sicknesses from friends | Steven W Thrasher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/this-year-lets-not-hide-sicknesses-from-friends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/this-year-lets-not-hide-sicknesses-from-friends","fields":{"headline":"This year, let's not hide our sicknesses from friends","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This year, several friends shared their illnesses and vulnerabilities with me. And I am eternally grateful to them for that. Given the constant news of hurricanes and fires and political disasters, we can feel like our personal problems aren’t important enough to talk about. But sick people shouldn’t suffer alone and in silence. When friends tell me they are going to the doctor, I usually offer to go with them. They rarely take me up on it – but that ended this year. There was, for example, my gay friend who was facing a cancer scare this summer. I accompanied him to the waiting area of the clinic specializing in LGBT health. And, once they (wisely) separated us to determine that I was not encroaching on his privacy, they let me sit in the exam. It was a deeply meaningful experience for me. I got to learn more about my friend’s health, his fears and his anxieties. I got to learn more about his sex life and drug use, and understand better ways to support him in enjoying both safely. When my friend got so nervous he couldn’t recall information, I helped prod his memory. And when the nurse practitioner suggested a course of treatment for therapy and follow-up care, I understood how to help my friend achieve those goals. I appreciated having our friendship – a type of relationship that is deeply meaningful despite being routinely dismissed as less important than spousal, sibling or parental relationships – validated by the clinic in this way. In showing me his vulnerabilities, I got to know and love my friend better. But selfishly, I also appreciated that I can now take off my mask in front of him, too. I’m more free to share how I am doing, and don’t have to pretend when I am not well. In being naked with me about his health scare, I feel more free to be naked about my own health issues. The dynamic of growing more intimate with friends after I learned of their illnesses repeated itself throughout the year. Another time, a dear friend had severe medical issues that he kept pretty close to the chest. He then had to have a series of surgeries which involved parts of his body that would normally be considered embarrassing. My friend is an extremely handsome man who carries himself in the world with great beauty. That he allowed me to be with him in the hospital for his surgeries, seeing body parts that society deems “shameful” and “dirty” was so meaningful to me. It was an immeasurable gift that he’d let me see him in that state, and we grew closer because of it. Another time, a friend texted me a photo of the impact mental illness was having on his body. The photo alarmed me, but I appreciated that my friend was letting me see his vulnerability. And when we met the next day to talk about it, I learned that my friend and I loved and trusted each other in a deeper way than ever. Similarly, I felt closer to a friend who asked me to help them find their way into a drug recovery program. It was a friend of mine who was at the end of their time here on earth to whom I was most grateful for letting me see her sick this year: the late, great gospel singing photographer Arlene Gottfried. Arlene had mostly kept to herself in the last year of living with cancer. But in her final days, she let me and our friend Belinda come visit her. We got to hug her and tell her how much she meant to us. And hours before she died, our one-time choir director Freeman and I got to pray with her and hold her, too. I will never be able to thank her enough for the gift of her letting me be with her in her illness, despite the widespread view that we are unfit for human companionship when we are sick. One new friend was not able to let me close when he was ill, sadly. I met the Broadway composer Michael Friedman on a panel he moderated about queer activism at the Public Theater in May, though the panel was largely about Aids. We went out for quasi-date drinks meetup shortly thereafter. I asked him about a purple spot he had on his cheek that he said was nothing, he was just a little run-down. We talked a lot about Aids, again – about my academic research on HIV criminalization, and on Aids depiction in Angels in America and in poetry. We talked for hours into the night at my favorite bar, the Scratcher. It was one of those nights when I was getting to know someone that I thought would be in my life for some time. We made plans to get together later in the summer or early fall after we both wrapped big projects. But in early September, I got a text from him saying, “Hey Thrasher. It’s Friedman. It’s been awhile. Long story, but I’ve been hospitalized for a month. Let’s check in, in a couple weeks? How are you?” I offered to visit him in the hospital, but he didn’t respond. Six days later, he died from Aids. I’ll never know for sure if he knew about his diagnosis when we talked about Aids that night. And I have no judgment about that at all. But his death did remind me about the terrible power of stigma, and the ways stigma can separate us from ourselves, from the people we love and from wellness. And it reminded me of how terribly grateful I am to my friends who have risked the stigma to allow me to see them, and be with their bodies, even in their toughest days. Here’s to 2018, friends. In sickness and in health, may we allow ourselves to be seen as we really are. And let’s get through it all together."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/19/tuesday-briefing-no-special-deal-for-the-city-says-barnier","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T06:18:41Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: No special deal for the City, says Barnier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/19/tuesday-briefing-no-special-deal-for-the-city-says-barnier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/19/tuesday-briefing-no-special-deal-for-the-city-says-barnier","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: No special deal for the City, says Barnier","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: Davis faces struggle to deliver trade pledge This is Martin Farrer with the Guardian briefing on all the top stories this Tuesday morning. Britain’s huge financial services industry will not be given a special deal in the Brexit settlement, Europe’s leading negotiator says. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers, Michel Barnier says that Britain’s decision to leave the EU means City firms automatically lose the financial passports allowing them to trade freely in Europe. The emphatic declaration is a blow to Brexit secretary David Davis who voiced hopes that Britain could negotiate a bespoke trade deal favouring its service-driven economy. In a blow to remainers, Barnier also said that Britain could not halt the Brexit process without the consent of the 27 EU member states. On the other hand, Brexiters will be infuriated by his assertion that Britain will have to follow all EU rules – including new laws passed – until after it has left. David Marquand, the former Labour MP, argues in the Guardian today that the UK does not have a problem with Europe, but a problem with England. The Brexit vote was an English majority, he writes, driven by an antiquated, Enoch Powell-style view of England which ignored two of the other four nations in the union. But the confusion and political paralysis caused by the referendum offers an opportunity for progressives to fight back for their vision of the country’s future. * * * NHS staffing fears – NHS trusts are struggling to fill thousands of vacancies, research shows, raising concerns about how hospitals will cope with increased demand on services over the winter months. Freedom of information requests by the Labour party reveal that almost one in four posts at some trusts are unfilled. Shortages of hospital and community-based doctors, and also nurses, are worsening, according to figures from 82 (36%) of the 229 NHS trusts in England. There was a total of 35,993 unfilled full-time posts, the survey shows, which is a vacancy rate of 9% or the equivalent of 100,517 positions across all 229 trusts. Janet Davies, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said the NHS faces “a perilous January without enough staff”. * * * Stop digging, Matt – After being criticised for opining that there was a “spectrum of behaviour” in relation to sexual harassment of women, Matt Damon has come back for more by saying that not enough is said about the men who don’t harass women. “One thing that’s not being talked about is there are a whole shitload of guys ... who don’t do this kind of thing and whose lives aren’t going to be affected,” the actor said. In the long read today, Dayna Tortorici asks whether amid the male backlash against the harassment scandals, is it time to accept that some will find the world less comfortable in the process of making it habitable for others? * * * I’ll win, says Corbyn – On the same theme, Jeremy Corbyn has said he is horrified at some of the stories of sexual harassment circulating in Westminster and he vowed to make the Labour party “a safe place women to go”. He told Grazia magazine: “I think sexism is a real challenge in society that needs to be dealt with.” He also said he thinks there will be a general election in the next 12 months that he will win. * * * Cyber threat – The US has blamed North Korea for the WannaCry cyberattack that crippled the computer system of the NHS and FedEx along with those of thousands of other organisations across the world in May. Kim Jong-un’s regime was “directly responsible” for the attack, said Tom Bossert, homeland security adviser to Donald Trump, adding that people carrying out cyber-attacks against the US would be held accountable. He didn’t mention specific actions Washington was considering taking but earlier on Monday Donald Trump unveiled a new security strategy on Monday which could broaden the use of nuclear weapons to counter “non-nuclear strategic attacks” such as cyber attacks. * * * Christmas blow – Toys R Us is facing collapse with the loss of up to 3,200 jobs because it is struggling to plug a gap in its pension fund. It needs to find £9m for the fund in order to get regulatory approval for the closure of 26 stores announced back in September as it fights fierce online competition. If it fails to find the money, then the whole business could go into administration. The unstoppable rise of online shopping is also reflected in the growth of the gig economy. We asked a Hermes courier to keep a diary of his working week this month and it reveals how he had to battle long hours, heavy traffic and atrocious weather just to make slightly more than the minimum wage. * * * Bailed out – After less than a month in service, the navy’s new £3.1bn aircraft carrier has sprung a leak and has been taken back to port for repairs. HMS Queen Elizabeth is taking on water as a result of a problem with a shaft seal, the navy confirmed last night. At 280 metres long and with an estimated 50-year working life, the carrier is the biggest and most powerful built by the UK. Lunchtime read: How one show dominated TV in 2017 It’s no surprise that our roundup of the best television programmes of the year ends with top spot being handed to The Handmaid’s Tale, the brilliant adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s distopian novel. Reviewing the defining series of the year, Rebecca Nicholson argues that although its success owed much to its eerie reflection of our turbulent cultural and political times, it became truly great TV because it also worked as a gripping thriller. She concludes: “It’s more than just a political allegory. It’s a gorgeous-looking horror show, an excruciatingly tense thriller and a remarkable compendium of stories about women, too. It’s television at its very best.” If that doesn’t sate your Handmaid appetite, we also have interviews with two of the show’s stars – Madeline Brewer (Janine/Ofwarren) and Yvonne Strahovski (Serena Joy) – and how they felt about bringing Gilead to life in the age of Trump.

Later iterations of this policy would lead to the establishment of the NBN and, learning from earlier experiences of allowing Telstra to keep control over the infrastructure, the Rudd government would pursue the establishment of a separate company to run the broadband network. But back to 1995. Since 1990 Telstra’s monopoly over telecommunications services had been progressively dismantled. The internet was rapidly evolving. But in 1995 most Australians who were accessing it were using old copper phone lines at dismally slow speeds. How then to drive investment by Telstra in broadband and encourage rapid uptake by industry? In 1995 the cabinet commissioned an expert group to peer into the future. In April of that year it considered several submissions, including the broadband services expert group report. “The ‘information superhighway’ is a powerful enabling tool that is driving and shaping traditional industries as well as being a progenitor of a whole new range of products and industries,” the industry minister, Peter Cook, enthused in his submission. “Information and communications will be a key driver of business efficiency and international competitiveness.” Cook warned it was a global race to remain at the cutting edge. “The infrastructure to establish the information superhighway in Australia is in place or under development. While broadband services in Australia are currently at an embryonic stage, the telecommunications carriers are installing broadband cable capacity, which will provide more sophisticated delivery of information services to business and for interactive communication.” Cook said there was strong case for the government “to channel and accelerate the process to ensure the widest possible uptake and best use of these new technologies in both the public and private sectors”. Cabinet agreed that the prime minister would make a statement at the end of the year, but in the meantime ministers were urged to look at how government services could be made more efficient by the use of broadband. Central to the statement would be a commitment to access and equity, the cabinet note recorded. The cabinet was obsessed with innovation, but getting meaningful investment could be tricky. In 1994 it considered a request by the German government to land a space rocket at Woomera, with the minister for science arguing it could lead to future industry collaboration. The foreign affairs department worried that it might undermine Australia’s credentials on non-proliferation if the Germans were really testing ballistic missile technology. There was less enthusiasm for Australia’s domestic national space program, begun in the late 1980s. In deliberations over the 1995-96 budget cuts to the program, the finance department said: “Since its inception in 1986 the National Space Program has not achieved any sufficiently tangible benefits to warrant its continued separate support outside the range of general, non sectoral industry and science assistance programs.” The government’s plan for the so-called Multifunction Polis on the fringe of Adelaide was also struggling. The MFP concept was first suggested by the Japanese government during ministerial discussions in 1987 and was intended to “be national and international in scope”. The futuristic city was meant to have 100,000 residents and be a magnet for high-tech industries. But by 1995 the cabinet was grappling with where the project was going. The cabinet was told the first stage of the MFP development had evolved into an estate “expected to house some 10,000 to 12,000 people over about 12 years”. “It will demonstrate the capacity for ‘clever’ (technologically advanced), ‘greener’ (environmentally sensitive) and ‘richer’ (in this case socially) community development. Fibre optic communications … will enable a range of leading edge urban services such as telecommuting, education, business services and entertainment.” But it was never to be. It was abandoned in 1998."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/19/theresa-may-election-advisers-nick-timothy-fiona-hill-lynton-crosby","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T16:55:03Z","webTitle":"The general election: where did Theresa May's most trusted advisers go?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/19/theresa-may-election-advisers-nick-timothy-fiona-hill-lynton-crosby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/19/theresa-may-election-advisers-nick-timothy-fiona-hill-lynton-crosby","fields":{"headline":"The general election: where did Theresa May's most trusted advisers go?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was one of the biggest upsets in British political history. Few but the most wildly optimistic Jeremy Corbyn supporters predicted Theresa May would lose her majority in June’s snap election, so the 10pm exit poll forecasting a hung parliament sent politicians, advisers and journalists into meltdown. The prime minister was not the sole architect of her near-downfall, of course – she was surrounded by a band of advisers with decades of electoral experience. Since that night, some have been more prominent and upfront about their role than others. What has happened to the people who helped to throw away the first Conservative-majority government in 20 years? Nick Timothy One of the PM’s all-powerful joint chiefs of staff before he resigned after the election. Timothy had overseen the Conservative manifesto, which contained the doomed “dementia tax” policy partially blamed for the Tories losing seats to Labour. Since his resignation, he has been on a journey, shaving off his Tsar-esque beard and, in columns for the Daily Telegraph and the Sun, admitting to mistakes made in the election, including letting the campaign become too presidential. Out of office, Timothy has continued to be a proponent of Mayism, including her version of Brexit. Fiona Hill The PM’s other chief of staff before she resigned with Timothy. Hill ran No 10 and access to May with a rod of iron, tried to stop Ruth Davidson running a distinctive campaign for the Scottish Tories, and attempted to undo anything associated with the Cameron/Osborne regime, including the Northern Powerhouse. Davidson was proved right, with the Scottish Conservatives the only success story of election night. Hill was also expert at political optics and would have prevented May’s mishap-laden conference speech. She has gone to ground since leaving No 10, and is believed to have spent time in New York. Lynton Crosby The “Wizard of Aus” behind the electoral successes of David Cameron and Boris Johnson as London mayor lost some of his magic in June. Crosby had been drafted in to help run the campaign, but clashed with Timothy over strategy. He is blamed for the presidential style of the campaign, which put too much focus on May being “strong and stable”, a slogan which has haunted the PM to this day. It has also since emerged that Crosby wrote a memo in April warning May not to call a snap election. In October, it was reported that he had been hired by Amber Rudd, fuelling speculation she will mount a leadership bid when May steps down. Ben Gummer A rising-star Tory MP under David Cameron, he was minister for the Cabinet Office and May’s chief policy adviser when he was appointed to help write, with Timothy, the 2017 Tory manifesto. Gummer, who was against a snap election, feared the Conservative poll lead was not as solid as it seemed. He was right, and lost his Ipswich seat, which may not have happened if he had not been busy at CCHQ. But his year may end on a more positive note: Gummer is in line for a Conservative peerage. Jim Messina Like Crosby, Messina was a veteran of electoral success, having helped Barack Obama win in 2008 and 2012. Yet he could not save May from losing her majority. Was it all the PM’s fault, however? During the campaign, Messina, an expert in data, refused to believe opinion polls suggesting a Labour surge, tweeting: “Spent the day laughing at yet another stupid poll.” According to Tim Shipman’s book Fall Out, Messina believed May was not ready to fight an election and compared her to Sarah Palin. He has since set up a new digital marketing company with Crosby called Outra."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/21/alabama-new-generation-black-politicians-doug-jones-win","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T11:00:43Z","webTitle":"A new generation of young black politicians is coming – the Democrats should listen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/21/alabama-new-generation-black-politicians-doug-jones-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/21/alabama-new-generation-black-politicians-doug-jones-win","fields":{"headline":"A new generation of young black politicians is coming – the Democrats should listen","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The recent upset in the special election for US Senate in Alabama has Democrats fantasizing about a 2018 wave election, and rightfully so. When you couple the Doug Jones narrow win in Alabama with the big victories in Virginia and New Jersey, Democrats have every right to feel optimistic. There is, however, one obvious similarity in each race: strong African American turnout fueled Democratic candidates to victory. Boosting African American turnout will continue to be the key to Democratic victories in 2018. And I encourage Democrats to use the campaigns of two, young progressive mayors in the deep south as a blueprint for effective engagement with black voters. Chokwe Lumumba, the self-described revolutionary mayor of Mississippi’s largest city, is just as forceful in his plan to fill Jackson’s potholes as he is about Mississippi’s oppressive state flag. Randall Woodfin became the youngest mayor in the history of Birmingham by campaigning on aggressive blight elimination and a comprehensive public safety plan that allowed him to crack the code on black infrequent voters, particularly 11,000 that had never voted in a municipal election. What do Lumumba and Woodfin have to do with Democrats in 2018? Both campaigns reassembled the Obama coalition in high-population areas where Democrats must run up the score in order to win statewide races. The Obama coalition is re-emerging in places like Jackson and Birmingham. And it’s being led by young, black politicians, and maverick black political firms like Pine Street Strategies. It is no coincidence that the city of Birmingham and Jefferson County came out for Jones at a rate that nearly matched Hillary Clinton. The value of these races extends beyond votes, as many Woodfin campaign staffers, organizers and volunteers brought invaluable experience to efforts to elect Jones. Bold candidates like Lumumba and Woodfin enhance Democratic voter files with newly identified voters, ultimately leaving behind campaign infrastructure that can be inherited and leveraged in future statewide races. So, what is the playbook for 2018 that gets Democrats the turnout they need to support a wave election? It starts with having candidates like Woodfin and Lumumba. Young, progressive candidates of color like Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum, Ian Conyers and Jermaine Reed. Each bring with them personal narratives that can establish credibility with millennials and voters of color, tapping into the excitement of the progressive base benefiting Democrats up and down the ballot. This playbook must also prioritize black engagement from start to finish of the campaign. This means engaging black voters around a real policy agenda that is responsive to their needs. For example, Woodfin promoted a comprehensive policy platform during the campaign that spoke directly to the concerns of black voters. Moreover, hiring the right campaign strategists who actually know black voters and understand how to craft and deliver a message that resonates with us is key. Finally, Democrats have to govern in a manner that prioritizes black voters. We expect more than election-year church visits and endorsements from senior black politicians. We want to see senior African American staff – especially in the US Senate given their shameful record on diversity. We also want to see statewide candidates and elected officials engaging trusted black media outlets and journalists the same way they do traditional outlets. Let me be clear: the days of assuming that we will turn out and be election-day accessories only to be forgotten after the swear-in are long over. We will support your primary opponent or stay home if you continue to ignore us. A wave election is there for the taking for Democrats in 2018, but it will require a dramatic shift from the traditional Democratic playbook of taking African American voters for granted. Alabama is leading the way. And a new generation of young, black politicians are leading the way. It is time for the Democratic party to listen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/19/oscars-fiasco-la-la-land-academy-award-chaos","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T19:00:02Z","webTitle":"The Oscars best picture fiasco: ‘I can sort of laugh about it now’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/19/oscars-fiasco-la-la-land-academy-award-chaos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/19/oscars-fiasco-la-la-land-academy-award-chaos","fields":{"headline":"The Oscars best picture fiasco: ‘I can sort of laugh about it now’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At first, everyone thought it was a joke. There is no other way to explain why there were two envelopes on stage announcing the best picture Oscar for 2017. It was so impossible. I realised something had gone wrong pretty quickly – I could see people running around in my periphery and I could hear people talking, and behind me, [La La Land star] Emma Stone was whispering something. I saw Warren Beatty coming across the stage and I remember him holding up an envelope. I went over. Then another guy came over and I showed him the envelope. Lots of envelopes flying around. At that point everyone was like: “Oh. Shit.” I just knew it needed to be fixed. Right then, I saw the cameraman and so I just locked my eyes on him, just looked right at him and thought, “I really hope you know what to do now.” Luckily, he quickly zoomed in on the envelope, really fast. He totally nailed it. After the shock died down, plenty of people said Moonlight didn’t get to have its moment because of what happened. A lot of people reached out to me, too, and they were angry. And I’m like – you should rage! But Barry Jenkins, Moonlight’s director, and I have talked about it a lot, about how we can look at it.To me, being able to hand him the award, to be able to demonstrate that seminal moment was a formative thing. I’ve always tried to be politically active on social media, but it was only after this that people actually starting listening to me. I don’t care what other people say: representation and diversity really matter, I’ve learned that here. The industry has been damaged. Right now, in the wake of all the Weinstein revelations, we are in a moment where no one knows which way is north. This is a terrifying moment. A lot of people in Hollywood are talking about change, which is good, but I don’t know if people are actually doing it yet. Asking people to give up power is inherently tough. People are clinging to an old system to prove that it works. As for the accountant from PriceWaterhouseCoopers who handed Beatty the wrong envelope, I vaguely remember seeing him on the red carpet before the awards, but I didn’t try to find him afterwards. They rang me the next day, we had a quick conversation, but that was it. The person I was looking for was the cameraman, to thank him, but I couldn’t find him. A year on, I’m still, like: “Wow. That actually happened.” I can sort of laugh about it now.

No, not Team Luke vs Team Vader but the ongoing war for the soul of Star Wars. It is fought between those who believe these movies are just space fantasies for the under 12s, and those certain there is something more sombre and sophisticated beneath the surface – or at least that there ought to be. To the casual observer, 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back might appear to be a relatively similar movie to its sequel, 1983’s Return of the Jedi. After all, both films feature duels between laser sword-wielding space priests and a blitzkrieg of cosmic dogfights. But to hardcore fans these movies couldn’t be more different. From its icy-hearted opening on Hoth, through the mid-movie lull as Luke Skywalker is trained by Yoda, and on to its downbeat and desperate finale, Empire is a brooding exercise in reminding audiences that the destruction of the first Death Star in 1977’s Star Wars was little more than a minor setback for the rampaging Empire. It replaces the joyous, starry-eyed sense of hope that permeates both Episodes IV and VI with a delicious air of grim foreboding. It is also almost entirely lacking in the colourful critters that populate ROTJ, from Endor’s ewoks to the motley gangsters of Jabba’s palace on Tatooine. All of which brings us to The Last Jedi, which despite an ardent thumbs up from critics currently seems to be dividing audiences – Rotten Tomatoes suggests only 55% of cinemagoers enjoyed Rian Johnson’s film. Few additions to the saga have been more divisive than the porgs, the cute creatures – part-hamster, part-puffin – who populate Luke Skywalker’s rocky and remote hideaway on the planet of Ahch-To, and who are being seen in some corners as an unwelcome kid-friendly, merchandise-ready extension of Star Wars lore. There is a sense that the alien birds typify The Last Jedi’s determination to keep this latest episode as light and fluffy as possible, and that Johnson would have been better off making a movie that dropped all pretence of accessibility and went over fully to the dark side. It does not help, of course, that Star Wars’ owner these days is Disney, a studio that has often been accused of dumbing down product in the past. One suspects the backlash – if it can be so termed when this is a movie that’s currently crushing all before it at the global box office – has probably been compounded due to the release only last year of the darkest, most grown-up Star Wars movie thus far, Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One. That episode seemed to go out of its way to reimagine the long-running saga through a real-world prism, largely excising fantasy elements such as lightsabers and the Force in favour of a pared down sci-fi approach. Many fans imagined The Last Jedi would be more of the same, a moodier, more thoughtful and atmospheric sequel setting up a triumphant third instalment, just as Empire was the best part of four decades ago. Those who have seen Johnson’s film will be well aware that such expectations have proven ill-founded. But for the record, the porgs didn’t irritate me as much as they appear to have others. Johnson’s film is perhaps the cheeriest Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi, and Ahch-To’s indigenous species seemed to suit the tone. Jar Jar Binks was so excruciating to the majority of Star Wars fans because he seemed to have been dreamt up by somebody who really didn’t understand what made Star Wars great, at all. By contrast, the porgs, which are based on the puffins that kept creeping into shot during Johnson’s shoot on the Irish island of Skellig Michael, felt like an organic addition to the saga’s ever-growing menagerie of critters. Many forget that the ewoks appeared in a Star Wars movie that features many of the saga’s most memorable moments, from Luke’s Jedi mind tricks and defeat of the Rancor to the remarkable space battle that finally brings down the Empire. Likewise the porgs, and the lightness of touch that they bring with them, are surely examples of pushing the envelope, rather than jumping the shark into another galaxy entirely. There is both a light and dark side to this venerable old series, and as Supreme Emperor Snoke kept trying to tell us before he was rudely sliced in half, Star Wars needs both of them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/05/thrillers-review-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T11:59:12Z","webTitle":"The best recent thrillers – review roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/05/thrillers-review-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/05/thrillers-review-roundup","fields":{"headline":"The best recent thrillers – review roundup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What is the price to be paid for lifelong social activism? That’s the question posed by Eva Dolan’s This Is How It Ends (Raven, £12.99). Molly is an old-school campaigner whose life has been dedicated to everything from the Greenham Common peace camp in the 1980s and 90s to opposing the gentrification of a semi-derelict tower block in the present day. She has become a kind of surrogate mother to the youthful Ella, similarly known to the police after her involvement in demonstrations touched by violence. And an act of violence drives the women even closer together, when Molly helps her friend conceal the accidental death of a man who assaulted her. After they dispose of his corpse in a lift shaft, retribution begins to close like a steel trap around the women. Dolan is expert at the orchestration of tension, right up to the vertiginous climax. This first stand-alone novel – her earlier work featured hate-crime coppers Zigic and Ferreira – also adds a new layer to the author’s trenchant social commentary. While the authorities are presented in unsympathetic fashion, Molly’s unending crusades over a variety of issues have not filled the void in her life that initially propelled her along this path. Dolan seems to suggest that organic human interaction is preferable to a lifetime of battling for right-on causes. Ask aficionados who is Britain’s finest thriller writer, and many would answer the veteran Gerald Seymour, whose career has spanned four decades. Though his recent work has lacked rigour, A Damned Serious Business (Hodder, £17.99) sees him once again firing on all cylinders. With customary topicality, the new book presents Russian hackers as the frontline warriors in a new cold war. With Russian electoral interference on both sides of the Atlantic, MI6 case officer Edwin Coker initiates the disruption of this secret operation, not with a computer virus but a bomb, delivered across the border by a young criminal hacker suborned by MI6. He is to be shepherded by the seasoned soldier Merc: the hazardous mission is palm-sweatily convincing. The German writer Dirk Kurbjuweit has frequently interviewed politicians such as Angela Merkel, but it’s the personal rather than the political that powers Fear (translated by Imogen Taylor, Orion, £12.99). Kurbjuweit, deputy editor-in-chief of Der Spiegel, transmutes into fiction the real-life experiences of his own family, victims of a stalker who was careful to keep within the law. We first encounter Berlin architect Randolph Tiefenthaler sitting with his father in prison: the latter has killed the tenant of the basement below his son’s upscale apartment, the unstable Tiberius, who has sexually harassed Randolph’s wife and accused the couple of abusing their children. Tiberius, a beneficiary of Germany’s welfare system, was protected from eviction, and as he grew more threatening, bloodshed became inevitable. But is the cold-blooded execution carried out by Randolph’s father all that it appears to be? While the tenser sections of the novel are handled efficiently enough, the real interest lies in the astringent picture of middle-class German society, with its schism between the haves and have-nots, something we’ve not seen before in contemporary crime fiction. Hitchcock’s Rear Window is a gift that keeps on giving, from Paula Hawkins’s The Girl on the Train to the latest riff, The Woman in the Window (HarperCollins, £12.99) by AJ Finn. As with Hawkins, we have a booze-addicted woman with a dysfunctional life, Dr Anna Fox. When not watching Hitchcock films (Finn is refreshingly open about the source of his inspiration), Anna uses the zoom lens of her camera to spy on the comfortable life of her neighbours, the Russells. But – as is de rigueur for this subgenre – Anna observes something horrific and is confronted with the inevitable question: will anyone believe her? Finn does not attempt to conceal the shopworn elements, but confronts them head-on and rings some bracing changes. “A J Finn” is really Dan Mallory, a US publisher who knows just what makes popular thrillers work. How would it feel to be trapped within one’s own body, able to see, smell and hear but unable to communicate? If I Die Before I Wake by Emily Koch (Harvill Secker, £12.99) is audaciously told from the point of view of Alex, a victim of locked-in syndrome after an accident. Initially yearning for death, Alex then tries to discover what has happened to him; he is perhaps solving his own murder.

In an interview with the magazine Grazia, Corbyn said there would be a general election in the next 12 months, which Labour “will probably win”, and that he was “ready to be prime minister tomorrow”. On the sexual harassment claims that have seen a string of MPs from all parties suspended or placed under investigation after the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #metoo movement, Corbyn said he had “not [heard] many whispers” about inappropriate behaviour prior to this and had been shocked by the allegations. He said: “I’m horrified and appalled by it all. I think sexism is a real challenge in society that needs to be dealt with. The allegations are all investigated and dealt with as appropriate. We support the people making them as well as the people being alleged against.” Corbyn said Labour was “not dealing with huge numbers” of allegations but added: “We’re dealing with some cases and they are of course disturbing when you get them. “But we have a process, including a confidential hotline and an independent person to investigate. I’m utterly determined all Labour party events will be a safe place for women to go to.” When asked about Brexit and why his party were not campaigning to reverse the decision in a second referendum, he said that some people had been “extremely irresponsible in what they did and said” in the campaign but “we have to recognise it was the largest participation of people in an electoral process ever in Britain and they chose to leave”. Corbyn has been facing pressure to spell out in more detail what Brexit settlement Labour would support and Theresa May repeatedly ribbed him over what she said was Labour’s ambiguous position in the House of Commons last week. He said his priority was ensuring there was enough time for a smooth transition: “I think we should continue putting pressure on the government to allow a transition period to develop, because at the moment we’re in danger of getting into a complete mess in March 2019.” On Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, Corbyn – known for his republican beliefs – said “she’s clearly a very decent person”. He added: “Weddings come pretty pricey, I understand, but I think the cost should be borne by the family themselves.” Asked what trait he most deplores in himself, he said untidiness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/18/david-davis-to-warn-european-commission-it-cannot-cherrypick-brexit-trade-deal-sectors","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T20:45:12Z","webTitle":"David Davis to warn EU it cannot cherrypick in Brexit trade deal talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/18/david-davis-to-warn-european-commission-it-cannot-cherrypick-brexit-trade-deal-sectors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/18/david-davis-to-warn-european-commission-it-cannot-cherrypick-brexit-trade-deal-sectors","fields":{"headline":"David Davis to warn EU it cannot cherrypick in Brexit trade deal talks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brexit secretary David Davis will warn the European commission that it cannot “cherrypick some sectors” when negotiating a trade deal, according to a senior government official, who said the UK planned to treat goods and services as inseparable. Responding to EU figures setting out their stall, the Whitehall source insisted that while trade talks would be complex, “they either want to have a broad economic relationship with the UK, or they don’t”. The source dismissed the idea that Britain would have to choose between a simple free trade agreement, which would focus largely on goods but not on the services that make up almost 80% of the UK economy, or a more comprehensive arrangement inside the single market and customs union. They also suggested that ministers across government had held meetings with a “full sweep of EU member states” and were confident some would be pressing internally for the commission to secure a bespoke and strong deal with the UK. “We are regularly approached by foreign governments and businesses who tell us that they want a fully functioning economic relationship with Britain which goes beyond the more rigid and unambitious suggestions from the commission,” they said. Ministers including Davis are thought to believe that countries such as Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands see trade with the UK as particularly important to their economies. As such, they would be nervous of any moves that resulted in Britain crashing out of the EU on to World Trade Organisation rules. The suggestion comes after Theresa May chaired a critical discussion of her “Brexit inner cabinet”, in which she and nine leading ministers discussed – for the first time – what “end state” Britain should be pushing for in the negotiations. The prime minister told colleagues that the government must aim high in the next phase of EU negotiations. But she is likely to face some division within her top team, which includes former remainers such as Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd and the key Brexiters, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson. Although the cabinet is united in swinging behind Davis’s suggestion that the UK will seek a “Canada plus plus plus” deal – adding services to the free trade agreement that exists – there are disagreements on how achievable that is. Sources said Hammond and Rudd argued for close alignment with European-style regulation at the meeting, with Rudd, the home secretary, suggesting that jobs in Britain could be better protected by a close economic relationship with the EU. However, Gove and Johnson were backed by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, over their desire to ensure the UK can diverge in the future. May’s position is less well known, although she told the group – in a boost for the Brexiters – that the UK ought to be thinking less about conforming to European standards and more about conforming to international ones. A key sticking point is likely to be whether the EU will allow Britain to have a deal unlike any other, which would include services to a high degree outside of the single market. Senior British negotiators are likely to draw on statistics that highlight countries that trade services with the UK in order to press their case. Internal government figures show that 10% of Polish exports in the professional and business services sector went to the UK in 2015, while in Italy, bilateral trade with Britain accounts for 15% of total trade in the accountancy and audit services sector. Meanwhile, 18% of Germany’s telecommunications exports were to the UK. The challenge for the prime minister is the pressure she is facing from MPs across parliament with differing views on what Britain’s future relationship should look like. During a Commons statement on the latest Brexit negotiations, May faced a string of interventions from Brexiters on her own backbenches who warned her against any move that could delay the date of Britain’s EU departure. Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at the EU, claiming its negotiating guidelines undermined the “principle of nothing being agreed until everything is agreed” and would leave Britain as a “no more than a vassal state, a colony, a serf of the European Union” during transition. “I urge [the prime minister] to model herself on her predecessor, the late noble Baroness Thatcher, and show real mettle and steel in rejecting these hostile negotiating terms from the European Union,” he said. Others asked about plans to maintain the status quo during an implementation period, leading May to confirm that she would back a position taken by Gove to leave the common fisheries policy and common agricultural policy in March 2019. However, it is unclear how the UK would then honour its promise to abide by EU laws and regulations during transition. On the other side, May was hit by question after question from Labour MPs who fear that the Conservatives will row back on workers’ rights after Brexit – in particular in relation to the working time directive. The prime minister said rights would be protected, but would not make a specific promise on that regulation in the future. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit back, saying: “These rights help prevent workers from being used and abused by their bosses. The Tories cannot be trusted to keep them. As we leave the EU, only Labour will protect jobs and our economy.” May also responded to the EU warnings by saying that a member of EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier’s team – Stefaan De Rynk – had said the UK’s deal would be a “bespoke agreement in terms of trade”. The key commission adviser told an event in London that every trade deal was bespoke, but also made clear that the advantages of the single market could only be secured by accepting the obligations. De Rynk argued that the UK would have to accept the rules during transition, while losing a place at the table, and claimed that Brexit could not be a success because it was a “mutual weakening” in economic terms. An academic, Dr Peter Holmes of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University, said that ultimately the UK would have to accept what the EU offered, but added that Canada was not the only template. “EU-Korea looks a bit more attractive than EU-Canada. It includes some services provisions and mutual recognition but offers less good market access than the European Economic Area,” he said. “But none of these models would allow an open Irish border as most people seem to understand last week’s agreement to require.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/29/trumps-america-his-impact-so-far-and-what-to-watch-for-in-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T12:00:31Z","webTitle":"Trump's progress report: his impact so far and what to watch for next year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/29/trumps-america-his-impact-so-far-and-what-to-watch-for-in-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/29/trumps-america-his-impact-so-far-and-what-to-watch-for-in-2018","fields":{"headline":"Trump's progress report: his impact so far and what to watch for next year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This is arguably the strangest presidency in America’s 241-year history. Donald Trump, billionaire businessman and reality TV celebrity, rises at the crack of dawn, compulsively watches cable news, impulsively rattles off thoughts on Twitter and lives in perpetual campaign mode, re-enacting old battles against Hillary Clinton and arming for new ones against the media, Robert Mueller and his next Democratic foe. His approval rating hovers at a historically low 40% or thereabouts, indicative of a divided, split-screen nation. His base still turns out for his rallies with quasi-religious fervour, worshipping the president and – no less importantly – venting hatred at his enemies: it is the force of anti-anti-Trumpism. But millions of Americans contemplate the awesome spectacle with a bulging-eyed horror, sickened by his worst excesses and still scarcely able to believe that Trump is president of the United States: a stress test for constitutional democracy. Here is a progress report on the 45th president so far – and what new twists and turns await in 2018. Environment Trump has taken a buzzsaw to Barack Obama’s environmental legacy, most obviously by announcing that America would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement; with Nicaragua and Syria recently signing up, the US is now the only country to stand outside it. The president has also declared an end to the so-called “war on coal”, lifted the ban on mining companies dumping waste in rivers and streams, approved the Keystone XL pipeline, cancelled a rule that would have helped prevent endangered whales and sea turtles from becoming entangled in fishing nets and drastically shrunk two national monuments in Utah. The zealous crusade – part of what his former chief adviser Steve Bannon called “the deconstruction of the administrative state” – is only likely to continue in 2018, with Obama’s signature policy on climate change, the Clean Power Plan, in the crosshairs. But so too is the resistance, with individual states, cities, businesses and campaign groups working to meet the goals of Paris with or without the White House. Healthcare, tax reform and infrastructure Senator John McCain’s late-night vote to scuttle the repeal and replacement of Obama’s Affordable Care Act was one of the biggest blows to the Trump presidency, undermining his claim to be a master deal-maker. But the more successful passage of tax reform – criticised as a handout to the rich at the expense of the middle class – will lead to the repeal of the individual mandate, the requirement to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. This could cause the health insurance market to implode in 2018 and, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, will strip health coverage from 13 million Americans a decade from now. With projections showing the tax bill will increase the deficit by more than $1.4tn, Republicans including the House speaker, Paul Ryan, are planning to slash Medicare and Medicaid to pay for the deficit explosion. But the surge of protest and activism around healthcare reform is a sign that Republicans may feel pain in the midterm elections, while Senator Bernie Sanders and others will feel increasingly emboldened in demanding a single-payer system. The next looming priority is a $1tn infrastructure programme. It has been seen as an opportunity to build bridges with Democrats, but Trump may have already burned too many. Immigration Trump tried to hit the ground running. After just a week in office, he issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days by citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen; the order also indefinitely halted refugees from Syria. It triggered confusion and protests in airports and was quickly blocked by courts, leading to revised orders and a legal tug of war that is likely to continue into 2018 – although a version of the ban is currently in effect. Meanwhile, in September, Trump announced the end of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (Daca), which protects about 690,000 “Dreamers” who were brought to the US as children, or came with families who overstayed visas. The president then quickly appeared to backtrack and pass the buck to Congress. “If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!” Unless the White House or Capitol Hill take action, nearly 300,000 people could begin to lose their status next year, and more than 320,000 would lose their status from January to August 2019. Perhaps the biggest cheers at Trump’s rallies are still reserved for his proposed wall on the US-Mexico border. Eight prototypes have been erected in the California desert and construction could begin next year – if the money can be found. Mexico has yet to agree to pay for it. Media The Trump administration began with the sound and fury of Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, ranting at the media over its failure to acclaim Trump’s inauguration as bigger than Obama’s. This set the tone for a tumultuous relationship which has seen Trump, a former reality TV host, and his allies brand the media as “damned dishonest”, “the opposition party” and “enemies of the people”. Major Garrett, White House correspondent of CBS News, told the Daily Beast there had been a cultural shift in the administration’s approach: “Disdainful of the whole set of ground rules, the whole architecture of the briefing, of the interaction with the White House press corps. The disdain is new. And it comes from Trump, pure and simple.” The president has sought to bypass the media by using Twitter, often stirring controversy, outrage and the slapping of hands on heads. But while supporters hail the Washington Post, New York Times and other outlets for playing a crucial role in keeping Trump’s authoritarian instincts in check, this can also be seen as a new golden age of satire, with Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, John Oliver, Saturday Night Live and other comedians shining a light on political absurdities in a nightly celebration of the first amendment. Race The successor to Obama, America’s first black commander-in-chief, has proved one of the most divisive presidents of all time and, more often than not, race has been at the heart of it. There was the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a civil rights protester was killed, prompting his comment that there were “very fine people on both sides”; the slow response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico; the condemnation of American football players who “take the knee” during the national anthem to make a statement against racial injustice; the dispute with the widow of an African American soldier killed in Niger; and his derogatory reference to Native Americans in front of Navajo guests. A majority of Americans (60%) say Trump’s election has led to worse race relations in the US, while just 8% say it has led to better race relations, according to a new national survey by Pew Research Center. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the African American journalist and author, published an essay entitled “The First White President” and refers to Trump as a white supremacist. The recent departure of aide Omarosa Manigault Newman leaves Trump without any African Americans on his senior staff, and his nominees to federal courts – including supreme court appointment Neil Gorsuch – are turning back the clock on diversity (91% are white, 81% are male), with grave implications for future rulings affecting discrimination and civil rights. The massive turnout of African American voters in the recent Senate special election in Alabama suggests that Republicans could pay the price at the ballot box in 2018. Russia The first year of the Trump presidency has taken place under the ever-darkening cloud of alleged collusion between his election campaign and Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed in May, following Trump’s dismissal of the FBI director James Comey, which may yet prove a case of obstruction of justice. Since then there has been a steady drip of damaging revelations, notably Donald Trump Jr’s June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer promising “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, and the indictments or guilty pleas of four members of Trump’s inner circle including the former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Such is Mueller’s pace that it seems 2018 will bring the matter to a climax. Unlike Richard Nixon during Watergate, Trump has Fox News, Breitbart News and other conservative outlets fighting in his corner, seemingly going all out to discredit and delegitimise the special counsel’s conclusions even before they are published. It could be paving the way of Mueller’s dismissal early in the new year, though Trump has denied this. The public reception to Mueller’s findings may therefore be one of the most bitterly polarised moments yet. Should he accuse Trump of collusion, there will be calls for impeachment, but Republicans on Capitol Hill will not necessarily heed them. Meanwhile the world is still waiting for Trump to utter anything remotely critical about the Russian president, Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/01/country-diary-dipper-braves-ice-cold-river-weardale-durham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T05:30:01Z","webTitle":"Country diary: dancing and diving, a dipper braves the ice-cold river","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/01/country-diary-dipper-braves-ice-cold-river-weardale-durham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/01/country-diary-dipper-braves-ice-cold-river-weardale-durham","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: dancing and diving, a dipper braves the ice-cold river","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was a morning of brittle beauty, the best kind of winter day. Last night’s magical transformation remained intact; rusty-brown bracken fronds fringed with frost crystals and ice-encrusted leaves that crunched underfoot. No hint of a thaw yet; the low elevation of the sun had left this side of the riverbank in deep shadow. The cold air stung our cheeks. In still pools beside the river, the 6mm-thick ice must have frozen gradually overnight, from the edges inwards as the water level dropped, creating concentric oval patterns with elegant art nouveau flourishes around their margins. In a few places, ice sheets remained suspended between the trunks of alders, creaking and groaning when the wind disturbed their branches. A dipper, Cinclus cinclus, came whirring down the river, low over the water surface, and landed on a rock just a few metres away. First it balanced its portly body on its right leg and stretched its left wing, preening it with its beak, then vice versa, before shifting its attention to the softer feathers of its white bib. Maintenance of insulating plumage is vital for a bird whose survival depends on feeding underwater, on the riverbed. Long-legged herons and wading birds that feed in the shallows have a heat exchanger arrangement in their legs, where descending hot blood warms chilled blood rising from their submerged feet. Dippers feed by whole body immersion, walking underwater, held down by the flowing current while they flip stones in search of insect larvae. Today the shallow water must have been only a degree or two above freezing. Then it performed that endearing “knees bend” dipper dance, bobbing up and down as if limbering up for the prospect of entering icy water to find food. It plunged in and disappeared. We waited for perhaps 15 seconds before it surfaced, swam duck-like downstream and hopped onto a rock, water droplets cascading from its wing feathers. By then, our feet were feeling the chill from standing still for too long. As we continued along the footpath we could hear the grating, warbling song of the dipper fading away behind us, announcing its presence to a potential mate, a promise of spring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2017/dec/25/esports-jennifer-lopez-gillette-audi-mercedes-benz-a-piece-of-the-action","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T12:35:19Z","webTitle":"‘They see the potential’: why J-Lo and Gillette want a piece of the eSports action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2017/dec/25/esports-jennifer-lopez-gillette-audi-mercedes-benz-a-piece-of-the-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2017/dec/25/esports-jennifer-lopez-gillette-audi-mercedes-benz-a-piece-of-the-action","fields":{"headline":"‘They see the potential’: why J-Lo and Gillette want a piece of the eSports action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If there are any doubts that computer games can become a mainstream spectator sport, then Jennifer Lopez and Stan Kroenke are not listening. The superstar singer and Arsenal’s majority shareholder have both put money into eSports teams, as the gaming competitions with millions of followers worldwide aim for even greater public appeal. Lopez has bought into a team franchise for the new Overwatch League, in which teams from cities such as Seoul, San Francisco and London play Overwatch, a mass-participation shooting game. The global competition for the game, which launches in January, also includes the LA Gladiators, run by Kroenke, a serial sports entrepreneur. Lopez and Kroenke are not alone. A host of top sport stars are investing in eSports franchises, including the Formula One driver Fernando Alonso and the former basketball player Magic Johnson. When the US-based SportsBusiness Journal released its annual list of the 50 most influential people, 10 were from eSports. Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee has taken a big step towards recognising the pursuit as a sport, opening up the possibility that eSports could feature in the 2024 Paris Olympics two years after it makes its debut at the Asian Games. The global eSports economy has grown by 34% year-on-year to $660m (£492m) and will reach $1.5bn by 2020, according to Newzoo, which provides market intelligence for eSports. It also estimates that eSports currently attracts an audience of 385 million people, the vast majority of whom follow the action online – via digital broadcast platforms like Twitch, which has more than 400m views a month. There are also sizeable audiences in the real world: the biggest eSports tournament, the Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) in Katowice, Poland, attracts more than 100,000 fans over three days. Sponsorship and advertising already account for the bulk of eSports revenue, at 38% and 22% of turnover respectively. Money flows into leagues, teams and players, but until this year interest has largely come from IT/computer-related brands like Intel and Logitech, or from fast-moving consumer goods – staple gamer fuel such as fizzy drinks and snacks. However, the kinds of brands associated with more conventional sports also woke up to the market’s potential in 2017. There were high-profile bookings from prestige car manufacturers such as Audi and Mercedes-Benz, from fashion brands like Jack &amp; Jones, and from Gillette. All were lured by a lucrative demographic: about eight in 10 eSports watchers are men in their mid-20s who have disposable income and generally shun traditional media. “We’re now starting to see the mainstream brands,” says James Dean, the UK head of ESL, the biggest eSports league organiser. “They have looked at the demographic and seen the potential.” ESL, which was bought by Sweden’s Modern Times Group for $87m in 2015, produces IEM, eSports’ longest running global event, which reached 46 million online viewers in March, up 35% on last year. Along with October’s ESL One Hamburg, a tournament for the Dota 2 fantasy war game with a prize pool worth €1m (£885,000), it attracted mainstream sponsorship for the first time this year from Gillette and Mercedes-Benz. “We seem to be at a tipping point with [mainstream] brands coming in, but the good thing is that they didn’t just treat it as a badge slap. They attempted to integrate themselves in a deeper way,” says Mark Cox, UK head of Publishing at Riot Games, the maker of League of Legends, one of the games featured at IEM. “Gillette took the step into eSports and demonstrated a real desire to integrate. They seem prepared to go in deeply from top level to grassroots. At the lower level the game is on all the time, people are constantly playing it, so they have this mass access.” Beyond splashing its logo everywhere, Gillette added one of League of Legends’ top players, Enrique “xPeke” Cedeño Martinez, to its roster of sports stars, a list that also includes the Brazilian footballer Neymar. It also set up a booth at the arena offering 3D-printed razor handles featuring gamers’ tags, or nicknames. Mercedes-Benz, meanwhile, provided branded cars for all the teams. Gillette spent a long time doing due diligence before its entry into eSports and found it was looking at an arena with significant growth rates. “If you look at the growth trajectory, the revenue, the viewing numbers, everything is going north,” says Adam Paris, of sports marketing firm H+K Strategies, which advises Gillette. “eSports is growing at a very rapid rate. Yes, it’s finding its feet, but it feels to me that we as an industry have been talking about investing in it for two to three years at trade show panel events, but I feel it’s time to move on from talking about it and make the jump.” While mainstream brands have been waiting to see enough value in eSports, they have also held back because of lingering concerns. There are thousands of competitions, no centralised organisation and a fanbase perceived as resistant to advertising. Research from the data firm Nielsen offers a more positive view on the third issue, as shown by an enthusiastic reception on social media for Mercedes-Benz’s presence at ESL One. But advertising outsiders with money to spend still struggle to know where to begin. There are a lot of tournaments, so a cull is inevitable, while ending relegation from leagues will encourage sponsors to sign long-term deals with teams. It also helps if advertisers and sponsors have employees who can demonstrate a real appreciation of the games, the teams and the fans. Nielsen data shows a decent return for commercial backers, too: Audi received a return of more than 10 times its investment during the Eleague finals and the DreamHack Las Vegas tournament at the beginning of 2017. Advertisers won’t get carried away: eSports is no NFL or Premier League. But the more popular it becomes, the more credibility it amasses among potential backers.The eSports games and players A good eSports game needs a specific appeal in order to attract mass audiences, says Michele Attisani, co-founder of gaming platform Faceit. “A top eSports game needs to have a fast-moving mix of strategy and gameplay to capture a large competitive community and create enough tension and drama to get a crowd roaring.” Popular games include Dota 2, played with two teams of five, and the multiplayer battle game League of Legends, which is eSports’ biggest game and has 100 million monthly players. The most successful eSports player of all time is the German-Iranian Kuro Salehi Takhasomi (KuroKy), aged 25, a Dota 2 pro who has earned $3.3m so far in his career. Another Dota 2 player, the Canadian Sasha Hostyn (Scarlett), 24, is recognised as the highest earning female player in eSports ever, with career winnings of $150,000. She is the first woman to compete in Korea’s top league GSL."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
