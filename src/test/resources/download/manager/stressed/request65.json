File alongside spirit-sapping efforts such as R Kelly’s Sign Of A Victory, Ricky Martin’s Cup of Life, and Anastacia’s admittedly memorable Sepp’s Gonna Sexx Ya Up. Still, at least Fifa are trying. England don’t bother any more, which is a terrible shame, as for a while they’d been world leaders in the field. Spin back to 1965 when the FA commissioned over-the-brow skiffle legend Lonnie Donegan to write a song for their upcoming tournament. He introduced us to World Cup Willie, tough as a lion, who never will give up. “That’s why Willie is favourite for the Cup!” The trad-jazz swinger wasn’t Lonnie’s best, but he did record the definitive version of Rock Island Line, and without his influence you’re getting no Beatles, so he had plenty of credit in the bank. Also England lifted the trophy with this ringing in their lugs, and there’s no arguing with results. Five years on, Sir Alf Ramsey’s squad reached the toppermost of the poppermost with Back Home. Penned by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter, the men behind Sandie Shaw’s 1967 Eurovision winner Puppet on a String and Cliff’s 1968 near-miss Congratulations, it was a catchy but emotional paean to across-the-sea yearning. Hipsters in search of deep cuts are advised to flip the single over for Cinnamon Stick, a bubblegum love song sprinkled with dreamy summer harmonies, Nobby the spiritual successor to Harry Nilsson, Big Jack channelling his inner Mama Cass. Totally Mexico. By the time England got to No 1 again with World in Motion, John Barnes was shouldering the creative burden on his own, the art of 1990 imitating the life of 1986. His daisy-age-inflected rap is commonly regarded as the 31-second pinnacle of the genre: from this point onwards, World Cup singles would never be as good again. (Neither would New Order or Barnes himself, but that’s for another day.) Embrace? James Corden? A supergroup starring members of Space and Ocean Colour Scene? No thanks! No thank you! No thanks! If 1990 represented England’s artistic peak, then 1982 was the year the squad was most prolific. Ron’s 22 were on their way to their first World Cup in a dozen years; all that pent-up frustration burst the creative dam. A double A-side was issued. England, We’ll Fly The Flag was a patriotic reworking of a 1975 advertising jingle for British Airways composed by Jake Holmes, who was getting used to having his work adapted for bespoke purposes. In 1967 he wrote Dazed and Confused, a song which “inspired” Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin to fashion his own version. On the other side: the more popular This Time (We’ll Get It Right), penned by a couple of chaps from 1970s soft-rockers and future Roy Chubby Brown enablers Smokie. This Time is identical to tracks such as Layla, How Soon Is Now and Smells Like Teen Spirit, in so much as it’s recognisable from the very first note. That takes some doing, although while the aforementioned rock classics instantly whisk the listener away on a transcendent spiritual journey, the synthesised pipes of This Time succeed only in plummeting supporters of a certain generation into an unwelcome Pavlovian funk, a reminder of childhood promises made and broken. And that three minutes of turgid oompah stomp is coming right up. The single reached No 2, no mean feat given 1982 was a great year for pop, forcing England to elbow for position near the top of the chart alongside big hitters such as ABC, Joan Jett, Simple Minds, and the Scotland squad featuring John Gordon Sinclair. For the record, Dana and Northern Ireland’s magnificent Yer Man – “Well times have been tough / Now it’s time to do our stuff!” - failed to bother the top 10. It was followed by a long player, This Time: The Album (K-Tel), which contained several seminal performances: Glenn Hoddle taking on Queen’s We Are The Champions in a note-straining style later popularised by Alan Partridge’s rendition of Close To You; Viv Anderson and Trevor Francis running through You’ll Never Walk Alone, the melody line spoken with much feeling, like Elvis delivering the last stanza of Are You Lonesome Tonight; and a narration by Ray Clemence, The Road to Spain, which served only to emphasise how fortunate England had been to scrape into the finals, and concluded with this rousing call to arms: “I know that we didn’t qualify in the way we would have liked, but hopefully that’s in the past.” Throw in singalongs of Land of Hope and Glory, Abide With Me and God Save The Queen so bombastic that even Jacob Rees-Mogg might suggest moving the sliders on the mixing desk down a notch or two, and K-Tel had a number-37 sized hit on their hands. England went home from that tournament unbeaten. Eagle-eyed readers will have noted that whenever they put some effort into a song, they end up doing OK. This doesn’t augur well for the summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/may/29/ucas-drops-need-for-university-applicants-to-declare-convictions","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T18:14:47Z","webTitle":"Ucas drops need for university applicants to declare convictions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/29/ucas-drops-need-for-university-applicants-to-declare-convictions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/29/ucas-drops-need-for-university-applicants-to-declare-convictions","fields":{"headline":"Ucas drops need for university applicants to declare convictions","bodyText":"Ex-offenders who want to study for a degree may find it easier in future to secure a place on a course after the university admissions service, Ucas, confirmed it was dropping its requirement for students to declare convictions when they apply. Until now, former prisoners and those with unspent convictions have had to tick a criminal record disclosure box when applying to university. For many it acted as a deterrent to applying, while others have been refused a place despite satisfying all the academic requirements. Ucas confirmed on Tuesday that the next round of applications, to begin studies in September 2019, would no longer include the box. Campaigners said the decision removed one of the barriers to ex-prisoners accessing higher education. As many universities aim to widen participation, Ucas says it has been working for two years with charities including the Prisoners’ Education Trust (PET), the Longford Trust and Unlock on how to improve progression routes to university for ex-offenders. The introduction of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force last week, prompted Ucas to bring forward the decision to remove the disclosure box. Ben Jordan, a senior policy and qualifications manager at Ucas, said: “Ucas is committed to ensuring that anyone who wants to study at university or college has the opportunity to apply and isn’t put off by questions on the application. “We’ll be making changes to the information we collect from applicants about unspent criminal convictions for the 2019 entry cycle. In previous years, everyone was asked to disclose whether they had any unspent, relevant criminal convictions. However, this has now been removed and we hope this reaffirms that higher education is open to everyone.” According to PET, ex-offenders have been offered places on the basis of their academic record, only to find their offer withdrawn at the last minute because of concerns about their criminal past. Georgie, a former prisoner, was elated to receive an offer to study architecture at a London university. “I couldn’t believe it. I thought this was going to be the start of something new. But then, on the day of enrolment, the university withdrew my application,” he said. “In an email, they said the reason for reversing their decision was the fact of my criminal record. This was despite the fact it was an offence I had committed in 2009, and I was fully discharged in 2012 with no restrictions against me as an individual. I was destroyed, heartbroken.” The university has since reversed its decision. Nina Champion, PET’s head of policy, said: “A week after the justice secretary encouraged businesses to employ people with convictions, PET warmly welcomes the decision by Ucas to promote second chances when it comes to higher education. “The charities PET, Longford Trust and Unlock have been working with Ucas to address some of the arbitrary and discriminatory practices that have gone on in university admissions processes, which have prevented many talented and qualified people from studying at university level. “People with convictions who are applying to university are showing a huge commitment to turning their lives around. As a society, we should be doing all we can to support them.” Christopher Stacey, a co-director of Unlock, said: “This is a significant change that has the potential to help many people with convictions see a university education as a positive way forward in their lives. “If universities are committed to widening participation, they should be considering the widest number of potential applicants. The change by Ucas provides a strong signal to universities that criminal records shouldn’t feature in their assessment of academic ability.” Georgie, who is now helping his university to improve its admissions procedures, said: “I don’t believe universities or any form of higher education institution should be willing to knock back someone just because of their criminal record. “I think ex-offenders, reformed characters, whatever you want to call them, have a lot to offer – a lot of ambition, a lot of drive, a lot of passion. We probably make the best students just for the sheer fact that we want it so desperately.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/may/30/fortnight-developer-copyright-pugb-playerunknown-battlegrounds-epic-games","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T10:55:19Z","webTitle":"Developer of hit video game Fortnite sued for alleged copyright infringement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/30/fortnight-developer-copyright-pugb-playerunknown-battlegrounds-epic-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/may/30/fortnight-developer-copyright-pugb-playerunknown-battlegrounds-epic-games","fields":{"headline":"Developer of hit video game Fortnite sued for alleged copyright infringement","bodyText":"The creator of the smash-hit video game Fortnite is to be sued in South Korea for copyright violation. According to the Korean Times, a lawsuit has been filed by PUGB Corp, a subsidiary of the publisher Bluehole. It alleges that Fortnite bears many similarities to its own title, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, which was launched several months earlier. PUBG claims an injunction was filed on Friday with the Seoul central district court against Epic Games Korea, the local office of Epic Games, a game publisher and developer based in Cary, North Carolina. An official told the Korean Times: “We filed the suit to protect our copyright in January.” Fortnite was originally released last July as a co-operative zombie-shooting game. However, after the success of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, in which 100 players fight each other across a shrinking environment to be the last person standing, Epic Games released a new version of its game entitled Fortnite: Battle Royale, which features the same premise. Since its launch in September, Fortnite has become one of the most successful games in the world, attracting over 40m players. The game is free to download on consoles, PC and mobile, but participants pay for cosmetic items such as costumes and backpacks. Epic Games made almost $300m (£226m) from such purchases in April, according to market analysis firm SuperData. Over this time, the popularity of PlayerUnknown’s Battleground has fallen. Fortnite is now the most popular game on streaming platform Twitch, while Battlegrounds has dropped to 10th place. The lawsuit is complicated. PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds was created using a games engine named Unreal Engine 4, which is developed and licensed by Epic Games. PUGB and Epic Games also share an investor – the Chinese tech company Tencent, which has a stake in both and last month contributed $15m toward bringing Fortnite e-sports to China. Copyright infringement is often difficult to prove in the video games industry, where competing publishers and developers often produce very similar titles in established genres. “In England there would only copyright infringement if it was shown that Epic copied a substantial part of PUBG,” said Alex Tutty of Sheridans law firm, which specialises in video game industry disputes. Epic Games has not yet commented on the lawsuit. “Games are a bundle of intellectual property rights, but in this case what’s most relevant is that copyright subsists in the source code and in the representation of the game on screen. Without examining the court documents it is impossible to say, but it doesn’t appear that Bluehole is saying Epic has copied the source code for PUBG to produce Fortnite. “With Fortnite, the style of the game does appear different to PUBG and given their close release dates it would seem less likely that copying took place [...] In their statement they say they are concerned that Fortnite is ‘replicating the experience’, which seems the sort of unreferenced statement that suggests that they are trying to protect the general gameplay. “Traditionally the protection of gameplay where it does not directly copy is not an action that succeeds, and rightly so.” There have been many attempts in the past to prove copyright violation in the games industry. In 1974, console manufacturer Magnavox sued Atari, arguing that the classic arcade game Pong infringed on its own patents and concepts. The companies settled out of court. More recently, the mobile games industry has seen a series of lawsuits ver games that have been alleged to have effectively “cloned” successful titles. In 2012, the US developer SpryFox launched a lawsuit against another studio 6Waves arguing that the latter’s title Yeti Town was a direct copy of its own Triple Town. The case was settled out of court. While PlayerUnknown’s Battleground has a naturalistic art style and focuses on authentic combat, Fortnite features cartoon-style visuals, fantastical weapons and the ability to build fortifications in the game world. In April, PUGB Corp launched a similar lawsuit against mobile developer NetEase, which developed two titles, Rules of Survival and Knives Out, bearing strong similarities to Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/06/six-of-the-best-new-potato-recipes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Six of the best new potato recipes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/06/six-of-the-best-new-potato-recipes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/06/six-of-the-best-new-potato-recipes","fields":{"headline":"Six of the best new potato recipes","bodyText":"New potato and beetroot salad (pictured above) Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Serves 4-6 750g new potatoes, halved 3 eggs 2 tbsp good-quality mayonnaise 2 tbsp Greek yoghurt 1 tbsp horseradish cream Salt and black pepper 4 spring onions, finely chopped 250g cooked beetroot, diced Cook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling, salted water for 10-12 minutes, until tender. Drain, leave to steam dry and cool completely. Meanwhile, cook the eggs in a pan of boiling water for eight minutes. Drain and run under cold water until completely cool. Drain, peel and roughly chop the eggs. Mix the mayonnaise, yoghurt and horseradish in a large bowl, season with salt and pepper and add most of the spring onions. Tip the cooled potatoes into the mayo mixture along with the chopped beetroot and gently toss to coat in the dressing. Transfer to a serving dish, and scatter over the hard-boiled eggs and the remaining spring onions. Chill until required or serve immediately. New potatoes with raclette and pickles Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Serves 2 250g new potatoes 2 tbsp light olive oil 1 small garlic clove, peeled, bashed and roughly chopped 400g raclette cheese, sliced To serve Cornichons Silverskin pickled onions 120g mixed charcuterie (salami, cured hams, etc) Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling, salted water for 12-15 minutes, until tender. Drain and leave to steam dry. Mix the oil with the garlic and set aside. Set a small nonstick frying pan over a low-medium heat, add half the cheese in a single layer and leave to heat and become molten – do not stir. Put some potatoes on to a couple of serving plates and drizzle with some of the garlic oil. Once the cheese is melted, use a wooden spatula to push the cheese on top of the potatoes. Repeat with the remaining cheese and potatoes. Serve immediately with pickles and charcuterie. Canarian potatoes with smoky mojo sauce Prep 5 min Cook 25 min Serves 4-6 1.5 kg new potatoes 3 tbsp coarse sea salt For the sauce 4 roasted red peppers from a jar, drained 2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 1-2 slices good white bread, torn into pieces 1 tsp smoked sweet paprika ½ tsp ground cumin 2 tbsp sherry vinegar, or red-wine vinegar 75ml extra-virgin olive oil Salt and black pepper First make the sauce. Blitz all of the ingredients to a smooth, thick but spoonable sauce. Add more bread if you’d like to make it thicker, or a splash of water to thin it out. Season to taste, then cover and set aside. Put the potatoes in a large pan and add just enough cold water to cover. Add the salt, then put the pan over a medium-high heat and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Drain and return the potatoes to the pan. Reduce the heat to the lowest temperature and gently move the pan until the water has evaporated from the potatoes and you can see a white salty crust form on the skins. Tip out the potatoes on to a serving plate and serve with the smoky mojo sauce for dunking. New potato and rosemary focaccia Prep 5 min Prove 1 hr 30 min Cook 30 min Serves 6 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g fast-action dried yeast 1 tbsp caster sugar 1 tsp salt, plus extra for sprinkling 3 sprigs rosemary, leaves stripped 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra 300g new potatoes, sliced thickly Put the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine. Finely chop a third of the rosemary, then make a well in the flour, add the chopped rosemary and oil, then gradually add 225-275ml warm water, stirring to form a soft, slightly sticky dough – you might need a bit more or less water. Tip the dough on to a lightly floured surface or use a stand mixer and knead for 10 minutes, or until you have a soft, shiny, pliable dough. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, cover and leave in a warm spot to stand for an hour to an hour and a half, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling, salted water for five minutes, until just starting to soften. Drain and leave to steam dry and cool. Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas 7. Generously grease a 20cm x 30cm tray with 5cm-high sides with oil. Lightly oil your hands, then lift the dough out of the bowl and transfer to the prepared tray, pushing it into the corners with your fingers. Stud the surface with rosemary and potatoes, cover loosely and leave to prove for 30 minutes. Drizzle the bread with more oil, sprinkle with salt, then bake for 30-40 minutes, until risen and golden and the potatoes are soft. Leave to cool in the tray for 10 minutes then transfer to a board with the help of a spatula. Cut or rip into chunks and serve at room temperature. New potato, herring and dill open sandwiches Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 10-12 small new potatoes For the dressing 3 tbsp olive oil 1½ tbsp white-wine vinegar 1 pinch caster sugar 1 banana shallot, peeled and finely sliced 1 large handful dill, finely chopped 4-8 slices dark rye bread (depending on size) 240g jar pickled herring, drained and torn into pieces Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling, salted water for 10-12 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and leave to steam dry and cool for a few minutes. Once cool enough to handle, cut into thick slices and set aside. To make the dressing, in a large bowl whisk the oil, vinegar and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Tip in the shallots, most of the dill and the warm potato slices. Gently toss to coat in the dressing, season and leave to cool to room temperature. Lightly toast the rye bread to crisp it up a little, then pile on the dressed potatoes and pieces of pickled herring. Sprinkle with the remaining dill and serve. New potato breakfast hash Prep 10 min Cook 35 min Serves 2 250g new potatoes, quartered 3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra 1 large knob butter 1 onion, peeled and cut into thin wedges ½ red pepper, sliced ¼ tsp dried chilli flakes 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 50g strong cheddar, coarsely grated 2 eggs 1 ripe avocado, peeled, stoned and diced (optional) Hot sauce, to serve Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling, salted water for five minutes. They should be just starting to soften – you don’t want them too soft. Drain and leave to steam dry. Heat half the oil and half the butter in a heavy-based frying pan or skillet over a medium-high heat. When it is bubbling, add the onion and pepper, and fry for eight minutes. Tip out on to a plate and put the pan back on the heat. Add the remaining oil and butter, turn up the heat, add the potatoes and cook for 10-15 minutes, turning gently every few minutes with a spatula, until golden and crisp at the edges. Return the cooked onions and peppers to the pan, along with the chilli flakes, season and stir in most of the parsley. Remove from the heat. Heat a grill to high. In another pan, heat a drizzle of oil and fry the eggs to your liking. Sprinkle the cheese over the surface of the hash and cook under the hot grill until the cheese is bubbling. Slide the fried eggs on top and sprinkle over the remaining parsley. Serve with diced avocado, if using, and hot sauce, if you like.

The company, which mines billion-year-old diamonds across Africa and in the Canadian Arctic, on Tuesday launched a range of much cheaper “lab-grown diamonds” created in just three weeks by scientists using a process similar to 3D printing. De Beers, which created the famous “a diamond is forever” slogan and once had a near-monopoly on global diamond production, said it was launching the new range of synthetic diamonds to meet demand for “affordable fashion jewellery that may not be forever but is perfect for right now”. “They’re not to celebrate life’s greatest moments, but they’re for fun and fashion,” Bruce Cleaver, De Beers chief executive, said. “We have always said we are a natural diamonds business. We remain a natural diamonds business.” The Lightbox brand diamonds will sell for between $200 (£150) for a quarter-carat stone to $800 for a one-carat stone. Nimesh Patel, De Beers’s chief financial officer, said the prices represented a 85-90% discount on the cost of natural diamonds. “We’re not pretending they’re unique or rare,” Patel said. “If you lose it, it’s not going to hurt as much as if you lost the real thing. It is not for those great moments in life you want something inherently precious. “If I were giving a gift to my 12-year-old daughter, I wouldn’t want to give her a natural diamond, and this a good alternative.” The diamonds will be available for sale in the US from September. There are no plans to sell them in the UK or other markets. De Beers has been making synthetic diamonds for industrial customers for decades but had avoided selling them as jewellery. Patel said the previous products made by De Beers’ Element Six unit were diamonds but didn’t look like them. “They are drilling tools for the oil and gas industry, and don’t look like diamonds. They are black and fit in the drill bit of tools used to drill wells.” The diamonds are made by a process called chemical vapour deposition. It involves pumping gases into a low-pressure vacuum. The gases react to create layers of carbon that consolidate into a single stone. De Beers said it would spend $94m creating a new Element Six factory near Portland, Oregon. When it is up and running the factory will be able to produce more than 500,000 carats of diamonds a year. Until then all the synthetic diamonds will be made in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/may/30/wilderness-360-immersive-journey-into-patagonia-vr","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T06:55:45Z","webTitle":"Wilderness: an immersive journey into Patagonia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/30/wilderness-360-immersive-journey-into-patagonia-vr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/30/wilderness-360-immersive-journey-into-patagonia-vr","fields":{"headline":"Wilderness: an immersive journey into Patagonia","bodyText":"If you’re viewing on mobile you’ll need to download the YouTube app for the full 360-degree experience.

The prime minister has faced intense political pressure over the law in Northern Ireland, where abortion remains illegal except in exceptional circumstances, after voters in the Republic of Ireland strongly backed liberalisation. But while May indicated her support for the Irish referendum decision in a tweet over the weekend, she would risk alienating the Democratic Unionist party MPs who support her government and who back the existing law if she sought to move on the matter from Westminster. Asked what might happen to Northern Ireland’s abortion laws, which do not make exceptions for conceptions by rape or incest and which allow for a maximum sentence of life in jail, May’s spokesman said it was a matter for the devolved Northern Ireland government. “The prime minister said on Sunday that the Irish referendum was an impressive show of democracy, which delivered a clear result, and she congratulated the Irish people on the decision,” he said. “But it’s important to recognise that the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to their own process, which is run by locally elected politicians. “Our focus is restoring a democratically accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland so that locally accountable politicians can make decisions on behalf of the public they represent.” Labour said May was entitled to intervene as it was a human rights issue, and that she was only refusing to do so out of political cowardice. “It gives the message that Theresa May is far more interested in protecting her very fragile government than she is in the women of Northern Ireland,” said Carolyn Harris, the party’s shadow equalities minister. “It’s purely because of her fear of the DUP that she’s not prepared to act on this. “She can act. Health is devolved but human rights are not devolved, and you can’t get away from the fact that what’s happened to the women of Northern Ireland is a human rights issue.” Harris said she expected May to have to change her mind on the issue, given the weight of opinion among many Conservative MPs. “The problem she’s got is, many on her benches think that this is wrong,” she said. “She needs to decide which party she is a member of – the DUP or the Conservatives.” The Northern Ireland assembly and administration collapsed in January 2017 after a disagreement between the DUP and Sinn Féin about a mishandled renewable energy subsidy scheme that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. There has been no progress since on forming a government, despite new elections and repeated attempts by May’s ministers to restart the process. Asked whether there was a deadline for restoring the administration beyond which London might act, May’s spokesman indicated there was not. He said: “There have been a series of talks, there’s been a number of meetings between the prime minister, the secretary of state and the parties. It’s important that we continue the work of restoring power-sharing.” The spokesman dismissed the idea of Westminster imposing a referendum on the issue in Northern Ireland, saying this “would need to be decided by a functioning executive in Stormont”. About 160 MPs have backed a letter championed by the Labour MP Stella Creasy saying that the government should legislate to relax the law on abortion in Northern Ireland. Creasy wants to force a vote by tabling an amendment to the domestic violence bill in parliament. Asked about this, May’s spokesman said that while votes on abortion in the Commons were not usually whipped on party lines, he could not comment on what might happen if Creasy’s amendment was tabled and voted on. He said: “Where Westminster has had votes in relation to this in the past there has been a free vote, but I’m not going to comment on hypothetical amendments.” He dismissed the idea that May was a “fair-weather feminist”, pointing to her record in areas such as equal pay, domestic violence and modern slavery. Asked what her message would be to women in Northern Ireland, the spokesman said: “We are working as hard as we can to get the devolved administration up and running.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/surviving-cancer-is-an-ongoing-journey-of-readjustment-not-a-bumper-sticker","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"‘Surviving’ cancer is a journey of readjustment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/surviving-cancer-is-an-ongoing-journey-of-readjustment-not-a-bumper-sticker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/surviving-cancer-is-an-ongoing-journey-of-readjustment-not-a-bumper-sticker","fields":{"headline":"‘Surviving’ cancer is a weird ongoing journey of readjustment","bodyText":"“Hey cancer, you picked the wrong bitch.” “Been there. Beat that.” “Remission rocks.” “Survivor.” “;” This is a selection of bumper stickers and tattoos devised by cancer survivors. Of these, I choose, if choose I must, the semi-colon. It is discreet, obscure, open to interpretation. To me, it signifies cancer as a pause, a clause, not necessarily the end stop; liminal, it conjures a bridge between one life and another, one self and another. Today is National Cancer Survivors Day or NCSD, an American initiative launched in 1988. It is marked with local events in various countries around the world, including the UK. In the US, NCSD groups organise parades, parties and pampering. They stock up on NCSD merchandise: visors, badges, balloons, banners, T shirts – “the one must-have item” in their catalogue. Self-proclaimed cancer survivors are an out-there bunch; to count myself among them, I should really ditch the semi-colon in favour of something defiant. I’m thinking CKMA, as in “Cancer, kick my arse.” Since I’ve just had a bowel cancer scare ruled out, it could be my little joke. But beneath the joke would be the fear: I was treated for head and neck cancer in 2014 and I don’t fancy another. But, like so many so-called cancer survivors in so-called remission, I wait for one. I wait, alert, in no-man’s land, the place to which my mind returns in between all its other preoccupations and activities. It is an eerie place, the fear of recurrence. A grenade may whistle into the expectant silence any time – or never at all. “Cancer survivor” is not a badge I reach for. Does that mean I want to hide who or what I am, or rather, who I have become? Perhaps. The very word “survivor” irks. It speaks of fighting, of scars and leaving others behind. “I battled cancer,” reads another bumper sticker. “What’s your superpower?” “Survivor” smacks of victimhood, too, and of exposure to dreadful atrocities. Some people are hit with depression, insomnia, anxiety and PTSD; “survivor” implies that your cancer is history, which is one reason Macmillan prefers the phrase “living with and beyond cancer”. It’s not catchy, but it factors in the impact cancer has beyond the duration of the disease itself. I can only describe that impact as a feeling of living in a perpetual after. It is uncharted territory, unfamiliar, forever changing, full of surprises. Here the survivor analogy holds: to live well here requires survival skills, adaptability and resilience chief among them. In the immediate aftermath of my curative treatment in 2014, long before my very recent and rather begrudging acceptance of my place in no man’s land, a new, post-cancer landscape started to form around me. I didn’t know what was going on. I kept looking for the yellow brick road that would lead me back to the old, pre-cancer me. Various emotional aftershocks threw me off track, came after me, in fact, like the San Andreas Fault. The first, shortly after the initial elation after getting the all-clear, was impatience, followed by gratitude, guilt, compassion, fear and, finally, a sense of failure. There were no half measures; each was felt with a head-splitting intensity that eventually sent me running to my Macmillan psychologist. In short, I thought I was going bonkers, and that no one else had the slightest inkling. “That is exactly how my brother felt when his cancer treatment was finished,” a friend said of her sibling, who’d had cancer in his 20s. “The after for him was the hardest part.” I was wildly impatient for everything to be normal again. I laugh at that now, think: fat chance. Friends already thought I was. It’s so great that you are back to normal, they’d say. But I couldn’t eat and was frightened of recurrence. I know, isn’t it fantastic! I would reply, which made me feel alone with my non-normal, wanting-to-be-back-to-normal self. When I told Dr Suleman, a UCLH Macmillan clinical psychologist, he said: yours is a common response. In other words, quite normal. “Have some answers ready that will work for you when people ask you how you are,” he suggested, “such as: I am doing well, thank you, I am on the road to recovery. Or, the recovery is going well.” The insertion of the word “recovery” was all that was needed to let others know that I was a work-in-progress. Some time after this, I was able to start trying to eat again, and was very grateful. The trouble was, I suddenly felt grateful for everything. I’d walk down my street, stop, and say thank you to the paving stones. In the park, I’d see the grass, the leaves on the trees, the twigs and the gnarly nodules on the twigs, and I’d thank them for being there. It made me see Wordsworth and Coleridge in a new light; I never realised what a lot of energy it took, being moved by nature all the time. When I told Dr Suleman I couldn’t think for all the things I had to thank every second of every minute, he said: “Are you religious?” “No,” I said, somewhat disingenuously. “Why?” “Because you sound a bit hard on yourself.” “I just want people to know I am grateful.” “How could you measure your gratitude?” “What do you mean?” “How could you go about showing people how grateful you are? What would be the proof?” I thought for a long time, and then said: “I don’t know.” “That’s because there isn’t a measure for gratitude. You could go on and on, pushing yourself to be more and more grateful. But you could never be grateful enough because you’ve got no way of measuring it. So give yourself a break.” I wasn’t quite off the hook, though, because I couldn’t stop being grateful to be alive, which triggered survivor’s guilt. I remember walking on Hampstead Heath and thinking of Primo Levi. I know how you feel, I wanted to say. But the Italian Jewish chemist was a Holocaust survivor, and all I had endured was stage 1b cancer. To have had Levi and myself in the same thought felt obscene. Meanwhile, every time I went back to hospital, or saw someone who looked diminished, I felt sharp pangs of compassion. The fear that my luck wouldn’t last had by now intensified; sure enough, nine months after the all-clear, a lump appeared where it shouldn’t. It turned out to be benign, which in turn intensified the pressure on me to be even more grateful. The final emotion to send me reeling was a sense of failure. I felt I had fallen short of what is expected of a cancer survivor. I told Dr Suleman I was supposed to be a better person. “Who says?” “Everyone. Everyone says that when you have cancer, it’s a transformative experience. You see everything differently, and you become good.” “Did you like your old self?” Blimey, what a question. “It was all right, I suppose.” He didn’t know the half of it. “Then go back to your old self. Go back to where you were before. I give you permission.” “Really? No transformation?” “No transformation.” The pressure to have what UCLH Macmillan Support specialist Vikky Riley calls a “cancer epiphany” was off, and that was a big help at the time. Today, however, living as I do with both my cheer and my fear, I still haven’t found the old self to which Dr Suleman said I could return. Instead, I hover between two selves, as if waiting for a better fit to emerge. I am that semi-colon. I think of the bardo, that between-consciousness state so vividly explored in George Saunders’ novel Lincoln in the Bardo. His dead cemetery dwellers are trapped in a Dantesque limbo. They don’t want to leave where they are, and, for very different reasons, neither do I. But I am definitely up for time out from the round-the-clock mental processing and deal-making with the Ferryman. Walking down my street today, I sometimes ask myself why it is that I want so badly to live; I interrogate why the will to do so is so strong. Of course it is. In which case, I shouldn’t berate myself for wishing I could stop listening out for the grenade that might come my way any time soon – or never at all.

Tommy Cowan, 20, and Georgia Jones, 18, both from Havant in Hampshire, died in hospital after attending the Mutiny festival in Portsmouth on Saturday. Police said on Tuesday they were questioning a woman from Waterlooville and a man from Havant, both aged 21, on suspicion of the supply of class A drugs. The arrests follow those of two 20-year-old men, from Havant and Waterlooville, and a 22-year-old man from Cosham, Portsmouth, on the same premise. The three had been released from custody but remained under investigation, Hampshire police said. On Monday evening, more than 100 friends and relatives of Cowan and Jones gathered at Leigh Park Gardens, part of Staunton Country Park in Havant, to release balloons and messages in their memory. Cowan’s father, Damian, who attended the tribute event, told Portsmouth paper the News he appreciated the support of everyone who had attended. He said: “This is everyone’s way of saying goodbye. There are people here who knew either Tommy or Georgia, from different parts of their lives but we have all come together to remember them. “It shows how much they were loved, that so many people could come at such short notice. I do appreciate that everyone has shown up today for support. It has been hard but it is nice to see everyone come together from both sides.” Cowan, also known as Tommy Bakeer, is understood to have had a one-year-old son. In a statement released by police, his father said: “My baby boy, I miss you so much and can’t believe you are gone. Fly high with the angels and sleep well. Until we meet again, I love and miss you always.” Jones, a care worker who worked with people with learning and physical difficulties, was described by her family as a “very strong-willed and opinionated young lady”. In a statement released by Hampshire police, they said: “She was a shoulder for anyone that needed it. She loved her job. We just hope she uses her ‘indoor voice’, wherever she may be.” The pair were among 15 people admitted to Queen Alexandra hospital from the event that night, after which organisers issued a warning about a high-strength or bad batch of drugs. The festival organisers later cancelled the event’s second day, which Craig David and Sean Paul were due to headline, as a safety precaution. Police said Jones had become ill at the festival at King George V playing fields at 7.10pm, and Cowan was found collapsed 20 minutes later. A third person who was taken seriously ill is no longer in a critical condition, a spokeswoman for the Queen Alexandra hospital confirmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/03/transfer-window-summer-2018-every-deal-europes-top-five-leagues","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T16:10:47Z","webTitle":"Transfer window 2018 – every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/03/transfer-window-summer-2018-every-deal-europes-top-five-leagues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/03/transfer-window-summer-2018-every-deal-europes-top-five-leagues","fields":{"headline":"Transfer window 2018 – every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/may/29/london-tumbles-in-city-rankings-for-rent-and-shopping-ubs-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T16:35:07Z","webTitle":"Sterling’s dip leaves Londoners worse off  – UBS survey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/london-tumbles-in-city-rankings-for-rent-and-shopping-ubs-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/29/london-tumbles-in-city-rankings-for-rent-and-shopping-ubs-survey","fields":{"headline":"Sterling’s dip leaves Londoners worse off  – UBS survey","bodyText":"The price of renting property and shopping in London is among the highest in the world but earnings are now lower than most other major capitals, including Paris, Berlin and Madrid, according to a study by wealth manager UBS. London ranked eighth most expensive city in the world in 2018, with Zurich and Geneva the priciest. But when judged by gross earnings, Londoners are 24th in the world, with salaries just half of those in Geneva and a third below the levels enjoyed by New Yorkers. Three years ago, when UBS last carried out the study, London was ranked sixth on prices and 13th on earnings. The comparisons are based on prices and earnings converted into US dollars, and underline how much London has fallen on a global basis since sterling plummeted after the Brexit vote. To afford an iPhone X, the average Londoner would need to work 11.3 days to earn the $1,390 required, compared to 6.7 days in New York for $1,088. UBS also found that while food prices in dollar terms have dropped significantly, avocados are peculiarly expensive, with prices in London the second highest in the world. Salaries for many jobs have fallen in dollar terms in London since UBS last carried out a detailed examination of prices and earnings in 2015. “If we look at salaries for a product manager, London topped the table in 2015, but salaries have since risen significantly in Madrid, Paris and Berlin. Today they outpace London, where average salaries have declined and are now the lowest of the four European cities,” the Swiss bank said. Secretaries in London also used to earn comfortably more than their colleagues in other European capitals, but no longer. “A secretary in London in 2015 was likely earning around $28,606 a year – a few hundred more than secretaries in Berlin and several thousand more than those in Paris and Madrid. Since then, salaries have climbed everywhere and the gap between London and other European capitals has closed,” it said. American and Canadian consumers emerge as the world’s wealthiest in real terms, with their spending power far superior to Europeans apart from Switzerland. Residents of Los Angeles emerge as the most well-off in the world in purchasing power terms, with the spending value of their incomes 48% higher than Londoners. LA is joined by Miami, Chicago, Toronto and New York among the top 10 cities in the world for local purchasing power. London was ranked 23rd, just ahead of Riyadh and Nicosia. One silver lining is that rents in London have fallen. UBS said that in 2015, rents in London in dollar terms were the highest of any European capital, with an average of $2,851 per month. That made a flat in London more expensive than in Paris ($2,445), and markedly pricier than in Madrid ($1,049) or Berlin ($894). It said that today, average London rents have declined to $2,548, falling below Paris, where they have risen to $2,854. But that will be cold comfort for most people in the city as, while rents in the capital will appear cheaper in dollar terms, in sterling terms they are little different. The UBS study has been running since 1971 and gives a snapshot of how relative prices and earnings have changed around the world since then. Within London, the figures show that a primary school teacher in 1976 earned around $8,079 a year, significantly more than a car mechanic ($5,807) and a bus driver ($7,485). But today the primary school teacher, on $34,756, earns less than the bus driver ($34,802) and the car mechanic, now on $36,626. Salaries in Dublin, once the poor relation of London, have risen dramatically as Ireland’s economy has boomed. In 1976, a Dublin bus driver earned 32% less than a London bus driver in dollar terms, but today they earn around 25% more. The gross income of a bus driver in Johannesburg was almost double that of one in Athens in 1971, but is now just half what their Greek counterpart earns, while in Zurich a bus driver currently earns $86,238, or not far off triple what a teacher picks up in London.

By any political standard, it’s been a tumultuous time since, but two things that have remained constant are my faith in our party and a commitment to doing what’s best for it. That’s why, when the party was being buffeted by strong countervailing forces, I was honoured to be approached to stand for the leadership. I hope I’m continuing to show the kind of leadership that’s about doing what’s best for the party by creating space now for more voices to be heard. Part of Green party leadership is knowing when to step up and when to step aside. I won’t be seeking nominations to be a candidate in this year’s leadership election, when the process starts on Friday, but instead will be focusing even more on work in parliament and in my Brighton constituency. I believe that Jonathan and I have shown the power of working together, since we became joint Green party leaders in September 2016, and it’s now time for me to show the power of letting go. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved in two very busy years: thanks in large part to the extraordinary work of staff and volunteers, the party has been transformed in so many positive ways, with progress towards our shared goals well underway. One of our priorities was to secure political backing for updating the party’s structures, which have changed very little since the 1970s. We are driving forward a root-and-branch review of how the party operates and organises itself. We want to be a more inclusive party, to see better representation of our members at all levels, faster decision-making and an ability to better capitalise on the next green surge. We focused relentlessly on getting Greens elected across the country, meeting thousands of activists from South Shields to Solihull, Lewes to Liverpool, who are at the forefront of our march forwards. And we’ve championed investment in our amazing regional staff to build a more powerful election machine. The effects are already clear – our best local election results ever earlier this month brought the Green party to every corner of this country as we broke on to councils as diverse as Birmingham, Burnley and Richmond. The polls now show us ahead of Ukip, and closing in on the Liberal Democrats. For a smaller party such as the Greens, it is always going to be hard to swim against the political tide. But in the last few years, against the odds, we have strengthened our position as a leading force in progressive politics. We have not been eclipsed by the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, but instead have used these unique circumstances to push for even more radical change, and to put our boldest policies yet before the public. Who would have thought a few years ago that we would be talking in primetime interviews about shortening the working week that we would have the government on the run on environmental protection, That pressing Amber Rudd on arms sales to Saudi Arabia in the general election debate would go viral? or that we would have hours of radio shows dedicated to discussion of our proposals for evidence-based drug laws? When it comes to the EU, we’ve not been afraid of championing membership of the world’s most successful peace project and being in the forefront of the movement for a people’s vote. As politics moves in our direction, I’m proud that we have consistently been out in front of the establishment. We are living through climate breakdown. We have an economy that prizes pointless jobs and condemns people to a lifetime of drudgery. We have an electoral system that excludes everyone outside of swing seats. Britain needs a party that makes the desirable feasible – that says what needs to be said, not what is deemed acceptable by the powers-that-be. The Green party must always be an insurgent force for good, consistently asking the big questions that matter. I have faith that our party, under a new leadership team, will step up to the challenge that our increasingly febrile times present, and give the people of this country the bold alternative that is so desperately needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/09/world-cup-2018-six-unheralded-talents-to-watch-in-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T11:13:39Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018: six unheralded talents to watch in Russia | Nick Ames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/09/world-cup-2018-six-unheralded-talents-to-watch-in-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/09/world-cup-2018-six-unheralded-talents-to-watch-in-russia","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018: six unheralded talents to watch in Russia","bodyText":"Aleksandr Golovin (Russia) The whipped free-kick that flew past Petr Cech during Arsenal’s 4-1 victory over CSKA Moscow in April proved little more than a footnote, but its provider looks destined for headlines. What little positivity Russians are able to muster about their team’s prospects tends to centre on the drive and vision that Golovin, who only turned 22 in May, brings to the midfield. He is that rarity among the host nation’s fairly staid current vintage: a genuine game-changer who makes those around him perform better. Premier League clubs are watching closely and if Golovin, who was born in the Siberian town of Kaltan and primarily played futsal growing up, can inspire Russia to some semblance of success he may be able to take his pick. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic (Serbia) Speculation linking Milinkovic-Savic with an £80m move from Lazio to Manchester United provokes a certain degree of déjà vu. He is 23, 6ft 4in, motors between the boxes, boasts a marvellous creative range and has become a consistently dominant figure in Serie A. Everything Paul Pogba was trailed as being, in other words, and the Serbia midfielder is on track to be at least as good. Brilliance at club level has given way to enigma status for his country, though. Slavoljub Muslin, the manager who guided Serbia to qualification for this World Cup, was relieved of his duties in November largely because he did not fit Milinkovic-Savic into his system. Mladen Krstajic, his successor, is unlikely to make that mistake this summer and if things click straight away the world could see a potential superstar talent come of age. Alireza Jahanbakhsh (Iran) In Iran eyes still mist over at memories of the breakaway goal scored at France ‘98 by the feted right-winger Medhi Mahdavikia, which sealed victory over the US and helped earn him a successful 12-year stint in the Bundesliga. For several years Jahanbakhsh was compared to his Team Melli predecessor but a blistering season in the Netherlands with AZ Alkmaar suggests he can be even better. He finished 2017-18 as the Eredivisie’s top scorer with 21 goals, adding a dozen assists – some return for a wide player – and if comparisons with Mohamed Salah are premature it is easy to see the connection. Jahanbakhsh – who turns 25 in August – bristles with pace and power, and finishes explosively. Those facets might yet make negotiating Group B a more viable prospect than it looks for Carlos Queiroz’s side, while earning Jahanbakhsh a move to a top league in the process. Pione Sisto (Denmark) It was a source of considerable relief in Denmark when Sisto, jinking inside from the left before curling a slick finish into the far corner, finally injected some quality into a drab friendly against Panama. Not only because it won them the game; Sisto’s intervention also suggested Denmark have another way of breaking opponents down when Christian Eriksen is not firing. Sisto, born in Uganda to South Sudanese parents, is something of a throwback: a dribbler who is not afraid to try things, a stylish winger with a flair for the unexpected, but one who can fit into a system, too. At 23 he already has two seasons in La Liga with Celta Vigo under his belt; nine assists and five goals in 2017-18 were a good return and the task now is to bring that productivity into a major international tournament. Denis Zakaria (Switzerland) The numbers looked good in Zakaria’s first Bundesliga season with Borussia Monchengladbach, and the visual evidence was not bad either. Signed from Young Boys last summer, the 21-year-old was ranked as the league’s second-fastest player and also came joint top of the pass-completion charts. Discipline was his only significant issue, with 11 yellow cards suggesting that a primarily defensively minded player has yet to curb an overenthusiastic streak when it comes to recovering possession. He is a serious contender to start for Switzerland, though, and could partner Granit Xhaka, the man he has effectively replaced at club level, in an all-action deep midfield axis. Zakaria – who has Congolese and (like Sisto) South Sudanese ancestry – could be a trump card for Vladimir Petkovic in what looks likely to be a tough fight with Serbia for second place in Group E. Christian Cueva (Peru) The emotional outpouring of support for their captain Paolo Guerrero – seemingly banned from the World Cup after a positive cocaine test – has occupied Peruvian hearts and minds in the run-up to Russia 2018, but they might cheer up quickly enough once the action gets underway. That is because Cueva, the 26-year-old Sao Paulo playmaker, has the ingenuity to lift them out of Group C and is perfectly capable of filling the team’s hero-shaped void. Cueva, a diminutive figure at a shade under 5ft 7in, is all darting feet and smart ideas: his wiles brought four goals, all of them significant, in qualifying, and most observers agree he is currently playing the best football of his career. Any iteration of his top form could see fretfulness quickly turn to joy on the streets of Lima, Cusco and beyond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/10/world-cup-russia-2018-england-messi-ronaldo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T10:47:55Z","webTitle":"Messi and Ronaldo primed for final World Cup hurrah as England get real | Daniel Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/10/world-cup-russia-2018-england-messi-ronaldo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/10/world-cup-russia-2018-england-messi-ronaldo","fields":{"headline":"Messi and Ronaldo primed for final World Cup hurrah as England get real","bodyText":"At least this time nobody has fallen into the trap of thinking England might actually win the damn thing. Nobody inside the England camp has proclaimed they are going to Russia to bring the trophy back home. And perhaps just as important, nobody in the media is feverishly backing our boys to do it. Not yet, anyway. Instead, the mood seems restrained compared to previous tournaments, as if the penny has dropped that England have not done a great deal in the World Cup since the year – the one between 1965 and 1967 – that Jürgen Klopp has suggested we no longer mention because of the pressure it puts on the team. Sensible advice bearing in mind England’s footballers have managed a grand total of six wins in the knockout stages of major international tournaments since, well, That Year Again. The last one was 12 years ago, against Ecuador, and if all this sounds downbeat it’s difficult, in fairness, to be a cheerleader when the most recent memory of England in a major tournament is Iceland’s Viking thunderclap, Harry Kane’s corner-taking and the mutinous chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” from Euro 2016. Roy Hodgson’s reign as England manager ended within minutes of that defeat to Iceland and he spent the night in a corner of the bar of the team’s hotel in Chantilly, with nobody else around and the lights off. The next day, when he was persuaded to speak to the media, the top three buttons of his shirt were undone, his hands were trembling and his fingernails were bitten to the quick. Alternatively, there’s the memory of Steven Gerrard at the 2014 World Cup, when England were eliminated inside a week and left Brazil before the players had even finished their course of anti-malaria tablets. Gerrard hadn’t slept much either. He was “hurting bad, broken”. England’s captain sat silently – dark smudges under his eyes, a week’s worth of stubble – staring into the distance as Hodgson talked about a “period of grieving”. Let’s not be too negative, though. England have some talented players, and indeed a sprinkling of excellent ones, and at the time of writing nobody has been struck down by the curse of the metatarsal just yet. Yes, Gareth Southgate’s team have been drawn against Belgium, third in Fifa’s world rankings, but there are more obliging games, against Panama and Tunisia, first. If those can be won, England will already be assured of a place in the knockout stages before they meet Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard et al. Nothing can be taken for granted, of course, given the ordeal against Iceland nudges out the defeat to the USA in the 1950 World Cup as the most mortifying result in England’s history. Likewise, it does not feel too long ago since the Sun splashed with an “E-A-S-Y” front‑page headline after the 2010 World Cup draw to let us know it would be England against Algeria, Slovenia and – to make it work – the Yanks. England stank out that tournament, too. It does help, though, that expectations this time are more realistic. Kyle Walker has said England will need a “miracle” to get their hands on the trophy in Moscow and it puts things into context to imagine the runaround Southgate’s team would likely be given by a France XI made up of players Les Bleus have left out. When Southgate named his squad the only controversies were the absence of Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey. Didier Deschamps, the France manager, has omitted Alexandre Lacazette, Anthony Martial and Karim Benzema, not to mention Dimitri Payet, Aymeric Laporte, Kingsley Coman and others who would be mandatory picks for most other teams. France will take some beating but so will Brazil, Germany and all the other usual suspects. Otherwise, there will be two players in particular who are determined to make a lasting impression. Lionel Messi will be 35 when the World Cup is held in Qatar in 2022. Cristiano Ronaldo will be 37. Between them, they have won the Ballon d’Or 10 times. Yet, realistically, this will be the last opportunity these two modern greats get to make a decisive impact on this stage. Can one of these two showmen be remembered for Russia 2018 in the same way that Diego Maradona is for Mexico 1986, Pelé in 1970 and so on? Messi was named the best player of the last World Cup. It felt generous at the time and, harsh as it may sound, the fact is we are still waiting for a truly Messi-inspired tournament. As for England, it does not feel too outlandish to imagine Southgate’s team navigating a route to the quarter-finals. The problem is that Brazil or Germany could be waiting and that is usually the point when we are reminded, as John Cleese once put it, that the nation that invented the sport has barely seen a penny in royalties ever since. All of which means it is probably not such a bad thing that the English football public is hardened to disappointment. Serial disappointments, indeed. Two more of these tournaments, on the back of this one, and the chances are it will be 30 years since “30 years of hurt” became part of the soundtrack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/how-old-bikes-are-giving-refugees-a-new-lease-of-life","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"How old bikes are giving refugees a new lease of life | Martin Love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/how-old-bikes-are-giving-refugees-a-new-lease-of-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/how-old-bikes-are-giving-refugees-a-new-lease-of-life","fields":{"headline":"How old bikes are giving refugees a new lease of life","bodyText":"The Bike Project Price restored cycles from £195 To donate or volunteer thebikeproject.co.uk Often it’s the simplest ideas which make the most sense, and the Bike Project is definitely one of those. The charity’s aim is to “take second-hand bikes, fix them up and donate them to refugees and asylum-seekers”. The only response to that is: “Well, of course!” It was mentoring a Darfuri refugee while at the LSE, and giving him his old bike, that gave Jem Stein his lightbulb moment. Noticing all the abandoned bikes in the city, he asked himself: “What if they could be rebuilt and given to people who actually need them?” He decided to set up a charity – and five years later the Bike Project has refurbished and donated more than 3,000 bikes to some of the most vulnerable people in London. “In the capital alone,” says Jem, “it’s estimated that about 13,500 asylum seekers arrive each year. In that same period, at least 27,500 bikes are abandoned in streets, parks and estates across the city.” It’s the Bike Project’s mission to bring those two groups together. One person who has benefited from the scheme is Ussamane Silla. He arrived in the UK from Guinea-Bissau in 2013. “For a refugee, having a bike is very important,” he says, “because who else will give you the money to travel? Public transport is costly and London is a big place.” Jem spells out the maths: “London is expensive, especially when you’re trying to navigate the asylum process on just £37 a week. No one should have to choose between a meal and catching the bus. A bike can save you £21 a week on fares, which is £1,000 a year.” A bike will help refugees access food banks, legal advice, healthcare, education and much more. The Bike Project now employs 10 people at its shop in Denmark Hill and its workshop under the arches in Deptford. The charity has several mainstays: it gives away refurbished bikes; it trains some refugees to become bike mechanics; it runs a servicing operation; and it has a website where the best donated bikes are sold to raise funds. Scrolling through the pictures of lovingly spruced-up bikes is addictive. Buy one and you help yourself and a refugee. Looking at the bikes made me think of puppies at the pound waiting to be picked for a new home… The project’s most recent initiative is cycle training for refugee women, empowering them to take control of their own transport – perhaps for the first time in their lives. The team noticed that almost all the donated bikes were going to men, so they set up women-only workshops to teach women to ride from scratch. Amena arrived from Syria 18 months ago. She says she “knew how to ride a bicycle when I was a little girl – for fun – but not as a grown-up. I was afraid about having an accident.” She joined other women from Eritrea, Albania and Sudan to master their new bikes. One of the project’s cycling instructors, Claire Donaldson, says it’s humbling to witness the joy they feel. “It is amazing to see them transform from hunched and quiet to confident and beaming when they get out in the fresh air on a bike.” For more information or to donate or volunteer as a cycling instructor, go to the Bike Project.

Her father grew up in Hyderabad, her mother in a British-Indian family in Birmingham. After starting pre-med classes, Mirza switched to creative writing and later gained a place at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop, whose alumni include Ann Patchett and Curtis Sittenfeld. Her debut novel, A Place for Us, is the first book published by Sarah Jessica Parker’s new imprint for Hogarth – the Pulitzer-prizewinning novelist Paul Harding called it “a work of extraordinary and enthralling beauty”. The novel explores tensions within a devout Muslim family in California around the turn of the 21st century. How did the novel come about? The first image came to me when I was 18. It was of a family gathered at the wedding of their eldest daughter and, as they’re about to take the family photograph, their son, Amar, cannot be found. The entire novel was written as a way for me to understand this moment. What were the dynamics in this family? What caused this fracturing [with Amar]? I began writing it in one of my creative writing classes and on my own at weekends. How did you react when you heard that Sarah Jessica Parker was publishing the book? I had just landed in NYC and stepped out of the subway the first time she called. The first thing I remember saying was: “Oh my God, I recognise your voice going back years.” I ducked into a McDonalds to escape the noise, and while we spoke, people kept asking to share the table with me. Such a surreal moment. I was stunned during our conversation, because she spoke so thoughtfully about the very scenes that meant the most to me in the book and I felt so comforted that she understood what those scenes meant to the characters, to me. We don’t see many novels exploring lives of Muslims in the west. Was that part of your motivation for writing it: to promote a better understanding of the Muslim community? No, not at all. In fact, when I first realised that the family was Muslim, I hesitated, because I was aware that this was an under-represented voice and I didn’t want to take advantage of it. But I couldn’t stop thinking about the characters. Once I began writing about them, they became human to me, they were not capital-letter Muslims, capital-letter post-9/11. To me it was always a story about brothers and sisters, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons – they just happened to be Muslim. When Hadia is about to get married, aged 27, you write that “She deeply respected hijab but did not wear it for herself”. Do you share her view? I wore hijab from when I was nine until I was about 22. It wasn’t out of a lack of respect or care that I took it off. It was the opposite of that. It was because I have so much respect for hijab and for the women in my life who are devoted to it, that I realised my own personal relationship with it was not for the same reasons. It has made me who I am and it will always be a part of me, even if it is not visible to the outside world. You decided to practise your faith in your own way? Yes. I get quite emotional talking about it. I think that people reduce the hijab. One thing that really frustrated me when I first took it off, is that many people, including some of my friends, reacted by saying: “Now you’re liberated.” But to me that’s a simplification. For me, my mother is liberated when she chooses to wear it, and all the years that I wore it, that was my decision. It struck me that the social limitations within the community in the novel are useful in storytelling terms. Even the most innocent-seeming romantic encounters become freighted with risk and suspense. Yes, absolutely. As a fiction writer that was really exciting territory for me, because the details can be so small, and they hum in a way that is indicative of the secret inner life of these characters. From the outside perspective, a stick of gum being offered to somebody is just a stick of gum, yet to Hadia at 13, it’s so private and cherished. That’s where I feel fiction is offering the most – when it says to its reader, this is the private, secret life of this character and you have the privilege of accessing their thoughts. Do I detect a West Side Story reference in the title [the song Somewhere has the line “There’s a place for us”]? I’m unfamiliar with West Side Story, I know that sounds crazy to say. Is that a reflection on your relationship with pop culture? I grew up with a TV but I didn’t start listening to music until I was 13. We just weren’t allowed to listen to music growing up. Until I realised that my dad listening to Bollywood songs is still music, and I told him: “If you can listen to Bollywood music, I can listen to my music.” He thought about it for a moment and said “You’re right”, so I started listening to music. But I feel like, because of that, I’m discovering stuff that people have always known. I was maybe 22 when I heard the Rolling Stones for the first time. And my reaction was: “What. Is. This?” What did your family make of your desire to become a writer? When I first moved to pursue my undergraduate degree, I was in agreement with my dad that I would become a doctor. But I was miserable in my pre-med courses, so I switched to creative writing. Saying that I needed to write this novel was jarring for us at first, but, in the end, no one has been more supportive than my family. My brothers have been my readers, they have believed in the novel when I have doubted it. It was my brothers who were, like: “No, it works.” My grandmother in England – she recently passed away – what she wanted was for me to settle down and get married to somebody from the community. Every time I’d call her with news of my book, her response was always: “Yes but when are you going to get married?” The last time I saw her before she died, she said: “Write your book with your whole heart, and finish it, and enjoy that… And then will you get married?” I was so moved because it was her first time acknowledging that this was what I wanted. What do you get up to when you’re not working? I’m learning how to box. As a kid my brothers played soccer, and every year we’d go buy them cleats for the new season, and I would see these pink boxing gloves and I would want them and I never got them. And so now, not only is boxing a really fun way to exercise, it also feels like I’m allowing a younger version of myself to have what she wanted then. What’s next? I guess I’ll always write, but I want to wait until I feel as compelled as I did with this story. [A Place For Us] is like a long love letter to the life that was mine right until I started writing it. It was a way to go back. Through the characters I could ask the questions that I had been asking myself my whole life. What kind of questions? What does it mean when asserting yourself as an individual can be seen as a betrayal to the home, or culture, or faith that you’ve come from? How do you navigate those instances? What do you owe to your loved ones? And what do you owe to yourself if there’s a conflict there? So the questions faced by the characters in the novel are also questions you have had to confront? Those moments arose in small or large ways throughout my life. It’s always been my goal with my family to try to be as respectful and thoughtful to them as I can, while not compromising my inner voice. In a beautiful way, it’s through the novel that I can understand that dynamic between the individual and their greater community with so much more complexity than when I was in it. It’s helped me understand where I’ve come from and who I am and what is important to me. • A Place for Us is published by SJP for Hogarth (£12.99).

Philip Alston, who acts as the UN’s watchdog on poverty and inequality around the world, spells out in blunt and unremitting terms the damage wrought by child poverty in one of the world’s richest countries. In his findings on conditions in the US, he highlights the personal suffering of millions of children who are left without food, homes and futures and warns that such deprivation is killing the American dream. He lays out the brutal statistics: 18% of American children – some 13.3 million – were living in poverty in 2016, making up almost a third of the total poor; more than one in five homeless people are children, including 1.3 million school students who were without a home during the academic year; infant mortality, at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, is almost 50% higher than other advanced nations; the US ranks 25th out of 29 industrialised countries in terms of the amount it invests in young children. “This is tragic and unconscionable, to treat so many children in this way, but it is also a totally self-defeating economic policy,” Alston said in an interview with the Guardian. “The ramifications are clear and considerable – the US is building a future citizenry that is under-nourished, under-educated, under-stimulated, and that in turn will rebound dramatically on the society itself.” While child poverty has been a pressing problem for many years in the US, Alston warns that policies being pursued by the Trump White House are likely to make it much worse. Food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, helped almost four million children stay out of the clutches of poverty in 2015 – now Trump is proposing in his 2019 budget to cut the program by almost a third. Carolyn Miles, president and chief executive of Save the Children US, said the food stamp program was critical for struggling families. “This is certainly not the time to be cutting these benefits in America,” she said. A new report by Save the Children on the US finds that children in America are at least twice as likely to be poor as children in Norway, Iceland, Slovenia, Ireland, Sweden and Germany. That disparity rises to more than five times as likely to be poor when compared to children in Finland and Denmark. One of the most insidious aspects of poverty among the under-18s is how it eviscerates individuals’ prospects of advancement, and thus undercuts one of the main glues of American society – the almost universally shared belief in the “American dream” of an equal opportunity to achieve success through hard work and aspiration. Alston points out that the US has one of the lowest rates of social mobility between generations of any rich country – not least because child poverty is so prevalent. “We know children who grow up in poverty have very little prospect of escaping from it,” he said. “That’s being locked in, here, ensuring the American dream is rapidly becoming the American illusion.” Some of the most visceral child poverty can be found in rural areas, particularly in the midwest and deep south, paradoxically where a lot of Trump voters live. Carolyn Miles recently returned from Duncan, Mississippi, a small town of about 500 people in the heart of depressed cotton country where a stunning 80% of the children live in poverty. “This area is completely desolate, it’s a really rough place to live for kids. Families can’t put food on the table every day. Every single child in local schools is on the federal school lunch program, many schools serve breakfast and some even dinner,” she said. Save the Children works with Mississippi children to try to improve literacy rates. They have found that by the time they start kindergarten at age four, many kids are already 18 months behind the national average educational ability. “We are trying to get these kids a shot, just to have a chance at an even playing field,” she said. The paucity of health care and other services, particularly in rural areas, forces parents into having to make painful decisions about how to allocate their meager incomes. Alston, who carried out an official UN fact-finding mission in December that took him to some of the poorest parts of the US, came across a particularly emotive dilemma. “Parents explained they had to decide between buying their child a Christmas present or saving it for essential food or shoes. There was no money to spare, and anything that was done out of the ordinary, such as buying a present, would penalize the child,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/29/rwandas-30m-arsenal-sponsorship-divides-opinion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T18:15:11Z","webTitle":"Rwanda's £30m Arsenal sponsorship divides opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/rwandas-30m-arsenal-sponsorship-divides-opinion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/29/rwandas-30m-arsenal-sponsorship-divides-opinion","fields":{"headline":"Rwanda's £30m Arsenal sponsorship divides opinion","bodyText":"Anyone confused as to why Rwanda chose to spend £30m putting its name on the sleeve of Arsenal’s football shirts could begin to answer their question by looking at President Paul Kagame’s Twitter feed. In common with many of his countrymen, Kagame is an avid fan of his “beloved club” and the president – who has been Rwanda’s head of state for almost as long as Arsène Wenger led Arsenal – has regularly offered his view on club matters over the past six years. To critics, the deal is an example of an autocrat who runs one of the poorest countries in the world indulging a private passion while subsidising one of the richest clubs in world football. But to Kagame’s supporters and some in the marketing industry, it’s a canny move that is already getting people thinking about the impoverished country’s tourism industry, which offers lakeside resorts and walks with mountain gorillas – with one expert estimating that the £30m investment could help to bring in £300m of new revenue. “Rwanda wouldn’t have occurred to me as a place for tourism, so perhaps you do need to shock people,” said Kelvyn Gardner, the head of international development at the Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association. “What you’re buying with sponsorship it’s brand recognition. Football shirts can be overmonopolised by things like online gaming companies, so it will stand out.” Kagame, a former army commander who emerged victorious at the end of the Rwandan civil war, has been president of the country since 2000. He recently changed the constitution to enable him to run for a third election, which he won with 98.8% of the vote, amid accusations of dirty tricks against those who dared to stand against him. In that time he has attempted to transform the mountainous central African country into a prosperous nation. The capital, Kigali, is largely safe and clean, with a construction boom that includes five star hotels. Despite this there are few dissenting voices in the media, limited political opposition and it remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Much of the development work locally has been assisted by aid from western nations, with British and Dutch politicians this weekend complaining that they are sending money to a country that is now supporting a high-profile football team. Clare Akamanzi, the Harvard-educated chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, defended the agreement, saying the money for sponsorship came from a different pot from international aid. “Anyone who criticises our deal with Arsenal on account of Rwanda being poor or an aid recipient, either wishes for Rwanda to be perpetually so, or doesn’t understand that in any business marketing costs are a key component of a company’s expenditures,” she said, insisting the country is determined to double its revenue from tourism to $800m over the next six years. That said, the deal could be as beneficial within Rwanda itself as abroad. Premier League football is ever-present in the country, with countless radio phone-ins dedicated to the Premier League. Fans crowd into bars and betting shops to watch matches while local minibuses are covered in the colours of English teams – with the north London club among the favourites. “Many Rwandans, especially in urban areas, are fans of Arsenal,” explained Rwandan accountant Charles Sac, who is a supporter of Unai Emery’s side. “I think it’s entertainment and associated success; involvement of black players in earlier years was a factor.” Sac said the reaction to the sponsorship deal had been positive in his country: “Rwandans were pleasantly surprised by the news and still excited.” As part of the deal Arsenal players will visit Rwanda to hold training camps, while the country’s logo will appear at the side of the pitch at the Emirates stadium and on the backdrops for post-match interviews. “This decision demonstrates Rwanda’s continuing reorientation from a francophone to an anglophone country,” said Timothy Longman, a professor at Boston University and author of Memory and Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda. “The group that dominates Rwandan politics, society, and economics today grew up mostly in refugee camps in Uganda, They brought back to Rwanda with them a connection to many things associated with Britain, including Premier League football.” He speculated that while the decision “may be popular with the English-speaking elite in Kigali” many Rwandans could think of a better use for the money. Regardless, at least one person will be happy. Earlier this month Kagame delivered his verdict on Arsenal’s recent performance after they were knocked out of the Europa League by Atlético Madrid. He said the defeat “should not have been the kind of ending of an era” but insisted their recent lack of trophies was “long coming”. “Blame the owners,” Kagame concluded, shortly before his country signed the sponsorship deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/29/italy-risk-new-financial-crisis-wake-coalitions-collapse-investors-alarmed-mood-against-euro","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T23:14:41Z","webTitle":"Italy at risk of new financial crisis in wake of coalition's collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/italy-risk-new-financial-crisis-wake-coalitions-collapse-investors-alarmed-mood-against-euro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/29/italy-risk-new-financial-crisis-wake-coalitions-collapse-investors-alarmed-mood-against-euro","fields":{"headline":"Italy at risk of new financial crisis in wake of coalition's collapse","bodyText":"Italy risks careening into a new financial crisis after the Bank of Italy said the country’s leaders could not “disregard” financial constraints and its commitments to Brussels. Markets around the world were also shaken with the Dow Jones industrial average in New York falling almost 400 points, or 1.58% on Tuesday as investors shifted money into the safe haven of US bonds, putting pressure on bank shares. Stock markets in Asia also dropped sharply at the opening of trade on Wednesday. The Nikkei in Tokyo was off 1.3% while the ASX200 in Sydney fell 0.6%. The Kospi index in Seoul was down 1.57%. Escalating worries that Italians may be poised to take a tougher stand against the euro prompted a round of accusations and finger-pointing among EU officials, including a rare admonishment by Donald Tusk, the European council president, who said EU institutions needed to show “respect to voters” in Italy. “We are there to serve them, not to lecture them,” Tusk said after the German budget commissioner, Günther Oettinger, had suggested the market turmoil in Italy would show voters the dangers of supporting populists. Ignazio Visco, the Bank of Italy chairman, said the country was at risk of losing the “asset of trust” with investors. On Tuesday the Italian bond spread, a leading indicator of investor concern, rose to its highest level in four years. The euro, which Italy uses as its currency along with 18 other countries, dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar for 10 months at $1.153. The crisis was set off late last week when the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Lega, which had been attempting to form a government, insisted that the president, Sergio Mattarella, approve their choice for finance minister, Paolo Savona, a fierce critic of the euro. Mattarella vetoed the nomination and the incoming populist government collapsed before it had taken power. The president appointed a new prime minister, Carlo Cottarelli, a former director at the International Monetary Fund, who was expected to present a list of ministers to Mattarella on Tuesday. The president’s spokesman said after a meeting that the two officials would meet again on Wednesday morning. Cottarelli is expected to lose a vote of confidence in the Italian parliament, which in turn is likely to lead to a new election, possibly as early as July. In Brussels, politicians were supportive of Mattarella’s move, which was seen as protecting Italy’s position in the eurozone. But there was also concern that the populist parties could win a bigger parliamentary majority in the new election, creating a bigger risk for the future of the eurozone. In an interview with the German news network Deutsche Welle, aired on Tuesday night, Oettinger said: “My concern and my expectation is that the coming weeks will show that markets, that government bonds, that Italy’s economic development could be so drastic that this could be a possible signal to voters not to choose populists from left and right.” The Italian embassy in Brussels responded by tweeting to Oettinger and Tusk: “Italian voters do not need any teaching. Free #elections and #democracy are key European values.” Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest group in Brussels, the European People’s party, of which the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is a member, said he trusted in the Italian constitution and its president. The leader of the socialist group, Udo Bullmann, a German MEP, said Mattarella had done “a great job” and had “safeguarded the future of the next generation”. But Philippe Lamberts, the leader of the Green group, warned against complacency. “Let me be clear: I have no time for the government that was being formed in Italy, but like it or not that was the choice made by Italians and at some point in time you have got to accept that,” he said. “Would it have endangered the eurozone? Yes, of course, but what we have seen over the weekend [is] that tensions in the financial markets have not calmed down but been exacerbated.” Oettinger late apologised for being “disrespectful”, although he claimed that he was only reflecting the “actual” market reaction. A statement from the European commission said: “The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, wishes to put on record his conviction that Italy’s fate does not lie in the hands of the financial markets. “Regardless of which political party may be in power, Italy is a founding member of the European Union that has contributed immensely to European integration. President Juncker is convinced that Italy will continue on its European path. The commission is ready to work with Italy with responsibility and mutual respect. Italy deserves respect.” Guy Verhofstadt, the former prime minister of Belgium, who leads the liberal group, said the crisis proved the need for an EU finance minister with a budget and a banking union to ease the pressure on the eurozone during such periods of political instability. “Everyone knows what we need to do,” he said. Mattarella has faced a political storm and threats of violence over his decision. Some critics argue the two populist parties that emerged as the winners of the 4 March election had a mandate to challenge the euro. On Sunday Mattarella emphasised that he had accepted most of the populist government’s recommendations, despite “perplexities” over its choice of prime minister. “I shared and accepted all the proposals made for the ministers, except the one for the minister of the economy,” he said. He had sought an individual who “may not be seen as the promoter of a line of reasoning … that could probably, or even inevitably, provoke Italy’s exit from the euro. This is evidently quite different from having a strong attitude within the European Union in order to improve it for the better from the Italian point of view.” Until the weekend, investors had remained calm about the prospects for the Italian economy and its public sector debt mountain, which ranks as the third largest in the world behind the US and Japan. But the Milan stock market slumped on Tuesday to it lowest level since July 2017, 3,000 points lower than its best performance this month. Fiona Cincotta, a senior market analyst at the spread betting firm City Index, said Italy’s unsettled domestic politics had also damaged confidence in London, where the FTSE 100 closed down 1.26%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/30/government-urged-to-use-rbs-majority-stake-to-veto-branch-closures","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T23:01:36Z","webTitle":"Government urged to use RBS majority stake to veto branch closures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/30/government-urged-to-use-rbs-majority-stake-to-veto-branch-closures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/30/government-urged-to-use-rbs-majority-stake-to-veto-branch-closures","fields":{"headline":"Government urged to use RBS majority stake to veto branch closures","bodyText":"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/29/ruth-davidson-urges-pm-to-prioritise-nhs-over-tax-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T17:01:27Z","webTitle":"Ruth Davidson urges PM to prioritise NHS over tax cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/29/ruth-davidson-urges-pm-to-prioritise-nhs-over-tax-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/29/ruth-davidson-urges-pm-to-prioritise-nhs-over-tax-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Ruth Davidson urges PM to prioritise NHS over tax cuts","bodyText":"Ruth Davidson has urged the government to prioritise NHS spending over tax cuts in a speech setting out what she called “centre-ground Conservative” vision, likely to be interpreted by many as a manifesto for a possible future bid to lead the party nationally. The head of the Conservatives in Scotland, who has been repeatedly linked with a move to a Westminster seat, also used the address at Glasgow university to call for a new land value-based tax, and to reiterate her opposition to a set target for migration. Davidson has regularly brushed aside talk of a shift into national politics, but her popular appeal and liberal style has seen her mentioned repeatedly as a possible future Tory leader, most recently the mooted idea she could succeed a brief Michael Gove stint in the job. In her speech, Davidson said that Scottish Conservative plans to eventually unseat the SNP at Holyrood would require a coherent philosophy, saying her own came from “the centre-ground Conservative tradition – as someone who wants to use government to enable people and communities to grow and prosper”. This would include having to make difficult decisions on NHS spending, she argued, saying it was right for ministers to have sought to reduce the tax burden on working families. She added: “But the UK government has a choice to make. And, if that choice is between extra spending on the NHS or introducing further tax breaks beyond those already promised, I choose the NHS.“Either way, we should have the honesty to recognise that this is a moment where we as a country have to choose one way or the other. My view is that people across the UK would not forgive us if we allowed this moment to pass.” Davidson also reiterated her opposition to Theresa May’s official target of reducing annual net migration to the tens of thousands: “I see neither the sense nor the need to stick to an immigration figure devised nearly a decade ago, which has never been met and does not fit the requirements of the country.” She also called for a liberal approach to post-Brexit immigration from EU nations. Davidson, whose fiancée is Irish, said: “We want EU citizens who live here to stay. I have an interest here: I speak as someone who is about to marry one. And to assure EU citizens and others of that wish, we need to do more.” Describing a lack of affordable housing as the most pressing crisis facing young people, Davidson said one idea could be to create a new tax to target the increase in the value of land when planning permission is granted. “This happened when we built new towns in the 1950s and 60s,” she said. “Landowners are paid the value of their land, but the extra funds that comes from planning permission can be used to invest back into the community.” The latest speculation about Davidson’s potential national ambitions followed her coming together with Gove to help launch a new Tory thinktank, titled Onward. In the speech she said in had been “a genuinely uplifting experience to see a group trying to grapple with these big, strategic challenges we face as a country, and doing so with real vigour and purpose”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/29/letter-tom-murphy-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T15:30:23Z","webTitle":"Letter: Tom Murphy obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/29/letter-tom-murphy-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/29/letter-tom-murphy-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Tom Murphy obituary","bodyText":"I got to know Tom Murphy during the early 1960s in pubs along the Fulham Road favoured by Irish migrants to London with an interest in theatre. Already he had a reputation on the strength of A Whistle in the Dark, rejected by the Abbey theatre in Dublin, unwilling to stage the reality of Irish men lost in England. Tom was as tough and as bitter as some of his characters: he scorned the delusions of post-revolutionary Catholic Ireland and cited seeing in a pub a souvenir ear in a matchbox from a tribal fight. He laughed with deep irony and sang beautifully, his tenor voice soaring in the Abbey bar after first nights of later plays. By then, he had been forgiven as a changed country accepted and even welcomed him to reveal and revel in primal elements of its imagined self. After the premiere of The Sanctuary Lamp, in which more lost souls seek solace in a church, he took exception to an overheard discussion by a group of visiting American academics about its length: “I don’t write plays for people who complain about missing the last bus home.” But afterwards he cut an entire act, and commercially the play was the better for it. He loved and was enthralled by women, at times flagrantly and at cost to both parties. These adventures surfaced professionally, notably in the later plays in which the totems of male strength and anguish were taken by female leads, no less strong and destructive. In his later years he seemed to revert into that west of Ireland man with a navvy build and ease. He was driven to the end, revelling in productions that impacted upon audiences, gratifyingly vain on reviews of overseas performances and touchingly vulnerable to praise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/29/balenciaga-shirt-t-shirt-cost-ikea-bag-tote-crocs","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T17:52:05Z","webTitle":"Holy shirt: Balenciaga is selling a 'T-shirt shirt' for $1,290","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/29/balenciaga-shirt-t-shirt-cost-ikea-bag-tote-crocs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/29/balenciaga-shirt-t-shirt-cost-ikea-bag-tote-crocs","fields":{"headline":"Holy shirt: Balenciaga is selling a 'T-shirt shirt' for $1,290","bodyText":"It’s the perfect gift for the man who has everything except, perhaps, self-respect: Balenciaga’s “T-shirt Shirt”.

You can get your hands on one for just $1,290 (£974). That might seem like a lot but remember you’re getting a T-shirt and a shirt, it’s basically buy one get one free. Balenciaga are the masters of convincing their customers to part with large amounts of their money while making them look ridiculous. Ever since creative director Demna Gvasalia took the helm of the Spanish fashion brand, they seem to have been trolling us mercilessly with fashion that’s designed to go viral. Their $2,000 Ikea-inspired bag made waves on the internet last year, as one imagines it was designed to do. Ikea even put out a tongue-in-cheek guide helping you tell a genuine, 99 cent, Frakta bag from a luxury imposter: apparently if it rustles, it’s real. Then there was Balenciaga x Crocs, released unto the world at Paris Fashion Week last year. Despite costing $850 and looking like they were designed by a preschooler, the Balenciaga platform crocs sold out before they were officially for sale. The danger of making clothes based around simple farce is it’s easy for counterfeiters to copy your work. Some online have already been getting creative: Trolling the fashion world seems to be working out well for Balenciaga: last week the chief executive of Kering, a global luxury group that manages the likes of Alexander McQueen, Saint Laurent, and Gucci, said that Balenciaga was the fastest growing brand within its group. They attributed this growth to men and young millennials most of whom, one imagines, aren’t actually buying the more outlandish items like T-Shirt Shirts but Balenciaga’s more down-to-earth designs.

Ever since 1981, when the writing of Austrian paediatrician Hans Asperger was introduced to an English-language audience, autism professionals have embraced Asperger syndrome (AS) as a condition. It excludes the most debilitating intellectual, communication and physical difficulties associated with classic autism. Between 1994 and 2013, AS was an official diagnosis in the American psychiatric bible The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is still widely used internationally. But who was Hans Asperger and how did the medical establishment come to honour him? Over the decades, a myth has evolved that Asperger, who worked in Vienna during the second world war, was akin to Oskar Schindler. He had talked up his young autistic patients’ potential in order to protect them not only from the legalised mass sterilisation of the “genetically unfit”, but also to prevent them from becoming victims of the more covert “euthanasia” T4 programme which led to the murder of over 300,000 disabled people. But now the American historian Edith Sheffer has systematically destroyed that persona in Asperger’s Children, a superbly researched account of his career. She has drawn on records recently discovered by the assiduous Austrian researcher Herwig Czech. These wartime documents reveal that, instead of saving children in his care, Asperger wrote wholly damning descriptions of at least 42 of his patients. His signature is on the paperwork that transferred them to the notorious Am Spiegelgrund clinic where almost 800 children died due to neglect or lethal overdoses. It would have been impossible for Asperger not to know his patients’ likely fate; the killings at the asylum led to public protests. Sheffer also gives a long-overdue and gripping analysis of Asperger’s own writing before, during and after the Third Reich. She details his wartime denigration of the cognitively and physically disabled children in his care. She frames him as complicit in “negative eugenics” and a careerist. Jewish doctors were forbidden to practise public medicine during the Anschluss. While never a Nazi party member, Asperger did not protest about his more senior Jewish colleagues’ exclusion. Aged 28, he became the head of the Curative Education Clinic within Vienna’s prestigious children’s hospital. Sheffer writes: “In May 1938, Asperger began to work for the Nazi state as a psychiatric expert for the city’s juvenile court system. He also applied to consult for the Hitler Youth.” Sheffer reveals that Asperger actively endorsed the forced sterilisation laws, citing his words that some people were “a burden on the community” and that “the proliferation of many of these types is undesirable for the Volk, ie, the task is to exclude certain people from reproduction”. The pioneering British autism psychiatrist Lorna Wing did not know this history when she first came across Asperger’s writing in the late 1970s. She had been assessing young patients at the Maudsley psychiatric hospital in London. They did not fit into existing categories such as autism or schizophrenia because they had no obvious intellectual disabilities or delusions. However, their profound difficulties with obsessive thinking and social interaction meant that they still needed help, particularly as they were at high risk of depression. Casting around for a diagnosis, Wing was attracted to Asperger’s writing on what he had called “autistic psychopathy” in the 1940s. His work had never been translated into English; Wing relied on her husband’s schoolboy knowledge of German for an initial translation of Asperger’s 1944 thesis. She was impressed by the Austrian paediatrician’s detailed, sympathetic descriptions of his patients. They sounded just like the young men she was encountering at the Maudsley. There was a stigma around the word “autism” so Wing proposed a new diagnostic term, Asperger syndrome. She wrote that while autism was associated with “muteness and total social withdrawal”, for parents “the suggestion that their child may have an interesting condition called Asperger’s syndrome is more acceptable”. Wing only met Asperger once, not long before he died in 1980. His strong belief that “curative education” could help appealed. As well as being a psychiatrist, she had a profoundly autistic daughter and shared Asperger’s view that appropriate education could improve outcome. Wing’s own thesis was that autism was a spectrum disorder and did not always entail intellectual disability and that variant could usefully be termed Asperger Syndrome. He became the ideal figurehead for the burgeoning autistic rights movement, which argues that autism is a difference to be accepted, rather than a disease to be prevented or cured. The godfather of 1940s autism in America, child psychiatrist Leo Kanner was widely disliked for blaming poor parenting or “refrigerator mothers” for causing a debilitating disorder; Asperger maintained autism was inborn and could come with positive abilities. It’s hard to believe that anyone will want to identify with Asperger syndrome after reading Sheffer’s extremely disturbing but very lucid book, but what should replace it? Wing syndrome, perhaps. Certainly it would honour a doctor who cared for all autistic people and worked tirelessly to make their lives better. • Asperger’s Children by Edith Sheffer is published by W W Norton &amp; Co (£20).

The issue of honesty has reared up again and again during the course of Josh Tillman’s career as Father John Misty, not least because of his own obfuscation. Last year, he told the Observer his lyrics “are the most true things I will ever say”, but in the same interview he also said the truth about him lay somewhere between believing his songs to be truthful reporting or seeing them as “beta-male, self-aware trickery”. The interviews Tillman gave to support Pure Comedy last year suggested a man drifting free of his moorings, and God’s Favorite Customer is full of rootless desolation. Hotels are a theme, not as symbols of travel and freedom, but for dissociating one from place, for leaving one adrift. The Palace finds the narrator “living on housekeeping and room service”, but dependent on something more – “it’s only been three weeks and a bag of speed from Jamie the PhD”. He doesn’t want to leave, but knows he needs to be fixed, because “I’m way in over my head”. In Mr Tillman – the album’s most beautiful melody, one that sounds as if it has existed forever – he’s checking in, so divorced from reality that the reception staff have to tell him the other people are not actors on a movie set. “Is there someone we can call?” it concludes, “Perhaps you shouldn’t drink alone?” Closest to home, perhaps, is The Songwriter. “What would it sound like if you were the songwriter / And you made your living off me?” Tillman asks. “Would you undress me repeatedly in public / To show how very noble and naked you can be?” It’s a reminder that “confessional” writing is a morally compromised act, since it exploits those who have no desire to confess. As ever, the music is lush and 1970s-styled, albeit not as lush as before: it’s only rabbit fur in texture, rather than mink. But Tillman’s voice – which rarely gets mentioned in considerations of his success – is as wonderful as ever, clear and true, and warm and approachable, even if close examination reveals the deep damage beneath the veneer. So is the car crash real? If it’s CGI, the effects are better than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/jun/01/build-empathy-classroom-lab-refugees-loneliness","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T06:17:41Z","webTitle":"How to build empathy in the classroom, one story at a time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/jun/01/build-empathy-classroom-lab-refugees-loneliness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/jun/01/build-empathy-classroom-lab-refugees-loneliness","fields":{"headline":"How to build empathy in the classroom, one story at a time","bodyText":"With the pressure on teachers and schools to prepare students for exams, or – as in my case – getting them ready to move from primary to secondary school, it’s easy to lose sight of the values pupils learn in our company. I was reminded of this recently, after a project about refugees prompted one to tell me: “I used to think that refugees were different from us. Now I don’t.” Another said, “This was probably some of my favourite work that we’ve ever done. We’re learning about the real world and how we’re all part of it. Like, everyone, not just us and the people we know.” That work was part of a pilot project my school, Moorlands primary academy in Norfolk, was trialling for EmpathyLab. As a teacher, I’ve long been aware of the importance of using stories to help develop children’s understanding of other people. But I hadn’t thought about how to embed it more systematically into the classroom until I was at an English conference in 2015. There, I was introduced to Miranda McKearney, founder of the Reading Agency. She shared research by the Cambridge University professor Maria Nikolajeva which found that “reading fiction provides an excellent training for young people in developing and practising empathy and theory of mind, that is, understanding of how other people feel and think”. A genuine shift in attitudes My school got involved as part of a long-term strategy to improve children’s attitudes to school, each other and the local community. The five EmpathyLab topics that teachers were encouraged to explore were friendship, loneliness, bullying, refugees and homelessness. At Moorlands, my year 6 class focused on refugees first. We spent time reading books, such as Boy Overboard by Morris Gleitzman and Welcome to Nowhere by Elizabeth Laird, as well as non-fiction including Who Are Refugees and Migrants? by Michael Rosen. The impact on the children was striking. It was the first thing that they spoke to their parents about at the end of the day and they immediately wanted to have a class meeting to think of ways that they could help. Several of them talked about how when they had seen stories about refugees on the news they didn’t really pay attention before, but felt they now would. The school invited speakers from Amnesty International and the local charity Great Yarmouth Refugee Outreach Support (Gyros). Each pupil wrote a letter to a child refugee from Syria as part of Amnesty’s Write for Rights campaign, and the two Gyros representatives (who were both refugees) shared their stories of fleeing home. To hear genuine first-hand accounts about life as a refugee was a unique experience for the children, and caused a genuine shift in their attitudes. Before getting involved with EmpathyLab, we might have just tried to raise some money, which is perhaps more akin to sympathy rather than empathy. The school also organised a refugee sleepover for the year 6 students. They were told they could only bring five items with them in a plastic bag to give them a small insight into what it would be like to be a refugee. This led to much discussion and, even though they knew they would be going home in the morning, many talked about how difficult it was to choose. ‘I’ve always had empathy, I just didn’t know what it was called’ The focus on empathy across the year had a significant impact on the children’s attitudes – and led to an improvement in their emotional vocabulary and comprehension skills. The Amnesty letters were undoubtedly the most powerful pieces of written work my students have produced, simply because they knew there would be a genuine audience for their work. Year 6 students have since been involved with planning lessons about refugees for other year groups, which has created a real sense of cooperation and teamwork among the class. I have also been struck by the thought that empathy had never been taught explicitly to them before. One child told me: “I’ve always actually had empathy with other people, I just didn’t know what it was called.” This year, the whole school will be involved with the project, focusing on loneliness. One of the year 4 classes, inspired by the main character in The Old Woman Who Named Things by Cynthia Rylant, has already arranged and hosted a tea party for 30 elderly residents from the local village. It’s just one example of how a focus on empathy has improved relationships between our school and the local community. Going forward, the project has made me think carefully about the books I read to the classes and those the school buys for the library. Not all books in a classroom need a message, but when they have one, we must be prepared to discuss it with children. As one parent said to me when asked for feedback, “I love how you’re teaching them about the wider world and the difference that they can make to it, not just getting them ready for SATs”. That’s something I believe all teachers want to do. Jon Biddle is a year 6 teacher at Moorlands primary academy in Norfolk.

Özgür Mumcu’s The Peace Machine does both: it is as much a rollicking Ottoman steampunk adventure – full of wit, tongue-twisters and roguish escapism – as it is a carnivalesque take on contemporary politics. Mumcu – a Turkish journalist, academic, free-speech activist, now novelist and generally dashing polymath – carries a lightness in his prose that runs counter to the weight of his life. Its burdens began when he was a teenager with the assassination of his journalist father. Turkey currently ranks 157th (out of 180 countries) on the World Press Freedom index and Mumcu has followed his father into journalism and fearlessly opposed the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He faced four years in prison for a newspaper column he wrote about the president, but was acquitted of defamation charges in 2016 – the whole affair a frightening experience that he now coolly dismisses. (“Compared with the state of the affairs in Turkey,” he says, “my lawsuit was an unimportant incident.”) He’s accepted a Right Livelihood award (sometimes called the “alternative Nobel prize”) on behalf of Cumhuriet, the Turkish newspaper he writes for. In a country where writing is a dangerous occupation, Mumcu is now a bestseller. The Peace Machine follows Celal, a street urchin turned aesthete and erotic writer. A duel forces him to leave Istanbul for France, where he comes upon plans for a machine that can bring peace to the world by producing electromagnetic waves and vibrations that “influence the human body”. Celal becomes embroiled in a conspiracy to activate the machine, which involves inciting a revolution in Serbia using a circus as cover. The 41-year-old author is posing a provocative question, which he puts to me: “Would we want a machine that would bring peace at the expense of our free will if millions of lives could be spared?” Mumcu isn’t sure if his father’s death influenced his writing – “but I am sure he had a huge impact on my way of thinking.” Uğur Mumcu was a prominent investigative journalist and secularist, and is now widely revered in Turkey. On 24 January 1993, when Özgür was 15, Uğur was killed by a car bomb outside their family home in Ankara. “Some Islamist militants were sentenced,” Özgür says, “but their whole network and its ties were never properly investigated.” Uğur’s research went to the heart of Turkey’s turbulent political system. Everyone from the CIA and Mossad to a Turkish deep state have been suspected of being behind the attack. To this day, hundreds of people gather in Ankara on the anniversary of his death; to this day, people are still calling for a wider investigation. “A trauma of that magnitude made me want to understand the human nature and the origins of violence,” says Mumcu. “It also forced me to constantly search how we can all have a peaceful existence.” What might surprise some is that the book’s heroes want to switch The Peace Machine on, rather than destroy it; a prominent defender of individual liberties has written a heroic tale of striving for peace – but by authoritarian means. His novel, however, is as much a thought experiment as it is a cautionary tale of rhetoric. “Electromagnetism,” begins one of the book’s characters, “is perhaps the most democratic force in the world. It exists everywhere in every single moment.” This agile eloquence tries to justify authoritarian technology, the novel’s seemingly light style having a seductive effect: danger lurks in words, and in history. At a time when fake news and historical revisionism are rife both in Turkey and the English speaking world, it’s hard not read Mumcu’s book – which offers a secret, alternate explanation for real-world events – as an exploded, critical example of these ideological narratives. But Mumcu denies having any of that in mind: he knew he would write a novel, eventually, and this is just the story that came to him. But he concedes that conspiracy theories and fake news are “a very efficient weapon for those who want to promote an authoritarian agenda by offering simple explanations and pushing people towards a black–and–white fallacy. Conspiracy theories and populism are like toxic barrels poisoning the public democratic debate.” However, he was consciously making a comparison between now and the era before the first world war. “Both periods are marked by technological developments and inventions,” he says. “It is also a period where the old world is about to die … We live in an age of inventions and of technological eruption. Technological changes send silent shockwaves to societies. These shockwaves shake the fundaments that were thought unshakeable. The socio-economic order is also no longer tenable. It may be a little painful to live in such times but I find such periods of time serve as a perfect background for storytelling.” With all the recent talk of “late-stage capitalism” and the influence of technology on politics, Mumcu may have a point. But he is also wise to avoid direct allegory in the book. Instead, he touches on a general feeling shared by many: that we’re coming to the end of something. In the English-speaking world, free speech has become a cause celebre for rightwing pundits. Everyone from US attorney general Jeff Sessions to your garden-variety internet troll is complaining that political correctness is stifling it. But this argument is often a smokescreen used, ironically, to silence opposing views. “The English-speaking world and most other parts of the world are challenged by the ascent of the populist authoritarian tendencies or regimes,” Mumcu says. “What’s a relatively new phenomenon for you is old news for us.” He is a writer in a country that “is dominated by a single party and its leader’s speeches and images. [Erdoğan’s] critics are trying to make their voices heard under the threat of getting fired, prosecuted or put into prison.” And Mumcu fears that, if this rise in authoritarianism goes unchecked then, even in apparently settled democracies, it’ll be the left defending free speech once more – from a threat far more menacing than student protesters. Shortly after The Peace Machine was first published, Mumcu found an article he’d written, aged 12, for a school newspaper. Its title was Is Peace a Dream? Almost three decades later, he says: “It is possible to say that with this book I have finished that article.” Decades of thought and action – all under tremendous pressure – have gone into Mumcu’s debut. But as much as the novel is a reflection of modern Turkey, it is also about something near-universal: how the joys of humour and adventure persist, even in the most adverse circumstances. The Peace Machine by Özgür Mumcu, translated by Mark David Wyers, is published by Pushkin Press, priced £12.99.

Who is protecting them?","bodyText":"One of the most remarkable things that came out of the Irish referendum was the personal testimony of women who had been forced to journey to England for medical care. But some – poor or migrant or disabled women – recounted how even this option wasn’t available to them; unable to travel, they had no choice but to take the gamble of a pill bought from the internet. It’s a striking insight into the black-and-white thinking imposed on pregnancy: women who could not even afford a flight on Ryanair for a safe abortion were somehow expected to be able to afford to feed, house and clothe a child. Beyond Ireland, this denial of the material reality of raising a child is an ongoing issue – in abortion debates and beyond. Indeed, the same voices so ardently protecting the “unborn child” are often strangely quiet when it comes to support for children once they are outside the womb. This convenient cognitive dissonance has long been a feature of rightwing attitudes: arguing to restrict a woman’s reproductive rights while supporting measures that push children into poverty. (Some British rightwing – often male – journalists couldn’t resist stepping in over the Irish debate too.) Avoiding this hypocritical “concern for children” does not require a particularly complex position: a civilised society would give women the choice not to continue with a pregnancy and in turn support a child’s wellbeing if they are born. And yet it is a concept with which many still seem to struggle, including our own government. The Conservatives have long positioned themselves as the party of family – from cruel so-called protection of the “traditional family” such as the anti-LGBT Section 28, 30 years old this month, to David Cameron’s pledge to use the family to solve social problems, and 2017’s backbench Manifesto to Strengthen the Family, pitched as Theresa May’s key social narrative. At the same time, their small-state ideology can make it devastatingly difficult for a low-income parent to look after a child. Look at the controversial “two-child” limit to child tax credits under universal credit (UC). From its inception, it was predicted the policy would lead to hundreds of thousands of additional children living in poverty, but it’s now emerging that some women are even feeling forced to have abortions because they can’t afford to go ahead with the pregnancy. “It wasn’t planned but it was very much wanted. I was crying as they wheeled me in,” one woman told the Mirror this month about her abortion; without the safety net of tax credits, she had no way to afford another baby. Women in Northern Ireland in similar positions have an even more restricted choice: the rape-exemption clause that gives some women on UC a financial reprieve endangers women who haven’t reported their attack to the police (in Northern Ireland, failure to report a crime is an offence) and, as the renewed calls for reproductive rights in light of the Irish vote has highlighted, Northern Irish women have no legal access to abortion in their own country if they feel they can’t raise a child. Recent years have in fact seen a determined removal of support from low-income mothers – everything from forcing single parents (90% of whom are women) to look for work once their child turns three or have their benefits sanctioned, to the benefit cap, a policy so regressive it was actually ruled to be unlawful when forced on single parents with toddlers. Just this week, it came out that a third of low-income families are missing out on state-funded free food vouchers – a scheme designed to help pregnant women and those with young children afford fruit, vegetables and milk. Much like Sure Start and child tax credits, these vouchers were brought in by a Labour government to reduce inequalities between wealthy and poor children, based on the understanding that if it takes a village to raise a child, it often requires a government to ensure they don’t live in poverty. It’s no coincidence that, as the welfare state has been pulled back, the number of children in poverty is rocketing to record levels. In the post-crash austerity era, this sense of social solidarity towards children has noticeably lessened. Under each policy to remove state support from parents there’s a lurking narrative that working-class women are “breeding too much” or that low-income children are drains on the “hardworking taxpayer”. (“Why should I pay for someone else to have more kids?” is the rejoinder on most articles advocating child benefits). In the real world, pregnancy is rarely predictable – contraception fails, relationships end, and jobs are lost – and besides, even the most ardent individualist would admit low-income children have done nothing to “deserve” their own poverty. We are at the point in which it is not rare to hear of infants living in B&amp;Bs, sleeping on cardboard, or even scrambling for food in school bins. If the ongoing debate over abortion rights teaches us anything, it’s that there are no shortage of voices content to defend the “unborn”. It’s a shame few are willing to give the same care to those children who are already here. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"social-care-network/social-life-blog/2018/jun/04/social-work-play-left-my-desk","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T10:04:11Z","webTitle":"My play aims to show the truth of social work:  dedicated and inspiring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2018/jun/04/social-work-play-left-my-desk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2018/jun/04/social-work-play-left-my-desk","fields":{"headline":"My play aims to show the truth of social work:  dedicated and inspiring","bodyText":"Why are there so many negative depictions of social work in popular entertainment? Jack Thorne’s Kiri and Jo Brand’s Damned have begun to turn the tide, however they are still outnumbered by the abundance of police, medical and courtroom dramas, all portraying challenging situations and professions just as bureaucratic. My play Left My Desk is about a children’s services social worker in a post-industrial Yorkshire town. The idea first formed two years ago; mid-way through a conversation with a friend, I shouted, “Hang on! You’re a social worker!” She looked perplexed, I had known her for more than a decade, and she had been a social worker for the past eight years but that was the moment I realised the picture of a social worker in my head was completely at odds with the reality in front of me. Why was my perception so skewed? I was influenced, I think, by headlines, secretly filmed documentaries, the various scandals that have hit the UK over the last 10 years. The phrase “thankless task” – alongside the words failure, incompetence, fault and blame – had become synonymous with social work. Yet here was my friend: intelligent, caring, fiercely passionate about her job. “You don’t have a clipboard!” I said. “No, we don’t have clipboards,” she replied. I decided to write a drama that – like all the best cop shows (*cough* Happy Valley) – was both serious and seriously entertaining. To tell a story that steers clear of the two extreme tropes: the failing and ineffectual, or the heartless child snatcher. I’ve always been aware of the financial pressures faced by many public services; my mum has worked for nearly 20 years for local authorities and though not directly working in social care, she has experienced the upheavals caused by the lack of funding and political will. She was once part of a team that won an award for excellent work in the community. Just weeks after the ceremony, the entire team was made redundant. I remember the devastation as the work it was so highly praised for was abandoned. But even with the knowledge that all local authorities are facing severe cuts, I was shocked at the crippling financial restraints social services find themselves under, especially considering there is a demand for social care across the UK, across all social strata, and a general consensus that it is a vital service. While researching Left My Desk, I interviewed experienced social workers, social work trainees, lecturers, service users and care leavers. I also spoke to my peers and wider circles with no immediate connection to social work. I found social workers fighting against the fact that their profession is often not granted the same respect or kudos as roles such as teaching or nursing. The negative picture in the public psyche – paired with cuts to early intervention schemes, and the raising of eligibility thresholds – have forced many social workers in child protection into what they believe is “reactive” rather than “proactive” care. I began to hear these terms everywhere – from police work to the housing crisis, to the NHS – connecting what is happening to local authority child protection teams to a wider public sector outcry against austerity. While writing and workshopping Left My Desk, it quickly became apparent that it would take a whole series of plays to adequately portray all that goes into the daily tasks of a social worker. How do I write a piece that acknowledges the difficulties, the sometimes hideous situations, takes into account the different schools of thought within the sector on what is and what is not the best approach to child protection, while also acknowledging the good stories and positive outcomes I heard when interviewing? I learned that in children’s services there are no clear cut answers; every single case is different and requires an individual approach. Throughout the writing of Left My Desk, the fear of getting it wrong has been ever-present, however, as a writer and storyteller I’ve been inspired by the positive effects dramas can have. I wanted a central figure like in the cop shows, like my friend: dedicated, inspiring, and really bloody cool. I hope that showing a slice of a social worker’s world will open a dialogue and offer an alternative to the negative image I for one carried in my head.

In a global first it was decided that the scents of antiquity should be especially revived. It was thus that Ivan Deiuri and Sonja Mik found themselves with nose in decantersniffing Aphrodite’s Rose – the highlight of the museum’s Countless Aspects of Beauty exhibition, which opened at the weekend. “It’s a bit like a rose, but more like an orchid,” said Deiuri, a Croatian sommelier, as he pressed his nose to the glass. “I’d say it’s more earthy, muddy, stony,” his girlfriend said. Her T-shirt was emblazoned with the words Believe in Love. “It smells a bit like grass after the rain, old grass, hay.” The scent’s power of seduction notwithstanding, the show appears almost overnight to have taken audiences by storm. Three fragrances – rose, coriander and sage – were created for what museum officials are calling a first sensory experience of antiquity based on scent. The archaeological experiment required 18 months of research, both in and outside the laboratory, said Korres, the Greek natural cosmetic firm tasked with reviving the “primordial, one-dimensional” perfumes. To remain loyal to the ingredients and methods of their ancient forebears, chemists followed ancient scripts. Linear B tablets used to document palace transactions during the Mycenaean Period – inscriptions known as the earliest preserved form of written Greek – were decoded for guidelines. The Greek countryside was scoured for plants; one vital ingredient, described as a “wild green”, was found on the remote Cycladic isle of Amorgos. And the works of Theophrastus, the father of botany, were studied closely for techniques of aromatic oil production. “We were also helped by Dioskourides, the pharmacist of ancient times who described how ingredients were used and processed,” said Lena Korres, co-founder of the company that led the research. “There were modern scientists, too, who revealed some of the secrets of ancient [perfumes]. But basically, going by ancient sources, and trying to mimic them step-by-step, we got here. As Greek scientists it was a magic journey to create the fragrances of our ancestors.” The scents are among 340 artefacts the museum has put on display for an exhibition that has Aphrodite, the goddess of love, beauty and desire, as its centrepiece. Works of art range from jewellery to gold ear-picks and quotidian pots and pans. Many are miniature masterpieces. Lagogianni said her idea to revive the scents was born of the significant role fragrances had in antiquity. As symbol of eternal love and beauty, Aphrodite was bathed in sweet-smelling oils when she emerged from the sea. “She taught us beauty’s secrets and one of them was the importance of sweet-smelling fragrances,” she said. Curators are hoping the exhibition, which is expected to run until the end of 2019, will survive the test of time. “It’s clear the ancients had really good taste,” said Deiuri, sitting on the museum’s steps after taking in the display. “And if something is beautiful, it is beautiful. It isn’t subject to time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality","fields":{"headline":"Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport","bodyText":"It’s the must-have accessory for every self-respecting 21st-century oligarch, and a good many mere multimillionaires: a second – and sometimes a third or even a fourth – passport. Israel, which helped Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich out of a spot of bother this week by granting him citizenship after delays in renewing his expired UK visa, offers free nationality to any Jewish person wishing to move there. But there are as many as two dozen other countries, including several in the EU, where someone with the financial resources of the Chelsea football club owner could acquire a new nationality for a price: the global market in citizenship-by-investment programmes – or CIPs as they are commonly known – is booming. The schemes’ specifics – and costs, ranging from as little as $100,000 (£74,900) to as much as €2.5m (£2.19m) – may vary, but not the principle: in essence, wealthy people invest money in property or businesses, buy government bonds or simply donate cash directly, in exchange for citizenship and a passport. Some do not offer citizenship for sale outright, but run schemes usually known as “golden visas” that reward investors with residence permits that can eventually lead – typically after a period of five years – to citizenship. The programmes are not new, but are growing exponentially, driven by wealthy private investors from emerging market economies including China, Russia, India, Vietnam, Mexico and Brazil, as well as the Middle East and more recently Turkey. The first launched in 1984, a year after young, cash-strapped St Kitts and Nevis won independence from the UK. Slow to take off, it accelerated fast after 2009 when passport-holders from the Caribbean island nation were granted visa-free travel to the 26-nation Schengen zone. For poorer countries, such schemes can be a boon, lifting them out of debt and even becoming their biggest export: the International Monetary Fund reckons St Kitts and Nevis earned 14% of its GDP from its CIP in 2014, and other estimates put the figure as high as 30% of state revenue. Wealthier countries such as Canada, the UK and New Zealand have also seen the potential of CIPs (the US EB-5 programme is worth about $4bn a year to the economy) but sell their schemes more around the attractions of a stable economy and safe investment environment than on freedom of movement. Experts from the many companies, such as Henley and Partners, CS Global and Apex, now specialising in CIPs and advertising their services online and in inflight magazines, say that unlike Abramovich, relatively few of their clients buy citizenship in order to move immediately to the country concerned. For most, the acquisition represents an insurance policy: with nationalism, protectionism, isolationism and fears of financial instability on the rise around the world, the state of the industry serves as an effective barometer of global political and economic uncertainty. But CIPs are not without their critics. Malta, for example, has come under sustained fire from Brussels and other EU capitals for its programme, run by Henley and Partners, which according to the IMF saw more than 800 wealthy individuals gain citizenship in the three years following its launch in 2014. Critics said the scheme was undermining the concept of EU citizenship, posing potential major security risks, and providing a possible route for wealthy individuals – for example from Russia – with opaque income streams to dodge sanctions in their own countries. Several other CIPs have come under investigation for fraud, while equality campaigners increasingly argue the moral case that it is simply wrong to grant automatic citizenship to ultra-high net worth individuals when the less privileged must wait their turn – and, in many cases, be rejected. The Caribbean The best-known – and cheapest – CIP schemes are in the Caribbean, where the warm climate, low investment requirements and undemanding residency obligations have long proved popular. Five countries currently offer CIPs, often giving visa-free travel to the EU, and have recently cut their prices to attract investors as they seek funds to help them rebuild after last year’s hurricanes. In St Kitts and Nevis a passport can now be had for a $150,000 donation to the hurricane relief fund, while Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada have cut their fees to $100,000, the same level as St Lucia and Dominica. Europe Almost half of the EU’s member states offer some kind of investment residency or citizenship programme leading to a highly prized EU passport, which typically allows visa-free travel to between 150 and 170 countries. Malta’s citizenship-for-sale scheme requires a €675,000 donation to the national development fund and a €350,000 property purchase. In Cyprus the cost is a €2m investment in real estate, stocks, government bonds or Cypriot businesses (although the number of new passports is to be capped at 700 a year following criticism). In Bulgaria, €500,000 gets you residency, and about €1m over two years plus a year’s residency gets you fast-track citizenship. Investors can get residency rights leading longer term to citizenship – usually after five years, and subject to passing relevant language and other tests – for €65,000 in Latvia (equities), €250,000 in Greece (property), €350,000 or €500,000 (property or a small business investment fund) or €500,000 in Spain (property, and you have to wait 10 years to apply for citizenship). Rest of the world Thailand offers several “elite residency” packages costing $3,000-$4,000 a year for up to 20 years residency, some including health checkups, spa treatments and VIP handling from government agencies. The EB-5 US visa, particularly popular with Chinese investors, costs between €500,000 and $1m depending on the type of investment and gives green card residency that can eventually lead to a passport. Canada closed its CA$800,000 (£460,000) federal investment immigration programme in 2014 but now has a similar residency scheme, costing just over CA$1m, for “innovative start-ups”, as well as regional schemes in, for example, Quebec. Australia requires an investment of AU$1.5m (£850,000) and a net worth of AU$2.5m for residency that could, eventually, lead to citizenship, and New Zealand – popular with Silicon Valley types – an investment of up to NZ$10m (£5.2m). • This article was amended on 4 June 2018.

The documentary is written, filmed and produced by an empty-headed DJ who begins a quest to find his childhood DJ hero (yes, the Reverend was a popular midwestern DJ before becoming a kidnapper and cult leader) but ends up being coerced into shooting a Making a Murderer-style documentary in the hope that the trial might be re-opened. The spoof is hilarious and painful, as we see all the tropes generally used to discredit women on full display. In one scene, Kimmy openly weeps while she is explaining her ordeal shortly after she is being rescued. “It was horrible,” she sobs. “And I missed, like, 10 Olympics!” “It was only nine, Ms Schmidt!” the detective replies, throwing a folder of various crime facts at her. “Now, are you ready to be honest with us?” The film-maker circles Kimmy Schmidt’s sobbing face in red ink and writes “not cute” in all capital letters. Similarly, fellow mole woman Donna is depicted as too old to have piqued the Reverend’s interest. Gretchen is maligned as crazy and Cyndee is dismissed as mouthy. None are deemed attractive enough to be taken seriously. In another clip, we see Kimmy and Cyndee when they are first released from the bunker. “They look like women, but they stink like hogs,” the news reporter states as we see the women dressed in long dresses coming out of the Reverend’s bunker and into sunlight. “Do you have a mirror?” Kimmy, who hasn’t seen her own face in 15 years, asks the reporter excitedly. When she is handed one, a look of horror flits across her normally perky face: “No, sorry, I asked for a mirror, not a picture of an old Irish witch.” When Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt first came onto the scene in 2015 its premise was shocking. The show was a comedy built around a bleak scenario – how a young woman who was kidnapped, abused and held captive in an underground bunker, re-integrates into the world. The show worked and still works for a number of reasons – it’s heartfelt without being sappy, is consistently smart and quick-witted, and it draws on tremendous talent, with stars like Tituss Burgess, Jane Krakowski, Jon Hamm and Ellie Kemper at the helm. The show has also been the most consistent pop-culture critique of the way American culture talks a big game about empowering women while also exploiting female pain. Throughout the series, Kimmy strives to move forward in forging a life that is happy, fun and kind, even as she faces inevitable setbacks and disappointments. Today, four years after the series initially aired, telling stories about female survivors of sexual violence is more common, yet Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt still explores what it means to be a survivor in ways that are unique. As I pointed out a few months ago, the explosion of angry women who are ready to shake up the status quo is a testament to a very real cultural mood. Yet the fantastic thing about Kimmy is how the show illustrates the ways that being a kind, feminine, do-gooder is just as badass as being a ball-buster. Kimmy’s positive thinking is presented as a kind of resilience, helping her to get through long, boring, frightening days in the bunker, and also guiding her as she works to understand the adult world of 2018. Over four seasons, Kimmy has learned to work, support her friends, embrace her own anger, go to college, take constructive feedback, and stand up for herself, all the while keeping true to her inner Kimmy. In a world where empathy is often portrayed as weak, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt consistently illustrates how warmth, kindness and creativity are actually heroic attributes, rather than the relics of a girlhood that Kimmy never got to entirely experience. Kimmy’s transformation from ingénue to working woman is on full display in the first six episodes of the fourth season, as we see Kimmy don a blazer over her colorful clothes and struggle to connect with co-workers who view her cheerful and affectionate behavior as off-putting. Her cluelessness when it comes to interpersonal interactions is even used to spoof sexual harassment! Yet while Kimmy continues to glow with radiant enthusiasm for life this season, there are lots of subtle reminders that fourth season Kimmy has grown up a lot since we first met her. When Jacqueline asks her to complete a task for her as a favor, Kimmy reminds her bluntly that she doesn’t work for her any more. When she finishes watching the House Flix documentary she attempts to call and complain about the show. When she ponders if it’s time to put away childish things and discard her purple backpack (who she talks to like a person and who she imagines with big goggle eyes and pigtails) she ends up realizing that she doesn’t have to discard things she loves in order to become an adult. In a world where survivors are still often presented as damaged, the insistence that Kimmy is really OK, despite her various struggles, is perhaps the series greatest legacy. Kimmy isn’t perfect. She makes a ton of mistakes on her road to recovery. She often misinterprets situations and misjudges people’s motivations. She is constantly having to navigate a world that underestimates her or doesn’t see the value in her ideas. In episode six, after becoming frustrated with the ways that men like the Reverend and men’s rights activists diminish women, she decides to create a children’s book that will help to teach boys the importance of being kind to girls. When she goes to sell the book (which she stayed up all night writing!) to a publisher, he rejects the premise offhand. “Kimmy, no. See, this is what we want from you,” he explains, taking out a cardboard display with a book titled Tubes of Terror: The Super Sad Story of Kimmy Schmidt by Kimmy Schmidt. “People see you as a mole woman and it’s my job to keep you in that box,” he continues. The joy of watching Kimmy learn to grow and change while still staying true to herself is that so few survivors of sexual violence onscreen are ever given the opportunity to be defined by more than their pain. Kimmy’s triumph comes not necessarily from being free of the Reverend or even acclimating completely to the world outside the bunker. After all, even as the series comes to a close, we know that our hero is always going to be at least a little weird. It’s her insistence on finding a “Kimmy” way to approach whatever problems come her way that is going to free her from ever being placed in someone else’s box.

Sinuous bronze tracery loops its way up the faceted shaft, framing crystalline windows between bands of lead arrowheads, like go-faster stripes shooting towards the heavens. “We’ve had enormous fun doing this,” says architect Ptolemy Dean, surveyor to the fabric of the abbey since 2012. “It’s not every day you get to add a new tower to Westminster Abbey.” Dean’s curious Weston Tower is the most significant addition to the building since Nicholas Hawksmoor’s west towers were completed in 1745. It has been deftly inserted in a south-eastern corner, between the 13th-century chapter house and the 16th-century Lady Chapel, to provide the public with access to the triforium for the first time, a hidden timber deck that snakes its way around the rafters, seven storeys above the nave. After five years and a combined project expenditure of £22.9m (privately fundraised), this atmospheric attic has been reborn as the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Galleries, stuffed with regal and religious treasures dating from across the abbey’s thousand-year history. Dean, whose first project at the abbey was wittily disguising a waste compactor in the form of a green timber taxi drivers’ shelter, has clearly had a great time developing his tower design. He has raided the back-catalogues of architectural history with promiscuous relish, sampling from the abbey’s many different layers to concoct a ripe confection of his own. An intersecting rotated square motif, found in the Henry VII Chapel, provides the basis for the star-shaped plan of the tower, which has been glazed with leaded windows, based on Christopher Wren’s late 17th-century additions to the abbey. The arrow detail of the leading and the elaborate crown rooftop are both inspired by Ely cathedral, while the looping bronze tracery over the windows is a nod to Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s trainshed at Paddington Station. The result is less pastiche than an energetic collage of bits and bobs. It could have been a gaudy eyeful, but the resulting sci-fi gothic lantern is somehow in keeping with the general riot of competing ornamentation with which the abbey is encrusted. Endlessly extended and remodelled over the centuries, the complex is not the result of a single hand: it is a patchwork of accretions in various versions of gothic. Dean’s Weston stair tower is simply the latest intriguing layer. The history lesson continues inside, where a stepped corner of the abbey’s ancient raft foundation has been revealed, built from 11th-century blocks of stone from Caen in France. The discovery was the architect’s cue to take visitors on a geological journey: he has wrapped his new lift shaft with 16 different kinds of stone sampled from the abbey’s history, laid in alternating bands. There’s pinkish Purbeck marble seething with fossils; white Portland stone left with tooling marks as Hawksmoor used it; hard grey Kentish ragstone; Yorkshire magnesian limestone; and even Reigate stone, of the kind used in the original west front from 1243. “No one has used Reigate in London for hundreds of years,” Dean claims. “We had to reopen a quarry in a corner of the M25.” He sadly refrained from adding a final layer of concrete breeze blocks at the top, in reference to the 1950s lavatory block that used to occupy the site of the tower. Visitors will spiral around this great mineral totem pole as they climb the new oak stairs, catching views across to the stained glass windows and carved stone details of the abbey, never before seen up close. Once at the top, the triforium galleries themselves open out as an enticing world of ancient oak beams crisscrossing their way around the attic, where exhibits have been beautifully spotlit in mercifully minimalist vitrines by museum design experts Muma (McInnes Usher McKnight Architects), the firm responsible for the V&amp;A’s medieval and Renaissance galleries and Manchester’s Whitworth Art Gallery revamp. Dean’s whimsy is all very well for the Weston Tower, but in the galleries, the cool, restrained hand of Muma allows the 300 precious artefacts to sing. Simple plinths of Purbeck stone appear to hover slightly off the floor, while seamless glass cases rise flush from the bases, containing everything from Wren’s 2.4-metre high model of his (unrealised) tower design, to the eerie funeral effigies of English kings and queens that were once paraded through the streets to the abbey. One jaw-dropping highlight is the elaborate concertina paper model of the interior of the abbey, made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in the 1830s, a kind of “peep show” designed to allow a wider audience to appreciate the spectacle of the ceremony. From the sublime to the prosaic, the artefact likely to draw the biggest crowds is apparently the wedding certificate of William and Kate. The designers’ greatest triumph is allowing natural light to flood in without the possibility of damaging any of the priceless pieces on show. In partnership with the environmental engineering company Max Fordham they carefully modelled all the sunbeam paths so that no sensitive objects would ever be touched by direct light, ensuring that none of the elaborately carved windows that ring the edge of the triforium would have to be blocked up. It would have been so easy just to make it a black box, but the presence of shafts of sunlight streaming in through the tracery is what makes this such an atmospheric place. It gives you the feeling of exploring a secret realm, formerly only inhabited by gargoyles, pigeons and the ghosts of dead royals – who now feel more present than ever. • This article was amended on 1 June 2018 to add that the company Max Fordham modelled sunbeam paths."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/from-the-archive-interview-with-yves-saint-laurent-paris-designer-1977","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"From the archive: an interview with Yves Saint Laurent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/from-the-archive-interview-with-yves-saint-laurent-paris-designer-1977","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/from-the-archive-interview-with-yves-saint-laurent-paris-designer-1977","fields":{"headline":"From the archive: an interview with Yves Saint Laurent","bodyText":"A library painted completely white is stuffed full of bronze sculptures and lamps shaped like cobras. Every surface is decorated with white flowers and on the wall hangs a Picasso. In the centre of all this finery is ‘a pale willowy man, elegant, very charming, shy and neurotic’, who is chain-smoking. This man is Yves Saint Laurent. When our journalist meets Saint Laurent in June 1977, a rumour is circulating that the iconic designer is dead. ‘People were coming to check if I was alive. It disgusted me,’ says Saint Laurent. ‘It was a hunt as if they were enjoying it.’ The interview takes place the day after Saint Laurent’s latest collection is unveiled in Paris, where women had screamed ‘Long live Yves Saint Laurent!’ from the balconies of his salon. But the designer cuts a nervous figure. Does he enjoy the success? ‘I hate fashion,’ he says. ‘I don’t have any fun doing it. A show terrifies me.’ Despite his distaste for the industry, Saint Laurent has had a significant impact on the wardrobes we modern women take for granted. All the skinny jean-clad gals out there owe a large debt to the designer who pioneered trousers for women when it was still unheard of for us to wear anything without a gusset. ‘I wanted women to have the same basic wardrobe as a man. Blazer, trousers and suit. They’re so functional. I believed women wanted this and was right.’ What of men in skirts, though? ‘If men wanted to look good in a skirt, they would need the body of an African. And the colour. A skirt with white skinny legs. Horrible!’ The one thing that truly brings him joy is writing. He writes feverishly from the moment he gets up and all through the night, as a form of therapy. ‘At moments what comes out is delirious. It’s going to be quite a book. It’s ambitious. Like me. It must never be finished.’ A decade after his death, it’s safe to say his legacy is still very much ongoing, even if he did hate it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/may/30/unemployment-to-drop-to-lowest-level-since-1980-says-oecd","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T09:05:33Z","webTitle":"Global growth too dependent on cheap borrowing – OECD","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/30/unemployment-to-drop-to-lowest-level-since-1980-says-oecd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/30/unemployment-to-drop-to-lowest-level-since-1980-says-oecd","fields":{"headline":"Global growth too dependent on cheap borrowing – OECD","bodyText":"Unemployment will drop to its lowest level since 1980 across the world’s richest nations, but global growth remains dependent on cheap borrowing and government spending, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has warned in its latest global economy health check. The rise of tit-for-tat protectionist trade barriers, the return of volatile financial markets, and soaring oil prices also spell trouble for the global economy as it heads towards the 10-year anniversary of the 2008 banking collapse, the OECD said. “The economic expansion is set to continue for the coming two years, and the short-term growth outlook is more favourable than it has been for many years,” said Angel Gurría, secretary general of the OECD, the Paris based thinktank for the world’s 35 richest nations, including the US, Britain, Mexico and Japan. “However, the current recovery is still being supported by very accommodative monetary policy, and increasingly by fiscal easing. This suggests that strong, self-sustaining growth has not yet been attained.” Central banks in Britain, the eurozone, Japan and the US have kept interest rates low and pumped funds into their economies via quantitative easing to maintain investment and promote growth. Governments have eased back on austerity measures, allowing more state funds for infrastructure projects and welfare payments, especially pensions. Last year, Gurría clashed with the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, when he suggested that a second referendum on EU membership would significantly benefit the economy. Like most international agencies, the OECD has warned that leaving the EU will harm foreign investment into the UK and lower potential growth. The latest economic outlook for the UK says the economy is in better shape than the OECD expected last September when it predicted that Britain would only manage to grow by 1%. It says the economy will grow by 1.4%, up from its previous estimate of 1%, and 1.3% next year. Despite the slightly stronger prospects for growth, the unemployment rate would edge up gradually. The main risk to the forecast remained the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. “If high uncertainty persists, the drag on capital expenditure could intensify as businesses delay plans further,” the report said. “By contrast, deferred plans may be brought forward if businesses gain clarity about future trading arrangements, pushing up investment growth in the short run. “In addition, prospects of maintaining the closest possible economic relationship with the European Union would lead to stronger-than-expected economic growth,” it added. The outlook calls for governments to reignite economic reforms while low interest rates and strong global growth persist. Countries should improve tax and spending policies to boost investment and raise living standards across the income distribution. Governments should also boost spending on digital and physical infrastructure, enhance research and development collaboration between universities and industry, reduce barriers to entry in professional services sectors and cut red tape. “Policymakers need to put greater focus on structural policies to boost skills and to improve productivity to achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive growth,” Gurría said.

It need not empty our museums of everything so acquired. As he showed in his recent BBC Civilisations programmes, cultural interchange between Europe and the rest of the world shaped a shared heritage. That needs displaying so its legacies can be appreciated without concealing the uncomfortable historical facts. Objects from the old empires will still have a place in European museum collections because, more vividly than most postcolonial history books, they bring that past to life. Wherever we and they are physically, with modern digital technologies and the internet they can be recorded, seen and interpreted from anywhere, but still there is no substitute for the originals, especially in countries that have few surviving artefacts from their own past. That is why returning some, while retaining others, would be mutually beneficial educationally, culturally and diplomatically. Deaccessioning colonial acquisitions from British museums could have other benefits. To ensure that they would be going where they will be cared for to the highest standards, money from the overseas aid budget could be used to invest in museums and professional training, providing opportunities for our own institutions to develop new income streams from heritage management and consultancy services. It could also reimburse at current market values the cost to museums of objects acquired with public or charitable funds. The investment would demonstrate more than a cultural commitment to the Commonwealth: it would pay educational dividends, support our museums, and contribute economically to growing tourism in developing countries. Michael Liversidge Emeritus dean, faculty of arts, University of Bristol • I completely disagree with David Olusoga. First, not all of the artefacts adorning the British Museum or V&amp;A were looted. Often there was a lot of collusion between the colonised people and the colonial masters in acquiring objects. Second, how does one determine who or which country should be the rightful owner? Which country should get the Koh-i-Noor diamond from the royal crown – India, Pakistan or Bangladesh? Should it be cut into three pieces so that none of these three countries feel left out? Should religion play a part in the returning policy so that Moghul miniature paintings in the V&amp;A go to Pakistan, but the Rajput ones go to India? What guarantee is there that, once returned, these items would be properly looked after? Fundamentalism has become a dominant force in many of the ex-colonial countries and in recent years we have seen what has happened to the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan and Babri Masjid in India, and what Isis did in Syria. Besides, most of the ex-colonies did not have the financial resources to care for and properly preserve these artefacts. Any researcher will know the condition of the colonial papers in Indian archives whereas similar papers are properly preserved in the British Library. Lastly more people come to Britain to see these artefacts. How many of them will go to Pakistan or Afganistan to see the statue of Gandhar Buddha or the relics of Harappa? Colonialism and what happened at the time are part of our inheritance, whether we like it or not. To claim restitution in the form of returns of goodies encourages cheap sentimentalism. The artefacts should stay where they are.

It is public property waiting to be embellished or condensed, depending on who tells it. I feel I am entitled to recount it (with embellishments), having arrived at the house in Sicily just days after said Ben and two young students foraged what they thought was chicory and made soup. The students, realising that the flavour was beyond anything even the most ardent lover of bitter leaves could ingest, gave up almost immediately, while Ben ate two bowlfuls (this has been increased to four in some versions of the story). The pair, who had each eaten little more than a mouthful, felt the room spin and white lights speckle and flicker like a dying street lamp in the corner of their eyes. Ben, on the other hand, having eaten so much of the soup made from alkaloid-heavy mandrake leaves, experienced hallucinations, which turned into convulsions, and had to be airlifted to safety – or maybe he just went in a car. The scenes at the hospital could extend the story significantly, but in short, once he came round, the doctors proclaimed – in Sicilian – that he had an extraordinary constitution, since mandrake in such quantities should be deadly. Ben not only survived, but thrived to tell the tale, a warning to future foragers. In her book Vegetable Literacy, Deborah Madison describes solanaceae, or the nightshade family, as a family of two parts: the lethal and the luscious. The soup makers discovered the dark side with their mandrake and onion soup, and psychotropic deadly nightshade (belladonna or death cherries) and, to a certain extent, fresh tobacco leaves, share the same properties. Then there is the other side - the luscious and delicious, the nightshades we covet for our gardens and tables: tomatoes, peppers, aubergines and potatoes, all of which came from the new world as part of the Columbian exchange. In Italy, where sun-loving solanaceae are such an integral part of the landscape and culinary identity, it is extraordinary to think they are relatively new immigrants, that they were treated with suspicion and mistrust, thought to be poisonous – and, in the case of the tomato, an aphrodisiac – before being embraced. It wasn’t until the 17th century that they had all put down deep roots, from which they thrived, enriching land and plates with their warm colours and flavours. These days, like so many edible parts of modern life, tomatoes, pepper and aubergines are not bound by seasonal constraints, we can have them whenever we want, from wherever we want. Peppers, I think, are the best of the off-season lot, as even a Dutch hothouse can cultivate crisp, juicy vigour. Summer, however, is the time for truly luscious peppers. Over the next few months, they will just get better and better, and our meals redder and redder. Although not as exciting as mandrake soup and survival, recipes are stories, embellished or condensed by the person following them. Today’s is short, as it is one of my sauce-takes-as-long-as-pasta-takes-to-boil lunches, a luscious and deeply flavoured one. Melt four to 10 anchovy fillets and a peeled, squashed clove of garlic in plenty of oil over a low flame (you can replace the fish with a sliced onion and a good pinch of salt). Once the anchovies have disintegrated and the garlic is fragrant, add two sliced peppers – one red and one yellow – and a handful of black olives, and let the crisp arcs cook down into rich softness while you bring a pan of water to a boil and cook 400g pasta. To finish, drain, then toss the pasta with the pepper sauce and serve, eating one or two bowls each."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/03/sundays-best-tv-a-very-english-scandal-frankie-goes-to-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:00:44Z","webTitle":"Sunday’s best TV: A Very English Scandal; Frankie Goes to Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/03/sundays-best-tv-a-very-english-scandal-frankie-goes-to-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/03/sundays-best-tv-a-very-english-scandal-frankie-goes-to-russia","fields":{"headline":"Sunday’s best TV: A Very English Scandal; Frankie Goes to Russia","bodyText":"A Very English Scandal 9pm, BBC One This three-part series based on the downfall of Liberal politician Jeremy Thorpe has been a triumph.

Sarah-Jayne Blakemore said it was only in recent years that the full scale of the changes that take place in the adolescent brain has been discovered. “That work has completely revolutionised what we think about this period of life,” she said. Blakemore, a professor in cognitive neuroscience at University College London, told the Hay festival that teenagers were unfairly mocked and demonised for behaviour they had no control over, whether that was moodiness, excessive risk-taking, bad decision making or sleeping late. The changes in the brain were enormous, she said, with substantial rises in white matter and a 17% fall in grey matter, which affects decision making, planning and self-awareness. All parents know that teenagers would sleep late if they could but it is all to do with brain changes, she said. “It is not because they are lazy, it is because they go through a period of biological change where melatonin, which is the hormone humans produce in the evenings and makes us feel sleepy, is produced a couple of hours later than it is in childhood or adulthood.” They are then forced to go to school when their brain says they should still be sleeping. That is then exacerbated at weekends when teenagers try to catch up by sleeping until lunchtime – what Blakemore called “social jetlag”. “They are constantly shifting their body clock from one time zone to another, which must be very disorientating.” She said schools should start later but added that the problem was bigger in the US where schools start at 7.30am or 8am, and were distances could be so huge some children had to set off at 6am. She also said it was wrong to have such stressful GCSE exams at 16, when the teenage brain is going through such a big change. “This country is the only country in the world apart from countries that follow our education system, like Commonwealth countries, that have big national public exams at 16. Given our children have to stay in some form of education until 18, we don’t need those exams … Why do we still have GCSEs?” “It doesn’t make any sense to me to impose this enormous stress, when we are so focused on grades, just at that precise moment in time.” Blakemore said it was important because teenage years were the time when people were more susceptible to mental illness, whether anxiety, depression, self-harm or addictions. Not enough resources were being channelled to the issue, she said. “This is a hugely neglected area in terms of the amount of resource given to mental illness in young people. The government is paying lip service to it but we really need to see actual change rather than just words.” Blakemore, the mother of a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old, said she was not the best person to give parenting advice other than she found that teenagers and adults felt empowered when they found out the facts about how much the brain changes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/29/nfl-protests-taking-a-knee-alternatives-new-rules-fines","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T16:51:32Z","webTitle":"After kneeling: the ways NFL players can protest despite the new rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/nfl-protests-taking-a-knee-alternatives-new-rules-fines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/29/nfl-protests-taking-a-knee-alternatives-new-rules-fines","fields":{"headline":"After kneeling: the ways NFL players can protest despite the new rules","bodyText":"“All team and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem”: that is how the NFL worded their edict that players who kneel during the national anthem will be fined. We all know what standing looks like, but what about respect? That’s likely to become a crucial question as NFL players look for new protest tactics that won’t endanger their careers or lead to financial penalties for their teams. Can respect still be shown while raising a fist, linking arms, or bowing heads – as some sports teams have done when the anthem has played in the past year? The Guardian spoke with experts in non-violent protest to ask how players might express resistance in light of NFL edict. “They have a number of options,” says Dr Adolphus Belk, a political science professor at Winthrop University. “They can continue to kneel, raise their fists and dare the league to enforce this policy. Or they can engage in some other kind of demonstration: bowing their heads during the anthem or adopting a position of prayer.” Belk says there’s another option the might cary even greater symbolic weight than taking a knee, while also complying with the NFL’s new ruling: “They can all stay in the locker room … they can engage in an act of civil disobedience by being absent, en masse, without falling afoul of the policy. It would make for a striking visual.” Hawk Newsome, the leader of Black Lives Matter’s New York branch, thinks players need to go further: he recommends making an impact by not showing up. Newsome says: “I call on all black NFL players not to show up the first day of work for the first day of season. Send a message, let them pay that fine. And what’s the NFL doing with all these fines? Are they investing them in programmes in the community? I think that’s a question we need to see asked too.” Money raised from NFL fines have traditionally been distributed by the NFL Foundation for programmes including youth football – though not specifically social justice causes. Some people believe the desire to protest could be greater in the upcoming season, now that the NFL has doubled-down on its position and explicitly silenced black protest. By the end of last season, very few players were openly protesting during the anthem, and the issue had become less prominent in the league. But the NFL’s new stance is likely to intensify resistance from players, particularly as many view Donald Trump’s consistent attacks on black NFL players as the reason for the new policy. “The president has said that players who kneel during the anthem should be run out of the league, he’s called them SOBs, he more recently said they need to be run out of the country,” says Belk. “He’s now challenging people on their personhood. He might elicit a response that people weren’t inclined to give him in the first place.” Newsome agrees that the president’s involvement has upped the ante. “The president should be paying more attention to race relations in America and less about what happens on the football field. Now the NFL have doubled down. They had the chance to be a shining star in corporate social responsibility. They could have created programmes in the community. Instead they chose to oppress us. Telling a player to hide in the locker room, stand or pay a fine is an act of oppression.” Newsome, who made headlines after speaking to a Trump supporters at a Washington DC rally, thinks that the majority white fanbase of the NFL makes an irresistible opportunity for groups trying to advance equal rights. “Black people already know that racism exists … we have to invoke empathy in white America. We need them to take action.” He says the NFL is a perfect stage on which to do that. The threat of police brutality is not just theoretical for NFL players and other sports stars – they are not strangers to harassment from law enforcement. “If we go back to what started the demonstrations in the first place, the extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of law enforcement, it’s still happening, not just to US citizens, but to football players themselves” says Belk. He points out that in the past two months Desmond Marrow, a former NFL player, and Sterling Brown, of the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks, have both been victims of excessive police force. Marrow said police “knocked my teeth out, slammed me on my head and choked me out until I was unconscious” when they arrested him in a parking lot in Georgia. The officer seen choking Marrow in a video of the incident was fired for use of excessive force and a felony charge against Marrow was dropped. Last week eight officers were disciplined and an apology was made to Brown after footage emerged of him being tasered by police after a supposed parking violation. Brown was not charged with any crime and the video of the incident does not show him raising his voice or resisting arrest.That’s why the actions that NFL players take next matter: the difference between a knee, a fist, an abstention and a boycott is more than just symbolic. It’s life and death. “Black folk know quite well that it could just as easily be them,” says Belk. “There’s no amount of economic attainment or success that is going to isolate you from this kind of treatment. For those reasons, the issue will continue to come up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/29/edl-founder-tommy-robinson-jailed-13-months","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T14:23:22Z","webTitle":"EDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/edl-founder-tommy-robinson-jailed-13-months","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/edl-founder-tommy-robinson-jailed-13-months","fields":{"headline":"EDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court","bodyText":"Tommy Robinson, the founder of the far-right English Defence League, has been jailed for 13 months for contempt of court. The 35-year-old’s sentence can be revealed after a judge lifted reporting restrictions on the case on Tuesday. The case had been widely discussed on social media, where rightwing activists claimed that the restrictions amounted to state censorship. Robinson was arrested on Friday after broadcasting an hour-long video over Facebook from outside Leeds crown court. In the video he made comments that risked causing a trial to collapse. Robinson pleaded guilty to contempt of court. He was arrested, charged and sentenced within five hours. A court order is in place to prevent any reporting of the details of the trial in question. Another court order preventing reporting of Robinson’s arrest and the subsequent court proceedings was lifted on Tuesday after a challenge by Leeds Live and the Independent. The restriction was put in place temporarily to prevent reporting on the Robinson case prejudicing the outcome of the first trial. It was lifted after a judge heard submissions that the order was already being widely violated by members of the public online. Robinson attempted to film defendants entering the court and spoke about the case. The video was viewed more than 250,000 times. Robinson’s arrest provoked protests in Whitehall on Saturday. Supporters were seen carrying placards reading “#FreeTommy” and shouting “shame on you”. A change.org petition calling for his release had received nearly 500,000 signatures by Tuesday afternoon. Last year Robinson was given a suspended sentence for committing contempt during a rape trial in Canterbury, after he attempted to film the defendants. He had been told that he would go to prison if he broke the law again. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, was sentenced to 10 months for contempt of court and a further three months for breaching the terms of the previous suspended sentence. Robinson’s supporters had posted online that his arrest was an infringement of his freedom of speech. On Sunday Donald Trump Jr, the US president’s son, retweeted one of Robinson’s supporters, adding: “Don’t let America follow in those footsteps.” The Dutch far-right opposition leader Geert Wilders posted a video on Twitter, filmed from outside the British embassy in The Hague, describing Robinson’s prison sentence as “an absolute disgrace”. He accused the judge of issuing a gagging order and said that freedom of speech was being violated all over Europe. “The lights of freedom are going out,” he said. “The authorities are trying to silence us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jun/02/20-great-traditional-festivals-europe-france-spain-greece-sweden","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"20 great traditional festivals in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/02/20-great-traditional-festivals-europe-france-spain-greece-sweden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jun/02/20-great-traditional-festivals-europe-france-spain-greece-sweden","fields":{"headline":"20 great traditional festivals in Europe","bodyText":"Water jousting, France Fête de la Saint-Louis, Sète, Languedoc When: 23-28 August Highlight: The final night’s firework display Since 1666, the port of Sète has been celebrating its patron saint in boisterous style. The town, known as the Venice of Languedoc, stages water-jousting tournaments on its canals throughout the summer, but it’s during its August festival that things go into overdrive. The lancers, standing on a platform on the stern of a boat propelled by oarsmen, try to knock each other into the water. The festival’s 70-plus events include street parades, pop-up bars and concerts. While you’re there: Don’t miss Sète’s windswept sandy beaches, which stretch west all the way to Cap d’Agde via Marseillan Plage. Where to stay: Peaceful Le Clos Saint-Clair B&amp;B (doubles from €80 B&amp;B) is on Mont Saint-Clair, the 183-metre hill between the old town and the beach, and has a pool. Mary Novakovich Lavender mob, France Corso de la Lavande, Digne-les-Bains, Provence When: 3-7 August Highlight: Nighttime parade of illuminated floats covered in lavender and locals in traditional costume The festival begins with a firework display over the river and is followed by four days of lavender-themed festivities: parades, marching bands, floats covered in the mauve flowers and a nightly ball in the main square of this spa town. Every afternoon, scores of stalls sell lavender and lavandin (its more photogenic hybrid variant) products. Digne’s lavender festival parade has been running since the second world war. Even older is the lavender fair, which takes place at the end of August, once the harvest is in. Members of the Commanderie de la Lavande, dressed in purple robes and felt hats, declare the harvest over, light the fire under a huge copper still in the centre of the town and celebrate with lavender liqueur, lavender biscuits, syrup, nosegays and lavender paté. While you’re there: Take the narrow-gauge Train des Pignes to Nice. The journey takes about three hours, past cliff faces and through dark pine forests and dramatic gorges. Where to stay: In the hills above Digne, the Chateau d’Auribeau (doubles from €90 B&amp;B) produces its own honey and lavender oil. Jon Bryant Flamenco fair, Spain Feria de Ganado y Fiestas de San Mateo, Villamartín, Cádiz When: 20-24 September Highlight: Teenagers in full flamenco dress on the fairground wall of death The feast of Saint Matthew, celebrated across Spain, is the last big party of the long hot summer. Villamartín offers the quintessential Andalucian combination of cattle fair by day (held here since the 16th century) and dancing, drinking and a fair by night. Aside from shopping for cows, there’s a chance to catch traditional horse and carriage contests, demonstrations of horsemanship and gutsy flamenco performances. After 11pm, the town’s entire population of 12,000-odd people, most elaborately, fabulously attired in flamenco dress, heads to the Recinto Ferial, to parade, eat, drink, sing and dance in the casetas (roadside tents) that line the route, and enjoy tacky fairground delights. This is a complete assault on the senses: glorious, surreal and what passes as normal in these parts. While you’re there: Cycle the Via Verde de la Sierra from neighbouring Puerto Serrano to Olvera (22 miles) or at least to the old station house cafe at Coripe (9 miles). Bikes available to rent at all three places. Where to stay: Casas de Alamajar has self-catering houses from €50 a night for two (two-night minimum) in a garden setting in nearby Prado del Rey. Sorrel Downer Dead good fun, Spain Santa Marta de Ribarteme, As Neves, Galicia When: 29 July Highlight: The procession of coffins: locals gather outside San Jose church holding long candles, waving incense and sobbing into handkerchiefs, waiting for the coffins to appear During this festival in rural Galicia, devout Spaniards who have survived a near-death experience in the preceding year, whether illness or accident, are paraded in coffins through streets to give thanks to God and Santa Marta, the event’s patron, for being alive. The coffins are followed by relatives and friends dressed in black, in a procession that replicates a Spanish funeral. No one is sure when the festival actually started; some say it began as far back as the 12th century as an attempt by the Catholic church to adapt to the pagan rites widespread in the region. It may sound lugubrious, but the festival is in fact a celebration of life: you are more likely to encounter tears of joy than of sadness. The whole day is a mix of macabre and merry. There is live music, a flea market and lots of farmers selling produce, such as wine and vegetables. After the parade, locals and visitors retire to open-air kitchens around town to feast on polbo á feira – octopus with potatoes, olive oil, salt and paprika – and drink local white albariño wine. While you’re there: Take the 45-minute drive to the seaside town of Baiona to sample great seafood, wander the picturesque streets and relax on white sandy beaches. Where to stay: The Parador de Tui (doubles from €64 room-only) is about a 25-minute drive away. Matthew Bremner Noble grapes, Italy Sagra dell’uva, Quartu Sant’Elena, Sardinia When: 15 September Highlight: Mass giveaway of bunches of home-grown grapes at the end of the parade Held since at least 1787, this is the most fun part of the 10-day festival of Saint Helena. On the middle Saturday, wine producing families from the whole province turn out in historic costume to celebrate the grape harvest.Pulled by horses, donkeys or oxen, carts decorated with grapes, vines, palm fronds, bells, ribbon and tinsel follow a two-hour route through the town, now a suburb of Sardinia’s capital. More participants carry tools of their trade, baskets of grapes, and trays of cakes, all to folk music from guitars, accordions and pipes. One cart even had a live grape-treading demonstration on board. The women’s costumes, particularly, are embroidered, multi-layered affairs, outdone only by the decorations on the patient four-legged beasts. This is a fervent, untouristy celebration of regional traditions, laid on by and for locals. At the end, the carts and their loads are blessed at Sant’Elena basilica in the town centre, and handed out in huge quantities to unwary spectators. While you’re there: See the 40,000 flamingoes that spend summer at Parco Molentargius, former salt pans south of Quartu that are now a nature reserve, with bikes to hire. Beyond that is Cagliari’s long sandy Blue Flag beach, Poetto. Where to stay: On a hill above Quartu, Al Sandalyon B&amp;B (doubles from €63 in June) has views of Poetto beach from the three bedrooms, and breakfast in the garden. Liz Boulter Mad for folk, Italy Valfino al Canto, Abruzzo When: 9-11 August Highlight: The evening banquet celebrating the Abruzzo speciality of coatto, lamb stew simmered in large vats in the square all day, then served on trestles for everyone Now in its 23rd year, Valfino al Canto celebrates folk music from all over Italy. With the unspoilt medieval hilltop village of Arsita as their stage, bands, buskers and dance troupes can be found performing anything from a Puglian pizzica to a Neapolitan tammurriata. There is nothing nostalgic about this festival, as traditional music is still very much part of rural Italian life, with multiple generations of families descending on the village over three days to share and learn popular song. Expect a low-key atmosphere, delicious locally grown grub, barrels of wine and many an accordion and fiddle. While you’re there: Explore the mountainous Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga national park, one of the most biologically diverse and largest protected areas in Europe, where you might spot wild boar, wolves, roe deer and golden eagles. Where to stay: The Colle Sette Vangeli agriturismo (doubles from €60 a night) is a farm in the hills with spectacular views and over 40 goats bred to provide cashmere. Sophia Seymour Donkey business, Portugal L Burro i L Gueiteiro travelling festival, Douro When: 25-29 July Highlight: The Dança dos Pauliteiros on the Friday night, a frenzied folk dance to bagpipes This festival travels between the Portuguese villages of the Miranda do Douro municipality, in the north-eastern mountains on the border with Spain. The festival celebrates the idiosyncrasies of a district isolated by its wild landscape, namely their unique breed of donkey and the tradition of the wandering minstrel. The players of gaita-de-fole, or bagpipes, once travelled by donkey to bring music and entertainment to the remote villages. Now a drove of up to 20 shaggy-haired donkeys are paraded through two chosen villages each year. Concerts and feasting on local smoked meats and Douro red wine take place every night but the workshops in traditional music, dance and painting are on the Saturday afternoon. • For more information, workshop tickets or to be a part of the donkey procession, see aepga.pt While you’re there: A 30-minute drive from Miranda do Douro is the river beach in the village of Uva, a perfect place to unwind on grassy riverbanks and take a dip with views of the Algoso valley. Where to stay: Puial de I Douro (doubles from €70 B&amp;B) is a rambling 19th-century farmhouse in the village of Aldeia Nova with a cellar of Douro wine. Edwina Pitcher Flower power, Portugal Festas do Pereiro, Ribatejo province When: 24-26 August Highlight: Dancing until dawn in the town square on the Saturday night, and staying for the Sunday procession of the Virgin to mass Once a year the narrow streets of Pereiro, a small hill town 200km north-east of Lisbon, are garlanded from wall to wall with paper flowers. This is a typical Portuguese summer festa, where the whole village celebrates its saint with homecomings, feasting and dancing. Pereiro has been heralded as the “capital of the flower-decked streets” but it is also a wonderful place to see the centuries-old tradition of Nossa Senhora da Saude (Our Lady of Good Health) being carried on a float through streets strewn with rosemary. Revellers kick off the weekend with dancing to pimba music, popular songs with bawdy lyrics, late into the night. Beer and bifanas or pregos (steak sandwiches) are served until dawn. While you’re here Stroll the 2km wooden walkway that starts at the Alamal river beach (20km south of Pereiro) and follows the Tejo (Tagus) River with views of the 12th-century castle in Belver. Where to stay: Casa Covão da Arbitureira (doubles from €60 B&amp;B) is a beautiful old stone house in Belver with seven guest rooms and views across the Tejo. Edwina Pitcher Wedding invitation, Greece Feast of the Assumption, Alonissos, Sporades Islands When: 15 August Highlight: The lively re-enactment of a traditional Alonissos wedding The festival takes place in the island’s capital, also called Alonissos. It starts in the morning with a church service in honour of the Virgin Mary. The celebrations really kick off in the early evening with a re-enactment of a traditional Alonissos wedding, complete with vibrant costumes and plenty of sweetmeats and tsipouro (pomace brandy). The wedding ritual begins with the best man’s visit to the groom’s house. He is accompanied by traditional musicians, who play as they walk along the cobbled streets to pick up the bride, gathering a procession behind them as they head to the church. After the ceremony the customary wedding meal of pasta with slow-cooked goat sauce is served from huge vats over open fires. Festivities go on all night with live music, wine and traditional dancing. While you’re there: Take a boat trip in the marine park of the northern Sporades. Where to stay: In Alonissos old town, Elias House (€95 a night self-catering in high season for up to three adults and one child) has a lovely patio. Merryn Wainwright Fighting ships, Greece Armata, Spetses, Saronic Islands When: 1-8 September Highlight: A lifesize ship set alight under a volley of fireworks, commemorating the 1822 defeat of the Ottoman fleet Feisty Spetses was the first Greek island to rise up against Ottoman rule in 1821. The formidable Laskarina Bouboulina – Greece’s only female admiral— spent her fortune amassing a fleet of warships to fight the Turks. On the second weekend of September, the whole island gathers at the harbour for the re-enactment of an epic 1822 naval battle in which the Turkish fleet was routed. Fishing boats lit by candles drift slowly out to sea, surrounding a model Turkish ship that is ceremonially set alight as a barrage of fireworks and dramatic music almost drowns out the squealing crowds. This patriotic display is the climax of a week-long festival of traditional Greek dancing, live music, and religious rituals. Orthodox mass is held at Panagia Armata chapel, as well as the church of Saint Nicholas, patron saint of sailors. Where to stay: The Poseidonion (doubles from €148 B&amp;B), a plush period hotel opened in 1914, is on the waterfront overlooking the action. Rachel Howard Singing up a storm, Croatia Klapa music festival, Omiš When: 29 June-21 July Highlight: The men’s highly spirited final on 21 July Backed by a dramatic canyon and straddling the mouth of the Cetina river, medieval Omiš has one of the Croatian coast’s most jaw-dropping settings. It’s a suitable backdrop for the evocative klapa music festival . Competing groups of singers perform this highly expressive a cappella, multipart style of singing in the town’s St Mihovil and Stjepan Radić squares every few days until one group is declared the winner. These songs of love and longing are some of the most beautifully haunting sounds of the Adriatic. While you’re there: The Cetina canyon is a giant playground, with kayaking, ziplining, rafting and riverside walks. Where to stay: Clinging to a rocky crag, the family-run Hotel Villa Dvor (doubles from €85 B&amp;B) overlooks the river and the old town. Mary Novakovich Tiaras and truffles, Croatia Subotina festival, Buzet When: 8 and 9 September Highlight: A giant truffle omelette prepared on the town square to kick off the festival This year, 2018 eggs and 10kg of truffles will go into the enormous omelette that marks the start of the white truffle season in Buzet, a picturesque hilltown in northern Istria. The next day, the whole town dresses up in traditional clothes or period costume and shares the heritage and atmosphere of yesteryear. Artisans demonstrate carpentry, stonemasonry and basket-weaving while locals sing in dialect and dance to live accordion music in the cobbled streets of the old town. This is Istria, so there’s plenty to eat and drink: specialities such as maneštra (a thick soup similar to Italian minestrone); traditional pasta called fuži served with truffles; and fried doughnut-like fritule. Wines such as crisp white malvazija, or red teran flow freely. While you’re there: Visit Hum, a charming fortified hilltown listed as the smallest town in the world by Guinness World Records. Twelfth-century frescoes decorate the nave of St Jerome’s church, and there are also wall writings in Glagolitic script, the oldest known Slavic alphabet. Where to stay: Vela Vrata (doubles from €59 B&amp;B) is a heritage hotel in Buzet’s old town with a pool, spa and restaurant. Isabel Putinja Ukuleles united, Czech Republic Czech Ukulele festival, Unetice, near Prague When: 28-29 July Highlight: Delicious, straight-from-the-brewery-tap beer – plus the chance to participate in the world’s largest kazoo workshop The ukulele may have become the hipster’s weapon of choice but this back-to-basics celebration of the tiny, twangy instrument is an unpretentious affair. It’s held in Unetice, a picturesque village around 20 minutes from Prague (bus 355 from Dejvice), where local and international musicians gather for a relaxed weekend of lute-plucking, lager-drinking japery. Its home is the highly rated Unetice brewery, so the beer is fresh and unfiltered, and the wide variety of acts and workshops means you can either get involved – or simply kick back in the sun. This year’s theme is Ladies Edition, and most of the acts are female. • Day, night or whole weekend tickets available at goout.net While you’re there: Get off the bus at Roztoky and enjoy a two-mile forest walk to Únětice through the gorgeous “Silent Valley”, following the red trail signs. Where to stay: Hotel International Prague (doubles from €76) is a monstrously brilliant slab of Stalin-era architecture near the Dejvice bus stop. Mark Pickering Wine and song, Czech Republic Pálava wine harvest festival, Mikulov, Moravia When: 7-9 September Highlight: The medieval pageant Beer isn’t the only Czech tipple. The annual Pálava wine harvest provides the perfect excuse to try burčák, a deceptively innocuous semi-fermented wine that appears for a brief period in late summer. The weekend shindig celebrates winemaking around the historic Moravian town of Mikulov, on the Austrian border, and on Saturday the otherwise sedate square buzzes with merriment as King Wenceslas IV and his entourage proceed through Mikulov in costume. High above town, the castle hosts wine tastings, and there’s local wine and food to sample on central Kapucínská street. Attracting around 65,000 visitors over three days, the festival features live music, kids’ entertainment and more. While you’re there: Don’t leave without taking in the views from 363-metre Svatý Kopeček (Holy Hill), on the edge of Mikulov and crowned by a dazzling white chapel. Where to stay: Boutique Hotel Tanzberg (doubles from €54), whose chef worked with Jamie Oliver. David Creighton Viking re-enactments, UK Largs Viking Festival, North Ayrshire When: 1-9 September Highlight: Travelling back in time to a Viking village (without the pillaging) The Battle of Largs in 1263 was the last mainland confrontation between the Scots and the Vikings, with Scottish king Alexander III crashing to defeat at the hands of Haakon. The Largs Viking festival kicks off with a parade, complete with pipers and a re-enacted skirmish; the final weekend includes a torchlit procession, a full-on battle re-creation, longship burning and fireworks. There’s a food and craft fayre, street performers and a Viking living history village (adults £5, children £2). Why go to Scandinavia when there’s Viking revelry right here at home? While you’re there: Take the 10-minute ferry ride to the island of Great Cumbrae and the attractive town of Millport, with its Cathedral of the Isles, Britain’s smallest working cathedral. Where to stay: With views across the Firth of Clyde to Ailsa Craig, the Old Rectory in Largs (doubles from £80 B&amp;B) used to house ministers of the Episcopal Church next door and has lovely period features. Dixe Wills Uncle Tom Cobley and all, UK Widecombe Fair, Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon When: 11 September Highlight: The location: a sheltered valley, surrounded by moorland tors, with a couple of excellent pubs This famous village get-together – celebrated in a well-known song about a man whose horse dies on its way to the fair – is run by volunteers and celebrates rural life, from horse, pony, cattle, sheep and produce competitions to bale-tossing, hawking and morris dancing. Look out for vintage cars and tractors, and terrier-racing. The Dartmoor Hill Pony Display Team, with young riders in the saddle, showcases these now rather rare ancient, fluffy, friendly native ponies. Apparently Anne Widdecombe lives in the village – you have been warned! • Entrance free, parking £20 a day, no ATMs While you’re there: Hike up to Hound Tor (a mile to the east), one of the most dramatic of the granite outcrops in this part of Dartmoor, said to have inspired The Hound of the Baskervilles. Where to stay: There’s plenty of free/wild camping on the moor – this area is nowhere near the military shooting ranges; you can pitch anywhere away from the road. Chris Moss Giant nuptials, Belgium La Ducasse d’Ath, Ath, Wallonia When: 24 August-8 September Highlight: The procession of seven giants The 700-year-old Giants of Ath festival has long slipped free of its religious origins, but Goliath remains the star. The giants’ parade depicts the marriage of the biblical figure and his fight with David, played by a local boy. The big day is the last Sunday in August, when seven giants, musicians and a giant horse (carried by 16 people) parade through the town. For more folklore, the Maison des Géants museum, in an 18th-century townhouse, is a colourful guide to this tradition. Don’t leave without trying a tarte à masteilles, an almond tarte that locals wash down with a glass of burgundy. Around 100,000 people visit for the festival, so accommodation books up quickly. While you’re there: Cycle the 14 miles to the Maison du Pays des Collines in Ellezelles, north of Ath (walloniabelgiumtourism.co.uk). Where to stay: The central Hôtel du Parc has recently been renovated (doubles from €98 room-only) Jennifer Rankin Costume drama, Slovenia Dnevi Narodnih Noš, Kamnik When: 7-9 September Highlight: The final parade, with scores of lavish regional costumes First come the men in floral hats, cracking disconcertingly long bullwhips. There follows a parade of elaborate floats, carriages, brass bands and marchers in the intricate, handmade traditional folk costumes of regions throughout Slovenia and beyond. The diversity of cultural heritage (some 50 dialects and 24 distinct culinary regions) in this tiny country is on full display at the snappily titled National Costumes and Clothing Heritage Days. Three-castled Kamnik is a charming medieval gateway to the Alps, and the beer capital of Slovenia, with six award-winning microbreweries in a town of just 13,000. While you’re there: Visit Volčji Potok Arboretum, five minutes from Kamnik, a world-class botanical garden with more than 2,500 trees and shrubs, plus an elaborate play area. Where to stay: Pod Skalo is a B&amp;B, hostel and pub (bunkbeds from €18 B&amp;B, doubles from €56 B&amp;B) a short walk from the centre of Kamnik. It is the only place in town open into the small hours, with local beers on tap. Noah Charney Knights on the town, Sweden Medieval Week, Visby, Gotland When: 5-12 August Highlight: Watching knights in medieval attire jousting on galloping horses Every August, the island of Gotland steps back in time to the middle ages and Visby, its largest town, becomes a mini kingdom celebrating Sweden’s medieval heritage during Medeltidsveckan, or Medieval Week. Visby itself is surrounded by a 13th-century ring wall with more than 50 towers and is a Unesco world heritage site. With more than 500 events in seven days, festivalgoers can attend jousting tournaments, haggle at markets, listen to storytellers, laugh at court jesters, watch fire shows and marvel at magicians. There is also a full-scale re-enactment of the 1361 Battle of Wisby against Danish forces. While you’re there: Stroll or cycle along the three-mile Strandpromenaden that wraps around Visby’s northern coast for panoramic Baltic views. Where to stay: Clarion Hotel Wisby (doubles from €205 B&amp;B) is a former 17th-century warehouse in Visby’s old town. Lola Akinmade Åkerström Midsummer madness, Denmark Sankt Hans festival, Skagen, Jutland When: 23 June Highlight: Partying on the northernmost tip of Denmark, where the sun barely sets in June Sankt Hans involves communal singing, bonfires and dancing – a tradition captured by artist P S Krøyer in a 1906 painting. Join the fun on the beach at Skagen, when a grand bonfire is lit with a straw witch figure on top – a reference to the many men and women convicted of witchcraft and burned alive in the 16th and 17th centuries. There’s live music before the bonfire is lit. While you’re here: Walk up to the very tip and northernmost point of Denmark, Grenen, and watch the waves collide where the seas of Skagerrak and Kattegat meet. Where to stay: Danhostel Skagen has dorm beds for £23, doubles from £52, both including Danish breakfast buffet.

But don’t despair – or maybe do, depending on your vibe. We have one more day of this. Isn’t that grand? Tomorrow is the last day until parliament resumes on 18 June 18, where the Senate will be back – and so, apparently, will Barnaby Joyce. For anyone who missed his tweets today, it doesn’t look like he is overly happy with the government’s attempt to shuffle him off until August and felt the need to let the world know he would be back on 15 June. A big thank you to the Guardian’s brain trust for all that they do. And to Mike Bowers, who may throw balloons at my head but is still the best damn partner to ride this crazy train with. For everyone who read and followed along today, in the comments and out, thank you very much. If I didn’t get back to you, I am working on it. I’ll be back here early tomorrow morning but in the meantime ... take care of you. Just some context on the Ann Sudmalis challenge: if Malcolm Turnbull’s and Scott Morrison’s intervention was enough for the numbers people – the power brokers who were looking to shift her in favour of Milton businessman Grant Shultz – then she will more than likely be OK. Liberals are saying that is the case, that while Shultz is still giving it a red hot go, the numbers are no longer there. But you never know how these things will play out. Did someone lose a bet? I meant to come back to this a bit earlier but was sidetracked by the Michaelia Cash circus. Never mind, better late than never. Emma Husar, a member of parliament who has actually been through the family court system, had a little to say to Sky about the government’s proposed changes. What we need is for this government to take responsibility that on their watch backlogs and the blowouts of waiting times has significantly increased. First of all they need to own up to that. Secondly, this is a slap to Pauline Hanson. She came in here all bluff and bluster at how she wanted to reform this system. This is right up her alley. This is exactly what she wanted, which is a step to demolishing and abolishing the family law court itself, which she has called for numerous times. The issue around merging the two courts together, simply changing the letterhead, stationery and name of something, does not actually reduce any backlogs that are currently being experienced. We have a situation with this government that we had a report. I spoke to you, I think last year about, which was DV and family law and the intersection of both. It was 33 recommendations handed down out of that report. Not one of them has been adopted. I actually think to this day that the government hasn’t even responded to that report. It’s sitting on a shelf somewhere – thanks very much for your hard work, guys – and they’ve put it to the side. They announced at the end of last year that they would have a full review into the family law system which is due to report in March 2019. Now, why they’ve called this now and why they’re trying to do this now was beyond any reasonable person in this building to try and make sense of and not waiting for the fullness of that inquiry and that report to come down by March of next year. Which would have included, and does include, extensive consultation. So what we’ve seen now, they’re making these changes based on one report, which we haven’t actually seen. They are going to, you know, potentially ignore what happens in March of 2019 anyway and say we’ve done something and something’s better than nothing. Simply rebranding, rebadging and changing the stationery is actually not a way to clear a backlog.” Here is what Tony Abbott had to say about Craig Kelly being under preselection threat: “I think it would be a disaster for our party if Craig Kelly were to lose preselection. An absolute disaster. He has been a very good local member, he has been a very strong participant in all of our policy discussions, he has been a very good and vocal advocate for our position. He is a liberal in the Menzies/Howard tradition and we have to keep him there. “The idea he should be knocked off, at this point in time, for someone who is the beneficiary of factional deals and has been branch stacking, I just think that is the worst possible look. “The only way we can win the election is if we have harmony inside our party and we sure ain’t going to have harmony if Craig Kelly gets rolled.” And on Barnaby Joyce: “Barnaby is a friend of mine. Yes, I have spoken on numerous occasions to Barnaby in recent months, because he is going through a very difficult time, and he deserves the support of his friends. “... I reckon that the last thing we should be doing is going over and over the entrails of someone’s private life. I would like to celebrate the contribution that Barnaby has made to our public life. He saved the government at the last election. If the National party hadn’t won seats, held on to its own and even won a seat, we wouldn’t be in government. “Barnaby has been a wonderful advocate for farmers; he has been a great voice for common sense in public policy. He is about the only person who has barnstormed the country saying we have to develop northern Australia, we have got to have dams, because water is wealth, and without dams we are sacrificing one of our great natural resources, so I would really rather focus on that in that time, and it would certainly cheer Barnaby up to have people focus on that. “... Why should he [leave politics]? Barnaby is somebody who has devoted the last 15 years of his life to public service. He’s been very, very good at it. We should be encouraging good people to be in the public service. We shouldn’t be hounding them out by a focus on their private life. “Now, I am not saying that everyone’s private life isn’t interesting in a prurient way, and I am not saying that everyone’s private life is in every sense, blameless – but hey, when we are talking about public figures, let’s focus on what they are doing for us and Barnaby has done for a us in the past and I hope he can do a lot for us in the future.” Ann Sudmalis is being challenged for preselection despite the prime minister’s intervention. Labor has also welcomed the Catholic church’s announcement. From its statement: Labor welcomes the announcement today that the Catholic church will join the national redress scheme for institutional survivors of child sexual abuse. This is an important milestone on the path to redress and justice for survivors, and it means we are one step closer to survivors getting the redress they deserve. Today is a particularly significant day for the thousands of people who have fought so long and so hard for redress and justice. We particularly acknowledge Leonie Sheedy and everyone at the Care Leavers Australasia Network (Clan), Chrissie Foster and her late husband Anthony Foster, and the many Australians who fought against the Catholic church for so many years for the truth to be revealed. The royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse found that the scale and severity of abuse in the Catholic church was appalling. Between 1980 and 2015, there were more than 4,000 people who reported allegations of child sexual abuse to Catholic authorities. In total, the royal commission estimated that about 7% of Catholic priests in Australia between 1950 and 2010 were accused of child sexual abuse. The royal commission referred at least 300 matters relating to abuse in the Catholic institutions to the police. The Catholic church bears a huge responsibility, and it is welcome it has made the decision to be the first non-government institution to join the redress scheme. There is no excuse for any state government, church, institution or non-government organisation not to join the national redress scheme where sexual abuse has occurred. We urge all remaining states and institutions to sign up to the scheme as soon as possible. The Gillard Labor government established the royal commission ... in 2013. We understand that no amount of money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors. However, redress is an important step along the road to healing for survivors.” Department staff have faced questioning about how the private health insurance reforms are playing out. Measures introduced by the government include allowing insurers to discount hospital insurance premiums for 18- to 29-year-olds by up to 10%, labelling policies in gold, silver and bronze categories to help consumers identify policies that offer less value for money, and reducing the minimum benefits payable by private health insurers for devices on the prostheses list. Questioning from the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, revealed that in March there were 11.3 million Australians with hospital cover, an increase of more than 10,000 since December, and the number of people with cover for general treatment increased by 13.5% since December. Di Natale asked the department how this increase could be explained given there had been an overall downward trend in recent years in the number of people taking out insurance. The department’s Penny Shakespeare said she hoped the increase was because some of the government’s reforms had been looked at favourably by consumers. The department’s Charles Maskell-Knight says “it’s the most significant upwards movement for a year”. Except – If you look at the figures for the year to March, 37,000 fewer people had cover compared with the previous year. Most of those who took out cover were the over-55 group (so older, sicker, people), and 98,000 younger people dropped out. Also, people tend to sign up for insurance early in the year before premium rises take effect in April. So the rise in insured people in the March quarter isn’t anything for the government to be excited about. Meanwhile senator Murray Watt wants to know how much the government’s reforms will keep premiums in check by next year. He asks if the department can guarantee premium rises of less than 4% next year. The reply is that the government can’t predict the future. “I’m not sure it’s the role of the department to offer guarantees,” said Shakespeare. So Watt turns his attention to the rural health minister, Bridget McKenzie. Labor, Watt says, if elected would introduce a policy of capping premium rises at 2% for two years. Why won’t the government commit to the same? “We’re not North Korea, senator Watt. We can’t stipulate exactly what everybody has to pay for the one product that we’ll offer,” said McKenzie. OK, unpacking what Tony Abbott just had to say to 2GB. On Russia: “We’ve got to make it crystal clear that no one can kill Australians with impunity. Now I accept that the Russians thought they were shooting down an Ukrainian military transport, they didn’t know they were shooting down a civilian jet liner. But the fact is, they acted with reckless indifference to human life. “This is an atrocity. Russia has to admit responsibility. It has to at the very least apologise and offer some kind of compensation to the families of the dead, and if they don’t they have to suffer some consequences. “I think expelling the ambassador is a very appropriate gesture, but I would like to think that there could be something quite serious and material, because as I said, we are a serious country, we take the wellbeing of our citizens seriously and when our citizens are violated in the most dreadful way as those 38 Australians were, our country has to take some action. “... When two people were victims of chemical warfare in Britain, Australia expelled two Russian intelligence agents. Now these are our people – not just two, but 38 of them that were murdered. They weren’t just attacked, they were murdered, so our action in respect of our own people has got to be even more serious than the action we took in conjunction with Britain over their people.” But he doesn’t think the Socceroos should boycott the World Cup. On energy: “I’m very worried that what’s going to happen here is we will go into that Coag meeting and in the end, to get a deal that the Labor states will agree to, we will do things that we would rather not do, we will agree to things that we would rather not agree to, and then it will all be presented to the party room as a done deal on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. “I don’t think that is good enough, frankly. I think there needs to be a proper internal process if people are going to wholeheartedly support any policy that we take forward, because, let’s face it, this is going to be critical to the next election. The prime minister says, quite rightly, that we want to be the party of low power prices and we want to let Labor be the party of high power prices, but we have to have a real policy that will deliver lower power prices and this isn’t in the end about coal as such ... It is ultimately about lower prices for power, so that our cost of living pressures are less and we have more jobs, not fewer jobs, because we stop destroying our own industries. “Let’s face it, the only comparable advantage we have ever had in manufacturing is cheap power and we are destroying it and it is an act of national insanity.” “The only way we are going to win the election is if we have harmony in our party room, and we are not going to have harmony if Craig [Kelly] gets rolled,” Tony Abbott tells 2GB. Just adding to the Fair Work Ombudsman cost of $180,000, the ROC chief has said how much his organisation has spent on the AWU case: That’s now over half a million dollars. Because there is so much interest – here is the transcript from Michaelia Cash’s press conference, as put out by her office just moments ago: MINISTER CASH: I would like to address the issue of Labor and the unions’ stunt today. The subpoena was issued at the request of the Australian Workers’ Union, Bill Shorten’s former union. The subpoena itself makes this clear. This is, in fact, the third subpoena at the AWU’s request. It does not surprise me that the AWU is trying this tactic again. Can I confirm, for the record, because there does seem to be some confusion, I am not a party to these proceedings. The proceedings themselves are actually between the Australian Workers’ Union and the Registered Organisations Commission. Again, I am not a party to these proceedings. Of course, at the heart of these proceedings, a fact that Labor and the AWU want you to forget: the person who has questions to answer is the former head of the AWU, Bill Shorten. The AWU has refused to provide evidence that donations made when Bill Shorten was the national secretary were properly authorised. The fundamental question is: when Mr Shorten was secretary of the AWU, did he donate $100,000 of union members’ money to GetUp, of which he was a director at the time, without proper approval of the unions’ executive? Today is just another effort by the union movement to protect Bill Shorten. The Government will always stand up to protect workers and ensure that the members’ dues, hard-working money handed over by members, are not used inappropriately. Questions? QUESTION: [Inaudible questions] MINISTER CASH: I cannot … QUESTION: Minister, would you accept the [indistinct] unanimous decision today to front up again and answer more questions? MINISTER CASH: You would be aware that I have answered numerous questions in estimates over many, many days and weeks now. I will not be bullied by the Australian Labor Party. I am not the relevant minister. Craig Laundy is the relevant minister. I will attend estimates when I am the responsible minister. QUESTION: [Inaudible questions] MINISTER CASH: Phil, Phil. Hold on, Phil. So I – Phil. QUESTION: Does this mean you do not intend [indistinct] … MINISTER CASH: I will comply with the legal process, and Phil, as part of that process, I have issued instructions to the lawyers to have the subpoena set aside. QUESTION: On what basis do you think it should be set aside? And are you confident that will happen, given that the court refused that application in December? MINISTER CASH: As I said, they did not refuse that application in December. The majority of that subpoena was actually set aside and the documents that were provided, we were very happy to provide. There was some misreporting, actually, in relation to that. Again, I have issued instructions for the subpoena to be set aside, and I do not intend to now play the court process out publicly. QUESTION: Minister, could I just clarify? You are saying that you have been bullied by Labor on this, but my question is, this is the first time we have seen you at a major press conference in some months. You haven’t been out in the public all that much until the last month. This is constraining your capacity to do your job and to sell the government’s message on jobs, isn’t it? MINISTER CASH: I completely disagree. During budget week I think I was out three times a day. I am out there every other day talking to the Australian people about jobs. And I tell you, the feedback is incredibly positive. When you talk to people about what the government said they would do in 2013 – we would create 1m jobs within five years. When you go and sit down with them and say, can I now give you the actual statistics? This is not Michaelia Cash talking, this is not Malcolm Turnbull talking, let me give you the statistics. The economy has created 1m jobs in less than five years. That is what Australians outside of, you know, Canberra, are actually excited about. And what they want the government to do is now say: great, you created 1m jobs, or you put in place the right economic conditions to create 1m jobs, what is the next challenge? And the next challenge for us is to ensure the economy continues to create jobs. QUESTION: You were hiding behind a whiteboard … MINISTER CASH: Oh, can I just – we have got to very clear. OK, I had nothing to do with the whiteboard. Can I tell you, you think you were surprised? You should have seen the look on my face. I was the one who was surprised. I believe it is parliamentary security have taken full responsibility for what occurred. We advised many journalists of that on the night. Reports, unfortunately, were not changed, but they have answered questions on notice and they had been very, very clear. I had nothing to do with it. My office had nothing to do with it. That was something that the Department of Parliamentary Services took upon themselves. QUESTION: [Indistinct] federal court judge has issued this subpoena. On what grounds should it be set aside? MINISTER CASH: Again, I am not a party to the proceedings, but also, David, I think you have to respect the fact that this is part of a court process. I am not going to play the court process out publicly. Andrew. QUESTION: That being said, correct me if I am wrong, but I think there are two subpoenas in reference to you. One is about attendance and the other one is production of documents. MINISTER CASH: I think it is the same subpoena. QUESTION: Are there documents that you have seen that show you were part of an email exchange, for example, that showed the media had been tipped off about the raid? MINISTER CASH: Not to my knowledge, absolutely not. And I have complied with all subpoenas. I complied with the order to produce the documents back in January. QUESTION: Wouldn’t you be better just to front up to estimates this week, answer the questions, than have this impression created that you are covering up? MINISTER CASH: Michelle, with all due respect, I am absolutely not covering up. I am standing here at this point in time, how many journos are here – 15, 20 of you? I am on national television as we speak. I am absolutely making myself available. I made myself available, Michelle, as you know, several times last year. I front question time every single day. What I find very interesting, though, is this is a protection racket to protect Bill Shorten. Way back last year, if the AWU had produced the evidence that those donations were properly authorised, the matter would have ended there and then. QUESTION: [Indistinct] the AWU did actually release the documents last year, you might remember, in October. There were some documents that had both Bill Shorten’s signature and that of Cesar Melhem. MINISTER CASH: And they did not confirm what was required. QUESTION: Minister, you say it is a cover-up, but you won’t answer, despite being asked more than 10 times yesterday, if you have been interviewed by the AFP, if you’ve had any contact with the AFP, have you given a statement to the AFP? Can you answer that once and for all? MINISTER CASH: Alice, unfortunately, I think you and I both know that, yet again, this is subject to an AFP investigation. And can I again confirm … QUESTION: How is it subject to an investigation to say if you have spoken to the police though? MINISTER CASH: … For the record, it is not an AFP investigation into me, it is not an investigation into my office. The police commissioner himself made clear at estimates last year it would not be appropriate to comment. But as I have consistently said, and I again said in Senate Estimates yesterday, the absolute extent of my knowledge is as set out in the days after, on Hansard record. That is the extent of my knowledge. Thank you very much. Some Mike Bowers QT magic for you: Dan Tehan has welcomed the Catholic Church’s decision – and is confident WA will soon come on board: Obviously we still have more work to do, but today’s development is incredibly welcome and I think now goes a long way to making sure that we will have a National Redress Scheme which is comprehensive and will reach as many survivors as we possibly can. ... There were three issues we needed to finalise with the Western Australian State Government. All those issues have been finalised. Now all the Western Australian State government needs to do is go through their all-party processes. Once that is done, my expectation is we will have an announcement from the Western Australia State government in the very near future.” Australia is handing back tribal skulls to Indonesia. Good. From the statement: The Australian government has returned four culturally significant tribal skulls to the Indonesian Government at an event this afternoon in Canberra. The valuable artefacts were handed over by Australian minister for the arts, senator the hon Mitch Fifield, to the ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to Australia, his excellency Mr Yohanes Kristiarto Soeryo Legowo, at the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia. The traditionally decorated skulls were each presented in a special box crafted by expert conservators from the National Museum of Australia to ensure the safe transport of the historic artefacts. Minister Mitch Fifield acknowledged the importance of the return of the cultural treasures. “Australia and Indonesia have a deep understanding and mutual respect for the culture and heritage of our two countries, and a shared commitment to protect and preserve it,” Minister Fifield said. “The Australian government is pleased to return these culturally significant decorated skulls from the Dayak and Asmat people to Indonesia, as part of our ongoing efforts to combat the international illegal trade in cultural property.” Ambassador Legowo said the return was testament to the close law enforcement and cultural ties between Indonesia and Australia. “The return of cultural property is not only a vivid example of our best practice, but it also signifies that Indonesia and Australia indeed always attach great importance to the protection of cultural heritages,” Ambassador Legowo said. “Hence, having noticed the growing global trends of illicit trafficking and selling of cultural property with many new forms in recent years, the return ceremony should also serve as an impetus for us to strengthen our cooperation to safeguard cultural treasures and to curb illicit activities of this kind.” In many societies human remains were carefully preserved and displayed in cult houses or at sacred sites and used in elaborate ceremonies. The Asmat people from West Papua decorated skulls with seeds and carved seashell rings, while the Dayak people of Borneo decorated skulls with intricate engravings. “We will return these pieces of Indonesian cultural property to their place of origin in Indonesia,” Ambassador Legowo said. The ongoing work to prevent the illegal trade in human remains and cultural artefacts is undertaken in Australia under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. First we had Barry O’Sullivan asking if he identified as a woman, would he be able to use the sheila’s bathroom for his smoko, now we have David Leyonhjelm asking if having your period could be classified as a disability. He’s asking in the context of removing the tax from tampons, for which I commend him, but as someone who has a period, COME ON The prime minister’s office has welcomed the Catholic Church’s decision to join the national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. From the PMO statement: The National Redress Scheme will provide access to counselling, a direct personal response from the institution and a monetary payment. Almost 2,500 survivors gave evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse about sexual abuse in an institution managed by the Catholic Church. According to the royal commission’s final report, 61.8 per cent of all survivors of sexual abuse in a religious institution were from a Catholic-managed institution. Today’s announcement that the Catholic Church will support the National Redress Scheme is a significant development. The Catholic Church will be the first non-government institution to opt in to the National Redress Scheme. If all states and institutions across Australia opt in, the scheme could provide redress to around 60,000 people. The royal commission put the horrific experiences of survivors on the public record and now the redress scheme will officially acknowledge them and continue the process of healing. Every government and institution must take responsibility for the abuse that occurred on its watch, and pay the cost of providing redress. Every state and territory has committed to joining the scheme except Western Australia. The government continues to work very constructively with the Western Australia government as well as other non-government institutions to secure their involvement. The commonwealth legislation to establish the National Redress Scheme passed the House of Representatives yesterday. The Women’s Legal Services Australia has responded to the plan to overhaul the family court system, with a reminder to remember some women are involved in domestic violence situations. From its statement: Women’s Legal Services Australia (WLSA) cautiously welcomes some aspect of the planned amalgamation of the family court and federal circuit court and attempts to reduce court waiting times, but fears decreased specialisation may lead to unsafe outcomes for domestic and family violence (DFV) victims and for children. Federal attorney general, Christian Porter today announced the family court of australia and federal circuit courts will be combined into a new court to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFCA) from 1 January 2019 in an effort to cut substantial waiting times. WLSA spokesperson Angela Lynch says the organisation cautiously welcomes part of the proposal. “WLSA welcomes the rationalisation of rules between the two courts. For our clients, the current system is complicated, confusing and expensive with two sets of rules leading to inconsistent outcomes. We’re supportive of moves to rectify this.” However, Ms Lynch says WLSA has fears the approach may dilute specialisation of the family court needed to safely deal with its high volume of domestic and family violence matters as the proposed changes will potentially see more judges without family law expertise hearing family court matters. “The numbers are huge. We know at least 50 per cent of family court matters involve domestic violence and child abuse,” Ms Lynch said. “At a time when other jurisdictions across Australia are recognising the magnitude of domestic violence in the community and are responding with specialised services such as the Gold Coast DV specialist court it’s an interesting choice to say the least to move away from a specialised legal response.” “If we have judges without the specialised knowledge and training in the complex dynamics of domestic violence and experience in family law, we will see an increase in unsafe and unfair outcomes for victims of domestic violence and their children.” “We should be increasing judge specialisation not reducing it,” Ms Lynch said WLSA awaits further detail on the planned changes but says there are also fears that ultimately the decision may result in less resources for family law as the new court may have to compete with the federal court for funding. “We would like to see more detail. At present there are a lot of questions. It’s not yet clear to us how a rationalisation, without investment in resources will increase capacity.” TFW Peter Dutton calls you by your name: The ABC has responded to Chris Jordan’s comments this morning about the Four Corners episode on the ATO, which took up most of his opening statement. I note though, that despite having a go at the ABC, he has not actually filed a complaint. And apparently we really needed to hear from Paul Fletcher, because the prime minister waits for that stirring performance to end, before calling time on QT. Chris Bowen has a question on why the government won’t support Labor’s tax cut plan, and Malcolm Turnbull punts it to Scott Morrison. I suppose we have only heard from the treasurer once today, so I’ll allow it. Morrison: “I am ... sure that question was not written by Bob Carr. Not even Bob Carr is that stupid. I am sure he is nobody’s puppet, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I quote the leader of the opposition. You may think this quote was from sometime ago, you may think it was maybe back when he was advocating a three-level tax rate in Australia, when he was an advocate for that, but this was only in September of last year. This is what he said in Townsville, the leader of the Labor Party: ‘I think Australians pay enough tax at the moment,’ he said. ‘At the moment’; notice there is a qualifier. He said, ‘I don’t believe that another tax is going to be what Australians need or want at this stage.’ That is what he said. And he ripped into retirees when he put a $10.6bn in two years tax on retirees.” Nope, changed my mind. There are limits. Bill Shorten with round three of the health funding war – this time for Tasmania’s Tasreach health service, and will the prime minister match Labor’s $4.5m funding commitment. And Malcolm Turnbull: (in short) Contrary to the lies that are being spread by the Labor Party, the federal government is providing increased and record funding for health right across the nation. Whether it is in hospitals, and pharmaceutical benefits, whether it is in Medicare. And we are able to provide that funding because we have the budget under control. Because we are able to bring it back into balance. We are able to put life-saving drugs on the PBS. Not like Labor who had to hold them back because they could not afford to put drugs onto the PBS. You, you know very well. You did not. You held them back. It was a disgrace. A disgrace. You should be ashamed of your record.” And repeat ad nauseam for the rest of time. Or at least until the election. Which ever comes first. Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull are giving us our daily dose of what the election campaign is going to look like. Turnbull is obviously still scarred from the “Mediscare” campaign which hit a nerve with voters during the 2016 election and really rattled the PM – as anyone could see from the “victory” speech he gave on the night of the poll. So he is now going very, very hard at calling out Labor “lies”. And in a world of alternative facts, he is being very deliberate in calling them “lies”. He is also very, very annoyed at the truck Labor has going around Longman, about cuts to health funding. And Labor absolutely loves it when he mentions it because they can all tweet and point to the truck. As for the actual facts – yes, health funding has increased and is at record levels but, yes, Labor is right in that funding has been cut because the rate in which it has increased is lower than was anticipated. You’ll see a lot more of this in the election campaign – which is effectively now, with five byelections running. It’s going to come down to who voters believe. While Christian Porter reads a dixer answer, which is essentially a rehash of all the statements and interviews he has given today, we had a chance to peruse some emails, and it looks like Tony Abbott is about to have some fun. He’s speaking at an Australian Environment Foundation event: On Tuesday evening, 3 July 2018, the Hon Tony Abbott – the former PM and current MHR for Warringah in NSW – will speak on ‘Climate change and restraining greenhouse gas emissions’. This event will be the second in a series of lectures that AEF has established to commemorate the life and work of Prof Robert (Bob) Carter, a former director and scientific adviser. The AEF Bob Carter memorial fund is financing the lectures. Mr Abbott’s address will conclude with a question and answer session. Dr Peter Ridd will move the vote of thanks. Peter was a former colleague of Bob Carter at James Cook University and was recently sacked for criticising colleagues’ research on climate change, something for which Bob Carter had previously been sanctioned.” The Australian Environment Foundation describes itself as: a non-profit, membership-based organisation that seeks to protect the environment, while preserving the rule of law, property rights, and the freedom of the individual. We take an evidence-based, solution-focused approach to environmental issues.’’ And I am pretty sure it is linked to the IPA* *A spokesman for the IPA has just contacted me to say there are no “has no financial or organisational links” between it and the AEF. There may have been staff crossover at some point, [as in staff may have worked at both organisations] but the spokesman said that is at a private, not organisational level. So there you have it. Peter Dutton dropped the “shady figure” line in relation to Bill Shorten, and Tony Burke interrupted with a point of order about reflecting on the member. Tony Smith: I was listening carefully. I heard the minister use a phrase that has been used many times without a point of order before. I don’t want to repeat the phrase, but I just make that point.” Dutton does not withdraw, and instead reads from this article, where he appears to conflate Andrew Giles’s Facebook comments with a source who spoke to the Guardian about the CFMEU Victorian conference voting decision. It seems as though even Peter Dutton is bored of dixers. He is basically just repeating what he said yesterday: “You are really safe under this government ... We stopped the boats ... The CFMEU is bad ... ’’ Brendan O’Connor to Malcolm Turnbull: “Can the prime minister confirm that minister Cash misled the Senate on five separate occasions, hid behind a whiteboard at her last appearance at Senate estimates, and despite being in the building right now, hasn’t even bothered showing up at Senate estimates? Prime minister, if minister Cash cannot do her job, why does she still have one?” Turnbull: “If the leader of the opposition can’t prove he had authority to pay $100,000 of his members’ money to GetUp, why should we believe he did?’ I think that is the equivalent of a “Yeah, nah.” Clare O’Neil to Malcolm Turnbull: “When did the prime minister or his office become aware minister Cash had been ordered by the federal court to give evidence over her and her officers’ involvement over an AFP raid?” Turnbull: “If the honourable member’s question is when did I become aware that a subpoena had been issued today, that was this morning. “I heard about it this morning. And the fact is ... this is the third time a subpoena has been issued. There was one before ... There is a court order setting aside one of the previous subpoenas. “While the member might be interested in the outcome of the proceedings, she is not a party of it. The document sought might be of assistance to the AWU’s case. The minister has said that her lawyers will apply to set aside this subpoena, as they have the previous ones. “And the court will make a decision. But the honourable member should recognise that the issue in the proceedings does not relate, does not relate to senator Cash. The issue here is about an attempt to stop the Registered Organisations Commission from finding out whether $100,000 of AWU members’ money was lawfully paid or not. “That is a legitimate inquiry. Do our honourable members opposite seriously believe, seriously believe, does the member for Hotham, distinguished trade unionist herself, does she seriously believe that the payment of union members’ money to an activist group should be done with authority or not? “That is the question. She may think that paying tax is a privilege, but I don’t think that union members believe paying their dues is a privilege. They believe it is paid to the union to represent them. To represent them. And handing it out to GetUp, without authority, that should [intelligible] honour and the decency of every trade unionist opposite, but they all seem, Mr Speaker, to be determined to do everything they can to stop the Registered Organisations Commission finding out whether $100,000 of AWU members’ hard-earned cash was paid to GetUp without authority. Surely the truth should out and the leader of the opposition and the union should say whether it was paid with authority or not and stop trying to obstruct this investigation.” While the dixers are going on, I have just been looking over the day, and noticed this: Michelle Landry, as the Nationals whip, put out this statement regarding Barnaby Joyce’s leave: The member for New England came to me yesterday and requested personal leave – effective immediately, running to the end of June. Given his circumstances, and in consultation with the deputy prime minister and the chief government whip, I approved his leave request.” And yet, Joyce’s tweet says this: If Joyce comes back on 15 June that puts him back at work in time for the June session of parliament, which begins on 18 June. Soooooo, is Barnaby coming back before the government wants him to? Malcolm Turnbull has continued to target the Australian Workers Union over whether its donations to GetUp were properly made. Here is more detail on the controversy from our story on 25 October: The AWU donated $100,000 to GetUp in 2005 and a total of $130,500 in donations to Labor campaigns at the 2007 election, including $25,000 for then national secretary Bill Shorten’s election in Maribyrnong. The $100,000 donation to GetUp was made up of $50,000 from the AWU national office and $50,000 from the Victorian branch. On 25 October the AWU national secretary, Daniel Walton, said: “The AWU national executive met to determine and approve the donations to GetUp and the ALP … Those donations were made to further the interests of AWU members. We stood by them then and stand by them today.” In November 2006 the AWU national executive passed a resolution that requests for donations from Labor candidates in the 2007 election “be left in the hands of the national secretary”. Walton said that resolution was sufficient to meet the AWU’s requirement for authorisation of donations and was “in keeping with previous practices”. The Victorian secretary, Ben Davis, said he believed the GetUp donation was “made in accordance with rules and objectives of the AWU”. Walton said the donations were disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission, producing statements showing the GetUp donations signed by Shorten on 19 January 2007 and then-Victorian secretary Cesar Melhem on in December 2006. Davis said the AWU had “bragged in [its] journal” about supporting GetUp at the time. “It’s a matter of public record,” he said. “The fact that we’d give a donation is hardly a shock, especially to Labor candidates including our [then] national secretary [Bill Shorten].” Andrew Wilkie gets the crossbench question for the second day in a row, and it is on GST: “Tasmanians are anxious right now about the GST and whether or not the formula will be changed to our disadvantage. This is a separate matter from your Braddon byelection promise that Tasmania will not see its dollar amount of GST reduced. So, prime minister, when will the government respond to the final report of the Productivity Commission inquiries into the GST, and in particular, make clear the government’s intention regarding the formula, and prime minister, most importantly, will you now commit to not changing the GST formula to Tasmania’s disadvantage?” Malcolm Turnbull: “The government has been given the Productivity Commission’s final report on horizontal fiscal equalisation, which examined our system for determining how GST revenue is distributed among states and territories. “This will be released within weeks, not months. But we obviously have to go through it and read it carefully. The government is committed to releasing the report in June. As the treasurer has committed both cabinet and the state and territory treasurers will have the opportunity to be briefed on the report before it is published. There will still be an exhaustive process which follows the Productivity Commission’s report release. We will consider its recommendations and work with the states and territories to come up with a package of reforms. It is important that we take the time to fully examine any proposed changes to our system of horizontal fiscal equalisation and to understand state and territory views and perspectives. “It is also important that any new arrangements are seen as being fair everywhere. It has to pass the pub test in Burnie, as it does in Bunbury, Ballarat and Bendigo, right around the country. “Mr Speaker, I can say to the honourable member, whatever changes are made to the GST to make it fairer or more transparent, the payments that Tasmania receives will not be reduced by 1 cent. Tasmania will not lose 1 cent, we will ensure that.” That Burnie to Bunbury line has been trotted out a few times by the prime minister – he is quite the fan of alliteration. Tanya Plibersek to Malcolm Turnbull: “Does the prime minister have confidence that each statement minister Cash has made to the parliament in relation to the circumstances surrounding the Australian Federal Police raids was truthful.” Turnbull: “I have complete faith in the minister, Senator Cash. “A return to the central fact. The AWU has issued a subpoena to Senator Cash. The court has at the request of the AWU. “... On the application of the union the court issued the subpoena. This is the third subpoena. One was substantially set aside. The other was completely set aside. Senator Cash is entitled to seek to set aside a subpoena if it is judged not relevant. That is a legal matter for the court. Again, the rule of law must prevail. Registered Organisations Commission is seeking to determine whether the leader of the opposition paid $100,000 of his members’ money to GetUp without authority. I think all honourable members would agree if the leader of the opposition was paying $100,000 of his members’ money to GetUp without authority that would be a very, very serious wrong. A very serious act of misconduct, misappropriating other people’s money. Now the union has taken action to stop the Registered Organisations Commission investigating this. And the question is why? Because it would be very easy to prove. Plenty of lawyers on that side. All they would need is the minutes of the meeting, duly attested and approved and that would demonstrate that the payment was made with authority. Why hasn’t it been produced? And no wonder people increasingly believe they cannot trust the leader of the opposition with other people’s money, let alone with the management of our economy.” In exciting news, dixers have moved from “alternative approaches” to “different courses of action”. George Orwell would be so proud. Anyways, John Alexander reads the question without notice that his constituents very much care about the treasurer and we get our first dose of the human pointing finger emoji. That finger will be up and pointing next Wednesday when Queensland once again dominates state of origin, I can tell you that. Speaking of other people’s money... Tanya Plibersek to Malcolm Turnbull: “I refer to the previous answer. As Senator Cash has nothing to hide from the federal court, why does she not show up?” I’m going to save my fingers and refer you to the previous answer on this. First dixer and nooooooooppppppppppppe. #deathtodixers Mark Dreyfus to Malcolm Turnbull: [It’s on Michaelia Cash, but I missed the first part because I was stuffing my face] Why is the minister refusing to give evidence under oath? Why is it that the minister will say it to a media conference or even to the parliament, but not under oath? Turnbull: “Mr Speaker, the unions, the AWU, the AWU, supported by the honourable member, is doing everything it can to stop the registered organisations commission from finding out whether the leader of the opposition paid $100,000 of AWU members dues money to GetUp without authorisation. That is what it is about. So the issue is this. “[There are interjections]... No doubt the member believes in the rule of law. He is. He is a QC. He is. He is a lawyer. Anyone can go to jail if they get the right lawyer. It is important to have the right one. Mr Speaker, the member for Isaacs knows well it would be a very, very serious matter if a union paid $100,000 of its members funds to GetUp without authorisation. “Senator Cash is not a party to the proceedings. The wrongdoings, suspected wrongdoing that is being investigated is the payment of$100,000 by the leader of the opposition to it GetUp. Now, if he did that, with authority, all we need to see is the minutes of the executive committee meeting proving its with an affidavit from the secretary saying it is a true and correct record. That is all the leader of the opposition needs to provide. And armed with such a great legal advisor as the member for Isaacs, the leader of the opposition would know this. So a reasonable person, observing the failure of the leader of the opposition to prove the payment was authorised, and the determination of the union to stop the payment being investigated, can only assume that the payment was not authorised. And that is the cover-up, that is the shameful act that the Labor Party and the member for Isaacs are trying to obfuscate.” Mike Bowers was in the Blue Room I just looked at the time and realised we were in the downhill slide into question time. I am ready to go hide under my desk, so I can’t imagine how you are all feeling. Meanwhile, back in the employment estimates hearing: As for the bullying allegations, Mark Dreyfus wanted to know how asking questions was now considered ‘bullying’: “Where is the bullying here? This is a minister, a cabinet minister, who has misled the chamber she is a member of, five times, and she is still not saying - she was discovered, she was found out, because she sacked her media advisor, David de Garis, who was the person who apparently, tipped off the media about the raid, but she is not answering questions, despite her misleading of the Senate, that is why she needs go back to Senate estimates and answer the questions. “She needs to be the minister she has been appointed to be, otherwise, the prime minister should be considering her position and so should she, because she is not prepared to do her job, she is not prepared to be accountable, she is not prepared to answer the hard questions. “It is a really disgraceful performance, but really, she has topped it off with the angry and defensive press conference she has just given.” Barnaby Joyce has popped up again today - on Twitter this time: Mark Dreyfus was on Sky immediately after the Michaelia Cash press conference: “What we’ve seen is an angry and defensive press conference from Senator Cash. What a crisis-ridden government which is just lurching from one crisis to the next. “As Senator Cash knows, it is an order of the federal court of Australia that she appear. She can say whatever she likes. She seems quite willing to comment when she thinks she can wound Labor or wound the union movement, but when any hard question is asked of her, she says ‘oh no, that’s a court proceeding’, or ‘oh no, that’s an AFP investigation’. She needs to answer critical questions. She should do her job and go into Senate estimates and answer questions there. “This ducking – what is she the minister for? She is apparently not the minister for very much, she wants to say Craig Laundy is the minister – he is not in the Senate. “She is and she should be fronting Senate estimates right now.” So, not going to estimates, will be fighting the court summons, it’s actually Bill Shorten who has the questions to answer, and the whiteboard was nothing to do with her. “You should have seen my face,” she says. We couldn’t though. Because it was behind a whiteboard. Why won’t she even answer the question of whether she has been interviewed by the AFP? Unfortunately, I think you and I both know that this is subject to an AFP investigation. Can I again, confirm, for the record, it is not an AFP investigation into me, it is not an investigation into my office. The police commissioner himself made clear in estimates last year it would not be appropriate to comment. But as I have consistently said again and again in Senate estimates yesterday, the absolute extent of my knowledge is as set out in the days after on Hansard record. That is the extent of my knowledge. Thank you very much.” It is still Labor’s fault: I am absolutely not covering up. I am standing here at this point in time, how many journalists are here? Fifteen [to] 20 of you? I am on national television as we speak. I am absolutely making myself available. I made myself available, as you know, several times last year. I front question time every single day. What I find very interesting though is this is a protection racket to protect Bill Shorten. Way back last year, if the AWU had produced the evidence that those donations were properly authorised, the matter would have ended there and then. This may be the first and only time you hear this from a minister: I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WHITEBOARD Can I be very clear, I had nothing to do with the whiteboard. Can I tell you? Do you think you were surprised? You should have seen the look on my face. I was the one who surprised. I believe it is parliamentary security who had taken full responsibility for what occurred. We advised many journalists of that on the night. “Reports, unfortunately, were not changed. But they have answered questions on notice and they had been very, very clear. I had nothing to do with it. My office had nothing to do with it. That was something that the Department of Parliamentary services took upon themselves. Will the minister re-appear back in estimates? You would be aware that I have answered numerous questions in estimates over many, many days and weeks now. I will not be bullied by the Australian Labor Party. I am not the relevant minister. Craig Laundy is the relevant minister. I will attend estimates when I am the responsible minister. Michaelia Cash: The AWU has refused to provide evidence that donations made, when Bill Shorten was the national secretary, were properly authorised. The fundamental question is, when Mr Shorten was secretary of the AWU, did he donate $100,000 of union members money to GetUp, of which he was a director at the time, without proper approval of the unions’ executive. Today is just another effort by the union movement to protect Bill Shorten. The government will always stand up to protect workers and ensure that the members’ dues, hard-working money handed over by members, are not used inappropriately. Michaelia Cash is calling this a “Labor/union stunt” and says this is the third subpoena she has been issued. It does not surprise me that the AWU is trying this tactic again. Can I confirm, for the record, because there does seem to be some confusion. I am not a party to these proceedings. The proceedings themselves are actually between the Australian Workers’ Union and the registered organisations commission. Again, I am not a party to these proceedings. Of course, at the heart of these proceedings, the fact that Labor and the AWU want you to forget. The person who has questions to answer is the former head of the AWU, Bill Shorten.” Michaelia Cash will hold a press conference at 1pm. Stay tuned. The federal court has reissued a subpoena at the behest of the Australian Workers Union for Michaelia Cash to give evidence in its challenge against the legality of the Australian Federal Police raid. Unless the subpoena is torn up this will mean on 1 August Cash has to tell her side of the story about the leak to the media about the AFP raid. Guardian Australia can confirm that Cash will apply to have the subpoena set aside before an 8 June case management hearing. So we have a subpoena but no final answer about whether Cash will have to front court, pending that challenge. Christopher Pyne spoke about Barnaby Joyce’s personal leave this morning, as part of his regular 5AA radio slot with Anthony Albanese: Well, it would depend on the circumstances of the individual worker. So parliament sits until, I think, 28 June. He is not on leave from turning up to work if he chooses to do so after that, but he is just on leave from parliament and parliament doesn’t sit again until mid-August and that’s the time frame you’re looking at from parliament. Whether Barnaby is well enough to return to work in his electorate office in New England is really a matter for him and his medical practitioner, not a matter for me to cast judgement on.” Asked if Michaelia Cash’s position is now “untenable”, Julie Bishop says: Absolutely not. There have been a number of ministers over the years required to attend proceedings and they comply with that requirement.” Meanwhile, there is a bit of chatter around here that Cash is considering potentially challenging the subpoena, but nothing firmed up as yet. Darren Chester turned up on Sky, after his very brief appearance in the Mural Hall, where he accused the AWU of “bullying” Michaelia Cash . Asked if he believed it to be sexism, Chester said “absolutely”. “I think they are bullies, they are trying to bully this minister, I think it is to create a smoke screen trying to divert attention away from the good work she is doing.” Topics being tackled in community affairs estimates today are private health insurance, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and Medicare. Senator David Leyonhjelm has asked health department staff about whether doctors who are authorised to prescribe RU486 for medical terminations could have their details listed online to make it easier for women to find them. The department responds that doing so might breach privacy laws and be a criminal offence, and that there is nothing stopping doctors advertising that they are qualified to provide the medicine themselves. There are 1476 doctors registered to prescribe RU486 in Australia. Leyonhjelm is told that even if a government-managed list of prescribing doctors was made available, the department would have to consider the cost to the community of continuously updating it. The Greens are also considering their position on the family court changes: Delays in the family court system should be addressed by more funding for the courts, legal aid and community legal centres, Greens Justice spokesperson Nick McKim says. “Families should have their cases resolved quickly and compassionately,” Senator McKim said. “Unfortunately that is not happening because of overstretched courts, community legal centres and legal aid.” “The Liberals urgently need to invest in these areas to help families in crisis move on and resolve their cases.” “We are also yet to see the government reinvest the savings from merging the back office functions of the family court and federal circuit court.” Network Seven have released the promo for the Barnaby Joyce and Vikki Campion interview. This is how they are promoting it: She’s the woman at the centre of the biggest political scandal in decades, yet nobody has heard her side of the story … until now. In an exclusive Sunday Night interview, Vikki Campion opens up for the first time about her illicit affair with Barnaby Joyce, their newborn son, and the pressure that almost drove her to do the unthinkable. Raw, unfiltered and brutally honest. Nothing is off limits as Vikki addresses the endless speculation about the affair and their working relationship, the showdown with Barnaby’s wife, the cruel and relentless attacks and the question of the child’s paternity. And Barnaby Joyce takes aim at his colleagues over his treatment in the wake of the scandal that would ultimately cost him his job as deputy prime minister. But, as Alex Cullen reports, this is also a very human story – at the heart of it, the couple’s gorgeous son, Sebastian, who became the most talked about baby in Australia.” That’s on Sunday night, for anyone who is interested. Darren Chester held a very, very brief press conference where he was asked about Michaelia Cash: They are the issues of the minister to discuss at the appropriate time.” After which he ended it. I have had ice cubes last longer on a 40 degree day. Meanwhile, in Queensland, Bob Katter is still working on getting north Queensland seceded: Labor is considering its response to the proposed family court changes. Here is Mark Dreyfus’s statement on the issue: Labor welcomes the government’s acknowledgement of the crisis in the family court system, and the pain it is causing families caught up in it. This situation has been going for far too long, and has worsened on the government’s watch. Any change aimed at improving the experience of families when they are going through their toughest time must be given worthy consideration, and Labor will examine closely the government’s legislation when it is presented. However, the government has some explaining to do as to why it believes the effective abolition of the family court is the solution to the current crisis. It claims 8,000 more family law matters will be cleared every year – nearly 40 per cent of the current backlog. On what basis does it make this claim? There is little detail as to how the “single point of entry” to the merged federal circuit court and family court will work. Serious concerns have also been raised at the removal of the appeals division of the family court – which means that the toughest and most complex family law cases will no longer be heard by specialists. Moreover, the government has not acknowledged several other factors that have contributed to the current backlogs in the court system – including judicial vacancies not filled for months, a funding crisis in legal assistance services and an increase in unrepresented litigants. Any solution to this crisis will not be complete if these factors are not addressed. The government’s proposal also does not address recommendations made by former chief justice of the family court Diana Bryant for a funding injection to provide for an increased number of registrars and family consultants, so that families can avoid having to go to court in the first place. Finally, there has been some suggestion in recent media reporting, in the form of unattributed statements, that the current backlog is partly caused by judges not working hard enough, or allowing appeal judgments to be coloured by personal opinion. This is offensive to the hard-working judges of the family court, who do a very difficult job. It is time for such statements to stop. The committee is back and has “unanimously resolved” to invite Michaelia Cash to return to give evidence. Brendan O’Connor is holding a press conference, where he is calling for Michaelia Cash to consider her future as a minister: This is not just about a crime, it is also about ministerial responsibility and the fact that the minister is hiding behind public interest immunity and on one occasion, tragically and comically, hid behind a moving whiteboard to avoid scrutiny, says everything about this government,” he said. [Although in fairness, the whiteboard was apparently the work of ‘overzealous’ security officers.] “It is about not being accountable to the parliament and indeed, for those reasons, the prime minister needs to consider the position of the minister. “The minister herself won’t make a decision to resign, the prime minister should consider that position because quite frankly, it is untenable for this to continue. “It has gone on for seven months and I do believe it was incumbent on the minister originally to answer these questions and today, she has been unable to account for her conduct or the conduct of her office and now, she is not even in a position to do her day job, not turning up to estimates today, and leaving estimates early yesterday, instead of representing the minister that she’s supposed to be representing in budget estimates. Penny Wong has entered the employment estimates hearing. It is now on a short break while the committee (the non-government members at least) attempt to force Michaelia Cash to appear. Doug Cameron and Murray Watt can not believe the gift they have been given in this estimates. Zed Seselja looks like he wishes he was anywhere else. Cameron: Minister, why are we engaging in this cover up. Why can’t we just get the minister here? I mean, you shouldn’t engage in this. Seselja: I completely reject your assertion. Cameron: Well, it seems like a cover up to me. Seselja: Well, you allege all sorts of things in this place, Senator Cameron and much of it is not true, so. Cameron: Well, I am just asking you, why you are engaging in the cover up, you should be assisting the estimates committee to get the information. Seselja: That is exactly what I have been [doing] and the officials are here ready, and they have been answering your questions. If you have further questions for them, I am sure you will continue to answer them. Cameron: So can you ask, on notice, when the prime minister became aware of this subpoena? Seselja: I’ll take it on notice Cameron: Has the ... have any other ministers been advised to your notice? Mr [Craig] Laundy? Seselja: I am not aware of that ... I am happy to take it on notice. Watt: When were you asked to appear today instead of minister [Michaelia] Cash? Seselja: I think sometime in the last couple of weeks when things, when arrangements were being put in place. Watt: When things were ... Seselja: [sighs] When we work out who’s going to be sitting in the chair. Watt: So you were asked a couple of weeks ago ... Seselja: It was sometime ago, it was put in my diary. Watt: It wasn’t this week? Seselja: No, I don’t believe so. Watt: And what reason was given to you at the time about why you needed to, rather than the minister who represents minister Laundy in the Senate? Seselja: No reason is given, as you may be aware, and as Senator Cameron would have been aware when he was in a similar role, assistant ministers ministers come along when they are asked. Watt: Over the last few weeks, what we have learned is that a number of minister Cash’s appointees have hit trouble with the law. We have had Mr [Nigel] Hadgkiss, who was found to break the law, we have had Mr [John] Lloyd who is under investigation for breaking the law, we’ve got at least one staffer of minister Cash who is under police investigation – what does it say about minister Cash, that all around her is this trail of lawbreaking? Seselja: I reject that completely. Watt: But you can’t deny – almost every person ... numerous senior people around her, in many cases handpicked by her, are now facing police investigation or other investigation for breaking the law. What does that say about minister Cash? Seselja: You’ve got to be kidding, I mean you know ... I reject your assertion. For you and your colleagues to come here, when you come in this place, consistently to defend the law-breaking CFMEU and some of the worst offenders there, I completely reject your assertions. The federal court has reissued subpoenas against jobs and innovation minister Michaelia Cash in the Australian Workers Union raid leak matter. Subpoenas were issued last year and in December Cash failed in a legal bid to avoid handing over documents, but the AWU’s federal court case was interrupted by the Australian Federal Police investigation into the leak. Those subpoenas have now been reissued, meaning: By 20 June Cash, former Fair Work Ombudsman employee Mark Lee and former Cash staffer David De Garis must produce any documents they might have, such as correspondence discussing the raid of the AWU headquarters By 1 August Cash, Lee, De Garis and ROC official Chris Enright will give oral evidence Doug Cameron is now asking if Cash can return to Senate estimates to answer questions about the subpoenas. Doug Cameron is now asking whether or not Michaelia Cash can be brought before the committee. She is going to be approached, but no promises. Michaelia Cash may have skipped estimates (although her social media shows she is in the building, making social media videos with backbenchers) but there has been movement in the AWU case On energy, Josh Frydenberg was a little more forthcoming on the “discussion” that occurred in the joint-party room yesterday, where Tony Abbott asked whether the Neg was coming back to the party room before the energy minister’s Coag meeting, and was told NO. “There was a discussion about the process going forward to the meeting in August with the states and the territories. “I made it very clear that what will be discussed with the states and territories is consistent with what has been discussed and approved with the party room previously, but there will be legislation required at a federal level as well as the state level, should there be an agreement in August on the National Energy Guarantee. “It is at that time that the party room can discuss the matter further.” Government MPs are hoping Barnaby Joyce’s leave will draw a line under the saga. Here was Josh Frydenberg talking to Sky a little bit earlier: “It is not for me or others to make a moral judgement on Barnaby Joyce. I would rather just leave it there and obviously our thoughts are with him and his family right now. “... It is what it is. And he is has now taken leave, which is something that obviously he sought, and if it is right for him, it is right for us. “... I have said it is not for me to be lecturing Barnaby Joyce on this matter. Personally, I wouldn’t have done it [the interview] but that is his personal choice that he has made and it is what it is.” The Labor senator Kristina Keneally is pressing Chris Jordan about why he’s complaining about the ABC without lodging a complaint. Keneally refers back to a flourish in Jordan’s opening statement about the ATO not being inclined to boil people to death. Keneally: Did anyone at the ABC suggest the ATO wanted to boil people to death? Jordan said a comment to that effect was put to air. One of the participants in the program said words to that effect. Keneally: A person who was being interviewed said that? Jordan says the comment wasn’t appropriate. Side note for a moment to give a MASSIVE congratulations to my brilliant colleagues Gareth Hutchens and Greg Jericho for their Walkley nomination for their investigation into Australia’s low wage growth. If you haven’t checked it out, I recommend you do. You’ll find the whole project here. Despite Chris Jordan’s passive aggressive opening statement to ATO estimates (see a few posts down), he hasn’t actually DONE anything about his complaints: So, it’s like me when I get served a crap coffee – I’ll whinge about it, probably on my insta, but not actually do anything about it. Nationals party whip, Michelle Landry, has made it official, official: The member for New England came to me yesterday and requested personal leave – effective immediately, running to the end of June. Given his circumstances, and in consultation with the deputy prime minister and the chief government whip, I approved his leave request. The Labor Party has granted the member for New England a pair for this period. Leave of this nature is routinely approved. We all look forward to the member for New England re-joining us after his period of leave. The Greens have announced a policy to peg the minimum wage to 60% of the median wage. The policy replicates the Australian Council of Trade Unions call for the minimum wage to become a “living wage” and comes after the Greens endorsed the unions’ Change the Rules campaign. The policy will create some product differentiation from Labor, which promised a more aggressive approach on the minimum wage but is looking at other options like changing the criteria the Fair Work Commission uses to set it, rather than pegging the minimum wage. Greens employment spokesman Adam Bandt said “inequality is growing, wages are flat-lining and many full-time workers live in poverty”. “The best way to make Australia more egalitarian is to lift the minimum wage, raise Newstart and invest in universal services like health and education,” he said. ACTU secretary Sally McManus welcomed the Greens policy: The tax commissioner Chris Jordan is fronting the economics committee in estimates this morning. He’s cranky with the ABC and Four Corners for a program that went to air earlier this year detailing dealings between the Australian Taxation Office and small businesses. Jordan says the program wasn’t an investigation, it was a series of “ridiculous allegations”. He says there was “no real investigation by Four Corners” and there is no systemic abuse of small business by the ATO. Then a comment, offered in the spirit of the eternal why. Chris Jordan: Why did the ABC think it was OK to call the staff of the ATO mongrel bastards? Simon Birmingham and Michael Keenan both started the morning at a childcare centre this morning. Mike Bowers was there. The shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus said that Labor agrees there’s “a need for reform” because “real problems in the family court system ... [are] causing families pain”. But Dreyfus told ABC Radio “we need to see the evidence for this proposed near abolition of the family court”. Labor is concerned that failure to make appointments to the family court division of the new court will phase out family law specialists. Dreyfus said the government was blaming a lack of efficiency, when failure to fill judicial vacancies and funding that has not increased in line with inflation since Tony Abbott was elected were to blame. Dreyfus noted that Pauline Hanson supports abolition of the family court and called on the government to explain if the changes were part of a deal. Like clockwork It’s been a busy morning for the attorney general. Christian Porter has not only announced a family court revamp, he is also looking at national security. Here’s the statement his office sent out on that: The Turnbull government will undertake the most significant review of intelligence legislation in more than 40 years. Former director general of security, the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Dennis Richardson AO, will head the review, which will examine the legal framework underpinning Australia’s intelligence community and capability. This will be the most comprehensive review of intelligence legislation in Australia since the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security in the 1970s. The review was a key recommendation of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review conducted by Michael L’Estrange AO and Stephen Merchant PSM. The legislative framework governing our intelligence agencies has evolved considerably since the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the Intelligence Services Act 2001 were first introduced. The Coalition government has so far passed 10 tranches of legislative reforms to properly equip our security agencies with the legal framework they need to respond to current and emerging security challenges. The 11th tranche of legislation to modernise espionage offences and establish new foreign interference offences is currently before the parliament. The national security environment is constantly changing and it is essential that we ensure our agencies have the tools and framework they need to be effective and meet their core function – keeping Australians safe. The review will consider options for harmonising and modernising the legislative framework that governs the activities of our intelligence agencies to ensure they operate with clear, coherent and consistent powers, protections and oversight. Mr Richardson is ideally-placed to undertake this important review, having an extensive career in the Australian public service, particularly in the national security, defence and foreign affairs environment. He was secretary of the Department of Defence from 2012 to 2017; director general of Asio from 1996 to 2005; secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade from 2010-2012 prior to which he was Australia’s ambassador to the United States. In addition to intelligence agencies, the review will consider the legislative frameworks for the intelligence functions of the Department of Home Affairs, Australian Federal Police, Australian Transactional Report Analysis Centre and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. This is consistent with the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review’s recommendation to consolidate and expand linkages between members of the national intelligence community. Terms of reference for the review will be announced in the near future. It is expected the review will be completed within 18 months. It was a very, very foggy morning in the capital – and Mike Bowers was out and among it. Before Barnaby Joyce went on leave on Tuesday, he popped with a bright idea to introduce a new tort – the right to sue for – invasions of privacy. The idea has been kicking around legal circles for decades because Australia has very poor protection of the right to privacy, and several recent inquiries have recommended creating the right to sue for serious breaches of privacy. The attorney general, Christian Porter, was asked about Joyce’s plan on ABC AM and responded bluntly: “Can I say that is not a primary focus of government, we’re about to talk about one of the primary focuses of the government [family law reform], but that ain’t one. Regardless of Porter slapping down the idea, it’s not even clear such a right to privacy would extend to preventing the Daily Telegraph snapping a pregnant Vikki Campion walking across the street. The Australian Law Reform Commission has suggested the tort should only apply where “a person in the position of the plaintiff would have had a reasonable expectation of privacy”. I’m not sure you can expect not to have a photograph taken when you’re in a public place. The ALRC proposal is that invasions of privacy would only be actionable where there is: intrusion upon seclusion, such as by physically intruding into the plaintiff’s private space or by watching, listening to or recording the plaintiff’s private activities or private affairs; or misuse of private information, such as by collecting or disclosing private information about the plaintiff. Once again, the political action spilled into the night, with the prime minister’s office announcing Barnaby Joyce had requested, and had been approved, paid personal leave, late on Tuesday. Joyce won’t be back until August. In the meantime, his interview with partner Vikki Campion will have aired – the promos for that were released last night. Meanwhile, Christian Porter has announced a massive overhaul of the family court system, proposing merging it with the federal court circuit from 2019, with the aim of hearing 8,000 more cases every year. As Paul Karp reports: The attorney general, Christian Porter, also announced a new family law appeal division in the federal court of Australia to hear all appeals from the new federal circuit and family court of Australia. Porter said the single entry point for family law matters “will help Australian families resolve their disputes faster by improving the efficiency of the existing split family law system, reducing the backlog of matters before the family law courts, and driving faster, cheaper and more consistent dispute resolution”. George Brandis, who started the process, said not seeing through the court reforms was one of his regrets, as he headed into retirement, as our man in London, and you can absolutely guarantee Pauline Hanson is going to take some credit for this, given it is one of her platforms. Estimates is still rolling on, which includes jobs and small business, which Michaelia Cash has sent her apologies for, sending Zed Seselja along instead. We’ll cover all of that, as well as the chamber shenanigans. Mike Bowers has been out and about since before the sun was up, so I’ll bring you his work, and you can follow along with him on Instagram at @mikepbowers and as part of the behind-the-scenes story on @pyjamapolitics You’ll find me in the comments, or, more immediately, on Twitter at @amyremeikis.

Under the plan the federal circuit court and family court will be merged from 2019, with the new court to resolve all family law matters without the need to move matters between the courts, as currently occurs in 1,200 cases a year. The attorney general, Christian Porter, also announced a new family law appeal division in the federal court of Australia to hear all appeals from the new federal circuit and family court of Australia. Pauline Hanson immediately took credit for the reform – prompting concerns from Labor about why the government was undertaking a reform that may reduce family law specialists instead of boosting the court’s resources. Porter said the single entry point for family law matters “will help Australian families resolve their disputes faster by improving the efficiency of the existing split family law system, reducing the backlog of matters before the family law courts, and driving faster, cheaper and more consistent dispute resolution”. As many as 22,000 family law cases are filed every year across the family court and federal circuit court. The backlog of family law matters has grown from 17,200 to 21,000, with the median time to reach trial increasing from 10.8 months to 15.2 months in the federal circuit court and from 11.5 months to 17 months in the family court. Porter said the government estimated the changes would improve the efficiency of the federal family law system by “up to a third, with the potential in time to allow up to an extra 8,000 cases to be resolved each and every year”. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) is undertaking a review of the family law system and is due to report in March. Porter told the ABC’s AM program the change was “a matter of such obviousness that the present structure was not working and was causing inefficiencies, duplications and delays, that we considered we could make the structural change” before the review. He said the ALRC was looking at the family law itself rather than the court structure. The new court will maintain two separate divisions – one to deal solely with family law and another that will consist of the current federal circuit court judges that hear a mix of matters. In a statement the Law Council president, Morry Bailes, said it was “interested to learn” of the plan and would need greater detail before it would support the reform. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said Labor agreed there’s “a need for reform” because “real problems in the family court system ... [are] causing families pain”. But Dreyfus told ABC Radio: “We need to see the evidence for this proposed near abolition of the family court.” Labor is concerned that failure to make appointments to the family court division of the new court will phase out family law specialists. Dreyfus said the government was blaming a lack of efficiency when its failure to fill judicial vacancies and funding that has not increased in line with inflation since Tony Abbott was elected were to blame. Dreyfus noted that Pauline Hanson supported abolition of the family court and called on the government to explain if the changes were part of a deal. Porter told ABC News Breakfast that in the second stage of reform the new court would “redesign all of its rules and processes, practice directions and procedures so that there’s one simpler set of that type of process”. Porter said on Wednesday the heads of the federal, federal circuit and family courts had been consulted. Porter told Sky News that while a dozen or so judges’ “work complexion and mix” will change, thousands of families stood to benefit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/29/jose-mourinho-porto-full-back-diogo-dalot-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T21:26:27Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho targets Porto full-back Diogo Dalot for Manchester United","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/29/jose-mourinho-porto-full-back-diogo-dalot-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/29/jose-mourinho-porto-full-back-diogo-dalot-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho targets Porto full-back Diogo Dalot for Manchester United","bodyText":"José Mourinho is hopeful of making Porto’s Diogo Dalot his first signing of the summer. Manchester United’s manager is targeting the 19-year-old as a long-term successor to Antonio Valencia at right-back. Dalot has a release clause of €20m (£17.5m) but it is understood this is yet to be triggered by United for a player who made his debut last season, finishing with seven appearances, six of which were in Porto’s triumphant domestic campaign. Dalot can also play in midfield and at left-back, the position he has operated in primarily for Sérgio Conceição’s side. He completed all of the 0-0 draw at Liverpool in the Champions League last-16 second leg in March as Porto were knocked out 5-0 on aggregate. Matteo Darmian, who has been a reserve for Mourinho in both full-back slots, is expected to leave, so Dalot is seen as a replacement for the Italian and as a challenger for Valencia’s first-team berth. The teenager was a member the Portugal Under-16 side who won the European Championship two years ago and the Under-17 team who won the corresponding competition 12 months ago.

There has been an overall increase of almost 400% in the number of reports of sex discrimination and harassment incidents received by Women in Football, with alleged abuse on social media accounting for the biggest leap. During the course of the 2017‑18 season, Women in Football claims to have received complaints from individuals across the football industry. Lewd comments of a sexual nature, racist, gendered remarks and threats of violence were reportedly made to a number of high‑profile female journalists, broadcasters, players and referees. A total of 271 incidents were reported to Women in Football during the 2017‑18 season. These alleged incidents occurred across clubs, organisations and online. Reported incidents on match days were up by 133.3%, workplace incidents by 112.5% and attacks on social media rose by 285.4%. A Women in Football spokeswoman said: “We regularly support women who face discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, providing pro bono legal advice thanks to Mishcon de Reya. We also work closely with Prospect Union and, with the help of both, have successfully resolved numerous cases. The significant increase in the number of sexist reports received by Women in Football is of concern, but sadly not a great surprise. “What is clear is that this is just the tip of the iceberg; for every offensive tweet or comment posted and reported to us, there are dozens that aren’t. And we know from our 2016 research, that women who experience sexism at work rarely report it – just one in 10 according to our landmark industry survey.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/29/ra-chief-executive-calls-for-action-on-diversity","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T18:31:00Z","webTitle":"R&A chief executive calls for more action to address lack of diversity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/ra-chief-executive-calls-for-action-on-diversity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/29/ra-chief-executive-calls-for-action-on-diversity","fields":{"headline":"R&A chief executive calls for more action to address lack of diversity","bodyText":"Golf requires a major facelift in order to attract more women and families and shift away from the stuffy, male‑dominated image it often conjures, according to the sport’s governing body. Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A chief executive, issued a call to arms as he launched the organisation’s first Women in Golf Charter, designed to increase the number of women and girls playing and working in the game. The Ladies European Tour, the European Golf Association, and the Professional Golfers’ Association are among the organisations to have already committed to the document, along with the governing bodies of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The charter’s main aim is to redress the gender imbalance in the sport. It was launched just weeks after a female golfer in Wales threatened legal action against her £860-a-year club because of a “men‑only” rule on Saturday mornings. Lowri Roberts, a civil servant, complained after women were banned from prime weekend slots at Cottrell Park Golf Resort at St Nicholas, near Cardiff. Slumbers said local clubs had an integral part to play in making the sport more welcoming to a diverse group of people. “I see that the future development of our sport depends upon achieving a change in the number of women working in all levels of golf and particularly the senior positions,” he said. “Clubs have a fundamental role to play in changing this culture. If we can change, there is a huge opportunity for golf, but we have to change and we have to change fast. “Creating a product that families together want to experience from clubs will be the catalyst to take golf forward for the next 50 years. If we don’t change, then we will suffer the consequences. We have to encourage everyone involved in golf to play their part in this change.” Golf has been plagued by rows about female membership and archaic views among some, even at the highest level. In 2016, Scottish club Muirfield voted against allowing women to join before the decision was reversed the following year in a second ballot after the R&amp;A opted to remove the club as a host venue for the Open."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/31/word-of-the-week-steven-poole-spygate","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T07:00:13Z","webTitle":"Spygate: why Donald Trump’s use of ‘gate’ is a scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/31/word-of-the-week-steven-poole-spygate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/31/word-of-the-week-steven-poole-spygate","fields":{"headline":"Spygate: why Donald Trump’s use of ‘gate’ is a scandal","bodyText":"When is a gate not a gate?

The suffix “-gate” to denote scandal derives from Watergate, which was not a scandal involving water but the name of the building complex where Nixon’s goons broke into the Democratic party offices in 1972. The first recorded derivative -gate was “Volgagate” in 1973, coined for a putative Russian scandal in National Lampoon magazine, and since then we have enjoyed Monicagate, Camillagate, nipplegate, plebgate (or gategate), gamergate and all the rest. Like “-mageddon” or “-pocalypse”, “-gate” is usually used with ironic hyperbole for relatively trivial things. Or, in this case, purely imaginary things.

Bond markets calmed down, weak banks got access to funding again and an economic recovery of sorts materialised. In terms of central bank rescue acts, it was a textbook operation. Unfortunately, there are no easy ECB fixes for the new Italian crisis. The ECB’s first problem is its own powers. Even if it were minded to try to reverse the dramatic sell-off in Italian bonds, the rules say it is only supposed to respond to emergency calls from countries that have agreed to budget conditions. With new elections now likely in Italy in the autumn, it’s hard to see how a deal could be done. Even if a technical fudge could be found, the second problem is that the eurozone’s big powers might prefer the ECB to do nothing. Günther Oettinger, the EU’s budget commissioner, seems to believe a bout of market turmoil “might become a signal to [Italian] voters after all to not vote for populists on the right and left”. In practice, the experience might provoke a bigger vote for anti-euro parties, but the strategy seems set. The third problem for the ECB will come if capital drains from Italian banks. In that case the ECB could in theory claim a clear need to intervene to prevent damage to eurozone banks outside Italy. But, again, there could be pressure to stay on the sidelines. Under the Target2 system, which is the way eurozone central banks keep account of liabilities to each other, Italy already owes £442bn. Any ECB-backed support for its banks would see that figure rise further, provoking fears over repayment. Note that Target2 imbalances are already a hot topic in Germany, where the Bundesbank is the single biggest creditor. “The weakening in chancellor Angela Merkel’s position, and the rise of the far-right AfD party, might prompt Germany to take a tougher stance than it did with the eurozone periphery in the past,” says thinktank Capital Economics. All those factors, one suspects, lay behind the warning from Ignazio Visco, governor of the Bank of Italy, that the country is “a few short steps away from the very serious risk of losing the irreplaceable asset of trust”. In his position, he’s paid to sound alarmed – but he is also basically correct. Dixons Carphone baffles its investors Incoming chief executives often assume they have a prerogative to rubbish their predecessors’ record and to talk up the size of the task ahead. Few, though, make such full use as Alex Baldock, fresh out of Shop Direct and eight weeks into the top job at Dixons Carphone. His criticisms, delivered alongside a thumping profits warning, were extraordinary. Dixons Carphone is “nowhere near” making the most of its strengths and “nobody is happy with our performance today”. While he has promoted “top talent” and cleared out “unnecessary layers and silos”, some £30m has to be spent immediately on improving the “colleague and customer proposition”, which turns out to mean basic stuff like getting the store staff to answer the phone. And, by the way, Honeybee, the now-sold software experiment, and a venture with Sprint in the US were unhelpful distractions. Shareholders will be baffled. A board chaired by Lord Livingston, who has been a director since 2015, never previously sounded worried about under-investment or flashy adventures. Indeed Baldock’s predecessor, Sebastian James, before he hopped off to Boots, reckoned rough trading conditions were mostly to blame when he produced his own profits warning last August. Now, about five minutes after James departed to cheers for his “outstanding contribution”, there is a sea of self-inflicted troubles. Livingston, assuming he shares Baldock’s diagnosis, owes investors an explanation. Profits this year will be £300m-ish, about £80m short of what the City expected and miles away from the £501m achieved a couple of years ago. Could such a sharp fall have been avoided if action had been taken earlier? That would seem to be what Baldock is suggesting. At least the new man thinks all the woes are “fixable”. Yet his grumble about the need for Carphone to find a new business model sounded familiar. In short, Carphone needs to renegotiate its contracts with network operators now that fewer consumers want two-year mobile handset deals. On that front, Baldock was only able to say the group is “making progress”. Perhaps best to tone down the fighting talk until you’ve got something to show for it. In the circumstances, the 21% fall in the share price looks about right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/08/the-unspeakable-truth-about-slavery-in-mauritania","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"The unspeakable truth about slavery in Mauritania","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/08/the-unspeakable-truth-about-slavery-in-mauritania","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/08/the-unspeakable-truth-about-slavery-in-mauritania","fields":{"headline":"The unspeakable truth about slavery in Mauritania","bodyText":"In 1981, Mauritania made slavery illegal, the last country in the world to do so. Nonetheless, tens of thousands of people – mostly from the minority Haratine or Afro-Mauritanian groups – still live as bonded labourers, domestic servants or child brides. Local rights groups estimate that up to 20% of the population is enslaved, with one in two Haratines forced to work on farms or in homes with no possibility of freedom, education or pay. Slavery has a long history in this north African desert nation. For centuries, Arabic-speaking Moors raided African villages, resulting in a rigid caste system that still exists to this day, with darker-skinned inhabitants beholden to their lighter-skinned “masters”. Slave status is passed down from mother to child, and anti-slavery activists are regularly tortured and detained. Yet the government routinely denies that slavery exists in Mauritania, instead praising itself for eradicating the practice. Members of Mauritania’s leading anti-slavery organisation, the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA), hope to oust the majority Arab-Berber government in national elections next year. The IRA leader, Biram Ould Abeid – a Haratine who was imprisoned for years before coming second in 2014’s national elections – has vowed to remove President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who came to power in a 2008 coup and has since dismantled the Senate in what critics see as a bid to broaden his powers. Fatimatou and her daughter Mbarka, above, were slaves to a family in the Aleg region, roughly 250km from the capital, Nouakchott. “They called me ‘Fatma the servant’: I looked after the cattle, prepared food, and fetched water from the well,” says Fatimatou. “I lost two babies to this family because they prevented me from taking care of my own children. I was forced to work when I had just given birth.” Fatimatou was freed with her children in the early 1990s by the organisation SOS Slaves. Today, she lives with her family in one of Nouakchott’s working-class neighbourhoods. Former slaves Habi and her brother Bilal, above left, stand in front of Bilal’s garage outside Nouakchott. The siblings were both slaves to a family east of the capital, but Bilal fled suddenly one day after his master beat him. After several attempts to rescue his sister, who was a victim of sexual abuse and forced labour, she was finally freed with the help of SOS Slaves in 2008. Today, the pair live in a poor neighbourhood on the periphery of Nouakchott. With the help of some activists, Bilal recently opened a small tyre-mounting garage. Mauritania is a bridge between the Arab Maghreb of north Africa and darker-skinned sub-Saharan Africa. The ruling Arab-Berbers have higher paid positions in jobs and government, while the darker-skinned Haratines and Afro-Mauritanians are under-represented in leadership positions and face many obstacles in society, from access to education to well-paid jobs. Haratines do many jobs that Arab-Berbers consider dirty or degrading, such as working in local markets. Sos Slaves provides workshops to help empower Haratine women, most of whom are unemployed, poor and have little or no education. Some workshops teach recently freed slaves about money – what it is and how it is used – while others teach Haratine women skills such as embroidery or sewing, which help them to earn money for the first time in their lives. Mabrouka, 20, was a child when she was taken from her mother, also a slave, to serve with a family in the south-western Rosso area. Around the age of 11, when she was cooking for her masters, she was badly burned on her left arm. She still suffers from the pain. Mabrouka was 14 when she was freed in 2011, but was never able to go to school. She got married at the age of 16 and is now the mother of Meriem, four, and two-month-old Khadi. A Tarhil neighborhood resident outside her house, where she was relocated by the state when her slum in Dar Naim was demolished to make way for the construction of a road. Married, with two children, she sells biscuits to passersby while her husband holds small jobs in the city. “If we had the budget, we would have rented a room in Nouakchott. Here, we don’t even have water – we have to pay for a cart to deliver water,” she says. Haratines work in certain professions that are designated for their caste alone, such as butchery and rubbish collection. Above, on the left, men at a slaughterhouse prepare cattle for sale in Nouakchott. The picture on the right shows Youssef, 18, who is in his third year of secondary school in Nouakchott. A few days a week he works as a rubbish collector to help support his family. Moctar was born into slavery in an Arab-Berber family, where he was forced to work alongside his mother and brother. In 2012, after several attempts, he managed to escape and met an activist from the anti-slavery movement. He tried to liberate his mother and brother, but they refused to go with him. His mother even criticised his escape and testified against him. “When I was younger, my mother told me every night that we must respect our masters, because their caste is higher than ours, and they are saints,” says Moctar. He started school at 13 and hopes to become a lawyer, in order to fight for the rights of the Haratines. Meryem (in blue) lives in Znabeh, a small village comprised of former slaves. In 2014, following the death of their father, the children of slavemaster Sheikh Mohammed freed four women and their children: Meryem, Aïcha, Beïga, and Merine. They all fled with their children and grandchildren and settled near a water source. They now survive off of their small holding and the little food it brings. Salma, above right, served for more than 50 years as a slave in a white Moorish family in northern Mauritania’s Chagar region. Her children were also born into servitude. In 2013, Salma and her daughter Yema were released by her two sons, Bilal and Salek (pictured above), who had escaped a few years earlier. But Yema twice ran back to her master’s family. Today, she is married and has two children. Salma, Yema and her brothers now live together in a slum in Dar Naim. Aichetou Mint M’barack was a slave by descent in the Rosso area. Like her sister, she was taken away from her mother and then given to a member of the master’s family to be a servant. She got married in the home of her masters and had eight children, two of whom were taken away from her to be slaves in other families. In 2010, Aichetou’s older sister was able to free her with the help of the IRA Movement, after she herself fled her masters when they poured hot embers over her baby, killing it. Aichetou and her eight children are now free and live together in Nouakchott. Jabada, below, is over 70. She fled her master after he tied both her hands to a tentpole, which cut off one finger entirely and deformed the others. She is now unable to use her hands. Taken in by another family who helped heal her wounds, Jabada stayed with them until her freedom in the 1980s. She now lives with her children and grandchildren in one of Nouakchott’s poor neighbourhoods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/29/rise-in-proportion-bame-suspects-met-police-gangs-matrix","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T17:17:25Z","webTitle":"Rise in proportion of BAME suspects on Met’s gangs matrix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/rise-in-proportion-bame-suspects-met-police-gangs-matrix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/rise-in-proportion-bame-suspects-met-police-gangs-matrix","fields":{"headline":"Rise in proportion of BAME suspects on Met’s gangs matrix","bodyText":"The proportion of suspects on the Metropolitan police’s gangs matrix from minority ethnic groups has increased to nearly nine in 10, according to the force’s own figures. The data revealed after a question by Sian Berry, the London assembly member for the Green party, showed that 89% of the 3,362 individuals on the Met’s gangs list as of May 2018 were from black or minority ethnic groups. In October 2016, 87% of suspects on the database were from ethnic minority groups. The increase has come as the numbers on the matrix overall have fallen – there are now about 450 fewer individuals on the database than there were in October 2017 – suggesting they have taken more white people off the list than people from other groups. This month a report by Amnesty International UK identified the matrix as part of a “racialised” war on gangs, triggered by the Conservative government after the riots in 2011, that stigmatised black youngsters and violated human rights. The findings showed that of those on the matrix, 78% were black and 9% from other ethnic minorities. This compared with Met figures stating that 27% of those behind violence in London were black. The gangs matrix is a database of suspected gang members, and those seen as being at risk of becoming embroiled in gang violence. Police say it helps to thwart violence, but Amnesty claimed the Met was stigmatising young black men for the type of music they listen to, their social media behaviour, and who they socialised with. “The police are supposed to have been reviewing the gangs matrix and yet the latest figures show that the disproportionality is getting worse, and that’s worrying,” Berry said. “We spoke to the police last week about this at the police and crime committee in the assembly, and the police keep saying to us that most knife violence is not gang related: a lot is just young people fighting and having knives and using those knives. “It’s essentially unhelpful when we are talking about restoring confidence in the police [and] young people’s willingness to engage with the police, and if they are being put on a database of suspects that’s not going to help.” Stafford Scott, advocacy officer at the civil rights charity The Monitoring Group, said he was not surprised by the increase. “It’s clear that the gangs matrix is a tool for racial profiling,” he said. “It’s not looking at serious youth violence, it’s not looking at the most dangerous or organised gangs, it’s just about criminalising and stereotyping various sections of the community. And the latest figures, plus the deaths of young kids out there, proves that it’s unfit for purpose.” The Met has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/29/roseanne-cancelled-what-happened-tweets-rise-fall-tv-biggest-show","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T22:02:46Z","webTitle":"The rise and fall of Roseanne: how TV's biggest show fell apart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/29/roseanne-cancelled-what-happened-tweets-rise-fall-tv-biggest-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/29/roseanne-cancelled-what-happened-tweets-rise-fall-tv-biggest-show","fields":{"headline":"The rise and fall of Roseanne: how TV's biggest show fell apart","bodyText":"ABC’s decision to cancel Roseanne – after its eponymous star compared Valerie Jarrett, a black former adviser to Barack Obama, to an ape – sent rumbles through the entertainment industry. Barr’s tweet, in which she also “joked” that Jarrett had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, caused a public outcry, resulting in swift condemnations of Barr from her own cast mates and, ultimately, the network’s unprecedented decision to pull the plug on its ratings juggernaut just one week after its season finale. In a statement made hours after Barr’s tweets, which quickly prompted calls for the network to discipline her, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey called Roseanne’s post “abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values”, announcing the sitcom would be cancelled. In a tweet, Disney CEO Bob Iger echoed Dungey’s statement and said: “There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.” Jarrett, who on Tuesday night will serendipitously appear in an MSNBC town hall called “Everyday Racism in America”, called Barr’s comments a “teaching moment”. The network’s cancellation marks something of a denouement to Barr’s rapid return to the public eye and subsequent fall from grace. It was only a few months ago that Roseanne, which went on a two-decade hiatus before ABC revived the series for a 10th season, earned Donald Trump’s seal of approval following its season premiere, which, with 18 million viewers, was television’s highest-rated comedy telecast in almost four years. Barr, a vocal supporter of Trump’s who in February told ABC “we’re lucky to have him as a president”, reportedly even received a congratulatory call from him after the season premiere. Aside from its colossal viewership, critical accolades followed the reboot, too. Roseanne was praised for having its finger on the political pulse and harnessing the appeal of the original series, which Barr herself once called “television’s first feminist and working-class sitcom”. Indeed, the show’s embrace by the political right reflected just how radically its star had changed her tune since the ninth season finale aired in 1997. “I wrote on the original Roseanne where we used to denounce nativism, racism &amp; homophobia,” Danny Zuker, the executive producer of ABC’s Modern Family, wrote on Twitter Tuesday. “Nauseating to see what she’s become.” In spite of the revival’s popularity, accusations of racism and insensitivity continued to trail Barr, whose on-screen alter ego Roseanne Connor plays a working-class Trump supporter (“He talked about jobs – he said he’d shake things up”) at odds with her liberal sister Jackie and struggling with an addiction to prescription drugs. In an episode that aired earlier this month, for instance, Roseanne suspects her Muslim neighbor is building a bomb, saying they’re probably from “Talibanjistan”. Predictably, the episode was roundly criticized as Islamophobic, a charge Barr responded to on her social media platform of choice. “I like to do TV episodes about REAL ISSUES &amp; REAL PEOPLE,” she wrote. “That’s what I do. Next season will be even more current events-I will challenge every sacred cow in USA.” There was also pushback to an apparent dig made by Roseanne’s character at two racially diverse ABC programs, black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat. In one episode Dan, Roseanne’s on-screen husband, says that the couple slept through “all the shows about black and Asian families,” to which Roseanne sarcastically replies, “They’re just like us!” Although the show rarely invoked Trump after its premiere, making only cursory references to contemporary hot-button topics like gender fluidity and national anthem protests, its erstwhile star has a pattern of trafficking in the same kinds of culture wars and conspiracies as the president. Barr’s tweet about Jarrett was not even the first time she’d compared a black female Obama official to an ape: in a since-deleted tweet from 2013, she called former national security adviser Susan Rice a “man with big swinging ape balls”. Barr’s also tweeted about “Pizzagate” and the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich; falsely claimed Chelsea Clinton was married to a nephew of George Soros; and called Hillary Clinton an “anti-Semite” and Huma Abedin a “filthy nazi whore”. In March, she said Trump “has freed so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world”, parroting a rightwing conspiracy about pedophilic, Hollywood-controlled sex rings. And when Barr ran for president as a representative of the Peace and Freedom party, she wrote a letter to Congress citing the Boston Marathon bombing as an example of the Obama administration “contriving false flag terror attacks to remove the second amendment”. Barr’s history of rogue, racist or untrue statements meant that ABC was taking a risk developing a new season of Roseanne, a risk that, until Tuesday, had indisputably borne fruit. But while the sitcom was lauded for tapping into a demographic many considered underserved, making Barr a rightwing icon, there remained a drumbeat of trepidation about her incendiary social media presence. When asked last August about the possibility that Barr’s tweets would make the show “untenable”, ABC’s president Channing Dungey said: “I try to just worry about the things that I can control.” And in an interview with the cast of Roseanne, co-showrunner Whitney Cummings said she “became the PC police” while working on the show: “I was the ‘you can’t say that anymore’ and ‘now this is the word we use’ one,” she told the Hollywood Reporter. Before ABC’s decision to cancel Roseanne, which had already been picked up for an 11th season, some of Barr’s colleagues expressed their objection to her posts on Twitter. Wanda Sykes, a consulting producer on the series, announced she’d be leaving the show, and Sara Gilbert, who plays Roseanne’s daughter Darlene, tweeted that “Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show.” Emma Kenney, who plays Darlene’s daughter Harris, also chimed in: “I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed,” she wrote. “The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable.” Other actors, like Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle and Debra Messing, denounced Barr’s comments and called for her to be fired. But the reaction to Barr’s racism was not entirely reproachful. Alex Jones, the far-right radio host, expressed his support for Barr, writing “it’s time for you to strike back against these THOUGHT POLICE and really shake them up!” while English media personality Katie Hopkins added: “Never apologise @therealroseanne It only encourages the bastards.” Once the dust settles on the partisan combat provoked by ABC’s decision, though, Roseanne’s cancellation marks another example of a prominent celebrity falling on their own sword while many wait for those higher up in the government to be held to a similar standard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/may/29/starbucks-coffee-shops-racial-bias-training","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T19:06:54Z","webTitle":"Starbucks closes more than 8,000 US cafes for racial bias training","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/starbucks-coffee-shops-racial-bias-training","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/29/starbucks-coffee-shops-racial-bias-training","fields":{"headline":"Starbucks closes more than 8,000 US cafes for racial bias training","bodyText":"More than 8,000 Starbucks coffee shops in the US closed their doors for racial bias training on Tuesday, in what the company said “isn’t a solution, it’s a first step” as it sought to rebuild its damaged reputation. Starbucks announced the training after two black men were arrested in one of the company’s Philadelphia cafes in April. Staff had called the police, accusing the men of trespassing, despite them explaining they were in the store for a business meeting. Coffee shops across the country shut down in the early afternoon, as Starbucks walked 175,000 employees through a carefully designed training program on “understanding racial bias and the history of public accommodations in the United States”. On Tuesday morning, one of several Starbucks stores near Times Square in the heart of New York City had a poster in the window informing customers that they would be closing early, “so our team can reconnect with our mission and share ideas about how to make Starbucks even more welcoming”. At 11am – three hours before the store closed – 14 employees were already undergoing the four-hour training, in a reserved area of the bustling coffee shop. Each employee had been given a Starbucks branded booklet titled “My notebook”, and were watching videos on tablets. One page of the notebooks had the heading “What makes me, me and you, you?” Another asked employees to think about where they “feel a sense of belonging”. After watching videos, the employees held discussions in small groups. A video describing the training, released by Starbucks before Tuesday, showed a clip of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson being arrested. “That is not who we aspire to be,” a voiceover says as the footage is played. The video showed a booklet that each Starbucks store will work through with its employees. Workers will watch the documentary You’re Welcome, filmmaker Stanley Nelson’s examination of black people’s experience in public spaces, Starbucks said, before being encouraged to take part in conversations about “understanding racial bias and the history of public accommodations in the United States”. The company said its workers will be asked to consider the impact of racial discrimination on public spaces “from the civil rights movement all the way to today”. Starbucks executive vice-president for US retail, Rossann Williams, said that the training “isn’t a solution, it’s a first step”. Williams said the full curriculum will be made available to the public “after May 29”, although Starbucks did not say exactly when or where it will be published. A range of civil rights activists and experts contributed to Starbucks’ training. Heather McGhee, president of Demos, an equal rights thinktank, contributed, as did the former US attorney general Eric Holder and representatives of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education fund. In April McGhee told the Guardian that Tuesday’s training will serve “really as an introduction” to racial bias. She said she and others were keen that in addition to the training, Starbucks also examine the rules and guidelines that its employees are given. “It is very important that we take this opportunity to go as deep as we possibly can,” McGhee said. “To review the policies and procedures, to have a longer-term engagement with Starbucks management about these issues on a deeper level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/30/texas-gun-control-reform-activists-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T10:00:48Z","webTitle":"'Inaction is not an option': anti-gun activists fight the odds in gun-loving Texas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/30/texas-gun-control-reform-activists-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/30/texas-gun-control-reform-activists-battle","fields":{"headline":"'Inaction is not an option': anti-gun activists fight the odds in gun-loving Texas","bodyText":"Marcel McClinton was napping in his hotel room the Sunday after a shattering 48 hours following the latest US school shooting, when a text message flashed on his phone. It read: “I’m a student at Santa Fe high school. Though everything is overwhelming right now, myself and a few of my friends would like to help in the movement for change soon.” It was from Megan McGuire, a junior at the Texas school where eight students and two teachers were murdered, police said, by a 17-year-old gunman who burst into a first-period art class with a revolver and a shotgun. McClinton is an organizer with the Houston branch of March for Our Lives, the student-led gun reform group created after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February. The 16-year-old, along with other activists, rushed to Santa Fe to help anyone who wanted it. He was unsure how many would take him up on the offer. What was startling about Parkland was not only the strength and eloquence of the students turned nationally known activists, but also the speed with which a movement was born and built, more or less overnight. But Santa Fe is small-town, deep-red, gun-loving Texas. It is less than an hour’s drive from the heart of Houston yet politically and culturally very different from the big city whose police chief, Art Acevedo, clashed on social media with the National Rifle Association (NRA) after a Facebook post in which he rebuked politicians who “called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing”. Republican politicians have floated a variety of ideas that call for anything but fewer guns. Arm teachers. More armed guards. Add metal detectors. Reduce entrances and exits. But what do Santa Fe students want? McClinton had exchanged a couple of brief messages with McGuire over Twitter. One of the Parkland pupils had passed on his number, but he was pleasantly surprised when four or five Santa Fe students got in touch urgently. They met just one week after the shooting. On a day when funerals were held for three victims, McGuire and three other Santa Fe students spoke in front of two dozen journalists in a suburban Houston conference centre. “Inaction is not an option. We must do something and we must get it right,” McGuire said. “I want to thank everyone for all their thoughts and prayers,” she said, adding a warning for elected officials: “My thought is that if you do not do something you don’t have a prayer of being elected. My generation will see to that.” Still, there was delicacy amid the determination. The venue was 50 miles from Santa Fe and the students declined to discuss how others in the town feel about their nascent activism and the issue of gun control. Also at the podium was a senior, Bree Butler, who drove to Austin earlier in the week and met with staffers of Greg Abbott, the Republican governor, who was holding gun policy discussions. On Wednesday, Abbott announced a package of proposals to make schools safer in the wake of the shooting but, as expected, they were noticeably light on new gun control measures. The focus of his recommendations was on more security guards and better mental health screening. Butler was one of about 15,000 people who had attended a March for Our Lives demonstration in Houston two months ago. “I followed the Parkland kids closely. Their action and their voices are so inspiring,” she said. On Friday the students advocated for better background checks, more mental health help, requirements that firearms be locked away. Even these modest proposals face an uncertain embrace in Texas, which is not a swing state like Florida where politicians feel more vulnerable to changing political winds. Nor do its part-time lawmakers meet again until January. Texas activists are cautious. “To us it isn’t a partisan issue, it’s an issue of safety,” said Alyssa DuPree, a teacher in Houston who started a March for Our Lives Facebook event page. “I was in sixth grade when Columbine happened [in Colorado in 1999] and it just really scarred me, my whole childhood. I always had an exit plan for every class I was in,” she said. McClinton was in church on Memorial Day weekend two years ago when his quiet, affluent, family-friendly suburban neighbourhood became a scene resembling a war zone. Metres away, a mentally-ill military veteran with a pistol and an AR-15 rifle attacked passersby at random. Over nearly an hour he fired 212 rounds, killing one person and injuring six others, including police officers and an armed civilian. The killer shot a police helicopter, peppered a patrol car and caused a gas station forecourt to burst into flames before he was shot dead by a Swat team sniper. As if to underline the extent of America’s gun violence problem, this astonishing incident only briefly made national news. But it strongly affected McClinton, then 14. “To cope with not sleeping and having a headache all the time I listened to airplane sounds on Spotify. It’s just that hum, a playlist of the airplane hum, and it would calm me down. If I listened to it and stared at the ceiling my headache would go away,” he said. His group has met resistance. “There’s been pushback. We’ve been called Nazis, we’ve been called anti-American, and then they shut up really quickly when you tell them your dad owns five guns, was in the army, locks his guns up, got them the right way, is trained in how to use them,” he said. What works in Texas, he explained, is “sitting down and talking to these people. It’s not to take away your shotgun, it’s not to take away your handgun that you keep in your house to protect you from a burglar.” Longtime Houston gun safety activist Kristina Woods, whose teenage brother killed himself with an illegally-purchased gun, said she felt encouraged by the new youth movement. “I feel like we’re in a race. Tomorrow there could be another shooting and I’d better run as fast as I can, every minute, to every person who’ll listen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/29/john-gozzard-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T16:49:22Z","webTitle":"John Gozzard obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/29/john-gozzard-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/29/john-gozzard-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Gozzard obituary","bodyText":"My friend John Gozzard, who has died aged 85, was an inventor and engineer whose most notable achievement was the creation of a zeppelin-shaped windshield for microphones, much seen on television and film sets, which stops wind and other extraneous noises interfering with sound recordings. John’s invention was not only far better than previous attempts at minimising unwanted noise, but was also lighter and more durable than the alternatives. Having established its usefulness he set up a company, Rycote, to manufacture the windshield, and the firm continues to this day from its base in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Throughout his time at Rycote John continued to apply his skills to produce items that perfected audio capture, and many of his designs are used worldwide. John was born in West Bromwich, in the West Midlands. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father, Herbert, remarried; John was close to his stepmother, Hilda, and remained so after his father’s death. He began his career as a sound recordist at the BBC, then moved to Southern Television and finally to ATV. It was while working in television that he became frustrated with the heavy and cumbersome equipment that he was required to use, especially on outside broadcasts, and so took to designing various solutions, including his microphone windshield. He set up Rycote in 1969 and ran the company full time until he sold the business when he retired in 1995. John’s restless curiosity and energy ensured that he was active in retirement, and even into his 80s he carried out all the DIY jobs at his house near Painswick, Gloucestershire. He was always exploring new devices that came his way, relishing ways to mend, improve and perfect various bits of machinery. John loved his corner of the Cotswolds, as well as the sea, Bach, car boot sales and antique locks. He lived simply, showing little care for his own comfort but great concern for the wellbeing of others. He was a generous donor to charities, brushing aside the thanks and recognition with a bluff: “Well, it’s what people with money ought to do.” For many years John knew that he wanted to be able to choose when to die, and so when he deemed that the time was right, he took his own life. His marriage to Louise Sargent in 1962 ended in divorce in 1971."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/30/nba-finals-predictions-who-will-win-and-is-the-cavaliers-warriors-era-over","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T08:30:46Z","webTitle":"NBA finals predictions: who will win ... and is the Cavaliers-Warriors era over?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/30/nba-finals-predictions-who-will-win-and-is-the-cavaliers-warriors-era-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/30/nba-finals-predictions-who-will-win-and-is-the-cavaliers-warriors-era-over","fields":{"headline":"NBA finals predictions: who will win ... and is the Cavaliers-Warriors era over?","bodyText":"This year’s winner will be ... Golden State Warriors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, 4-2. HF Warriors beat the Cavaliers, 4-1. LC Warriors beat the Cavaliers, 4-1. AR Warriors beat Cavaliers 4-1. AT What the Cavaliers need to do to win ... LeBron James. Should I be more specific? In order for the Cavaliers to win, LeBron, at age 33, needs to play the best series of his incredible career. Would you put it past him after seeing what he’s done this year with his thrown together supporting cast? HF This will have to be a team effort. Golden State are too deep, with too many elite scorers for the Cavs to rely solely on LeBron. If the Warriors have a weakness they can be beaten on the boards which means Tristan Thompson, Jeff Green and Kevin Love (if healthy) need to rebound. Oh, and JR Smith needs to be on night after night. LC Clone LeBron – but since they can’t, just try to support him by draining threes (Kyle Korver), creating plays (Kevin Love), and defending like they actually want to win (I’m looking at you, Tristan Thompson). AR It’s redundant to say they need LeBron to have the series of his life; what’s more important is that the second tier – Love and Smith – and “the rest” need to have the series of their lives as well. That means taking more of the burden in offense off LeBron, making more three-pointers, and giving LeBron space to husband his energies more evenly between defense and offense. AT What the Warriors need to do to win ... The Warriors have already faced their toughest opponent in the Houston Rockets. So stay healthy? Keep Draymond Green from getting suspended? The Warriors probably should stop falling behind in the first-half of games, but as long as they have the Deadly Third Quarter in their arsenal, that’s not too much of a worry. HF As long as Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are shooting the way they did at the end of Games 6 and 7 of the Western Conference finals there is little even LeBron can do to stop the Warriors. The Golden State players learned a valuable lesson in resilience in surviving the Rockets. If the Warriors stay composed through Cleveland’s big runs, their depth and stars will save them late. LC Play by their slogan: Strength in Numbers. The Warriors struggled when Durant played iso ball and had too many turnovers when trying to rush the lane. If they do what they do best – move quickly, pass often, and shoot well – they’ll sweep the Cavs. AR Not succumb to their two biggest weaknesses: boredom and smugness. Superiority has its dangers: the Warriors were guilty of phoning it in at various points throughout the regular season, and even against the Rockets they drifted at times. They’ll also need to tighten their defense to contain LeBron, especially given the question mark over Andre Iguodala’s fitness. AT Your series MVP will be … Kevin Durant, and everyone will be annoyed. He’ll lead the Warriors in all major statistical categories but, for whatever reason, he’ll fail to have any truly memorable games. When Durant’s MVP is announced people will still be upset – even some Warriors fans who still feel irritated that this is no longer solely Curry’s team. HF Believe it or not, Curry has never been a finals MVP. In 2015 the winner was sixth man Andre Iguodala. Durant won the award last year. Curry, however, remains the Warriors’ heart, the one who facilitates their selfless culture. He is healthy again and his shooting has become sharper as the postseason has gone on. His ball-handling and three-point shooting should be the difference in this series. LC LeBron James, even if (OK, when) the Cavs lose. He’s having the season of his life and made it to the finals for the eighth (!) consecutive season despite the odds and team turnover. I expect him to average a triple double and win MVP, even if he won’t be taking home the Larry O’Brien trophy. AR Kevin Durant. His regular season was a little patchy – injuries played a part – but as the playoffs have progressed the Warriors’ spaghetti-limbed maestro has grown steadily more influential. His second-half takeover in Game 7 against the Rockets, in which he ghosted across the perimeter and landed successive long-range threes with an ease so elemental it almost seemed liquid, was a particular delight. AT Unheralded player to watch ... Former Indiana Pacers semi-star George Hill, who was the Cavaliers second-best player in their series against the Celtics. Also, he had the best line of the Eastern Conference finals when he confessed that the secret behind his home court success was … Chipotle tacos. HF How about two? Golden State’s Nick Young and Cleveland’s Jeff Green. Both have made their names elsewhere: Young as “Swaggy P”, the always-shooting, shooting guard from the Wizards and Lakers, and Green as the journeyman forward who has overcome heart issues. A more subdued Young gave the Warriors valuable minutes in the Houston series and Green was a huge inside presence for the Cavs in the final two games against Boston. LC Jordan Bell. The Warriors rookie who stepped up in the Rockets series could make the difference on defense. Though his stats weren’t too impressive, his team-mates were “thrilled” with how he guarded James Harden, and he was crucial to clearing the way for Curry’s clutch shots. AR Bell. In the absence of Iguodala, the young forward did an outstanding job marking James Harden in Games 6 and 7 of the Western Conference finals, disrupting the Rockets’ screen-and-roll and throwing their star off his rhythm. With Iguodala’s fitness in question, can Bell be trusted to take on LeBron? Steve Kerr hopes so. AT Is yet another Cavaliers-Warriors finals bad for the NBA? This match-up was so likely that we were discussing it even before the conference finals began. Had the conference finals been blowout wins for the two teams, I would have said it was bad for the league: it would have felt like the entire season was a formality. Now? Now we get to see the best player in the game against the best team. Are there diminishing returns here? Probably. Is it still a marquee matchup? Absolutely. HF It shouldn’t be, but the NBA has never had four straight finals with the same teams. Many fans want to see someone other than Golden State and Cleveland in this series. At least those who are unhappy can take solace: this is probably the last Golden State-Cleveland finals for quite some time. LC Bad? No. Boring? Absolutely. AR Not at all: the NBA is built on great rivalries. Even imbalanced there’s something beautiful about this one, with the sport’s first authentic superman (a title LeBron clearly deserves before Michael Jordan, whatever your position on The Most Boring Debate Known To Humanity) called on to perform herculean feats to repel the best team of its generation. It never gets old watching LeBron expand the boundaries of his greatness; and it helps that of all the dynastic teams in American pro sports today, the Warriors are probably the most likable. AT Next year’s finals will be between … Where will LeBron be? Let’s say he heads to the Western Conference. If that happens, it frees up the East for the Celtics. In the West, the Warriors finally stop LeBron’s run of consecutive finals by beating him earlier in the playoffs. The Warriors then destroy the Celtics in the finals. HF Golden State and Boston. Much depends on what LeBron decides to do. If he chooses to join the brilliant young core of the 76ers there’s an excellent chance Philadelphia will be in the finals. Otherwise, the East probably belongs to Boston. And regardless of who LeBron joins in the West, the Warriors should have at least one more run left in them. LC Anyone else. Please. Nobody needs Round 5 of this. AR Golden State and Philadelphia. It’s tough to imagine the Warriors juggernaut slowing down next season, and as for the Sixers ... the Simmons-Embiid axis should be the backbone of the league’s next great team, and the offseason will give them time to find what they need: a big-name free agent (hello, Paul George) and Ben Simmons’s jump shot. It’s good to have dreams in life. AT One bold prediction ... Well, we’ve already had the Jeff Green podium game in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals, so why not the Kendrick Perkins Podium Game? After all, the two were famously traded for each other back in 2011, so it would be nice if Perkins, who was retired back in February, had at least one more moment to shine in the NBA. Or at least score two more points. HF The TV ratings will be down. This should be a dream match-up for the networks. But there will be a fatigue of seeing the Warriors and Cavs for the fourth straight time. By now all the great storylines have played out: Golden State’s first championship in three decades, Cleveland’s first sports title in half a century, the Warriors building a superteam and taking the championship back. This year feels a little empty. The numbers may well show this. LC This will be the last Cavs-Warriors finals of this era. The East is getting better and the Cavs can’t attract talent that fills the gaps while LeBron is resting or not handling the ball. The Warriors will likely be back, but this could be the last run for this Cleveland team – especially if LeBron leaves. AR Wanda Durant will leave her son’s facial hair undisturbed even as he takes home the crown as finals MVP.

From Darth Vader to The Lion King’s imaginatively named Scar, for as long as films have existed, film-makers have conflated disfigurement with mental instability or malevolence. The trope is still going strong in Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars Story – physical otherness equals evil. It goes back a long way: in 1926, Nosferatu gave Count Orlok overgrown teeth and a huge nose, while Boris Karloff is the scarred Monster in 1931’s Frankenstein. Nowhere is the trend more obvious, however, than in the baddies of the Bond films, where five of 007’s major adversaries – Ernst Blofeld, Renard, Emilio Largo, Le Chiffre and Raoul Silva – as well as numerous henchmen – are notably scarred or disfigured. In the Star Wars franchise, a high proportion of the bad guys have scars or other disfigurements: Darth Vader, Darth Sidious, Supreme Leader Snoke, Cornelius Evazan, Kylo Ren, and now, courtesy of Solo: A Star Wars Story, Dryden Vos. Last year, Wonder Woman featured a female villain in Isabel Maru, notable for her facial disfigurement hidden with a ceramic mask, while Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War had scarred villains in Ulysses Klaue and Thanos. But what of heroes with facial differences? “There are limited ones,” says Phyllida Smith, a representative of the charity Changing Faces. “Wonder is definitely positive and pretty accurate given it covers the issues faced by a young boy with a craniofacial condition, although it’s contentious that they decided to cast a boy without the condition and instead used prosthetics. In terms of scars, we tend to only really be able to refer to Harry Potter as a positive portrayal.” Harry Potter’s scar is, of course, world famous – but having gained it at the hands of his mortal enemy, it doesn’t quite reflect the reality for many people living with facial differences. One of the most famous examples of differences between the real world and Hollywood is that of Joseph Merrick, or The Elephant Man, whose life was turned into a 1980 drama directed by David Lynch. Although John Hurt gave an excellent (and Oscar-nominated) performance, the film has been criticised by historians, who noted that the film portrayed Merrick as a victim of exploitation and a generally tragic figure, when in reality, he had been quite the canny businessman, who chose to exhibit himself. The haste to position those with facial differences as either villains or victims misses out on so much middle ground. What’s significant about the likes of Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars Story is that these films are aimed primarily at a family audience – younger viewers are still being taught by cinema to distinguish good from evil based on physical appearance, sensitising viewers to see evil where none exists. This trend is not limited to live action cinema either – a new study published in the British Journal of Dermatology has found that within the top 50 grossing animated films below a 12A rating, 76.5% of villainous characters had skin conditions of some kind, including scarring, blemishes and wrinkles, whereas only 25.9% of heroes did. Some 50% of the films in the study were produced after 2010, suggesting the trend towards visual codification in this manner is still prevalent. “The animated films we watch as children tend to stick with us, with many of us being able to fondly recall our favourites with ease,” says Matthew Gass of the British Association of Dermatologists. “We watch them in formative years when we are learning about good and evil, and whether they mean to or not, it’s likely that they impact our biases and associations.” Becky Hewitt, chief executive of Changing Faces, agrees. “The film industry has such power to influence the public with representations of diversity, and yet in films we still see scars and visible differences being used as a shorthand for villainy or vulnerability. It’s particularly worrying to see that young people don’t tend to make this association, until they are exposed to films that influence their attitudes towards disfigurement in a profoundly negative way.” The fact that younger audiences do not make the same associations between facial difference and negative traits is significant – this prejudice is learned, not inherited. Agnes, who has lived with facial scarring for almost all her life, is acutely aware of the difference between on-screen representation and real life experience. “Not only are heroes rarely shown with anything but dashing good looks but people with scars are naturally the villain in most films,” she says. “Quite interestingly it’s quite the opposite in real life, or at least it has been for me; I have always been praised by people for being strong and positive person.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/30/facial-matching-system-is-racist-human-rights-law-centre-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T20:12:22Z","webTitle":"Facial matching system risks racial bias, Human Rights Law Centre warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/30/facial-matching-system-is-racist-human-rights-law-centre-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/30/facial-matching-system-is-racist-human-rights-law-centre-warns","fields":{"headline":"Facial matching system risks racial bias, Human Rights Law Centre warns","bodyText":"Facial matching technology proposed by the government risks racial bias and would have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of assembly without further safeguards, the Human Rights Law Centre has said. The warning is contained in a submission to a parliamentary committee inquiry examining the Coalition’s proposal for the home affairs department to collect, use and disclose facial identification information. The facial matching system was agreed to in principle by states in October, but has since led to overreach warnings from Victoria and the Law Council of Australia. Concerned parties have warned the Coalition’s identity matching services bill allows access to facial verification data by the private sector and local governments, and that it could be used to prosecute low-level crimes. In a submission to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, lodged on Tuesday, the Human Rights Law Centre warned the bill was “manifestly and dangerously insufficient” and the system was “high risk” because the bill failed to adequately identify or regulate the uses of facial matching technology. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The centre submitted that both false positive and false negative results for facial recognition “are likely to arise disproportionately in relation to people who belong to ethnic minorities in Australia”. It cited studies that found facial recognition had “a bias towards the dominant ethnic group in the area in which it is developed”. The HRLC noted the NEC Neoface technology, used by federal agencies and several Australian states, had been validated as the best in the industry by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. But the centre warned the technology “has not been tested for accuracy based on demographics”, and therefore overall accuracy rates may obscure disproportionately high rates of misidentification of ethnic minorities. The centre warned that false positives could subject suspects to investigation, surveillance and denial of employment, and misidentification would erode trust in law enforcement and security agencies. It recommended annual accuracy testing, including demographic tests. The use of facial recognition technologies also posed “a significant threat to freedoms of expression, association and assembly”, the submission said. It said facial recognition “risks transforming the public space into a sphere where each person can be monitored and identified”, which is “particularly concerning in the context of civic gatherings, demonstrations and protests”. The HRLC said the use of facial recognition could discourage people from exercising their right to assembly, because even citizens who had done nothing wrong might not want police to know they had attended politically sensitive gatherings such as protests against police violence or Aboriginal deaths in custody. It said “politically motivated surveillance” might not be a “likely near-term consequence” of the bill, but it “must be guarded against in the design of this system”. It said the bill should not pass without safeguards to protect freedom of expression. Earlier this month the Victorian government threatened to pull out of the facial matching system, arguing it had agreed the private sector should not be given access to facial verification systems, but the bill did not contain that restriction. The Law Council of Australia has warned that facial recognition could lead to a full “social credit” system of government surveillance, and called for safeguards to prevent “illegitimate and disproportionate uses” of the technology. At a hearing on 3 May the home affairs department fought against proposed restrictions on the system, rejecting calls for warrants and a threshold for serious offences that justify use of the technology. Maria Fernandez, the department’s deputy secretary of intelligence and capability, said facial recognition would be for the use of law enforcement agencies “whose sole purpose is to protect and keep citizens safe”. In its own written submission, the department has said the systems could be used for “improving road safety through the detection and prosecution of traffic offences”. The HRLC submitted that dragnet facial recognition should only be used for investigation of “serious criminal offences”. Any real-time surveillance capability should be set out in the primary legislation to allow for a “full assessment of whether its use is justified and safeguards are sufficient”. The home affairs department has submitted that privacy laws and existing restrictions on agencies’ information sharing would continue to apply."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/28/peter-kays-car-share-reaches-end-of-the-road","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T13:14:17Z","webTitle":"Peter Kay's Car Share reaches end of the road","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/28/peter-kays-car-share-reaches-end-of-the-road","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/28/peter-kays-car-share-reaches-end-of-the-road","fields":{"headline":"Peter Kay's Car Share reaches end of the road","bodyText":"Three years and 12 TV half-hours ago, supermarket assistant manager John Redmond (Peter Kay) first gave sales rep colleague Kayleigh Kitson (Sian Gibson) a lift to work as part of their company’s carshare scheme. On Monday at 10.29pm, their flirtatious friendship, as stop-start as the Lancashire traffic they negotiate in morning and evening rush hours, was finally resolved in what the BBC1 continuity announcer billled as the “final ever episode” of Peter Kay’s Car Share. Kay, a proper scholar of TV comedy, knows that the one of the biggest decisions in a sitcom is how far the show departs from the central situation. There’s a tension for viewers in threat that the successful set-up will be jettisoned. With typical sophistication, Kay and co-star Gibson (who have written the series with Paul Coleman and Tim Reid) played with various deviations from the series’ dominating shot of the two retail employees seat-belted in the front of John’s red Fiat 500L, with its WR62 XDF plate. For the first 10 minutes, the passenger seat beside John was empty, a consequence of the row between the couple at the end of the second series, screened in May 2017. Kayleigh was now commuting solo by bus and train. The show kept teasing about whether it would deliver the generally desired romantic clincher that fans have been demanding (100,000 signed a petition) after an apparent Richard Curtis-like ending to season two, with John finally declaring his passion for Kayleigh in a traffic jam, turned out to have been one of the series’ periodic fantasy sequences. Another Curtisian touch – a love song (“Come back, my car share buddy!”) recorded by John and delivered at dawn on a Walkman to Kayleigh’s house, got them back in tandem in the Fiat a third of the way in. John’s rationale for giving things a go with Kayleigh was, fittingly, that “you make me laugh.” But rows and then the road accident of which the storyline has always carried the possibility tantalised with the possibility of another unhappy ending, until, in a satisfying twist on the show’s central visual image, the lovers had to have their first official cuddle on a bus. Making viewers wait and sweat for the ending they desired confirmed the suspicion that Kay, like his character, resists the drive towards sentimentality that the audience desires. The first half of the two-part finale, an unscripted and non-sequential special shown on 7 May, had exposed a comedy that is generally gentle (except for occasional swearing that gives the DVD releases a 15 certificate) to significant controversy for the first time. Some viewers objected to a conversation in which John and Kayleigh reacted satirically to the playing of a request for a transgender woman on Forever FM. No such Twitter-storm threatened the final episode, but there was evidence of a wish to keep some edge. The signature punctuating cutaways of north-west urban life and the witlessly optimistic drivel on the car radio of the drivetime presenters on the fictional Forever FM were more consistently filthy than ever before, as if to add some salt to the sugar of the conclusion. Glimpsed from the vehicle were signs warning against “dogging” and an advertising hoarding on which the line “don’t drive like a” was followed by a picture of a cockerel. The radio ads included come-ons for a drink called “love juice” and a “name the year” quiz had a saucy gag about Monica Lewinsky. There was also a hint of in-jokes. John had two speeches about his desire for “privacy”, a right that Kay, who controls media access more than most celebrities, fiercely protects for himself. And a final sub-plot, in which the couple had both been invited to the December 28 wedding of workmates Donna and Rick, seemed designed to lay down the tantalising basis for a Christmas special at some point in the future. A significant television event in any case, the final episode has also taken on an exaggerated significance in Kay’s career. This was a rare example of a TV departure also being a comeback, as this is the first Kay work to be seen since he cancelled for what have been described only as “unforeseen family reasons” a fourteen-month UK stand-up comedy tour that was due to begin last month. If the original plans had stood, the early gigs would have been a warm-up for the last look at Car Share; now the latter was a compensation for the loss of seeing the former. With Kay apparently on sabbatical at the moment, it’s impossible to know what he might do next. But Car Share will stand as one of the highest achievements of 21st century TV comedy, containing a combination of warmth and cleverness, social observation and romance, originality and nods to TV comedy history that only Kay could achieve. This article was amended on 29 May 2018. The original described a character referred to in the show as a transgender man. This should have said transgender woman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/29/not-for-profit-group-to-manage-85000-hectares-of-murray-darling-floodplain","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:15:13Z","webTitle":"Not-for-profit group to manage 85,000 hectares of Murray-Darling floodplain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/not-for-profit-group-to-manage-85000-hectares-of-murray-darling-floodplain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/not-for-profit-group-to-manage-85000-hectares-of-murray-darling-floodplain","fields":{"headline":"Not-for-profit group to manage 85,000 hectares of Murray-Darling floodplain","bodyText":"A consortium led by not-for-profit group the Nature Conservancy has been chosen to take over the future stewardship of Nimmie-Caira – 85,000 hectares of internationally significant Murrumbidgee floodplain in southern New South Wales.

The choice of the Nature Conservancy, means that priority will be given to managing the high-value wetlands on the property near Balranald, and giving access to the local Nari Nari people. The NSW minister for industry and water, Niall Blair, confirmed the tender outcome on Tuesday. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon In 2013 about 19 properties and their water rights were bought for $180m by the commonwealth under the Murray-Darling basin plan in order to return water for environmental flows to the river system.

This took the pressure off buybacks from farmers in the Murrumbidgee region. The land was transferred to the NSW government, which held a tender to determine who should manage the land. The process of picking a group to manage the vast property has been slow, raising doubts about the project and whether it would deliver the vaunted environmental benefits.

Responding to a landmark report by the Productivity Commission, released on Tuesday, O’Dwyer said she was “very encouraged” by a proposal to overhaul the superannuation system by creating a new body to recommend 10 high-performing funds to workers but stopped short of promising to implement this central recommendation. The deputy chair of the commission, Karen Chester, said the odds were stacked against super fund members due to “unintended multiple accounts and persistent underperformance” from some funds. “The impact of that is highly regressive, it causes a great harm to young people, workers on low incomes and workers in and out of work,” she told ABC AM. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning The Productivity Commission found that more than a quarter of the 74 funds offering MySuper product failed to meet benchmark performance returns. If workers in those funds had moved to the median of the top-10 performing products “they would collectively have gained an additional $1.3bn a year”, it said. “If a new job entrant ended up in an underperforming super fund they would be short-changed $375,000 when they come to retire,” Chester said. Employees do have the ability to choose their fund but, in practice, many are allocated an industry superannuation fund by their enterprise agreement or are allocated a default fund, chosen by the Fair Work Commission, through an industrial award. The Productivity Commission proposed that employees submitting a tax file number should be able to choose from a list of up to 10 of the best funds, to be decided by an independent panel every four years. The chief executive of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Martin Fahy, warned that this approach would wipe out a large number of medium-sized funds over time and harm competition. “We need to be careful there are not unintended consequences from a government-appointed body selecting 10 funds,” he told ABC News Breakfast. Asked whether this new system undermined consumer choice, Chester suggested it was necessary to combat the proliferation of unintended multiple accounts – which currently number 10m – resulting in unwanted fees and insurance contributions costing workers $2.6bn a year. O’Dwyer told Radio National on Monday that the report had “blown the whistle for millions of Australians”, revealing that superannuation funds “have not always been acting in the best interests of their members”. O’Dwyer said that about one-third of accounts were “unintended multiple accounts” because “employers have forced them into a particular fund of their choice or unions have through enterprise agreements”. “We don’t think that’s right and we know it needs to be fixed.” O’Dwyer called on Labor to back government legislation to prevent enterprise agreements nominating workers’ super fund. She said the Productivity Commission had proposed “a really clever solution” by recommending an independent organisation to pick 10 “best in show” funds, which would be an improvement on the “highly politicised” FWC choosing default funds. The chief executive of Industry Super, David Whiteley, said the report found that industry and not-for-profit funds were the best performing and the default system had served workers better than when they chose or were sold a fund. Whiteley told Sky News the proposal for a “best in show” shortlist was an “experimental” plan that would mean disengaged teenagers were making decisions for their retirement. On Tuesday Labor shadow treasurer Chris Bowen did not rule out supporting the Productivity Commission recommendations but called on the Coalition to drop “ideological” attacks on industry super if it wanted cooperation. In the 2018 budget the treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced changes including a ban on exit fees for superannuation. The super package includes a 3% annual cap on the fees that can be charged on passive accounts with balances below $6,000, to prevent low super balances from being eroded by ever-rising fees. O’Dwyer said the government would “proactively return people’s money to them through the taxation office” if they have a lost or inactive account, which would result in $6bn a year being returned to members instead of eaten up by fees and charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/29/malaysian-convicted-murderer-wants-to-settle-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T22:39:50Z","webTitle":"Malaysian hitman linked to Najib wants to settle in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/malaysian-convicted-murderer-wants-to-settle-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/malaysian-convicted-murderer-wants-to-settle-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Malaysian hitman linked to Najib wants to settle in Australia","bodyText":"A Malaysian former prime ministerial bodyguard who was convicted of the murder of a Mongolian translator involved in a French submarine purchase has said he wants to settle in Australia. Sirul Azgar Umar, who worked for Najib Razak, has been held in the high-security wing of the Villawood immigration detention centre in western Sydney since he was picked up under an Interpol warrant three and a half years ago. He may hold the key to a crime that has dogged the Najib government for more than a decade. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, which was given rare permission to visit the detention centre, Sirul said he was the scapegoat in an elaborate political crime and that prosecutors in Malaysia had chosen not to call certain witnesses. Sirul and a fellow bodyguard, Azila Hadri, were found guilty of the 2006 murder of Altantuya Shaariibuu who was the translator for, and lover of, Razak Baginda, one of Najib’s close advisers. The pregnant Altantuya was abducted in front of Baginda’s Kuala Lumpur home and taken to a forest in Subang where she was shot twice with a semi-automatic weapon and her body was blown up with military-grade explosives to dispose of DNA evidence from the foetus. She had allegedly demanded payment for her role in securing a French submarine deal. Sirul said he had never confessed to the killing. “I bring her halfway along the road, I give her to Azila,” he said. He alleged Azila had made up an alibi and told the court Sirul was the last person with her. “I am not a bad person, but the case makes me out as bad,” he said. The pair were convicted in 2009 as co-conspirators under Malaysian law. Sirul said he decided to visit Australia while on release awaiting an appeal. He claimed he was not fleeing justice. Neither man knew the victim, and rumours have circulated in Malaysia about who ordered the hit. Since being held in Villawood, Sirul has been visited by figures linked to both Najib’s UMNO party and the former opposition of Mahathir Mohamad. Azila is on death row in Malaysia. A direct link between Najib and the murder has never been established, and the former leader has always denied knowing Altantuya or being involved in her murder. Since this month’s election, however, the political landscape in Malaysia has shifted. Najib has been refused permission to leave the country and is under investigation on allegations of corruption and other abuses of office. Sirul was reported to have told the Malaysian website Malaysiakini last week he was willing to assist the new Pakatan Harapan government to reveal what transpired in the case, provided he was given a full pardon. At present, that seems unlikely. A high-profile member of the the new government, Ramkarpal Singh, said a pardon was inappropriate and Sirul’s testimony, while useful, was not essential. He has called for a new inquiry or a royal commission. Asked if he could reveal who gave the orders for the killing, Sirul said: “I am not going to comment about it.” Asked if he had information that would be valuable to any new inquiry, he said “no comment”. Asked if he would return to Malaysia if his sentence was commuted, Sirul became agitated. “Singh wants me to serve a life sentence. I don’t want to go back. People say: ‘Don’t give a pardon’. I would be killed in jail,” he said. To stand any chance of staying in Australia, Sirul must convince authorities that he is not a murderer. He is currently trapped in limbo as the Australian government will not send him back to face the death penalty in Malaysia. Sirul has been rejected for the temporary protection visa that would allow him to enter the community, on character grounds. He said he was preparing a case for the administrative appeals tribunal, although his Australian lawyer, Chris Levingston, said he was “not properly instructed” at this moment.

It was his way of answering all those angry questions on the campaign trail about how he would stop “illegal immigrants”. If moms and dads couldn’t feed their kids in Mexico, he explained, they would try to provide for their families in the United States. Bush badly misjudged his party, as well as his own powers of persuasion. His efforts at immigration reform died along with his domestic influence. But that wasn’t the end of his party’s long journey away from his values. Now, under his Republican successor, it is official US policy to deny family values for the undocumented migrants who cross the Rio Grande. Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security adopted a new policy to start criminal prosecutions of parents crossing the border illegally, and to place their children in protective custody. It wasn’t enough to deported undocumented people. Now the Trump administration would actively break up their families. This is not just an inhuman policy that violates any meaning of the words “family values”. It’s also recklessly incompetent about children’s safety, since the federal government has lost track of almost 1,500 of children in its supposed custody. For the American Civil Liberties Union, it’s unconstitutional because it denies migrant families due process. How did we get to the point where the supposed party of family values believes the best way to stop undocumented migration is to break up families? The answer starts with the demonization of such migrants: they aren’t moms and dads, but criminals. And we all know what kind of criminals Donald Trump has in mind when he talks about undocumented people: the tiny sliver who form part of the brutal MS-13 gang. For Trump, there is a vast army of MS-13 murderers out there, a force that rivals our own military in size. Otherwise it’s hard to understand the numbers he cited at the top of his infamous discussion about California’s so-called sanctuary laws earlier this month. “California’s law provides safe harbor to some of the most vicious and violent offenders on Earth, like MS-13 gang members, putting innocent men, women and children at the mercy of these sadistic criminals,” he said. “But we’re moving them out of this country by the thousands. MS-13, we’re grabbing them by the thousands and we’re getting them out.” By the thousands. Thousands and thousands of gang members getting deported, meaning the gang represents, what, hundreds of thousands of people? The FBI estimated the gang’s numbers between 6,000 and 10,000 in the US. This worldview is the context for Trump’s deportation policies and his comments just a few minutes later. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in – and we’re stopping a lot of them – but we’re taking people of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals.” Yes, he was talking about gang members. He just happens to believe there are thousands and thousands of them pouring across the border. And it’s so much easier to break up families if you think there are thousands and thousands of animals, not humans, among them. It is a remarkable gang that recruits so many mothers and young children to fill its ranks of murderers. Trump has demonized migrants as violent criminals from the start of his presidential campaign. We’ve come to expect him to use these neo-Nazi tactics, to re-tweet actual neo-Nazis and to express his sympathies for neo-Nazis screaming for racial purity. As George W Bush never said, this hard bigotry has given us such low expectations. But it hasn’t yet hardened us to the hollow hypocrisy of those claiming to support family friendly policies within Trump’s own family. Chief among those is his daughter Ivanka, who styles herself on Twitter as a “wife, mother, sister, daughter” ahead of her job as a presidential adviser. Were it not for her father’s policies and repeated comments, it might be admirable that she has been an advocate for working mothers and paid family leave. We might just appreciate the cuteness of the family photo of her snuggling up to her young son. Instead, she looks like she is either out of touch with her father’s policies, or out of the loop. There’s little point in advocating for families while your own administration is breaking them up intentionally as some kind of deterrent to immigration. Never mind that none of Ivanka’s policy proposals have made it into reality; she works inside an executive branch that is actively working against what she says she stands for. Whether she is ineffective or just ignorant, Ivanka’s inability to see outside her soft-focus bubble poses some pretty fundamental questions about her own political aspirations. According to Michael Wolff, Ivanka believes she will be the first woman president. Such delusions are not just a personal affliction, apparently: her own mother thinks she’ll run for president in 15 years or so. She might start laying the groundwork by blocking her own father’s policies separating children from their parents. In the meantime, her father naturally blames everyone but himself. According to the president, his immigration policies are dictated to him by the all-powerful Democrats who currently control no part of the federal government. “Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.,” he tweeted on Saturday, ignoring good sense as well as good spelling. He concluded the nonsensical tweet with an all-caps scream: “DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.” It’s not clear what planet Trump is living on, but it is a terrifyingly confusing one. Democrats are both punishing undocumented families and protecting them. Trump is but a hapless and impotent observer of this nightmare he presides over. For such a good family man, this is something of a stormy scenario. Because when it comes to Trump’s compassion for families, there’s just no there, there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/aug/06/player-liaison-officer-aston-villa-lorna-mclelland","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-06T07:00:31Z","webTitle":"‘A good officer can be the difference between a player joining a club or not’ | Sean Cole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/06/player-liaison-officer-aston-villa-lorna-mclelland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/aug/06/player-liaison-officer-aston-villa-lorna-mclelland","fields":{"headline":"‘A good officer can be the difference between a player joining a club or not’","bodyText":"Professional footballers tend to get a bad press. There is a perception that those at the top are insulated from real‑world concerns by wealth and status – that the bond between players and supporters has been broken as earnings have soared. Lorna McClelland, who worked as player liaison officer at Aston Villa for 14 years, agrees to an extent but has sympathy for the unusual situation in which footballers find themselves. “Once they reach a certain standard they’re earning a lot of money,” she says. “A life-changing amount of money. And very rarely do they know how to cope with that. So a good liaison officer will help them to get financial arrangements in place, perhaps working with an outside agency, like an accountant. Many players often lack these skills when they first come to the club. “But at that point they’re already set apart from the rest of the world by their fame and their salary. There are people out there who will try to abuse players for their own gain, both financially and socially, so they’re never sure who their friends are; whether they’re genuine friends or they just want to be seen with someone famous. There are hangers-on and financial agencies who want to get involved with them because they’re going to make money from them. They’re a little bit on the back foot so they do have to retreat into another world to be protected really.” McClelland, a former language teacher who speaks French, German and Spanish, was working at a school in Birmingham when she sent a speculative letter that would change her life. It was 2002 and Graham Taylor had just been appointed as Villa manager for the second time. One of McClelland’s daughters was working in the hospitality boxes at Villa Park when she told her mother about difficulties faced by young players who had moved to the club from abroad and were not receiving adequate support. As a counsellor and teacher McClelland was keen to help. She outlined how she thought she could. Taylor had been thinking that a more formal approach was needed and, after a long interview process, she was hired. “There wasn’t a remit because the role had never existed before,” McClelland says. “Graham Taylor and [the Villa owner] Doug Ellis showed a lot of insight into the needs of a player. They said to me: ‘There’s your computer, there are your keys, there’s your phone – you know what you need to do. Create a role and find a name for it.’ So I did that. It took me a while, maybe a couple of months, to work out exactly what the role should include. “I didn’t have an office. It was a very small training ground and that’s where I learned about the inner workings of a club and the life of a player. I had a seat in the coaches’ room because of a lack of space, which was a great learning ground.” McClelland was the first of her kind in English football. Her role became known as a player liaison officer and was widely replicated. It marked a sea change in attitudes. McClelland formed lasting friendships with many players and their families. She was there for them at important and stressful times; during illnesses, bereavements, house moves, pregnancies and almost everything in-between. She provided emotional and practical support, as well as referring players to outside agencies when necessary. “A good player liaison officer can be the difference between a player joining a club or not joining a club,” she says. “And also staying at a club or not staying at a club. If a player is happy then that makes a big difference. Looking after players, I found that I really had to think on my feet. You’re a firefighter sometimes and things crop up in their lives, just as they do in yours or mine, and you have to sort them out. “Players are a financial asset. Anyone with a modicum of sense who’s looking after a financial asset will make sure that they’re cared for. If a player’s unhappy, he’ll leave. For me it’s always been important for someone to be there if a big issue comes up in a player’s life. Perhaps someone in their family has died or there’s been an emergency. I was there if they wanted to phone me.” McClelland emphasises that most players she has worked with are polite and decent. Many find themselves prematurely wealthy and with their traditional support network suddenly stripped away having moved to England. “They’re still kids and they’re still growing up. They occasionally do silly things and make poor decisions but they learn from them, just the same as everybody does. “Players don’t always have confidence either, so the bravado can be a cover for that. It’s a very macho world and quite a tough world for a player to be sensitive in. If he has any quirky aspects to his personality or his life then the other players will find that. It’s a very tough world. One man’s banter is another man’s bullying.” McClelland left Villa two years ago, after relegation from the Premier League. She continues to work with sportspeople as a co-founder of GCSportsCare, which provides advice, support and counselling to people with mental health issues or addictions. The former footballer Gary Charles is the managing director. “The pressure on a footballer can be phenomenal,” says McClelland. “The pressure to succeed for himself, for his club, for his family. Everybody expects him to get out there and do well. “ If he doesn’t do well, it may be because his form has suffered or it may be because he’s injured and an injury can have a devastating effect in terms of his mental health. It can be a difficult time anyway, even with support, but at least if the right support is there, it can prevent a player from going over the edge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27530","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T23:00:55Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,530","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27530","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27530","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,530","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27528","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T23:00:00Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,528","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27528","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27528","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,528","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/may/28/gary-cahill-chelsea-form-miss-world-cup-england","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T21:30:04Z","webTitle":"Gary Cahill feared Chelsea form would cost him England World Cup place","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/28/gary-cahill-chelsea-form-miss-world-cup-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/28/gary-cahill-chelsea-form-miss-world-cup-england","fields":{"headline":"Gary Cahill feared Chelsea form would cost him England World Cup place","bodyText":"Gary Cahill feared the worst when his phone flashed with a missed call from Gareth Southgate this month. He had ample reason to believe the England manager was preparing to deliver bad news. After being appointed captain in March 2017 Cahill found himself out of Southgate’s plans a year later, omitted from the squad for two friendlies and struggling for form at Chelsea. “I thought potentially it could be bad news because in my experience of being involved with England for seven or eight years you usually don’t get the call – you just receive the information that you’re going to meet up and what times,” Cahill said. “So to get the call a different way, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bit nervous.” Cahill was driving to training at the time, preparing for Chelsea’s FA Cup final against Manchester United, and his thoughts were occupied by that fixture rather than the World Cup. “I was desperate to go and be in the squad like anybody else,” he said. “It was in the week leading up to the cup final so my emotions were all over the place. My mental state was fully focused on this final. That’s all I was thinking about. And then that came along and obviously I was delighted to get the news. There were a lot of emotions for me in that particular week and both turned out to be very good news. So let’s hope that carries on into the summer.” One of the hallmarks of Southgate’s tenure as manager so far has been the way he has communicated with his players, even when delivering bad news. He phoned Jack Wilshere, Ryan Bertrand and Joe Hart to let the trio know they did not feature in his plans for Russia. Cahill was extended the same courtesy when he was left out of a 27-man squad for friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March this year. It was a significant fall from prominence for the defender who Southgate had chosen to wear the captain’s armband against Germany in Berlin in March 2017 and played a key role in England’s World Cup qualification campaign. But Southgate had grown concerned at Cahill’s reduced role at Stamford Bridge, particularly after he was dropped from Chelsea’s defence after costly errors in Premier League games. As a result, the phone call did not come as a shock. “He spoke to me before he left me out. I respected him a lot for that phone call because I’d sooner find out from the horse’s mouth than anywhere else and nothing surprises me in football,” Cahill said. “Everyone is judged in months and weeks. You have a month where you score two or three goals and you’re the best thing since sliced bread. Or you have a month where you make a couple of errors and you’re finished. That’s the kind of way things go. “I played the majority of qualifying games for two years and then I was left out for the World Cup squad in 2014 when it was announced. Other people were in form, playing well, it is what it is. The thing I keep harping back to is dig into your character and make sure you perform well for your club to give yourself the opportunity. That’s all I tried to do. At that moment I took a knock – it’s not the first I’ve taken and I’ve had a lot of good times in football. I just needed to work harder, get in the team and show what I could do. On the last day of the season I lifted the Cup and there was the turnaround. It can happen quickly.” With 58 international caps Cahill is the most experienced member of the 23-man squad which will have an average age of 26 on 18 June when England play their first group game. He is also one of only 10 players in the squad who featured in England’s Euro 2016 campaign which ended with a humiliating defeat by Iceland. He insisted he would not be carrying mental scars from that early exit. “It depends on your personality and character. If you’re asking me that now I won’t even think of that when I’m over there. I will in the aspect of not want to experience that feeling again – it will just make me more determined to do well. “That game was so frustrating because we had unbelievable amounts of possession yet we never created anything with it. It took a long time to get over that. But we can’t harp on about the past, we’re looking to the future and we’re going into this tournament with a positive frame of mind. I think that’s the key for everybody whether you’re an England fan – or yourselves – to go in with a more positive attitude and we’ll see how far we can go.” The squad were enjoying the sunshine at St George’s Park, the FA’s centre of excellence on Monday. After a morning training session they posed for photographs for official FA promotional material, with Phil Jones still sporting a black eye he sustained during the FA Cup final. Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold won’t join up with the rest of the squad until Saturday at the earliest after featuring in Liverpool’s Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid. But their club mate Adam Lallana, who is one of four players on standby, is expected to report early to the squad get-together on Wednesday, waiving the extra days Southgate was willing to let him take after the Champions League final. It is understood he wants to prove he is fit should someone drop out. The 30 year old came off the bench to replace the injured Mo Salah after 30 minutes in Kiev and is thought to be next in line to travel to Russia if any of the midfielders or forwards are forced to drop out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/29/national-disability-insurance-scheme-complaints-reach-record-level","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T01:30:06Z","webTitle":"National disability insurance scheme complaints reach record level","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/national-disability-insurance-scheme-complaints-reach-record-level","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/national-disability-insurance-scheme-complaints-reach-record-level","fields":{"headline":"National disability insurance scheme complaints reach record level","bodyText":"Delays with the national disability insurance scheme are continuing to drive record numbers of complaints about the reform, new figures show. The latest report on the NDIS, released on Tuesday, shows 4,146 complaints were made to the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) in the three months to the end of March. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon It is the highest number of complaints received in a single quarter, well above the 3,880 complaints received last quarter when numbers were artificially inflated by the manual entry of earlier data. The number of complaints in the two quarters prior was 2,961 and 1,669 respectively. By far the most common frustration was with timeliness. Delays accounted for 37% of participant complaints about the NDIA, well above previous levels (28%). Since its inception, 17,352 complaints have been made about the NDIS, the equivalent of roughly one complaint for every 10 participants with approved plans. “The NDIA is concerned about the level of complaints it has received,” the report said. “The challenges experienced in implementing the scheme are recognised and work is proceeding on the participant and provider pathway review to address the issues that underlie the complaints.” The nature of the complaints is likely to enliven criticism of the government’s staffing cap on the NDIA. Critics say the cap has hampered the agency’s ability to effectively and efficiently implement the scheme. Earlier this month, a damning ombudsman’s report found people were waiting up to nine months for a review after complaining of errors or inadequacies with their support plan. Some were waiting months for a simple callback from the NDIA, the ombudsman found. Tuesday’s report also shows alarming gaps affecting those who are already receiving state and territory disability support services. About 2,430 of those already receiving support did not meet NDIS access criteria. Another 13,625 could either not be reached, rejected an opportunity to enter the scheme, or withdrew their request for NDIS support. Advocacy groups have long warned that such individuals could be left without support, as state and territory governments withdraw services in the expectation they will be replaced by the NDIS. In a statement the NDIA chief executive, Robert De Luca, said: “The NDIA will continue to proactively work with the states and territory governments to bring eligible people into the NDIS in future quarters.” More broadly, the report shows about 160,000 people are receiving support through the NDIS, including 151,970 people with approved plans and 10,253 children receiving early intervention services. About 45,000 had not previously received any government-funded support. “These figures show that under the NDIS, more and more Australians with disability are receiving better and more effective support and assistance than ever have before,” De Luca said. Satisfaction with the planning process – when an individual’s support needs are determined and funded – remained steady, with 84% rating it as good or very good. De Luca said the scheme was having a positive impact. About 90% of parents or carers with young children said the scheme had helped with their child’s development and access to school services. About three-quarters of those aged 25 and over said the NDIS had helped them with daily living activities. “These strong outcomes demonstrate the NDIS is already delivering on its goals to increase Australians with disability’s independence and participation in the community,” De Luca said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/28/brazilian-truck-drivers-block-port-after-temers-offer-falls-flat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T22:08:41Z","webTitle":"Brazil's truck drivers reject concessions as strike goes into eighth day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/brazilian-truck-drivers-block-port-after-temers-offer-falls-flat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/28/brazilian-truck-drivers-block-port-after-temers-offer-falls-flat","fields":{"headline":"Brazil's truck drivers reject concessions as strike goes into eighth day","bodyText":"On the eighth day of a nationwide strike over soaring fuel prices that has paralysed the Brazilian economy, truck drivers continued to protest on highways across the country. According to the G1 news site, demonstrations continued on Monday in 25 states and the federal district of Brasília, while in São Paulo, school buses and motorbike couriers joined the protests. New concessions announced by the president, Michel Temer, on Sunday night, including cutting taxes on diesel for 60 days, reduced tolls for empty trucks and minimum freight rates, initially appeared to have won over truckers. The Brazilian Truck Drivers Association – a key union that claims to represent 600,000 drivers – even said the strike was over. But truckers have yet to return to work. Some strikers said the deal was not enough. Others were unsure. “After 60 days it will go back to how it is, with higher prices,” said Edmundo de Souza, 36, a truck driver parked up with other strikers on a São Paulo highway. “Most people here realise that there was a victory, but the decision whether to continue will be up to a vote,” said José Rodrigues, leader of a group of strikers blocking Brazil’s biggest port in Santos. On Sunday, the Estadão news agency reported, a truck driver was shot in the head after trying to stop a truck avoiding a blockage in Espírito Santo state. He was taken to hospital. Across Brazil factories have been forced to shut down. In São Paulo only a third of buses were running, queues for gasoline at petrol stations continued and schools and universities suspended classes. Supermarket shelves in central Rio were bare of fruit and vegetables, bus services were reduced, schools were closed and the city had an enforced holiday feel. “It’s all empty there, take a look,” said Marcos Colal, a supermarket manager in central Rio, gesturing at empty fruit and vegetables shelves. “We haven’t had any medicines delivered in a week, not one,” said Paulo Galvão, manager of a nearby pharmacy. “I’m very worried.” Brazilians have been left shocked by the waste of food caused by strike – such as 300m litres of milk that the country’s Dairy Products Association said had been thrown away, and 64m birds the Association of Animal Protein said had to be put down. It added that 1bn more birds were at risk. Economists have been calculating how much the strike will cost Brazil’s battered economy, barely limping out of recession. Sunday’s concessions alone will cost taxpayers nearly £2bn. On Friday Temer sent in the army and federal police forces to help break the strike but while fuel deliveries from refineries for police, public transport and hospitals have been made with armed escorts, the army has avoided confrontation. On Sunday army commander, General Eduardo Villas Boas, tweeted that its “operational guideline” was “negotiation to avoid conflicts”. In some towns in the south of Brazil, people have demonstrated in support of striking truckers and drivers. A minority of strikers even called for military intervention – a thorny subject in a country that spent 21 years under a right-wing dictatorship. “I think that’s the way forward,” said Sonia Gouveia, 52, a striking school bus driver in São Paulo. Amid the political fallout, Temer’s dismal popularity has plummeted further. His Sunday-night television address was greeted with pan bashing by incensed viewers in some cities. Yet his administration printed newspaper adverts on Monday to trumpet its “conquests” during two years in government. One was headlined “We advanced with Brazil”, with a photo of a smiling woman in front of full supermarket shelves. Rafael Cortez, a political scientist and partner at São Paulo consulting outfit Tendências, said Temer’s claim to be leading an economic recovery looked increasingly shaky. “The Temer administration is almost a lame duck,” he said.

Top stories Land-clearing has wiped out close to $1.5bn in taxpayer-funded emissions gains, according to the government’s own figures. Official data suggests public money spent cutting greenhouse gas emissions by planting trees and restoring habitat under the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy will have effectively been negated by little more than two years of forest-clearing elsewhere in the country. The $2.55bn emissions reduction fund has contracts to prevent 124m tonnes of emissions through vegetation projects – mostly repairing degraded habitat, planting trees and ensuring existing forest on private land is not cleared. Meanwhile, forest-clearing has released more than 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since the fund began in 2015. Emissions projections data estimates another 60.3m tonnes will be emitted this year – more than 10% of national emissions. The Wilderness Society climate campaign manager, Glenn Walker, said other data sources suggested the projections data was almost certainly an underestimate. A Productivity Commission report has assessed the superannuation industry’s efficiency and competitiveness, and it finds much wanting. Greg Jericho analyses the results. “More than a quarter of the 74 funds offering a MySuper product failed to meet benchmark performance returns – accounting for 1.7 million member accounts and $62bn in assets. And such was the lack of transparency in the system that a mere five funds out of 208 provided the commission with information on their rates of return across all 14 assets classes, and 71% gave no response on the level of fee for related parties.” Italy’s faith in the eurozone is set to be tested in fresh elections after the president, Sergio Mattarella, installed an interim prime minister to lead a new government. The political crisis that has engulfed Rome threatens to bring about another bitter battle over the future of the EU, and the uncertainty promped a sell-off on Italian markets on Monday. Mattarella has asked Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official, to become interim PM, after refusing to accept the nomination of Paolo Savona, a Eurosceptic, for the role of finance minister. Mattarella said appointing Savona, 81, who has called Italy’s entry into the euro a “historic mistake”, would have risked the confidence of foreign investors and destabilising the country. The Australian Greens will push for a parliamentary inquiry into how $444m in reef funding was awarded to a small not-for-profit foundation, with little scrutiny and without a competitive tender process. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, the party’s spokesman for healthy oceans, will move for a Senate inquiry into why the Great Barrier Reef Foundation was announced as the recipient of the record government grant without the funds being offered to existing government reef agencies. The inquiry, if supported by Labor and the crossbench, would also investigate the capacity of the foundation to meet the objectives of the government’s Reef 2050 plan and the foundation’s governance. An undocumented migrant in France, Mamoudou Gassama, known as “spiderman” for climbing four stories to rescue a child, has been granted French citizenship. Gassama, 22, met with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, yesterday and was promised documents allowing him to stay, and a fast-track process to gain French nationality. He was also offered a job with the Paris sapeurs-pompiers, the city’s fire and emergency service. “He gave me a present,” Gassama said of Macron. “It’s the first time I’ve had anything like this. I’m very happy.” Sport The World Cup in Russia will be a tournament of firsts. It will be the first held in eastern Europe, the first for Panama and Iceland and the first to feature video assistant referee technology.

One is Australian Jo Fernandes, women and girls development manager at Football New South Wales. Officials from the International Cricket Council have arranged to meet with Al Jazeera television to view all of the footage relating to alleged spot-fixing by English and Australian cricket players. The five players – who remain unnamed – will also be interviewed when the ICC probe gets under way. Thinking time Margaret Atwood has admitted having no control over the TV version of her harrowing novel The Handmaid’s Tale, but says she has no problem with that and fans need to chill out over divergences from her novel. “I think I would have to be awfully stupid to resent it because things could have been so much worse,” she says. “They have done a tippety-top job … the acting is great, they’ve stuck to the central set of premises.” The light emitted from our LED screens is blamed for everything from bleary eyes to much more serious health issues, so what is the truth about blue light: does it really cause insomnia and increased risk of cancer, and just how worried should we be? “Blue light is not sinister,” says Stuart Peirson, of the sleep and circadian neuroscience institution at Oxford University. “ It’s just that we’ve subsequently invented devices that emit light and we’ve filled our environment with them and made them addictive. If you go to bed at night and stare at your bedside lamp for 10 minutes, that will shift your clock, it’s just that nobody does that.” A US federal court has declined to decriminalise cannabidiol (CBD) – a non-psychoactive chemical produced by the cannabis plant – despite widespread belief in its medical value. Many cannabis advocates consider it a miracle medicine, capable of relieving conditions as disparate as depression, arthritis and diabetes without getting users high. Here is what you need to know about CBD. What’s he done now?

The answer may lie in the chance of escape, a chance for Mexico to forget all its real-world troubles and revel in irrational, unbridled hope. El Tri have lost 25 World Cup games since the tournament began in 1930, more than any other team in history. Despite that unfortunate achievement, every four years Mexico overflows with dreams as football stops traffic, closes shops and pauses classes to unite the country. This year especially, football is likely to serve as a welcome withdrawal from the daily horrors of drug violence and the shadowy machinations of the 1 July presidential elections. Perhaps even more importantly, it takes place nine months after devastating earthquakes killed nearly 400 people. In the face of such events, Mexico is eager to come together to watch the spectacle of Russia 2018. “Celebrating soccer in Mexico is a pretext to explode without consequences, to let go of all the violence without a big fuss,” Mexican writer Fabrizio Mejía Madrid told the Guardian. “It’s like setting off a firecracker.” Mejía Madrid, who has dedicated his career to writing about social phenomena in Mexico City, says that Mexicans feel they can minimize their own failures, and the failures of the country, by enjoying the small victories of El Tri. “There is a party even when there is a tie,” he said. The World Cup will be played in a tense political environment this year as leftist candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador seeks the presidency for the third time. After his first loss in 2006, his followers paralyzed the country with massive street protests. But now he is favored to win as people have become more disillusioned by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that has ruled Mexico for more than seven decades with only a brief stint out of power. Corruption scandals and the disappearance of 43 students have haunted the term of the current president, Enrique Peña Nieto. “Everyone is talking about the elections, and maybe people are seeing the excitement around the World Cup as a breath of fresh air,” says 31-year-old Guadalupe Borja. “It is something that can release us from the haze of political contamination,” she said, “even if we know, deep down, that our team isn’t really going to make anything better.” Borja went to an all-girls Catholic school in Mexico City and she vividly remembers the 1998 World Cup in France when all the teachers, who were nuns, suspended classes to watch the games. That year Luis Hernandez, the star forward with memorable bleached-blond hair, scored four goals to become the most successful Mexican World Cup scorer. Borja recalled her classmates outfitted the only blonde girl in the school with a headband like the one Hernandez wore and paraded her around in proxy celebration chanting “México, México, México!” “Every time there is a World Cup, I want to feel that same level of emotion,” she said. Borja’s memories are typical. Offices turn all available televisions to the games and workers stop what they are doing for 90 minutes, the government sets up giant screens in plazas around the country and cantinas are full with spectators round the clock. Borja’s generation has never seen Mexico make it to the quarter-finals, even though the team has participated in the past six World Cups. The last time Mexico reached those heights was in 1986, when the country hosted the World Cup for the second time. Much like today, the tournament then took place just one year after one the worst earthquakes in Mexico’s history that claimed tens of thousands of lives. In 1985, President Miguel de Madrid shunned international help after the earthquake and the public made their disapproval of his leadership known by booing him during the World Cup opening ceremony at the Estadio Azteca the following year. But that negativity was not the central theme of the tournament. Instead people rallied around each other by gathering at Mexico City’s Angel of Independence, a column topped with a golden statue on the Paseo de Reforma that stands as a national symbol. “The idea of going to the Angel was about taking back the streets [after the earthquake],” said Mejía. It is a tradition that is carried on to this day. Inevitably, whatever the final score, fans overrun the monument clad in green and white jerseys and waving giant Mexican flags after every game. That patriotic spirit that cheered the team on its home pitch, helped Mexico to the quarter-finals in 1986. Now despite all the odds, Mexico fans are once again yearning for a strong showing this year. “There is a lot of expectation to see if [the team] are really evolving,” said Aldo González a 34-year-old Mexico fan who is traveling to Russia with his brother and a friend. González hopes Mexico can overcome their losing streak and lift people up back home. “We all know the country has a lot of problems,” he said, “so at least we have soccer to help us escape from our reality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/28/icc-intends-to-interview-players-alleged-involvement-spot-fixing-al-jazeera","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T17:22:46Z","webTitle":"ICC intends to interview the players allegedly involved in spot-fixing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/28/icc-intends-to-interview-players-alleged-involvement-spot-fixing-al-jazeera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/28/icc-intends-to-interview-players-alleged-involvement-spot-fixing-al-jazeera","fields":{"headline":"ICC intends to interview the players allegedly involved in spot-fixing","bodyText":"The unnamed England and Australia cricketers alleged to have been involved in spot-fixing by al-Jazeera’s undercover investigation into corruption are set to be interviewed when the International Cricket Council’s own probe gets under way. ICC officials are due to meet with the Qatar-based broadcaster this week following a request for all unedited materials sourced during the making of Cricket’s Match Fixers, the documentary that was aired on Sunday, to be shared with them. Among the claims aired was the allegation that three England players batted to order during the fifth Test against India in Chennai, December 2016, having agreed to score below a set number of runs during a 10-over passage of play as part of a betting scam. The England and Wales Cricket Board has issued a strong denial of any wrongdoing by its players, stating there is “no credible evidence”, as did Cricket Australia following a similar allegation made about two of their batsmen when they played the third Test against India in Ranchi last year. While all five players’ names were redacted in the final edit, along with specific match details that would assist in identifying them, the ICC will seek to get this information from the upcoming meeting with al-Jazeera and then look to speak to those allegedly involved. Speaking before his side’s departure for a limited‑overs tour of England in June, the Australia captain, Tim Paine, said: “At this stage it’s unsubstantiated claims. We’re confident that none of our guys are involved in it. As far as I’m concerned our players have got nothing to worry about. I’m really confident none of our players are involved.” The allegation of English involvement comes at an already troubling time for the Test team given the disappointing nine-wicket defeat to Pakistan at Lord’s on Sunday that has seen them now go eight matches without a win. Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, has however insisted the allegations were not responsible for their poor showing. He said: “There was no chat about it in the change-room. It would be wrong to blame that for the way we played. When we were told about it, the thought on it was that it was rubbish.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/may/28/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/28/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/28/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• We said that Oxford’s Wadham College would be spending around £30m on a dedicated access centre, to widen the range of students it admits.

There are kids making pottery that have more experience with clay than the 22-year-old. However, if he was expected to be overawed on a muggy Monday afternoon against the world No 43, Peter Gojowczyk, he showed no signs of it, breezing past the German in 41 minutes. Gojowczyk, who is in excellent form having reached the Geneva Open final at the weekend, was down 1-6, 0-2 and 15-40 when he retired with a groin strain after Britain’s latest prodigy wrong-footed him with an artful and unreachable forehand. “I think that was the best tennis I have played in my life,” Norrie said, his New Zealand accent now masked by an international mix. “I was in the zone and not making any unforced errors, dictating play. I think if he’s winning, there’s no chance he’s retiring. I got my first win [in a major] with a retirement as well, so it would be nice actually to win a match. But I’ll take it.” As for his French adventure, he said, “I didn’t come here [last year] because I didn’t want to start my career with a loss on clay. I had never played [on it]. I headed straight to London and got ready for the grass. I was just taking it one step at a time.” Those steps have been huge ones for the son of a Scottish father and Welsh mother, who have been stalwart supporters of his development in their adopted country, then his move to London, and they backed his decision to quit college in Texas to pursue his career. The world No 10, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, stopped him in the first round at Wimbledon and he won a challenger in the United States before the wily Russian Dmitry Tursunov gave up on him in the first round at Flushing Meadows. Norrie’s learning curve steepened dramatically in Marbella in February when, against all expectations, he came from two sets down in his first Tour-level match on clay to beat Roberto Bautista Agut on his Davis Cup debut for Great Britain against Spain. Andy Murray described it as “one of the most amazing wins I have ever seen”. Norrie, who has worked his way assiduously from the 200s into the top 100, said: “This time last year I would be very excited to be ranked 85 in the world and in the second round of the French Open, that’s for sure. The thing about tennis is you always want more. You get to 85 and you want to be top 50.” He was on fire against the experienced Gojowczyk. The form he found to beat John Isner in Lyon last week, his first win against a top-10 player, remained in place as he polished off the first set in 24 minutes. Norrie placed his groundstrokes with care and force, with only two unforced errors, and served efficiently. He struck four aces and landed 21 of 31 first serves for a 71% win ratio, and was equally sound on second serve. Norrie has had the advantage of being a relatively unknown quantity in the locker room, although word of his Marbella heroics spread quickly, and his move to the UK is changing his profile. He may soon be exposed to the weight of further expectation, especially if he gives Pouille a convincing challenge on Wednesday. Pouille, two years older, announced his arrival two years ago in majors with a string of excellent wins against quality opposition. On Sunday, he conceded only nine games against the Russian Daniil Medvedev to reach the second round at his home major, where he has a 4-5 career record. Heather Watson sails into second round Heather Watson, who broke a run of eight Tour defeats last week, continued her positive momentum at the French Open on Monday when she beat Océane Dodin 6-3, 6-0 in just over an hour on Court No 3. It was her sixth first-round win at Roland Garros, and she desperately wants to build on that on Wednesday. Having not won a set since 27 February before her redemptive win in Nuremberg, she struck nine aces and 18 clean winners while dominating the short rallies. She won 27 of 32 points on first serve. It kept her French opponent constantly guessing. “I started a little nervous,” Watson said courtside. “I was feeling really confident coming in, and loosened up. I played really, really well. It was tough to close it out. You could feel the rain coming. Throwing the ball up to serve I kept getting water in my eyes. “I was happy with my level throughout the whole match. Despite my season, I was feeling so confident coming into the match because I’ve done everything to prepare to the best of my ability.” Dodin played a curious first set, breaking at the start and throwing it away under quality pressure half an hour later. Watson remained calm after dropping serve and worked her way back into the contest, helped by the profligacy of her opponent, who served four double-faults, seven times in all, and converted only one of six break opportunities. Watson made the most of her early chances then blitzed Dodin in the second, despite a minor wobble in the final moments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/28/eddie-jones-inside-knowledge-england-beat-south-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T21:01:04Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones hopes inside knowledge can help England beat South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/28/eddie-jones-inside-knowledge-england-beat-south-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/28/eddie-jones-inside-knowledge-england-beat-south-africa","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones hopes inside knowledge can help England beat South Africa","bodyText":"Eddie Jones believes his intimate knowledge of South African rugby can help England “beat history” to claim a first away series win against the Springboks. Jones expects South Africa to be highly motivated because of “cultural issues” between the countries, highlighting a “dislike of the English”, but is sticking to his stated aim of a 3-0 series win next month. Any win would do at the moment. The 63-45 defeat by the Barbarians on Sunday was a fourth successive defeat under Jones but it was the embarrassing nature of it – never before have England conceded more points at Twickenham – that gave cause for concern. Jones is putting great faith in the return of 15 players from Exeter and Saracens, singling out the Vunipola brothers, Maro Itoje and his new captain, Owen Farrell, for their performances in the Premiership final on Saturday, but acknowledged they will need to be “re-educated” to England’s tactical approach, which he says has changed since the Six Nations. Jones will also be giving history lessons, attempting to hammer home the reasons why England have won only three of their 13 matches away against South Africa, the most recent in 2000. South Africa have renewed optimism under their new coach, Rassie Erasmus, who has recalled five players based overseas including Sale’s Faf de Klerk and Wasps’ Willie le Roux , and who on Monday made one of the most significant appointments in the Springboks’ history, naming Siya Kolisi as their first black captain. The Springboks have been beaten by England only once since 2006 but Jones, who was on the coaching staff for South Africa’s 2007 World Cup triumph and masterminded Japan’s 2015 World Cup victory against the Springboks, has claimed he knows their “rugby psyche” as well as anyone. “It always comes down to the fact the first thing you’ve got to do is beat history. History shows England have never won a series in South Africa,” he said. “I probably understand the South African rugby psyche as well as any having had experiences there. And I know what they are going to be like when they play England. There are certain cultural issues between the two countries that provide great motivation for the South Africans.” Jones is expecting a fearsome welcome in Johannesburg for the first Test on 9 June but believes England can use that against the Springboks. “You have to be able to exploit that and use it in a positive way. How can you use their dislike of the English to create an opportunity for yourself because you know at Ellis Park they will be unbelievably passionate and aggressive for the first 20 minutes. That creates opportunities for us. We have to be good enough to understand those opportunities and execute them. “First it is about creating an understanding of [the history]. They need to understand why English teams haven’t won there in the past and then come up with an approach of how we will be ourselves. Like in any game of rugby, any physical contact sport, you have to understand the psychology of the opposition. You have to understand where they get their strength from.” Tom Curry, one of the few players to emerge with credit from the record‑breaking defeat against the Barbarians, also knows what to expect against the Springboks. The 19‑year‑old, who has played in South Africa for England Under-18s, said: “At every age group South Africans just want to smash the English. It is what it is. You know what they are going to bring.” Jones will finalise his 34-man squad on Tuesday and will name replacements for the injured Jack Willis and Cameron Redpath. Nathan Hughes and Piers Francis are the most likely additions while Willis’s absence means Curry appears to be the frontrunner for the No 7 jersey in the first Test on 9 June in Johannesburg. “Eddie is pretty clear about what he wants from a seven. I just try to fit into the seven role in the team structure,” Curry said. “Just make sure I have speed at the breakdown and link the play. And work as hard as possible. Seven has got to be the hardest working player on the pitch. I am just going around busting a gut.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/04/jim-callaghan-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T16:56:58Z","webTitle":"Jim Callaghan obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/04/jim-callaghan-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/04/jim-callaghan-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jim Callaghan obituary","bodyText":"It was a source of considerable personal pride to the former Manchester MP Jim Callaghan, who has died aged 91, that after a lifetime spent seeking to improve health services in his constituency, his efforts were recognised, 10 years after his retirement from the House of Commons, when the local NHS centre was renamed in his honour. On visiting Callaghan House, in Cross Street, Heywood, he was also able to commend the health authority for ensuring that the disabled facilities complied with legislation he had introduced at Westminster. He was a profoundly modest man – he used to introduce himself as “the other James Callaghan” – who had been born into the rough, tough streets of Manchester and who well understood the poverty of the urban slums in which he was raised and the acute social deprivation he later witnessed as a teacher in the city. Eldest of five children of Norah and Jim Callaghan, he had an Irish Catholic background and a father who was at one time a lorry driver. He never disclosed details of his early education, but there was a hint of a difficult street-fighting youth. He admitted once that there was a time when he was “constantly in trouble”, that he could find his way blindfold to the local hospital and that the doctors there would greet him with: “Not you again, Callaghan!” By his mid-20s, however, he had secured qualifications from Manchester and London universities and started teaching sport in junior schools in his home city before being appointed in 1959 as a lecturer in art at St John’s and Openshaw Technical College (now the Manchester College). He retained a love of art and sport throughout his life, but never forgot the postwar slums that politicised him. Having joined the Labour party, he was elected to Middleton council in 1971 and then pulled off the considerable feat of narrowly taking the Middleton and Prestwich parliamentary seat from the Conservatives in the “Who Governs Britain?” general election of February 1974. “Little Jim”, as he became known at Westminster (he was considerably shorter than his famous namesake), was widely liked, as much by his fellow MPs as by his constituents. He was initially embarrassed when occasionally mistaken for James Callaghan (who became prime minister in 1976), particularly when travelling abroad and finding himself unexpectedly upgraded by foreign dignitaries. In time he grew to laugh and enjoy it. MPs liked him because he was decent, diligent and stuck to his principles without pretension or pursuit of promotion. He was correspondingly popular in the constituency because his views were similar to many of those he represented: he was an old-style Tribune group leftwinger, opposed to Europe, nuclear weapons and power, and what he regarded as unnecessary bellicosity in the Falklands and the Gulf. Most significant, though, was his pursuit of every government to secure better education, to improve the health service and to speak out in defence of those who had no voice of their own. He was never afraid to express controversial views and was an early advocate of a ban on public smoking. He was concerned about excessive violence being shown on television because of the possible impact on family life and repeatedly attempted to outlaw boxing as a sport because of what he described as the terrible tragedies and hazards involved. His sincerity was evident in all his speeches and he was consequently heard with respect. Early in his parliamentary career he successfully proposed a private member’s bill, amending the law on disabled access to commercial buildings, and was subsequently promoted to become parliamentary private secretary to the chief secretary to the Treasury, Joel Barnett, giving him a toehold on the lowest rung on the ladder for political promotion. Within three months, in early 1976, he nevertheless voted against his own Labour government – obliging the prime minister, Harold Wilson, to stage a vote of confidence – and he was predictably sacked. By an odd quirk, he later found himself in a popularity contest with Barnett, his parliamentary neighbour, for the redrawn constituency of Heywood and Middleton, which he won in 1983. During Michael Foot’s tenure of the Labour leadership, Callaghan sat briefly on the opposition frontbench as a junior spokesman on Europe from 1982, but thereafter his career was concentrated on parliamentary work out of any sort of limelight. He was an assiduous member of Commons’ select committees on transport, education and national heritage. He sat on the Commons’ catering committee and on the Speaker’s panel of committee chairmen. Having reached the age of 70, he stood down at the 1997 election, glad to have more time to pursue his interests in photography, art and sport, and to spend time with his wider family. He is survived by a brother, Joe, three sisters, Norah, Pat and Maureen, and eight nephews and nieces. • James Callaghan, politician, born 28 January 1927; died 29 March 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/30/what-good-surgery-homecare-crisis-council-funding-older-people","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘What good is advanced surgery if we can’t even offer proper homecare?’ | Anna Bawden and Nicola Slawson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/30/what-good-surgery-homecare-crisis-council-funding-older-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/30/what-good-surgery-homecare-crisis-council-funding-older-people","fields":{"headline":"‘What good is advanced surgery if we can’t even offer proper homecare?’","bodyText":"Almost 1.2 million people aged over 65 do not receive the support they need with essential daily tasks such as getting washed and dressed or preparing meals, according to Age UK. The perilous state of the domiciliary care sector, which provides support in people’s own homes, is one of the main reasons for this, the charity says. It’s symptomatic of the deep problems affecting social care in England. Last week, two influential reports laid bare the scale of the problem and put further pressure on the government to find a long-term funding solution. Researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation calculated that households would need to pay around £300 a year each in extra taxes to fund adult social care. This is on top of the £2,000 additional tax they would need to pay to ensure the NHS can cope with the demands of an ageing population. In a similar vein, the surgeon and former Labour health minister Lord Darzi, backed by former Tory health minister Lord Prior and the IPPR thinktank, called for a 1p in the pound increase in national insurance contributions from 2019 to fund the NHS and social care. The IPPR calculates that this would deliver an extra £350m a week for health and social care, which includes domiciliary care. The plan is part of a package of proposals to be unveiled in a final report next month. “Without an adequately funded social care system, patients who could otherwise be safely discharged to their own homes have to be looked after in hospital for longer than is necessary – a waste of NHS resources, and a less happy situation for the people concerned,” says Darzi. “Providing people with the care they need at home is just as important to the nation’s wellbeing as the surgery that I do. There is no point in being able to provide the most advanced treatments if we can’t get the basics of caring for people right,” he said. “That’s why we need to be straightforward about the financial challenges we face, and honest about the need to tackle them through a modest increase in national insurance contributions. We can secure the NHS and social care, including domiciliary care, for the future by asking everyone to contribute a little more. It’s a small price to pay for a more civilised and caring society.” It follows an interim report last month , which calculated that the NHS needed an extra £50bn a year by 2030 to keep going, and a further £10bn a year was needed for social care – which includes care in people’s own homes. According to the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, there are some 7,000 providers of domiciliary care in the UK, the majority of which are small, private firms. The biggest five homecare operators account for less than 9% of the market, according to figures published in April by analysts LaingBuisson. As a result, there is a lot of “churn” in the sector, as small homecare companies stop providing services. The UK Homecare Association, which represents domiciliary care providers, estimates that over a 12-month period, more than 20,000 people using homecare services may have been affected by providers exiting the market. Ruthe Isden, the head of health influencing at Age UK, says that this churn “really impacts on older people’s continuity of care as day to day they don’t know if they are going to see the same care workers” coming into their home. The other issue, she says, is the quantity of provision. “We are increasingly hearing that people are finding it difficult to actually access homecare in some areas, either because the providers local to them have no capacity or there aren’t any providers locally any more. That is particularly a problem in rural areas where they might be the only person who needs care in that village. With care workers not being paid for travel, it can mean it’s not viable for agencies to take that person on – so they don’t.” Part of the problem is that the fees local authorities can afford to pay are often far lower than providers say they can afford. The UKHCA calculates that the minimum price that homecare providers need to receive from councils is currently £18 per hour. But some only pay £13 an hour. This comes on top of the multimillion-pound bills providers face after the government announced that care staff were entitled to the minimum wage for “sleep-in” hours and to back pay where they did not receive it. Colin Angel, the UKHCA policy and campaigns director, says the £18 per hour is “based on the absolute minimum price, assuming you can recruit enough workers on the minimum or living wage. Typically we’re seeing wages that are often below local labour market expectations, which means you’ll have difficulty recruiting workers. You’ll find providers have less money left over for things like back-office staff – and one of the first things that goes in any organisation under stress is the training and development budget, which is crucial for retaining staff.” In contrast, he says, operators whose clients can afford to pay for their own care are able to provide a higher quality service. “People are buying care for much longer periods of time so usually won’t have visits of less than an hour and won’t have the kind of rushed and undignified visits you see elsewhere. They also report much lower staff turnover and find it easier to recruit.” Glen Garrod, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, describes the domiciliary market as “limping along” because of growing staff shortages. “There are over 19,000 care workers and more are needed, but when funding is so tight, there is a challenge to recruit quality staff and get them to stay. They want to see that there is a career path for them – but to do that organisations need to thrive, not just survive, so that they can provide good quality training and supervision.” The fragility of the homecare sector is exacerbated by the fact that the three largest providers – City &amp; County, Carewatch and Allied Healthcare – are owned by private equity groups. The nature of private equity means that debt levels tend to be high and firms tend to cut costs to boost returns. In 2015, Saga sold its homecare business, Allied Healthcare, to German private equity firm Aurelius, while last year, Mitie’s two domiciliary care enterprises were bought by Apposite Capital for £2. Last month, Allied Healthcare, which provides home visits to 13,500 older and vulnerable people, narrowly avoided going bust by agreeing a new credit agreement for its debts. Although this provides breathing space, the CQC says it is continuing to closely monitor the situation. Andrea Sutcliffe, CQC’s chief inspector of adult social care, says: “This is a dynamic situation that remains under very close review. We can and will take timely action to notify local authorities if circumstances change so they can ensure that continuity of service is preserved for the people who matter most.” Some homecare providers, such as the Mears group, have made public statements about work they are handing back to councils because it doesn’t believe care can be delivered at the price the councils are willing to pay. But the UKHCA says there are many more cancelling contracts much less publicly. Izzi Seccombe, the chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board, says that councils have “effective contingency plans in place” in case contracts are handed back so they can ensure any disruption to a person’s care is kept to a minimum and that people remain at the centre of decisions about how best to meet their care needs. “However, continued cuts to funding for adult social care is putting an impossible squeeze on councils and providers to deliver care,” she says. “This is impacting on the availability, choice and number of people receiving homecare services, with the number of people affected by contract cancellations in homecare greater than those in residential care.” Ultimately, the crisis in domiciliary care risks undermining independent living, says John Bolton, a visiting professor at the Institute of Public Care. “The whole ambition of keeping people at home, allowing them to live fulfilled lives, is being lost in the malaise of a homecare market that is increasingly reliant on goodwill to survive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/28/roman-abramovich-granted-israeli-citizenship-tel-aviv-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T20:55:08Z","webTitle":"Roman Abramovich granted Israeli citizenship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/roman-abramovich-granted-israeli-citizenship-tel-aviv-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/28/roman-abramovich-granted-israeli-citizenship-tel-aviv-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Roman Abramovich granted Israeli citizenship","bodyText":"Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, has been granted Israeli citizenship and will move to Tel Aviv, an Israeli government spokesperson has said. Abramovich had faced unusually long delays in renewing his UK visa, which had expired, sources told the Reuters news agency. The British government has declined to comment on his case. Israel’s interior ministry confirmed the offer of citizenship on a local television station on Monday. “Roman Abramovich arrived at the Israeli embassy in Moscow like any other person,” an Israeli government spokesperson told Channel 10. “He filed a request to receive an immigration permit, his documents were checked according to the law of return, and he was indeed found eligible.” Abramovich’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. According to the Ynet website, which belongs to Israel’s biggest selling daily newspaper, Yedioth Aharonoth, Abramovich flew to Tel Aviv on Monday and received documents confirming his status as an Israeli citizen. He has reportedly bought a property in the city. Israel grants citizenship to any Jewish person wishing to move there and a passport can be issued immediately. Israeli passport holders can enter the UK without a visa for short stays, although they require visas to work. Abramovich, who is Jewish and has been a regular visitor to Israel, has donated millions to Israeli research and development projects and invested in local firms. Ynet said he had bought a former hotel in Tel Aviv, on the Mediterranean coast. Israel’s media has speculated for days that the businessman was seeking citizenship. The Times of Israel said Abramovich would be exempt from paying tax in Israel for 10 years and would not need to explain the sources of his wealth in that time. Worth £8.6bn, according to Forbes magazine, Abramovich would instantly become the richest Israeli. It is believed the British government would have required some financial disclosures if Abramovich’s UK visa was to be renewed. There have also been suggestions that Abramovich fell foul of tighter regulations imposed in 2015. His failure to secure a new tier 1 visa, which allows anyone who invests more than £2m in the British economy to stay for 40 months, comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Russian and UK governments. Relations have been strained since the poisoning of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March, an act Britain has blamed on Russia but in which the Kremlin denies any involvement. The UK’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, hinted last week that the UK could take action against Russian oligarchs in the wake of the poisoning of the Skripals. Johnson said it would be “totally wrong” to discuss the case of Abramovich, who is a friend of Vladimir Putin. But he added: “There is a broader question about what the UK can do to crack down on people close to Putin who may have illicit or ill-gotten wealth. As you know, we have statute that allows us to use unexplained wealth orders against them, but we live under the rule of law so whatever happens must be done in accordance with the rules and the law.” Johnson added that the more stringent approach to Russian oligarchs adopted by the US had been effective. He said: “The truth is actually that I think the effect of some of those sanctions, particularly on some individuals, has been very marked and I’ve noted that, but we have our own systems and our own approach and we have to do it in accordance with the law and accordance with the evidence.” There is no suggestion that Abramovich has been involved in any wrongdoing. The Russian foreign ministry had criticised the British government over the delays in his visa application process, saying: “It’s obvious that, for the British government, both visas and the regulation of the media sphere are instruments of politics.” Last week, Roman Borisovich, a Russian anti-corruption campaigner, said the Russian ambassador to the UK’s suggestion that oligarchs who had similar problems could take their cases to court was unlikely. “The last thing these guys want is to have a public hearing in the UK. They would have to answer questions like ‘how did you make your money’ and ‘are you the real owner of your assets’? Plus ‘are you a conduit for the Russian regime or an instrument for meddling in other countries?’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/beauty-tips-rose-gold-is-a-supremely-flattering-look","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Beauty tips: rose gold is a supremely flattering look","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/beauty-tips-rose-gold-is-a-supremely-flattering-look","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/03/beauty-tips-rose-gold-is-a-supremely-flattering-look","fields":{"headline":"Beauty tips: rose gold is a supremely flattering look","bodyText":"That delicate pinkish glow, like blushing jewellery, was worn on eyes, cheeks and lips at Alberto Zambelli.

Philip Alston, the UN special rapporteur who acts as a watchdog on extreme poverty around the world, has issued a withering critique of the state of America today. Trump is steering the country towards a “dramatic change of direction” that is rewarding the rich and punishing the poor by blocking access even to the most meager necessities. “This is a systematic attack on America’s welfare program that is undermining the social safety net for those who can’t cope on their own. Once you start removing any sense of government commitment, you quickly move into cruelty,” Alston told the Guardian. Millions of Americans already struggling to make ends meet faced “ruination”, he warned. “If food stamps and access to Medicaid are removed, and housing subsidies cut, then the effect on people living on the margins will be drastic.” Asked to define “ruination”, Alston said: “Severe deprivation of food and almost no access to healthcare.” Alston sounds the alarm in the final report of his investigation into extreme poverty in the US that is published on Friday and will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva at the end of June. His findings are based on a tour he carried out in December through some of America’s most destitute communities, from Skid Row in Los Angeles, through poor African American areas in Alabama, and the stricken coal country of West Virginia, to hurricane-racked Puerto Rico. The report amounts to one of the most scorching assessments of Trump’s leadership in his 16 months in the White House. It is likely to spark debate across the political aisle as well as globally about the US president’s rapid drive towards heightened inequality. The Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz told the Guardian it was profoundly important that international observers were speaking out about Trump’s impact. “This administration inherited a bad situation with inequality in the US and is now fanning the flames and worsening the situation. What is so disturbing is that Trump, rather than taking measures to ameliorate the problem, is taking measures to aggravate it.” Top of the list of those measures was the $1.5tn tax cuts enacted by the Republicans last December that slashed corporate tax rates. “Can you believe a country where the life expectancy is already in decline, particularly among those whose income is limited, giving tax breaks to billionaires and corporations while leaving millions of Americans without health insurance?” Stiglitz said. The UN monitor similarly excoriates Trump and the Republicans in Congress for passing a tax bill that “overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and worsened inequality”. Alston added that “the policies pursued over the past year seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment and make even basic health care into a privilege”. He cautioned middle-class Americans from thinking they were immune from the lash of such policies, as Trump’s assault “bodes ill for society as a whole. The proposed slashing of social protection benefits will affect the middle classes every bit as much as the poor.” The Federal Reserve annual economic survey released last week underlines the large pool of people who are vulnerable to any further erosion of the safety net. It found that four out of 10 Americans are so hard up they could not cover an emergency expense of $400 without borrowing money or selling possessions. Cory Booker, the US senator from New Jersey, described the UN report as “disturbing, but unfortunately not surprising. We live in a land where great wealth lives alongside unconscionable poverty, and the Trump tax bill makes this dire situation worse by showering the wealthiest with huge tax breaks while Republican leaders seek to make drastic cuts to the social safety net.” Booker, who has introduced legislation to combat poverty, said fellow policymakers should see Alston’s investigation as a wake-up call to take bold action, such as a jobs guarantee, healthcare for all and help for former prisoners to reintegrate in society. “People who disagree on politics can agree that no child in America should go to bed hungry, no home should lack access to a working sewer system, no illness should drive a family to bankruptcy.” As one of the world’s wealthiest societies, the US is what Alston calls a “land of stark contrasts”. It is home to one in four of the world’s 2,208 billionaires. At the other end of the spectrum, 40 million Americans live in poverty. More than five million eke out an existence amid the kind of absolute deprivation normally associated with the developing world. The symptoms of such glaring inequality include: Americans now live shorter and sicker lives than citizens of other rich democracies; Tropical diseases that flourish in conditions of poverty are on the rise; The US incarceration rate remains the highest in the world; Voter registration levels are among the lowest in industrialised nations – 64% of the voting-age population, compared with 91% in Canada and the UK and 99% in Japan. Against that backdrop, the UN rapporteur identifies a slew of what he calls “aggressively regressive” policies coming out of the Trump administration that are sending the country “full steam ahead” towards greater inequality. In addition to the tax breaks, there are new work requirements for welfare recipients, cuts of up to a third in the food stamp program, a recent proposal from housing secretary Ben Carson to triple the base rent for federally subsidized housing, and a burning of government regulations that offered protections to middle-class and poor families. “This is an across the board attack on those who are living on the poverty line or below it,” Alston said. The UN monitor contends that what amounts to Trump’s punishment of low-income Americans is based on an unfounded assumption that such people are lazy, work-shy and dedicated to defrauding the welfare system. Several senior government officials told Alston during his tour that scamming by welfare recipients was rampant, yet little convincing evidence was provided to support that caricature, he notes in his report. The scrutiny now falling on Trump from the UN is significant in that the US stands increasingly as an outlier in the world community. Alston’s report adds to a mounting body of criticism emanating from global organisations warning the US that unless it pulls back from its current course it will end up isolated from all other developed countries. The statistics speak for themselves. In 1980, the US and Europe stood side by side in terms of inequality – in both cases, the richest one percent earned about 10% of national income. Fast forward to 2017, and in Europe the 1% has edged up to 12% of national income. But in America the same elite now gobbles up 20%. Last year the IMF, a world body not renowned for being hyper-critical of countries that fail the poor, said: “The US economy is delivering better living standards for only the few. Household incomes are stagnating, job opportunities are deteriorating, prospects for upward mobility are waning and economic gains are increasingly accruing to those that are already wealthy.” Stiglitz said: “It’s clear that this administration is totally out of step with the rest of the advanced world that is looking at the US more askance on so many levels. For Americans who are fighting against the abnormality of the Trump administration it is heartening and reinforcing to know that the rest of the world is becoming more resolved in how it deals with the post-Trump US.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/29/uk-economy-brexit-business-activity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T11:57:45Z","webTitle":"UK economy feels chill from spectre of disorderly Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/uk-economy-brexit-business-activity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/29/uk-economy-brexit-business-activity","fields":{"headline":"UK economy feels chill from spectre of disorderly Brexit","bodyText":"The spectre of a disorderly Brexit is holding back the British economy from a full recovery after a heavy snowfall earlier this year, according to a Guardian analysis of economic developments over the past month. Having been blown badly off-course by the “beast from the east” cold snap, the UK has only managed a muted rebound, raising fresh questions over the strength of the economy as the Brexit date draws nearer. The pound plummeted to the lowest levels this year after the Bank of England was forced to delay raising interest rates after weak economic data. While there are some positive signs such as a rebound in consumer spending, economists argue the UK would have performed better if it were not for the lingering effects of the referendum vote. Heavy snowfall hit large parts of western Europe, including France, Belgium and the Netherlands, yet the UK was the worst performer in the first three months of 2018, recording the weakest quarter for five years. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said if anything recent data suggests a rate cut is in order. “Brexit is a disaster. As Laurel and Hardy famously said: ‘Well, here’s another nice mess you’ve gotten me into’,” he added. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, used a recent speech in London to warn that a disorderly Brexit could force the central bank to freeze rates, or even lower them, to protect jobs and economic growth. Meanwhile, there are signs of tension emerging between the Treasury and Threadneedle Street over the type of deal for the finance industry being pursued by the government. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows key barometers of business activity in the UK failed to recover as much as forecast. The reading on the IHS Markit/Cips all-sector purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.2 in April, up from 52.5 in March. James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING Bank, said: “The storm didn’t just hit the UK, it contributed to weakness right across Europe. But Brexit is causing ongoing uncertainty and nervousness. Why would you put money to work as a business?” The Office for National Statistics found business investment fell 0.2% in the first quarter, while figures show the weakest levels of consumer spending for three years. Several retailers across the UK, including Marks &amp; Spencer and Dixons Carphone are planning to shut stores amid severe strife on the high street. There was better news from falling inflation, as the effects of the post-referendum slide in sterling begin to fade, helping to alleviate pressure on squeezed Britons. The consumer price index (CPI) fell to 2.4%, according to the ONS, against economists’ forecasts for inflation to remain unchanged from the previous month at 2.5%, although some economists said it could begin rising again in coming months with the cost of fuel increasing. The labour market also helped to paint a reasonably upbeat picture, with employment continuing to rise and wage growth sticking above the rate of inflation. However, Carney warned the Brexit vote had already cost UK households £900 in lost income, compared with forecasts made before the vote in May 2016. The Bank’s governor also warned the economy had also lost almost 2% of predicted growth, which means the economy is about £40bn smaller than it would have been without Brexit. Andrew Sentance, another former member of the Bank’s MPC, said this should prove positive for consumer spending in the second half of the year. However, he warned that Brexit could have a damaging effect by acting as a drag on productivity growth – a measure of economic output per hour of work which is key for raising workers’ pay. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “If Brexit causes high value-added jobs in manufacturing and financial services to move out of the UK, productivity growth could weaken further.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/29/liverpool-capture-fabinho-anfield-jurgen-klopp","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T09:55:00Z","webTitle":"Liverpool’s £40m capture of fabulous Fabinho shows they mean business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/29/liverpool-capture-fabinho-anfield-jurgen-klopp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/29/liverpool-capture-fabinho-anfield-jurgen-klopp","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool’s £40m capture of fabulous Fabinho shows they mean business","bodyText":"“During the transfer window and even the month after it was a little difficult to live with the situation,” Fabinho admitted in December. “I had to leave, I did not leave, etc. But I do not think about it any more, the page is turned.” A little more than six months later and the boy who left his home near São Paulo for the bright lights of Rio as a teenager has finally been granted his wish. Yet while his wife, Rebeca Tavares, could barely contain her excitement as she filmed their flight on a private jet from Madrid to Merseyside on Monday in a video posted later on Instagram, Fabinho managed to keep his cool as he responded to her impromptu interview. “We’re landing in Liverpool in a few minutes. How do you feel?” he was asked. “What?” came the response. “How do you feel about Liverpool?” pressed his wife. “I feel good. Thanks.” Monaco supporters will be used to such understatement from a player who prefers to do his talking on the pitch. Ever since Fabinho arrived in the principality as a fresh-faced 19-year-old, his conduct and attitude have been exemplary. Initially signed on a year-long loan from the Portuguese club Rio Ave having spent a season in Real Madrid’s Castilla side, he became a regular at right-back under Claudio Ranieri in Monaco’s first season back in Ligue 1 and was retained for another year when Leonardo Jardim took over as manager the following year. But it was Jardim’s decision to switch Fabinho to a central midfield role in his third season at the club that transformed both his and Monaco’s fortunes. Having signed a permanent deal with the club that summer, the Portuguese immediately installed the 6ft 2in Brazilian at the heart of his exciting young team and reaped the rewards. Securing the Ligue 1 title ahead of Paris Saint-Germain’s expensively assembled squad in 2016-17 and reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League during the same season was the culmination of that journey. Yet while Kylian Mbappé, Bernardo Silva, Tiémoué Bakayoko and Benjamin Mendy were all allowed to move on at the end of the campaign, it was telling that Fabinho was ordered to remain despite an informal agreement with his representatives, Jorge Mendes and the former Portugal midfielder Deco. The result was a mediocre start to the season that may have ultimately cost him a place in Brazil’s World Cup squad, although the player who left Fluminense having never featured for the first team has since underlined his undoubted ability as Monaco secured Champions League qualification for a fourth successive year. Manchester United initially appeared to be the most likely destination for Fabinho once Monaco decided to allow the 24-year-old to finally depart but despite holding talks last summer, and José Mourinho sharing the same agent, an offer did not materialise. In fact Atlético Madrid were the only club to have made a firm bid, of around £30m, until Liverpool’s offer blew them out of the water. Liverpool’s relationship with Mendes, who arranged Fabinho’s move to Rio Ave in 2013, proved pivotal in the club’s latest intelligent move in the transfer market. Having already secured their record purchase of Naby Keïta from RB Leipzig last summer, the two new recruits will report at Melwood on 1 July as part of a squad that already looks considerably stronger than the party which lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final. The addition of a high‑class holding player to complement the abilities of Keita, a Guinea international, Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain, Georginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson in midfield will provide more defensive stability for a sustained challenge for the Premier League title. But it was the influence of another of Jürgen Klopp’s current squad that persuaded Fabinho to take the plunge. “I spoke on the phone with [the Liverpool forward Roberto] Firmino,” he told the French broadcaster RMC. “I know him personally ... I was able to speak with the manager and people who work at the club. They gave me a lot of confidence. “I always said that this was a league that I wanted to get to know, where I wanted to play. You see lots of passion, crazy atmospheres in all the stadiums each weekend. I cannot wait to experience that.” Fabinho could soon be joined by Nabil Fekir, with Liverpool understood to be in advanced discussions to sign the France forward from Lyon for around £60m. Even with the heartache of Saturday night in Kiev still fresh in the memory, Liverpool supporters will be already counting down the days to the start of next season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/31/drawn-into-tolkiens-world-exhibition","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T08:59:16Z","webTitle":"How Tolkien created Middle-earth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/31/drawn-into-tolkiens-world-exhibition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/31/drawn-into-tolkiens-world-exhibition","fields":{"headline":"How Tolkien created Middle-earth","bodyText":"As a fantasy lover, I can barely remember a time when I wasn’t aware of JRR Tolkien. I read The Hobbit until it fell apart as a child, and have always strived, in my own contributions to the genre, to take even a shred of the care in my world-building that Tolkien did in his. “It is written in my life-blood,” he said of The Lord of the Rings, “such as that is, thick or thin; and I can no other.” A rallying cry for anyone who has known what it is to inhabit a world of one’s own. “Tolkien was a genius with a unique approach to literature,” says Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford. “His imagined world was created through a combination of his deep scholarship, his rich imagination and powerful creative talent, and informed by his own lived experiences. We are incredibly proud to hold the Tolkien archive and to be able to share so many previously unseen items in this once-in-a-generation exhibition.” An exhibition, Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, is at the Weston Library in Oxford until October. Visiting before it opens, with preparations still ongoing, I must rely a little on my imagination to colour between the lines. We pass the skeleton of what will be the main entrance to the exhibition; I am told by its curator, Catherine McIlwaine, that the Doors of Durin will be projected into this dark passageway to welcome visitors. At the heart of the gallery is a model that will chart the routes taken by Tolkien’s characters through the landscape of Middle-earth. As McIlwaine talks me through the items, I find that seeing the exhibition in this liminal state lends an unexpected resonance to the experience. After all, never is a story more alive than when it is in progress. Though many authors have since found great success in his genre, Tolkien, born in 1892, is unrivalled in his reputation as a meticulous creator who knew his world down to the last blade of grass. Today, Tolkien might have come to represent the old guard of fantasy – the “locker room” that the late Ursula K LeGuin once derided. Yet fierce passion for his work endures, and even his harshest critics will concede that few creators have succeeded in building a paracosm that touches the depth of Middle-earth. Every so often, a new offering will stoke the coals of Tolkienmania – Beren and Lúthien was published in 2017, and this August The Fall of Gondolin will expand on another story from The Silmarillion. Meanwhile Amazon has signed a deal for an ambitious TV adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. Throughout my career as a writer, I have found Tolkien to be a source of both self-doubt and inspiration. On the one hand, it can be tempting to give up in the face of his brilliance. He began to invent his first Elvish language when he was a student at Oxford, and eventually built a “Tree of Tongues” – one of the items on display in the exhibition – that charted his constructed languages from source. McIlwaine tells me about a painting Tolkien did when he should have been studying for his finals, of the realm of Valinor. “In 1915, it was all there, already in his head,” she explains. Dwelling on this too deeply could induce an existential crisis. More often, however, the knowledge of how fully Tolkien inhabited his work is a catalyst and a beacon. It fuels me to build larger, to dream weirder and to push harder at the bounds of my imagination. Exhibitions of the Bodleian’s extensive Tolkien collection are rare. Kept in a strongroom with four papyrus scrolls from Herculaneum, the material is tested before and after display and shown in the same womb-like darkness that wraps the Book of Kells in Dublin. Given the importance of preserving the collection, there has been no major exhibition for 26 years. After finishing its run in October, it will travel to New York, then to the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This is the first time the latter will host an exhibition about a foreign author. It is all too easy to believe in the myth of the professor as the one true god of a world he knew in its entirety. The truth, however, is more complex. Tolkien was not always sure of himself. A notebook page reveals that Gandalf once had the Elvish name Bladorthin, meaning grey wanderer. Gandalf, it turns out, was the original name of Thorin Oakenshield. Tolkien flickers between names in the text, as if torn. “He spoke about sub-creation,” McIlwaine says, “and I think this tied into his religious beliefs that all talents and gifts come from God. God is the one creator, and what we do is in imitation of that. Tolkien was a very humble man.” There is abundant evidence of his humility. He was uncertain of his skill as an artist, responsive to criticism, and went out of his way to seek feedback from his friends and children. He could also make the most absent-minded of mistakes – for instance, when he forgot to write his own name on the manuscript title page of The Hobbit. More than 200 items will be on show at the Weston Library, many for the first time – including personal objects donated by the Tolkien family, such as a pipe and a briefcase. Among my favourites is a letter from a fan who has attempted to write a poem in Elvish, which Tolkien has translated and annotated. He was confident enough in his grasp of his world to know when its rules were broken. Rules, after all, are vital in the creation of what he called “secondary belief” in an invented setting – yet he would have been the first to admit that there were uncharted places in Middle-earth. “I don’t desire to go and have afternoons talking Elvish to chaps,” he once said. “Elvish is too complicated. I’ve never finished making it.” Although Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth will be free to attend, this is the first exhibition at the Bodleian to be ticketed. “I think people are going to be surprised,” McIlwaine tells me. “We don’t know what they will bring with them, but I’d like them to leave with the impression of the whole man and his work – not just Tolkien as the maker of Middle-earth, but as a scholar, a young professor, a father of four children.” In this, I believe McIlwaine has succeeded. I am comforted to have glimpsed the man behind the myth, and I am more inspired than ever by the scope of his creation. The final item I admire is a gathering of patterns in black ink, on the back of a meeting agenda. Its title, written in Quenya, is Parma Mittarion, or “book of enterings”. It was probably intended to be a book cover, but what the book was to contain remains a mystery. Long after I leave the exhibition, my imagination runs wild. I ask myself what Tolkien intended for this book, whether he ever wrote it – either in his mind or on lost pages – and what he could have meant by the phrase “light in the eye”, which he tucked among the decoration. I realise I am beginning to write a story between the lines, and that anyone who looks at the page will perhaps do the same. In this way, Middle-earth will live for ever. • Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth is at the Weston Library, Oxford, until 28 October. tolkien.bodleian.ox.ac.uk.

Chances are, you may just gravitate to Provençal rosés, but they are not always the best value. So what are the new rosé rules? And what are those tell-tale indicators of what style of rosé is in a particular bottle? First of all, the colour. Pale rosés generally mean it’s a dry wine, and the nearest rosé gets to a white; darker ones tend to be riper, fruitier and a shade sweeter. Always go for the latest vintage – at the moment, that’s 2017. A few more expensive rosés may still be around from the 2016 vintage, but as a general rule, the fresher and younger the wine, the better. Check the alcohol content, too: quite a lot of these wines come in at less than 12% abv, but with rosé that isn’t necessarily a virtue, and often results in wishy-washy, off-dry wines that don’t have a great deal of character. Where the wine comes from is important, too: southern French and Spanish rosés and rosados are usually dry, while Californian ones are, more often than not, sweetish. Also, watch out for the word “blush” on a label. With the odd exception, such as Sainsbury’s rather appealing Taste the Difference Pinot Grigio Dolomiti Blush 2017 (£7, 12.5%), which tastes like – surprise, surprise, pinot grigio – this word usually indicates a sweeter style, as opposed to gris de gris, which points to a paler, drier rosé. Look out, too, for the grapes the wine is made from: cinsault is the magic variety to look out for, because it contributes a delicious crispness and bite to a blend. You often find white grapes in Provence rosés, too, most often rolle (the local name for vermentino). Rosé made from pinot noir tends, like its red counterparts, to be fruitier. Don’t be seduced by fancy bottles, either. These are especially favoured by producers in Provence, but don’t always go hand in hand with the best wines – you’re probably paying as much for the bottle as for the liquid inside. Magnums, on the other hand, are quite fun, but not the easiest to chill if you’ve a fridgeful of food. That said, the La Terrace Rosé 2017 (13.5%), from the Languedoc, at £20 from Sainsbury’s, is a real invitation to the sun to come out. You can also get it in standard bottles for a tenner. The other thing to bear in mind is that rosés are one of the most heavily discounted wine styles during the summer, so keep your eyes peeled for bargains (there are a couple below).

Make a blackberry or apricot compote instead of the cherry if you prefer – just adjust the sugar accordingly. Sweet cherry and marzipan buns Prep 20 min Rise 2-3 hr Cook 20 min Makes 12 For the dough 300ml whole milk 10g fast-action dried yeast 500g strong white flour 50g caster sugar 1 tsp salt 100g butter, softened For the filling 300g fresh or frozen cherries, halved and stoned 50g caster sugar 1 tbsp lemon juice ½ tbsp cornflour Icing sugar, for dusting 200g marzipan To glaze 20-25ml water 100g icing sugar Gently heat the milk until it is lukewarm. Whisk in the yeast and leave to sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a chance to come to life. Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl, then rub in the butter until no visible flakes of fat are left. Pour in the yeast mixture and work the dough with your hands. Knead for 10 minutes, until smooth, springy and soft. It will be a bit sticky to start with, but it should absorb more water as you work the dough. Put in a clean bowl and cover with clingfilm. Leave to rise for one to two hours, until doubled in size. How long this takes will depend on the temperature of your home (yeast works quicker in warmer temperatures). Meanwhile, mix the cherries, caster sugar and lemon juice in a medium pan over a medium-low heat. Cook, stirring regularly, for five to 10 minutes, or until the cherries have released their juices. Add the cornflour, stir to combine and cook for a couple of minutes to thicken the juices. Decant into a clean bowl and leave to cool. Divide the dough into 12 and shape each piece into a taut ball. Flatten each between your palms and pull it into a concave disc roughly 10cm across and fatter at the edges than in the middle. The hollow at the centre of each bun should be at least 6cm wide. Arrange the buns on two baking trays lined with greaseproof paper, cover loosely with clingfilm and leave to rise for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. While the buns rise, roll the marzipan to 3-4mm thick, using a little icing sugar to stop it sticking to the surface or the rolling pin. Cut out 12 circles with a 6-7cm pastry cutter. Press the circles into the hollows of the risen buns, then divide the cherry mixture between the buns, spooning it on to the marzipan. Bake for 20 minutes, until the buns have risen and are golden. For the glaze, stir the water into the icing sugar to give a smooth, runny icing. Brush it over the edges of the buns as soon as they are out of the oven, then leave to cool completely before tucking in. Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay.

For a child, making sense of what is and isn’t permitted is endlessly perplexing. No surprise then that in at least two of the shows in the Edinburgh international children’s festival, the theme of rules and rule-breaking looms large. “If you follow all the rules, you miss out on all the fun,” says Christine Johnston in the title role of Baba Yaga, a co-production between Scotland’s Imaginate and Australia’s Windmill. With her handbag hat and pompom necklace, she looks like a woman who knows a thing or two about transgression. A kind of Technicolor Cruella de Vil with the added swagger of a drag queen, she has taken residence in an upper storey of Poultry Park apartments and annoyed the neighbours by keeping pets, sticking drawing pins in the walls and playing loud music. To be fair, the neighbours are a nimbyish lot, as poor receptionist Vaselina knows only too well. Played by Shona Reppe in a chrysalis-like silver-grey Parka, she can’t polish her set of Russian dolls, fill in a form or peel a banana without someone complaining about the noise. She’s actually quite the mousy sort, shy and obedient with an ever-tidy desk – which only makes Baba Yaga, who communicates primarily in raucous song, seem all the more extraordinary. The play is an unconventional take on a piece of Slavic folklore, although Baba Yaga’s affinity with nature remains. When the conversation flags, she tends to turn into a bee (splendidly realised in Chris Edser’s animations) and when she nurtures her plants, she whips out two recorders and plays them at once – through her nose. Directed by Rosemary Myers, it is a funny and eccentric barrage of invention, even if the delirious thrill of watching Vaselina on an animated ski slope or the two of them on a trip into space are distractions from uncertainties in the story. We know why Vaselina is fascinated by Baba Yaga, but what are this mysterious creature’s intentions towards the receptionist? Playing to a slightly younger audience, Andy Manley’s Stick By Me is also focused on boundaries, rules and limits. In this wordless one-man show, a masterclass in comic choreography, the rules he establishes in his theatrical game are a metaphor for the rules every four-year-old has to navigate in life. He discovers it is forbidden to step beyond the playing space, yet it seems looking inside the sealed cardboard box is allowed. When he invents his own rules by outlining the shape of a room with masking tape, does he have the right to pass through the invisible walls? Like a modern-day Buster Keaton, almost but not quite in control of his environment, Manley plays with the idea of sticks and stickiness. A routine in which he must maintain contact with his desk (while his chair is surreally sticking to him) morphs into the discovery of new friends in the form of ice-lolly sticks. Just like real friends, they need care and attention and, just like in real life, accidents will happen. Co-created with director Ian Cameron and exquisitely timed to the music of Will Calderbank, this is a joyful and funny show that is also about injury, disability, loss, death, love and friendship. Edinburgh international children’s festival is at various venues until 3 June. Box office: 0131-228 1404. Baba Yaga is showing at the 2019 Adelaide Festival, 27 February – 6 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/30/ceasefire-urged-in-coalitions-climate-and-energy-wars","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T18:00:29Z","webTitle":"Ceasefire urged in Coalition's climate and energy wars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/30/ceasefire-urged-in-coalitions-climate-and-energy-wars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/30/ceasefire-urged-in-coalitions-climate-and-energy-wars","fields":{"headline":"Ceasefire urged in Coalition's climate and energy wars","bodyText":"The emissions reduction target in the national energy guarantee is too low to encourage the development of renewable energy projects on a scale sufficient to drive down power prices as Australia’s ageing coal plants retire, according to the Clean Energy Council. A new report from the council, to be released on Wednesday, says 2017 was a standout year for the renewable energy industry, with the largest domestic rollout of rooftop solar in history, and 16 large-scale renewable energy projects completed, adding 700 megawatts of new generation to the mix. Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday But the CEC’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, is continuing to express concern that there is still no long-term unifying energy or climate policy in place, and says the level of emissions reduction planned under the government’s national energy guarantee “is unlikely to encourage the new renewable energy to continue to drive down power prices as our old coal power plants continue to close”. The council is converging on Canberra this week, as the launch of the report on the state of the renewables sector coincides with another bout of unrest within the Coalition party room over the national energy guarantee. With the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, due to meet his state counterparts in August in an effort to secure their approval for the national energy guarantee, the former prime minister Tony Abbott on Tuesday challenged Frydenberg, arguing that the policy should come back to the Coalition party room for debate before the critical August meeting. Frydenberg rebuffed that push, saying he would bring legislation giving effect to the policy back to the party room after any agreement was struck with the states – without reopening the internal debate the Coalition settled last October. Abbott’s challenge followed a government MP raising concerns about the impact of high power prices on businesses in his electorate. The chair of the backbench committee on environment and energy, Craig Kelly, also declared that the government needed to do more to differentiate its policies from Labor’s. While Thornton says public discussion about the national energy guarantee appears to be moving in a constructive direction, the CEC report notes the history of politics scuttling sensible outcomes and observes that Australia remains a distance short of settling its decade-long climate and energy wars. “Australia’s banks, businesses, major energy institutions and many governments have begun planning for a renewable energy future but there is still no long-term unifying energy or climate policy in place,” the report says. “In June 2017, chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel delivered a suite of 50 recommendations to improve Australia’s energy security, which became known in industry circles as the Finkel report. The government moved quickly to adopt 49 of these, but ultimately voted to reject the primary recommendation – the introduction of a clean energy target to take effect beyond 2020.” The report notes that the clean energy target was backed by the energy sector, the business community, the clean energy industry and federal Labor but it was scuttled because of internal opposition within the Coalition, with “a backbench revolt” killing the Finkel recommendation. Consultations about the national energy guarantee are not yet resolved, it says, noting that state governments have stepped into the breach. “Given the significant uncertainty and relatively low level of ambition on clean energy and emissions reduction from the federal government, many state governments have introduced their own policies and targets. “This will help to secure job and investment benefits from renewable energy projects as well as helping Australia to meet its emission reduction commitments.” The report says there are enough projects in the system to meet the 2020 renewable energy target, which underscores a boom in the sector over the past couple of years. But it points out that the investment boom has followed policy certainty. Investment in renewables stalled when Abbott attempted to wind back the renewable energy target after he won the 2013 election, and rebounded once the ensuing political dispute was settled. The report says that trajectory “shows that long-term bipartisan policy has been critical for investment in the energy sector, and that policy certainty beyond 2020 is becoming increasingly urgent”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/29/italy-political-turmoil-angers-backers-lega-five-star-movement-coalition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T12:00:53Z","webTitle":"'They played us': Italy's political turmoil angers backers of populist coalition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/italy-political-turmoil-angers-backers-lega-five-star-movement-coalition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/29/italy-political-turmoil-angers-backers-lega-five-star-movement-coalition","fields":{"headline":"'They played us': Italy's political turmoil angers backers of populist coalition","bodyText":"Even though Italians are more than used to their government lurching from one turmoil to another, anger is emanating from backers of a short-lived coalition of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League. “Our lives have become a game in the hands of people who have no scruples,” said Marina Mari, who voted for M5S in the 4 March general election that resulted in a hung parliament. “They [the coalition] played us – we understand that now, but we didn’t before.” The coalition – which would have created Italy’s first populist government – ran into a roadblock in its bid for power on Sunday night when the president, Sergio Mattarella, vetoed its pick for economy minister – Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old Eurosceptic also described as “radically anti-German”. While both M5S and the League are traditionally Eurosceptic, their individual and joint programmes called for an exit from neither the European single currency nor the EU. Instead, the coalition’s objective was to seek a renegotiation of European treaties. Giuseppe Conte, the law professor nominated to lead the administration, who resigned on Sunday evening after Mattarella vetoed Savona, had said Italy would remain within the EU. Francesco Giavazzi, an economics professor at Bocconi University in Milan, said that by backing Savona, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, intended to ensure the coalition’s bid for government failed and that fresh elections would be called. “His tactic from day one was to go back to elections. He did it in such a way he knew the president would refuse.” Salvini’s popularity has increased since the March vote, but it remains to be seen if his gamble will pay off. “Salvini is a very good campaigner who has never finished anything in his life,” said Giavazzi. “He knows that if he campaigns, he wins, but if you give him a real job to do it soon becomes clear that he’s unable to do it.” About 57% of Italian voters wanted a government whose programme included generous tax cuts, a universal basic income and a raft of hardline policies against illegal immigrants. After the events of Sunday and Monday, what they have now is another temporary, unelected prime minister who is a europhile. Carlo Cottarelli, a former director at the International Monetary Fund, has been tasked by Mattarella with forming an interim government. His administration is expected to lose a vote of confidence in parliament, meaning new elections could be held as early as September. “We feel conned and trapped – we wanted a revolution,” said Roberto Percuaio, who lives in Orvieto, Umbria, and backed the populist coalition. “What I can’t understand is why Mattarella rejected a government formed by a technocrat [Giuseppe Conte] only to appoint another technocrat the next morning?” The outcome has left others feeling equally baffled, and with little appetite for a fresh vote. “Did they do it on purpose?” asked Federico Badia, an artisan shoemaker in the central Umbria region. “Now I’m starting to think we would be better off without a prime minister – we have the law, the constitution, the country is still working. This could be the next generation of politics – no prime minister.” While most anger seems to be directed at Italy’s political leaders, there are fears that Mattarella’s veto could lead Italians to support any renewed calls for a referendum on the euro. Many blame the currency for a drop in the standard of living since 1999, but most believe the task of extracting the country from it is insurmountable. “The politicians are the ones who are supposed to have the brilliant minds, so it should be their job to find a solution – not to leave the euro but to help make life easier for citizens and to help Italy be more competitive within the eurozone,” said Badia. Europe’s populists, who were quick to hail the electoral triumph of M5S and the far-right League in March as a fresh win for anti-establishment politics and a blow to the European project, have been generally quiet on the parties’ setback. But Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s Front National, took to Twitter to denounce an EU coup. “What is happening in Italy is a coup d’état, a hold-up of the Italian people by illegitimate institutions. Confronted with this denial of democracy, popular anger is mounting across Europe.” The party’s vice-president, Nicola Bay, told French radio that Mattarella had carried out “an institutional coup”. Rather than serving the Italian constitution, he said, the Italian president was “at the service of the EU and the Commission”. Gianluca Arcimboldo, a bookshop owner, said that while many Italians harked back to the golden era of the lira, he believed the country would not be strong economically enough to withstand a euro exit now. Franco Pietrantozzi, a writer, said there was no going back on the euro, but Italians felt a lot of resentment towards the EU because of it. “The problem was entering the euro in the first place. When the monetary change happened the cost of everything went up overnight,” he said. “But our politicians didn’t object to it, they just did it, like sheep.” Giavazzi believes if it came to a vote, a large majority would back staying in the currency. “It’s mostly the older generation who complain about it, the younger ones don’t know any different,” he said. “People aren’t stupid – Italy is a country with a very large amount of private savings and most don’t want to revert to being paid in lira.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/29/carphone-warehouse-shut-stores-profits-mobile-phone","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T13:11:18Z","webTitle":"Carphone Warehouse to shut 92 stores amid profits warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/carphone-warehouse-shut-stores-profits-mobile-phone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/29/carphone-warehouse-shut-stores-profits-mobile-phone","fields":{"headline":"Carphone Warehouse to shut 92 stores amid profits warning","bodyText":"Nearly 100 Carphone Warehouse stores are to close this year as the retailer’s new boss, Alex Baldock, issued a profits warning and pledged to take action to adapt to a changing mobile phone market. Dixons Carphone said it will shut 92 Carphone Warehouse standalone stores this year as it grapples with a shift in consumer habits and rising costs. Analysts suggested more closures could be on the way as Dixons trims back its estate of more than 700 standalone Carphone stores. “There should be some easy wins in terms of making it leaner,” said Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com. Shares in the group, which have already lost 30% of their value in the past year, closed down a further 20% at 185p as it warned profits would fall to £300m, well below City forecasts of £387m for the year to April 2019. In an unscheduled update, the company blamed a shrinking market for electrical goods as well as cost increases from the rise in the legal minimum wage and an increase in the cost of sourcing goods overseas for a squeeze on profit margins. The warning came as Dixons confirmed profits would crash to £382m in the year to April 2018, 24% down on the £501m made a year before. Analysts had been expecting that fall after the company issued a profits warning last summer, blaming the fall in the value of the pound in the wake of Brexit, which has made mobile handsets more expensive while technical innovation has slowed, giving shoppers less reason to update. Hard-pressed consumers are holding on to their phones for longer and going “sim-only”, hitting Dixon’s performance. The group said it was closing stores as it had to become more efficient but said no jobs would be lost as a result of the closures as staff will be offered the chance to move to larger outlets nearby. Baldock, who replaced the longstanding chief executive Seb James earlier this year, said: “Though there’s plenty to fix, it’s all fixable.” He said the business had been too inward looking, short-termist and “easily distracted by dabbling in peripheral opportunity” and was now aiming to improve its main UK businesses, partly by ensuring Carphone Warehouse and the Currys PC World chains worked more closely together. Baldock said the group would also be investing £30m in improving customer service by retraining staff in stores and at its call centres, and would continue its attempt to renegotiate contracts with the mobile networks to reflect the slowdown in phone sales. He said there were no current plans to close Currys PC World stores and a high street presence remained important to the group. “We see stores at the heart of what makes this business distinctive,” he said. He said: “We won’t tolerate our current performance in mobile, or as a group. We know we can do a lot better.” The store closures will add to the pain on the high street after a long list of retailers and restaurant chains have signalled a retreat. Carpetright, New Look, Mothercare, Byron, Jamie’s Italian and others are closing outlets in the face of falling consumer confidence and a shift to buying online. This week alone, House of Fraser, Mothercare and Carluccio’s are expected to reveal further details of closures as part of formal restructuring processes, known as company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), which require approval by creditors including landlords. Revo, which represents retail property companies, has written to the Commons housing, communities and local government select committee warning of the consequences of the trend for CVAs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/29/humpback-whale-trapped-in-netting-off-bondi-beach","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T08:01:37Z","webTitle":"Humpback whale trapped in netting off Bondi beach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/humpback-whale-trapped-in-netting-off-bondi-beach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/29/humpback-whale-trapped-in-netting-off-bondi-beach","fields":{"headline":"Humpback whale trapped in netting off Bondi beach","bodyText":"A 10-metre humpback whale trapped off in netting off Bondi beach in Sydney may have to wait until Wednesday morning to be freed after darkness hampered rescue efforts.

Frydenberg rebuffed a push by the former prime minister Tony Abbott during Tuesday’s Coalition party room meeting for another round of internal consultations about the government’s policy, saying he would bring enabling legislation for approval after the energy ministers signed off on it. The energy minister is due to meet his state and territory counterparts in August in an effort to secure agreement for the national energy guarantee, a policy that will impose reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers from 2020. Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday Abbott took on Frydenberg during a discussion among MPs about the negative political impact of high power prices, demanding to know whether the national energy guarantee was a fait accompli. According to government sources, the New South Wales National Andrew Gee kicked off Tuesday’s conversation by telling colleagues that high power prices were killing businesses in his electorate. Abbott then chimed in, arguing that Frydenberg should bring the national energy guarantee back to the party room for discussion before the critical August meeting, and querying whether emissions reduction under the policy would be linear or backend-loaded in the second half of the decade to 2030. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly – the chair of the backbench committee on environment and energy – has already argued that Frydenberg does not have a complete mandate from the Coalition party room to do a deal with state governments, which is a necessary component of implementing the national energy guarantee. Kelly said in April the party room had not yet agreed to an emissions reduction target for the electricity sector of between 26% and 28% by 2030 – which is a core feature of the policy that the government regards as settled. Also up in the air, according to Kelly, is a regulated level of carbon intensity for the electricity market under the new scheme, and a settled trajectory for any emissions reduction – how fast the mandated pollution cuts are phased in over the decade to 2030. But Frydenberg insists the party room has agreed on all the key principles of the policy, giving him the imprimatur to move forward with the energy ministers’ council and then pursuing the necessary draft legislation once the deal with the states is settled. Only Abbott argued on Tuesday in favour of bringing the policy back for a full discussion. Frydenberg responded to Abbott’s question about the trajectory for emissions reduction by saying it would occur at “least cost” – which some MPs interpreted as meaning the minister would agree to a trajectory which would see emissions reduction backend-loaded to the second half of the decade – the so-called “hockey stick” curve. Sources said the energy minister had also put offsets on the table during Tuesday’s discussion about the reduction trajectory. State governments want Frydenberg to agree to a more ambitious emissions reduction target than the government’s proposal of a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030 but the Coalition’s contested internal dynamic makes that impossible. As well as concern about the low target, some states are also worried about the use of offsets. Frydenberg has flagged that he might allow energy companies to buy offsets to reduce their emissions under the national energy guarantee. There is speculation Frydenberg could take offsets off the table as a sweetener for the states and territories now objecting to the policy on the basis it lacks ambition on emissions reduction, and it doesn’t give jurisdictions credit for the work they are doing under their renewable energy schemes. Frydenberg told colleagues on Tuesday the use of offsets in the scheme was “under consideration”. On the sore point of high prices, the energy minister told colleagues that power prices were already on the way down in Queensland but reductions in the wholesale price of electricity would take longer to flow through to other states, including New South Wales and South Australia, because of hedging in forward contracts in the national energy market. Kelly also contributed during Tuesday’s discussion, raising a Newspoll survey showing that 37% of voters believed the Coalition would deliver a better policy on reducing power prices and energy security than Labor, and 39% thinking Labor had a superior plan. The poll underscores the fact that energy policy in Australia remains polarised, with voters dividing on partisan lines. It said 76% of Coalition voters backed Malcolm Turnbull and Frydenberg to lower power prices and deliver a secure grid, and 73% of Labor voters endorsed the approach from Bill Shorten and the shadow energy minister, Mark Butler. Kelly told colleagues the government was losing the energy argument in the public domain and needed to be more aggressive in countering Labor’s policies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/31/does-trump-really-think-preaching-celibacy-can-beat-hiv","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"Does Trump really think preaching celibacy can beat HIV? | Serra Sippel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/31/does-trump-really-think-preaching-celibacy-can-beat-hiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/31/does-trump-really-think-preaching-celibacy-can-beat-hiv","fields":{"headline":"Does Trump really think preaching celibacy can beat HIV?","bodyText":"It is no secret that the US president’s emergency plan for Aids relief, launched by George Bush in 2003, is one of the most successful public health campaigns in history. Known as Pepfar, it now reaches more than 14 million people with lifesaving HIV treatment. In the past 15 years, it has enabled more than 2.2 million children to be born free from HIV and has reached more than 15.2 million boys and men with voluntary medical circumcisions, a procedure that can prevent new HIV infections. However, Pepfar’s most striking accomplishment is the sharp drop in new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa. In just three years, these infections have declined by between 25% and 40% in nearly two-thirds of districts with the highest HIV prevalence. Success is manifested in Pepfar’s Dreams partnership, a $385m (£290m) commitment to reduce HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. The programme is based on a growing body of evidence that empowering young women through mentoring, confidence-building, job training, making sure they stay in education, and giving them access to comprehensive health information and services can reduce HIV infections. The emphasis on evidence-based prevention addresses the historic failure of Pepfar’s abstinence and fidelity-in-marriage programmes. In its first 12 years, the organisation spent $1.4bn on such projects, but, according to a 2016 Stanford Medical School study, these made no impact on changing sexual behaviour or reducing new HIV infections. Nonetheless, the Trump administration recently came down in favour of “sexual risk avoidance” education. This is nothing more than a rebrand of the abstinence programming that deprives adolescents of education about HIV, sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy. It means they grow up without the knowledge they need and deserve to have safe sex. Marital fidelity programming undermines efforts to end early marriage and often fails to acknowledge relationships among LGBTQ young people, which results in isolation and exclusion. In addition, shrinking budgets make it harder to provide treatment, care and prevention on a global scale. The Trump administration’s budget request for 2019 proposed more than $1bn in cuts to the global Aids response. Pepfar is down by 17% from 2017 levels ($4.65bn to $3.85bn). Support for the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria is down by 31% ($1.35bn to $925.1m). Trump has also reinstated the Mexico City policy, and this time it’s attached to Pepfar funds. Known as the “global gag rule”, the policy prohibits any international organisation from receiving certain categories of US funding if it even discusses abortions with patients. First introduced by Ronald Reagan, the rule has been enforced and rescinded by different administrations since 1984. Despite the fact that George W Bush exempted Pepfar from the global gag rule after reinstating it, evidence shows that the policy curtailed community-based outreach services such as condom distribution and HIV testing. Trump made no such exemptions, and expanded the policy to all global health assistance, an unprecedented move that affects 15 times more funding. One year later, its devastating impacts are apparent. Earlier this year, I was in Mozambique, a country with a high HIV prevalence, and I saw the immediate damage of the policy on Pepfar-funded programmes. Rural communities have been cut off from access to health services, clinics have been forced to lay off nurses and activistas (community outreach workers), and HIV prevention programming for young people has abruptly ended. For a country like Mozambique that has decriminalised abortion and built on that momentum to address other local public health issues like HIV and Aids, Trump’s global gag rule halts progress in providing care to communities across the country. Saving lives cannot become a relic of the past. Favouring ideology over science is careless, short-sighted and extravagantly wasteful. Fifteen years of data collection speaks for itself – the key to success is the marriage of scientific research and rights-based health policy. Now, more than ever, these principles and policies must prevail.

His admission came just weeks after the 2018 prize was called off in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct, financial malpractice and repeated leaks. On 4 May, the Swedish Academy – which decides on the winner of the world’s top literary award – announced that it would not be handing out a Nobel prize for literature in 2018, after a series of allegations of sexual harassment and abuse were made against the husband of academy member Katarina Frostenson. The way the academy handled the allegations, which have been denied by Frostenson’s husband, the photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, led to several resignations, leaving it with just 10 active members – with 12 required to elect new ones. In order to “commit time to recovering public confidence”, the academy said that it would instead create two laureates in 2019. While the Nobel Foundation – which is responsible for the fulfilment of Alfred Nobel’s will – has supported this decision, the executive director of the foundation, Lars Heikensten, has cast some doubt over the academy’s ability to have its house in order soon enough. On the prize’s website, he said: “The Swedish Academy’s goal is to make its decision on the 2018 Nobel prize in literature and to announce it together with the 2019 prize. We hope that this will be the case, but it depends on the Swedish Academy restoring its trust.” Heikensten was clear that the academy needed to cultivate a more open approach in order to do this. The way the jury decides on the winner has long been a closely guarded secret, with archives only opened 50 years after a decision is made. “The Swedish Academy must be able to report what concrete measures are being taken and should get outside help in order to solve their problems,” said Heikensten. “Among other things, they need to reassess compliance with their confidentiality and conflict-of-interest rules. “The academy has cultivated a closed culture over a long period of time. This was likely to be challenged at one time or another … I believe that in the end something good will come out of this situation, even if that of course has not been the feeling during recent weeks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/30/domestic-abusers-still-able-to-cross-examine-victims-in-court","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T23:01:37Z","webTitle":"Domestic abusers still able to cross-examine victims in court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/30/domestic-abusers-still-able-to-cross-examine-victims-in-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/30/domestic-abusers-still-able-to-cross-examine-victims-in-court","fields":{"headline":"Domestic abusers still able to cross-examine victims in court","bodyText":"Victims of domestic violence continue to be cross-examined by their abusers in family courts more than a year after the government promised to stop such ordeals, a report has found. Children’s lives were being put at risk because victims were not being given safe or fair hearings, according to the study by Women’s Aid and Queen Mary University of London. Survivors reported they were repeatedly not believed, blamed for experiencing abuse, and seen as unstable by judges, barristers and Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service) officers. One woman said her abusive ex-partner was able to cross-examine her about her sexual history during child contact proceedings. Almost a quarter of survivors (24%) surveyed said they had been cross-examined by their abusive ex-partner. Three in five (61%) said there was no special protection, such as separate waiting rooms, different entry/exit times, screens or video links, despite the domestic abuse allegations. More than two thirds (69%) reported their abusive ex-partner had also been emotionally abusive towards a child, while 38% said children had been physically abused. Nonetheless, unsupervised contact with an abusive parent was the most frequent outcome in cases sampled by the report. The extent to which women were being harassed in secretive court hearings was revealed in a Guardian report in 2016 featuring research by Women’s Aid. It triggered a debate that eventually led to the then justice secretary, Liz Truss, pledging in February 2017 to ban the “humiliating and appalling” practice. Women’s Aid is calling for the government to commission an independent inquiry into the family courts to tackle the failings. Shazia Choudhry, a professor of law at Queen Mary, said: “There is evidence of the family courts failing in their responsibility to prevent and investigate acts of violence towards these survivors, and facilitating or failing to challenge a climate of gender discrimination within the courtroom. The findings of this research are deeply concerning and require urgent attention from both the judiciary and the legal profession.” Katie Ghose, the chief executive of Women’s Aid, said the government urgently needed to meet its commitment to ban the practice. “For far too long, survivors have endured continued abuse at the hands of their abuser in the family courts,” she said. “Enough is enough. We want to see the family courts protect survivors during the court process and ensure that survivors are able to access their right to a fair and just legal process. “We know that perpetrators of domestic abuse are using the family courts to continue to control and abuse victims, and that the family courts’ failure to consistently safeguard survivors and apply fairness during the court process is enabling that abuse.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We will legislate to ban the unacceptable practice of abusers cross-examining their victims in the family court as soon as possible. The law is clear that the child’s welfare is paramount, and it is for judges to determine what is best for the child after careful consideration of the facts in each case.” Victims’ views ‘The judge allowed him to be abusive’ Catherine (not her real name) said she was shocked at being questioned by her ex-partner, against whom she had a restraining order. “I felt so ill having to sit there and go through it,” she recalled. “He was following his own agenda and asking me about previous boyfriends and my sex life – things that were completely irrelevant to what we were discussing. Half of what he was asking me he should never have been able to inquire about but the judge was telling me to answer. “The district judge allowed him to be very abusive. He called my barrister a ‘slag’. I think the judge had become desensitised and was used to the abuse. “The final result was indirect contact because my child didn’t want to go to him. I’m still living in fear that he will find me one day. I have had to move homes at great expense. “I heard recently that he had attacked his current girlfriend. This cross-examination is still going on in the family courts. It would never happen in the criminal courts. It beggars belief. It’s absolutely horrendous.” ‘He believed he could still control me’ Claire Throssell, 46, lost both her sons, Jack and Paul, when her ex-husband set fire to their home and killed himself during an unsupervised visit after their marriage ended. Beforehand she had to go to court to resolve contact issues. “When I was in court he was allowed to hurl insults,” she said. “He called me all the names under the sun and the judge allowed this to happen. “I had a solicitor representing me. My ex-husband didn’t. He was aggressive, believing he could still control me and that it was his right. It’s a really traumatic experience: you are fighting to get your children’s voices heard. “As it stands now, there are women in refuges and there’s nothing to stop a perpetrator following them from court back to the refuge. “I think it’s a question of cost. It’s even harder for families to get access to legal aid now. They should have separate waiting rooms so that the victim and perpetrator don’t have to sit outside the courtroom in the same small space. “I’m still getting people contacting me saying they are having horrific experiences in court. Things have to change. “I lost my sons three and a half years ago. Jack’s voice was never heard in court. He would have said he didn’t want contact with his father. It all starts in the family court and they are not getting it right.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/29/us-eavesdropping-base-in-yorkshire-flouting-uk-law-menwith-hill","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T13:00:23Z","webTitle":"US eavesdropping base in Yorkshire flouting UK law, claims group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/us-eavesdropping-base-in-yorkshire-flouting-uk-law-menwith-hill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/29/us-eavesdropping-base-in-yorkshire-flouting-uk-law-menwith-hill","fields":{"headline":"US eavesdropping base in Yorkshire flouting UK law, claims group","bodyText":"The information commissioner is to launch an investigation after a complaint by a campaign group that forces at the US’s largest eavesdropping centre in Britain are breaking the law. Reprieve said US forces at Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire were failing to comply with the provisions of the UK Data Protection Act by collecting and processing personal data without registering with the information watchdog. Drawing on reports about how US surveillance operations identified targets for drone strikes, the charity said personnel at the base operated programmes that monitored and located communications, including mobile phone calls and wifi traffic. In a letter to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), Reprieve detailed the experience of the al-Manthari family in Yemen, who were caught up in a March 2018 US drone strike. While the US claimed the strike had killed members of al-Qaida, Reprieve alleges that its investigations revealed all the victims were civilians. “We write to ask you to investigate this as a matter of urgency, given that individuals’ lives may be at stake,” Reprieve said in its letter to the ICO. An ICO spokesperson said: “We will consider the complaint but it will be important to establish the arrangements the UK government has made with other sovereign states for operating out of bases in the UK and the applicability of UK law to their activities on that base.” Jennifer Gibson, who leads Reprieve’s investigations into the use of drones and other forms of lethal force outside of war zones, said: “The government guarantees us that US activities at RAF Menwith Hill are carried out with their knowledge and consent. “Yet the Trump administration is openly flouting UK law by not registering with the Information Commissioner’s Office. That they feel they can ignore such a basic requirement raises the question of what other British laws they are breaking.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: “RAF Menwith Hill is part of a worldwide US defence communications network, with the base supporting a variety of communications activity. “US forces maintain robust civilian and military cooperation with the United Kingdom and manage all base activities in accordance with the agreements made between the United States and Her Majesty’s government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/29/footballer-raheem-sterling-defends-gun-tattoo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T09:25:26Z","webTitle":"FA backs Raheem Sterling after criticism over gun tattoo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/29/footballer-raheem-sterling-defends-gun-tattoo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/29/footballer-raheem-sterling-defends-gun-tattoo","fields":{"headline":"FA backs Raheem Sterling after criticism over gun tattoo","bodyText":"The Football Association has defended the England forward Raheem Sterling over a tattoo of a gun on his right leg, praising his “honest and heartfelt” explanation for the choice after he faced severe criticism in the tabloid press. Sterling had posted a picture of himself on Instagram training with his England team-mates at St George’s Park, with a tattoo of an M16 assault rifle visible on his right calf. The Sun put the image on its front page on Tuesday, with the headline: “Raheem shoots himself in the foot”. Lucy Cope, who founded Mothers Against Guns after her son Damian was shot dead outside a club in central London in 2002, told the newspaper the tattoo was “totally unacceptable”. “We demand he has the tattoo lasered off or covered up with a different tattoo,” she said. “If he refuses he should be dropped from the England team. He’s supposed to be a role model but chooses to glamorise guns.” But Sterling explained the tattoo’s significance in his Instagram post. “When I was two my father died from being gunned down to death,” the 23-year-old said. “I made a promise to myself I would never touch a gun in my life time, I shoot with my right foot so it has a deeper meaning.” He said the tattoo had not yet been finished. On Tuesday afternoon the FA backed Sterling. “We all support Raheem Sterling and acknowledge the honest and heartfelt account he gave via Instagram last night,” a spokesperson said. “He and the rest of the squad are focused solely on preparing for the forthcoming World Cup.” Some have questioned the motives behind the criticism, which follows numerous negative stories about the player over the years. In 2015, the Daily Mirror accused him of being “greedy” in pay negotiations. He has also been criticised for taking nitrous oxide. In 2016 The Sun ran a story headlined “Obscene Raheem” accusing him of enraging fans by showing off his “blinging” house on social media. Sterling later said that he had bought the house for his mother, who raised him and his two sisters alone after the death of his father. The poet and columnist Musa Okwonga said the Sun and the Daily Mail “seem to take it almost in turns to go after Raheem Sterling, apparently for no reason other than he is black and successful”. In a thread on Twitter, Okwonga said Sterling received a “routine hounding” from the newspapers. Former England player Gary Lineker described his treatment as “disgusting” and said that attempts to “destroy our players” ahead of major tournaments were uniquely British and “weird, unpatriotic and sad”. Others suggested class could be a factor, with Adam Payne, political reporter at Business Insider UK, saying that Wayne Rooney had received similar treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/29/belgium-parents-mawda-shawri-girl-killed-police-right-to-stay","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T13:01:47Z","webTitle":"Belgians' anger grows over status of parents of girl killed by police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/belgium-parents-mawda-shawri-girl-killed-police-right-to-stay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/29/belgium-parents-mawda-shawri-girl-killed-police-right-to-stay","fields":{"headline":"Belgians' anger grows over status of parents of girl killed by police","bodyText":"Belgium’s failure to offer the parents of a two-year-old girl shot dead by police the right to stay in the country has been described as “unbearable” by a former prime minister as anger grows over the case. The funeral of Mawda Shawri, an Iraqi Kurd killed two weeks ago as she sat on her mother’s lap in the front seat of a Peugeot van carrying 26 adults and four children, is due to take place on Wednesday. The vehicle in which she was travelling was being driven by suspected people-smugglers at 55mph (89km/h) during a 37-mile chase near Belgium’s border with France. Police initially, and falsely, denied an officer had been responsible for the shooting. The Belgian government has not clarified how long the grieving parents may stay in the country, beyond saying it is a “very difficult decision”, but they will not be removed while an investigation into police conduct is undertaken. In recent days Bart De Wever, the leader of the nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), which is part of Belgium’s governing coalition led by the prime minister, Charles Michel, blamed Mawda’s parents for her death. He said they had previously travelled illegally through Germany and the UK. “Speaking of these people as mere victims, I do not think that is correct,” De Wever said. The former prime minister Elio Di Rupo, who is now the mayor of Mons, a city near the site of the shooting, said: “Bart De Wever spoke as we know. He said that parents were not only victims but they are responsible for the death of their child. “They are words of terrible inhumanity. They are pretty ignoble. Bart De Wever dishonours us. Whether one is Flemish, Walloon or Brussels, one bows to the death of a child and one brings all possible support to his parents. This is a Kurdish family escaping terror.” Speaking to the Belgian daily newspaper Le Soir, he said: “As a former prime minister, I can assure you that, in the face of a tragedy like this, I would have immediately granted a renewable five-year residence permit to the family, to allow them to mourn and to recover. “The circumstances are exceptional, the answer must be too. Parliament is the guardian and architect of the rule of law. Charles Michel can go to parliament, but he does not dare because there is the N-VA.” This week Mawda’s parents, Shamdine and Ako, who also have a three-year-old son, gave an account of the events that led to their daughter’s death. They said the van was chased by four police vehicles – one on either side and two behind – and the shot came from the car to the left of the van. Although officers tried to treat the child, who had been shot in the cheek, it was said to have been some time before she was taken to hospital."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/03/sweet-turns-sour-queensland-split-sugar-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T02:30:34Z","webTitle":"When the sweet turns sour: Queensland split between sugar and solar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/03/sweet-turns-sour-queensland-split-sugar-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/03/sweet-turns-sour-queensland-split-sugar-solar","fields":{"headline":"When the sweet turns sour: Queensland split between sugar and solar","bodyText":"Colin Ash has spent a working lifetime in the cane fields near the Pioneer River in central Queensland, out past Marian, where the mill has processed sugar for more than 130 years. “You can’t get sentimental about things,” he says from the front seat of his truck as he drives slowly around the boundary of his property. “You’ve got to pay your bills.” Almost two years ago Ash agreed to allow a solar energy company, Esco Pacific, to lease 169 hectares – about half his land – to build a solar farm of about 180,000 panels. The scenario is increasingly common as renewables projects spread across the sunshine state, in some cases swallowing large parcels of productive agricultural land. Clean energy offers billions in potential investment and thousands of jobs for regional Queensland. But it also faces on-the-ground challenges, including turf wars with intensive farming that threaten to hamper the energy sector’s transition. Ash’s decision to offer up part of his Mirani property for solar has made him something of a divisive figure locally. Two fellow growers objected, as did the company that buys and refines his cane, Mackay Sugar. Mackay regional council, whose planning officers had backed the project, voted to reject the application. Legal action is afoot. Whenever he’s asked about the state of the sugar industry or the challenges faced by cane growers, Ash just makes a downward motion with his arm. He wanders around his block, pointing to patches of standover cane – left unharvested from the previous season – where solar panels will ultimately be placed. He says part of the field to be given to the solar company was planted with cane just four years ago. “If I had my time over again I wouldn’t have planted it, the way the industry has gone,” Ash says. “When [the solar plan] come around, the way the industry was going, it was going backwards and it was one way of diversifying into something that’s friendly, it’s not going to do harm. “And if it doesn’t work, well, they’ll reinstate the ground back to how it was. You’re not putting it under cement or doing that sort of thing.” ‘It’s a very sunny place’ Modelling released by the Climate Institute last year showed Queensland had the potential to power 4m homes through renewable energy projects and create more than 7,000 jobs over the next decade, many of them in north and central Queensland where many local economies are struggling with high unemployment and the hit-and-miss legacies of mining and gas booms. The number of jobs on offer is considerably more than at Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, a project touted by many in these parts as an economic saviour. Andrew Stock, an energy expert and councillor for the Climate Council, says about $1.6bn of renewable investment is being built in Queensland. “Obviously ... it’s a very sunny place so solar projects both large and small, are very well suited to Queensland and north Queensland,” he says. “The amount of energy they can generate ... is among the highest output of any solar farms in Australia.” The clean energy regulator says the government’s 2020 renewable energy target has effectively been met by projects either built or under construction. Incentives have led to an industry boom but there is a danger it will shift to bust without changes to policy settings and planning regulations that could threaten the pace of the renewable transition. Stock says the federal government’s national energy guarantee is “woefully inadequate” and will bring forward no new renewable energy capacity over the next decade. “If electricity demand doesn’t grow, and no existing coal plants shut, the modelling by the energy security board last year shows there are virtually no new renewables ... that need to be built,” he says. “And that’s potentially a problem for renewables, that pipeline of investment projects, probably between $7bn to $10bn worth of investment, many thousands of jobs ... and that’s all put at risk because under the Neg, the emissions reduction requirements mean that there’s virtually no new renewable capacity that’s needed.” From overhead, the cane fields are a mesmerising combination of bright green and right angles, stretching for country miles. About 300km to the north of Mirani, near the banks of the Burdekin River, patterned rows of black panels suddenly consume the landscape. The Clare solar farm is the state’s largest, and last month was connected to the energy grid. In 2015 it caused angst among cane growers and was subject to a legal challenge led by the local milling company, Wilmar, until being “called in” by the state government, a process that overrides local planners on matters of state significance. The same conflict between sugar and solar has been repeated at Mirani, and will be again. “The Queensland government has a very strong policy of supporting solar renewables in general,” says Georgina Davis, senior policy adviser for the Queensland Farmers’ Federation. “They didn’t make provision to plan where they would go. They’ve let that be a market-driven process. “It’s just been an unfortunate sort of effect that some of those sites have been on [good quality] agricultural land. Their primary focus is looking for a piece of land that has a willing seller or a willing renter, and that has the access to infrastructure they need.” Solar projects are more efficient, and more profitable, the closer they are built to existing substations, which means proponents have targeted certain blocks. The Australian Energy Market Operator issues ratings called “marginal loss factors” which score renewable projects based on local demand and effectively determine how much energy that project can feed into the grid. “The adoption and interest in large-scale solar has been so quick, and it has had to be quick,” Davis says. “A lot of them have been in a rush to get these facilities up compared to their competitors ... Once that capacity is gone, it’s gone.” Although the operation of the energy market has exacerbated land-use conflicts, planning policies also lack consistency when it comes to land disputes between agriculture and renewables. The Queensland state planning policy lists enabling renewable energy projects as a priority. It also aims to minimise “encroachment on agricultural resources to ensure viable tracts of agricultural land are maintained”. The farmers’ federation and the farm lobby group AgForce have called for a solar code that provides protection for high-quality land and establishes rehabilitation bonds, similar to those for mining tenements. Graziers are worried about the effect of power lines connecting some facilities, and farmers are in some cases uncomfortable that they are close to projects. ‘The industry has got a lot to prove yet’ The Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, says his council would have supported a solar farm proposal had it been on “rubbish land” but state policies required it to consider the agricultural impacts. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s the one that’s being contested now or not,” he says. “If it’s growing 9,000 to 10,000 tonne of cane a year and it [is good quality agricultural land], we’re obliged to consider that. And really nothing else trumps it.” Even if state government policy did not mandate the consideration of agricultural land, the council’s priority is sugar, rather than solar, Williamson says. The council has “nothing against solar” and considered building its own solar farm, but found ultimately it would not produce savings to justify the investment. Instead, the region is putting panels at individual council sites. “We don’t want a future for our industry to be less cane farms and to grow solar panels,” he says. “We want more sugar to be produced. We want to grow more sugar for the right outcomes.” Stock says communities such as Mackay, which is a hub for the Bowen basin’s coalmines, should be among the first to embrace the opportunities provided by renewables. They should “start to plan that transition in an orderly way so they don’t end up being faced with really quite dramatic shocks to regional employment when mines close”. Williamson, who argues that Australia should have invested in new coal-fired power stations, bristles at that suggestion. “Well, mate, hang on,” he says. “Queensland generates 14.8 gigawatts of power to run every day and less than 5% has been generated by solar. The industry has got a lot to prove yet. “From a council perspective, we have an industry [sugar] that produces $400m to $500m a year for our valley, for our region ... It is not fair to level at council a head-in-the-sand attitude about renewable energy ... when we have a vested interest in protecting an industry that provides millions and millions of dollars to this district.” For Colin Ash, that same industry, the one he’s worked in for a lifetime, is getting to the point where he’s struggling to make ends meet. Like many other growers he has everything – his income, and his ability to fund his retirement – invested in the land. “It’s not a goldmine what they’re offering [for the solar development],” he says. “When this come along, that was one way of putting a bit of a buffer in there, without the cost of diversifying into something else. “It was clean, green, and no trouble to go back to any other agriculture afterwards if it doesn’t work. “You just can’t get sentimental about these things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/19/its-exhilarating-japans-female-sumo-wrestlers-take-on-sexism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T00:04:29Z","webTitle":"'It's exhilarating': Japan's female sumo wrestlers take on sexism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/its-exhilarating-japans-female-sumo-wrestlers-take-on-sexism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/its-exhilarating-japans-female-sumo-wrestlers-take-on-sexism","fields":{"headline":"'It's exhilarating': Japan's female sumo wrestlers take on sexism","bodyText":"It isn’t hard to see why Chisaki Okumura is one of Japan’s best female sumo wrestlers. Combining her considerable height and heft with flashes of speed, her practice bouts end with a succession of opponents thrown to the ground or shoved unceremoniously out of the ring. On a humid, wet afternoon in central Japan, Okumura draws on her reserves of strength for a final, punishing series of drills with a male opponent. By the end, it is hard to tell who is more exhausted. For more than two hours every weekday afternoon, the 17 men and nine women of Asahi University’s sumo club stretch, warm up and perform drills together, although for safety reasons they conduct full-on bouts separately. Training is centered on two dohyo – a dirt-covered 4.55m diameter circle marked out with half-buried rice-straw bales - which are among the few places where female sumo wrestlers are defying the centuries-old sport’s uneasy relationship with gender. As amateurs, the women athletes at Asahi and other universities are not bound by the ancient traditions governing professional sumo - in which only men can compete. But that might not be the case for much longer. Many hope the ban on women joining the professional sumo ranks will one day be overturned, proving that deep-seated misogyny has no place in a sport striving to be accepted as an Olympic event. In April, not long after professional sumo was rocked again by allegations of bullying and violence, an incident at an exhibition tournament in Maizuru, near Kyoto, triggered a new campaign to rid Japan’s de facto national sport of its sexist traditions. The row was triggered by after several women, including at least one nurse, rushed on to the ring to administer first aid to the local mayor, who had collapsed after suffering a stroke. Using the public address system, the referee repeatedly ordered them to leave the ring, but the women refused. Officials sprinkled “purifying” salt on the wrestling surface after they had left. Sumo officials later denied that this had been done because of the women’s presence in the ring. Salt is customarily scattered on the ring before bouts and after a wrestler has been injured. The impromptu first responders had fallen foul of an ancient rule banning women from entering, or even touching, the dohyo. The rule has prevented local female politicians from presenting awards inside the ring. The Maizuru incident not only embarrassed sumo but was also seen as a metaphor for the treatment of women in Japan, which performs poorly in global tables of gender equality and female political representation. ‘Sumo is for everyone’ Tomoko Nakagawa, the mayor of Takarazuka in western Japan, has unsuccessfully petitioned the Japan sumo association to lift the ban. “I can’t understand why it is only the sumo world that refuses to change or is even going backwards,” she told Agence France-Presse. The sport’s struggle with sexism is equally baffling to Okumura, who has been wrestling since she was at middle school. “Sumo shouldn’t be thought of as a sport for men and women, it’s for everyone,” says Okumura, runner-up in last month’s international women’s sumo invitational championships in the 64-80kg category. “I definitely benefit from being able to train with the men, and I don’t get the impression that they’re looking down on me and the other women. If I were allowed to compete against them in a proper bout I think I could hold my own.” The Asahi club was formed eight years ago and is now one of about half a dozen women’s sumo clubs at Japanese universities. The female members use the same number of kimarite – or winning moves – as the men, but wear their mawashi belts over shorts and T-shirts. “There are some people who still struggle to accept the idea of women’s sumo, but I’ve never thought it was at all unusual,” says Shigeto Takahashi, the club’s manager, who has been coaching female wrestlers for 35 years. “The only real difference is that the women have to be a little more careful about injuring their shoulders, but they’re not allowed to wear any padding.” Kaori Matsui, an associate professor in the university’s department of health and sports sciences, and the club’s deputy manager, said it was natural for women to compete in sumo, having already broken down barriers in other contact sports such as wrestling and judo. The number of new women taking up amateur sumo is static, however, a problem she blames on the dearth of female coaches to offer guidance to girls and young women. “Some people I meet are amazed that there is even an international women’s sumo scene,” she says. “There needs to be a more coordinated approach to promoting the brilliance of women’s sumo. When you watch it close up, it’s exhilarating.” While weary wrestlers gulp down cups of cold tea from a copper kettle, Minayo Nishimoto shows few signs of fatigue - unsurprising, perhaps, for a woman who has been hurling her comparatively slight frame around sumo rings since she was nine years old. “I understand that the dohyo is regarded as sacred, but whichever way you look at it, the ban on women is sexist,” says Nishimoto, who prides herself on her uwatenage overarm throw. “But that just makes me all the more determined to carry on and be the best female wrestler in Japan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/29/pret-a-manger-sold-jab-holdings-krispy-kreme-sandwich-shop","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T13:14:15Z","webTitle":"All 12,000 Pret a Manger staff to get £1,000 each as chain is sold for £1.5bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/pret-a-manger-sold-jab-holdings-krispy-kreme-sandwich-shop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/29/pret-a-manger-sold-jab-holdings-krispy-kreme-sandwich-shop","fields":{"headline":"All 12,000 Pret a Manger staff to get £1,000 each as chain is sold for £1.5bn","bodyText":"Every one of Pret a Manger’s 12,000 employees is to be gifted a £1,000 payout to thank them for their hard work as the popular sandwich shop chain is sold to a family of secretive German billionaires for £1.5bn. Lidia-Alexandra Sipos, a team leader at a Pret shop in central London, was too busy making lattes and helping prepare chicken and avocado sandwiches on Tuesday morning to have noticed a tweet from Pret’s chief executive Clive Schlee revealing the windfall. Schlee had tweeted that Pret had been sold by its British private equity owners Bridgepoint to JAB Holdings, a Luxembourg-based investment fund belonging to Germany’s hugely wealthy Reimann family. Brothers Wolfgang, Stefan, Renate and Matthias, descendants of the founder of what would become consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser, are estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth just over $4bn (£3bn) each. “Today is a big day for @Pret,” Schlee said. “As we welcome JAB, we’ll be thanking the people who really matter by giving each of our 12,000 employees £1,000 when the deal completes.” Sipos had no idea that the company she has worked for since 2016 had been sold. Neither had any of her colleagues, who when told were excited at the prospect of coming into a windfall, but didn’t expect much about their day-to-day lives to change as Pret’s ownership switches from an office block in Marylebone to one near Luxembourg airport. “I had no idea at all, no one did, we’re all so busy in the morning,” Sipos said. “To be honest, I have no idea who owns the company, and don’t expect anything to change for us.” Sipos, who started work at Pret two weeks after arriving in the UK from Romania in 2016, refused to believe that Pret’s staff would really receive the £1,000 each until shown Schlee’s tweet. She then said she would save most of her £1,000 windfall – after buying a gift for her mother. “She helped me so much to get here, and I want to give her something special to say thank-you,” Sipos said. “Pret really does look after you,” she said. “I quit in December to try and get an office management job, but I study two days a week and it’s hard to get a job that lets you do that. “So Pret helped me come back in February, and I can study management at college on Tuesdays and Thursday,” she said. “And it pays better than receptionist work.” Sipos said she gets paid £9.70 an hour with a £1-an-hour bonus if the store passes regular mystery shopper tests. Her colleague Fatu, who is from Guinea in west Africa and has worked at Pret for five years, was also incredulous that staff would receive the £1,000 bonus. “What? Why? Why would you give us £1,000 each?” Schlee later expanded on his earlier tweet to confirm that the £1,000 bonus would be paid to all employees who are on the payroll during the week the deal completes, adding: “It’s serendipity for those who have just joined.” Even employees joining Pret between now and when the deal is official late in the summer will collect the £1,000. It should help with recruitment, which Schlee has complained has become tough since Brexit. The chain, which draws a large proportion of staff from the European Union, told parliament last year that just one in 50 job applicants were British because Britons did not view its shops as a “desirable place to work”. The sale will also mark a lucrative payday for Bridgepoint, which bought the chain for £364m in 2008. William Jackson, chairman of Pret and managing director of Bridgepoint , said the chain “has a unique culture and is a great British success story”. Jackson said he would continue to pick up Pret’s porridge pots for breakfast and his favourite hoisin duck wraps for lunch. The chain opened with a single shop, near Victoria station, in central London in July 1986. It was started by entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe and his university friend Sinclair Beecham. They bought the brand out of the liquidation of Pret’s first incarnation in Hampstead a few years earlier. There are now 530 Pret shops in the UK, 92 in the US, 26 in Hong Kong, 24 in France, two in Dubai and Denmark, and one in each Singapore and the Netherlands. Metcalfe shared in a £50m payday when a third of the business was sold to McDonald’s in 2001. It is thought that Metcalfe sold almost all his remaining stake in Pret in 2008 when it was bought by Bridgepoint. The company declined to comment on Metcalfe’s current involvement. Metcalfe went on to create Metcalfe’s skinny popcorn, which was sold to crisps giant Kettle Foods in 2016, and Asian-inspired restaurant chain Itsu, in which Pret’s boss Schlee is a big private investor. The Reimann’s JAB has been on a global acquisition spree, buying up coffee, tea and snacks brands including Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Douwe Egberts and Tassimo coffee, American bakery giant Panera Bread and Dr Pepper Snapple. It also owns speciality brands including San Francisco’s Peet’s Coffee and Might Leaf Tea, Chicago’s Intelligentsia Coffee &amp; Tea and Oregon’s Stumptown Coffee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/may/28/a-worrying-lack-of-pastoral-care-for-russell-group-undergraduates","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T16:04:59Z","webTitle":"A worrying lack of pastoral care for Russell Group undergraduates | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/28/a-worrying-lack-of-pastoral-care-for-russell-group-undergraduates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/28/a-worrying-lack-of-pastoral-care-for-russell-group-undergraduates","fields":{"headline":"A worrying lack of pastoral care for Russell Group undergraduates","bodyText":"Thirty-eight years ago I left a Russell Group university, where I met my tutor regularly, had seminars four times a week and was known by the teaching staff. As one of a very few students from a comprehensive school background, this made the experience manageable. Now my son attends the same university and I can concur with the “institutional indifference” identified at Bristol University (Growing concern and anger after student suicides, 26 May). He recently told us he had attended hardly any lectures this year and has not met his personal tutor in a year and a half. This triggered no pastoral measures to indicate he was floundering in a system that gives students no structures, and only corrals them in for end of year exams. His previous educational experience was in a nurturing east London comprehensive and FE college where he gained three As at A-level. This contrasts with my experience of the University of East London, which is 115th on the Guardian league table. Their target group is mature and harder-to-reach students, and as such they put pastoral work at the heart of everything they do. As a teacher, I know the message is filtering down to working-class students that university is not worth £50,000-plus worth of debt on graduation, the distinct possibility of no graduate dividend and the harm to your mental health. Simon Shaw Redbridge Teachers Association vice-president • I read your article on student suicides at Bristol University with concern and thought it worth sharing the very recent experience of my daughter in her final year at another Russell Group university priding itself on its pastoral care. It’s hard to imagine a move more guaranteed to skyrocket student stress than bringing forward the last final-year exam by half of its original timescale, yet this happened in my daughter’s case, from 5 June to 17 May, with three weeks’ notice. Despite following the available channels to get the original date restored, there was no willingness to consider this, nor any recognition of any impact on the students’ wellbeing and the potential consequences, only a rigid insistence that correct procedure was being followed in line with official policy: “(a) that the dates of individual papers are subject to change and are not guaranteed in any way; (b) that the university will accept no responsibility for any personal arrangements any student may make on the basis of the provisional dates.” Equivalent to a fireguard manufacturer disclaiming that “not catching fire is not guaranteed in any way, nor any personal impact from combustion”. Hard to imagine a more thoroughly determined hand-washing of a university’s duty of care for its students than this. So far the students seem to have kept their heads above water, but things could have gone very differently. The university needs to address a potentially fatal disconnect between its wellbeing position and actual ways of working.

Attractions include a maritime museum telling the story of warships built for Nelson’s navy and other moments in seafaring history, from the sinking of SS Persia by a German U-boat to Sir Francis Chichester’s circumnavigation of the globe in Gipsy Moth IV. Costumed volunteers are on hand to answer questions and enthuse children with, say, a game of coits or explain how families lived in the Shipwright’s Cottage. In summer hop on a boat for a cruise up the river (extra charge). Fun fact The saying “money for old rope” comes from sailors selling old ships’ ropes for oakum (used to waterproof ships) and therefore getting something for nothing. Best thing about it The setting is lovely, two rows of well-preserved red-brick workers’ cottages – separated by an immaculate lawn – lead down to the water’s edge where boats glide past. Many family attractions are an assault on the senses (and the wallet) with their high-tech wizardry and high-octane activities but Buckler’s Hard offers a gentler day out. What about lunch? We arrived hungry and made a beeline for the Captain’s Cabin Tea Rooms, which had very few options. We had homemade but not very nice soup with a roll (£4.50), so doughy my son made bullet-like balls out of it. I wish we’d held out for the Yachtsman Bar and Garden, part of the on-site Master Builder’s hotel. Exit through the gift shop? The shop shares space with the tearoom and has a focus on twee homeware: lots of sailing or shell-related objets, plus cushions, mugs and kitchen signs – most of them emblazoned with “witty” phrases. There is little to tempt small beady eyes. The shop in the museum has toys and maritime-related books. Getting there Take the M27, exit at junction 2 and follow the tourist signs towards nearby Beaulieu motor museum – from there Buckler’s Hard is signposted. Train to Brockenhurst then taxi – or hire a bike and cycle the eight miles through the New Forest. Value for money? Yes. The amount of time you take will likely depend on the weather. On a sunny day you could easily spend an afternoon for a reasonable £6.90 (adult), £4.70 (child 5-16) or £19.70 (family) – all online prices. An annual pass is £12.50 for an adult or £33 for a family and allows unlimited free visits. Opening hours 10am-5pm every day, except Christmas Day Verdict 8/10. At its peak, Buckler’s Hard would have been noisy, crowded and smelly. Now it’s a calm backwater – in a good way. • bucklershard.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/28/mutiny-festival-drugs-supply-three-men-arrested","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T17:03:47Z","webTitle":"Concerns raised over festival water supplies after drug deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/mutiny-festival-drugs-supply-three-men-arrested","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/mutiny-festival-drugs-supply-three-men-arrested","fields":{"headline":"Concerns raised over festival water supplies after drug deaths","bodyText":"Concerns have been raised about access to free drinking water at Mutiny festival this weekend after the death of two people believed to have taken high-strength ecstasy pills. People who attended the event in Portsmouth on Saturday alleged on social media that there was a lack of drinking water after 4pm, when they claimed some of the taps stopped working properly and large queues built up. The festival’s organisers vehemently denied access to water was limited and said the 21 taps were working at all times. Ecstasy use can lead to overheating and dehydration. The NHS advises that drinking too little can be dangerous, but also that too much fluid can affect the brain, as ecstasy tends to make the body retain fluid. The festival was cancelled on Sunday after the deaths of Georgia Jones, 18, and Tommy Cowan, 20, who also went by the name Tommy Bakeer and had a young son. Both were believed to be in reaction to drugs, Queen Alexandra hospital said. Another person was in a critical condition. Jones’s mother, Janine Milburn, said in a Facebook post that the teenager had a fit after her temperature rose significantly because of two pills she had taken. Cowan’s father, Damian, told how he had sat by his son in hospital. “I held his hand and he died. So I guess he wasn’t alone,” he told the BBC. “It’s no good saying ‘don’t do drugs’, all I can say is ‘take this on board, look what’s happened, if you want to end up that way, carry on’. If you don’t, don’t even think about it.” In a statement, Jones’s family said: “Georgia was a very strong-willed and opinionated young lady. She was a shoulder for anyone that needed it. “She loved her job working with people with learning and physical difficulties. We just hope she uses her ‘indoor voice’ wherever she may be.” On Monday, police said three people had been arrested overnight on suspicion of involvement in the supply of class A drugs at the festival. A 20-year-old man from Havant, a 20-year-old man from Waterlooville and a 22-year-old man from Cosham were arrested overnight on Sunday. They were in police custody on Monday. At least 12 other people at the festival were admitted to the hospital in Portsmouth on Saturday night, although it noted that not all admissions were necessarily drug-related. Festival organisers issued a statement warning of a “dangerous high-strength or bad-batch substance on site”. Fiona Measham, a director of the drug-testing charity The Loop, said dozens of people had contacted her expressing their concern about the availability of water at the festival. “[People] were contacting us to say there was a real problem accessing water and that the pumps were not working properly and water was dripping out. There were big queues around the pump and also people queueing in the sun to get in [to the festival],” she said. The terms and conditions on the festival website stipulated that attendees could only bring in 500ml water bottles with them. “There is a bigger learning point here about what festivals can do to make sure people have more access to water,” Measham said. “Why are they restricting access to how much water you can bring on site in first place? I don’t think there should be restrictions on that.” She said Mutiny festival was not unusual in this approach and “all festivals should have better water provision”. Cavan Homewood, 19, from Redhill, who attended Mutiny with a group of four friends, said: “The festival setup [for water] worked nicely up until about 4pm and the pressure at the water stations dropped out, so you had to sit there and keep pressing the tap for five minutes to fill up a bottle, and the queues were huge and lots of people were put off by that.” He said some stalls selling water ran out. “I had no option but to stand in the sun and wait 10 minutes to fill up a water bottle,” Homewood added. Another festivalgoer, Thomas Blain, 17, said: “The event organisers had proposed a rule banning opened bottles of water, and limiting individuals to one bottle each, but of course everyone in that queue had to drink the little water they had taken, meaning no one had any water once inside. Prices to buy water were extortionate, with places charging £2.50/£3.50 per bottle. “No re-entry into the festival meant if you had no money, you had no water. I asked at the bar for tap water, but they refused.” Organisers said they had monitored the free water areas to ensure there were no long queues. “In addition to the taps, free water was available at the medical and welfare facilities, and free water was handed out by security for those in the pit at the front of the stages,” they said. Tributes were paid to the two people who died. Cowan’s friend Ollie Joell told the Guardian: “I don’t really know how to put into words what’s happened. It hasn’t really sunk in. To be at the festival and see Tommy go downhill, and have him be taken to an ambulance, even then I never thought I’d lose him.” Damian Cowan had told the Portsmouth newspaper the News: “He was funny. He loved life and he loved his little boy. He was everything. He was a good lad – unfortunately he made a bad choice.” In her Facebook tribute, Milburn described her daughter as “full of life”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/29/labour-mps-fear-brexit-voters-unfounded-study","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Labour MPs' fear of Brexit voters could be unfounded, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/29/labour-mps-fear-brexit-voters-unfounded-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/29/labour-mps-fear-brexit-voters-unfounded-study","fields":{"headline":"Labour MPs' fear of Brexit voters could be unfounded, study says","bodyText":"The number of Labour leave voters in each constituency could be lower than previously thought, suggesting MPs in pro-Brexit seats who fear being punished at the ballot box unless they adopt a hardline stance could be worrying unnecessarily, a campaign group has said. In a study of all 650 UK parliamentary seats, the pro-remain group Best for Britain found numerous examples of Labour-held constituencies where remain supporters outnumber the MP’s majority. The group has briefed many MPs on its findings in the hope of emboldening Labour politicians who had been reluctant to push the party leadership to support staying in the European Economic Area because of constituents’ views. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has ruled out supporting a Norway-style close relationship with the EU, although his deputy, Tom Watson, hinted at the weekend that a policy shift to back EEA membership could still be on the table. Seven in 10 Labour-held constituencies voted to leave the EU and a recent meeting of the parliamentary Labour party was dominated by a bitter row over the single market, with MPs in pro-Brexit seats warning that supporting it would damage their electoral chances. However, the research suggested there were “only a handful” of seats where more Labour voters backed leave than remain, and that many of these would support the party at a general election irrespective of its position on Brexit. The study, which used YouGov data, showed that key members of Corbyn’s inner circle were among those MPs who could benefit from an “electoral dividend” if the party softened its position on Brexit. They included the shadow cabinet ministers Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery. Trickett’s Hemsworth seat in West Yorkshire voted by 68.1% to leave the EU at the 2016 referendum. However, the YouGov data shows that of those who voted in the 2017 election, 11,037 were Labour remainers, greater than the shadow cabinet minister’s 10,174 majority. More Labour voters in the constituency backed remain than leave. Lavery’s Wansbeck constituency in Northumberland backed Brexit with a 56.2% vote, yet the Labour remain tally was 12,392, greater than the Labour party chairman’s 10,435 majority. In 2017, 51% of Labour voters in the election had backed remain at the referendum, while 32% supported leave. An insider at Best for Britain said: “These are both seats where the MP has the ear of Jeremy Corbyn. In each, the MP’s position is better than previously thought. If you’re saying that about Wansbeck and Hemsworth, then you can also say it about a couple of hundred other Labour-held seats with the same dynamic.” These could include Don Valley, where the Labour MP Caroline Flint campaigned for remain but has subsequently warned the party not to try to “wriggle out” of the referendum result. Her constituency voted leave by 68.6%, but the Labour remain vote in 2017 was, at 10,371, substantially larger than her 5,169 majority. Best for Britain, which was set up by the pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, also held focus groups that suggested Labour leave voters would vote for a Labour government even if its position on Brexit – which is currently to stay in a customs union – did change. The data, which cost tens of thousands of pounds to produce, also suggests many Conservative MPs have more Tory remain voters than previously thought, potentially bringing some of these seats into play for Labour. The Tory Brexiter Stuart Andrew, for example, has a majority of just 331 in Pudsey in West Yorkshire. However, 6,903 Tory voters in 2017 were backers of remain. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith also has more Tory remainers in his Chingford and Woodford Green seat than his 2,438 majority. Best for Britain also believes the research might “stiffen the resolve” of remain-supporting Tory MPs to consider their options when the House of Commons votes on Brexit in the next two weeks. The research highlights the chances of a Labour “decapitation strategy” against Boris Johnson, whose majority in Uxbridge and South Ruislip halved at the last election to 5,034. The Tory remain vote there stood at 5,444 in 2017. It showed that Theresa May has the second highest Tory remain vote in the country in Maidenhead, with 14,452 of her backers also voting to stay in the EU. Eloise Todd, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said: “This is the first batch of a massive research project that we have undertaken. What this shows is that there is an electoral dividend for Labour in many seats if they move position and oppose Brexit.

I went in there once, just to see him standing behind the bar. It was both impressive and a little disturbing, like watching a monkey smoke a pipe. A year later, on his 19th birthday, I am trying to find a present for him at a French airport. Celebrations are being delayed until my arrival home, unless a local air traffic controllers’ strike foils my plans. In the end, my flight is only 40 minutes late and I am back by lunchtime. “Happy birthday,” I say, handing the youngest one an unwrapped package. “Thanks,” he says. “Olympique Marseille underpants,” I say. “It’s what everyone’s wearing.” My wife informs me that lunch has been pushed back to late afternoon, when the middle one is due to arrive home from university. The oldest one is not available – he’s working – but his friend, Gabe, who has flown over from the States to sit an exam, is presently studying at our kitchen table. “Then we’re all going to the pub,” my wife says. “His pub?” I say. “It’s what he wants,” she says. Gabe’s industry shames me into going out to my office to catch up on some work. When the middle one comes out to find me an hour later, I am fast asleep in my chair. It’s nearly 5pm when we set off for the pub in a straggly procession, with the dog on a lead and Gabe standing in for the oldest one. I am the last one through the pub’s door, so I am still outside when an enormous cheer goes up. Inside, the bar staff have their hands in the air. “Happy birthday!” one shouts. “Twelve at last!” The youngest one smiles and shakes his head at the floor. Customers call his name. A waiter hugs him. A head in a hat pops out from the kitchen door. “How does it feel to be 14?” it asks. “It’s great,” the youngest says. “Can we start a tab?” We eat outside under an umbrella, the dog cowering under the table, while the youngest one explains the logistics of the pub’s new pink gin promotion. He has to break off from the disquisition frequently to acknowledge greetings from arriving staff, departing clientele, even passersby. People stop to offer to buy him a drink, or to insist that he buy them one. It is strange to think of my youngest son being so well known in this place where I know no one, so embedded in this neighbourhood that I haunt like a spectre. Gabe fills in for the oldest one admirably by starting a debate that soon has the other two bickering. Within minutes, they are shouting over one another. “Nicely,” my wife says. A man, evidently a regular, pulls off his motorcycle helmet, walks up to our table and looks us over. “The whole family?” he says to the youngest. “It’s my birthday,” the youngest one replies. “Your birthday?” the man says. “What are you, nine?” Afterwards, my wife insists that we go across the tracks to the funfair in the park. She offers to pay for us all to go on some kind of whirligig while she stands by with the dog and laughs at our misfortune. “Are you kidding?” I say. “I just ate.” Gabe also declines, but she manages to coerce the other two into a car, having already paid the attendant for it. As the ride starts, they look supremely awkward, then a little alarmed. At top speed, it goes a lot faster than I imagined it would. I watch the pair of them go round side by side, 19 and 20 years old, their knuckles white as they grip the safety bar, laughing and turning green on alternate rotations. I try to take a picture with my phone, but the whole thing is just a blur."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/may/28/students-are-at-breaking-point-in-a-broken-system","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T16:10:33Z","webTitle":"Students are at breaking point in a broken system | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/28/students-are-at-breaking-point-in-a-broken-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/28/students-are-at-breaking-point-in-a-broken-system","fields":{"headline":"Students are at breaking point in a broken system","bodyText":"I too have a daughter who, though creative and gifted, cannot do squiggles on paper, has spent 12 years of her life learning that she’s “thick” and “useless” and is about to sit – and likely fail – her GCSE maths for the third time (GCSEs are failing stress test as students suffer, Letters, 22 May). I also had a mother who was president of the Mathematical Association and brought the International Mathematical Olympiad to Britain, and a sister who sat on Tony Blair’s Tomlinson commission, which recommended a much broader mix of academic and vocational skills for all children – and was promptly ignored. My mother, a great teacher, always said there was no point in forcing children who struggle with maths to do it, and always began her classes with an example from their own lives which made it “relatable”. Twenty years ago, we were told vocational courses were old hat and what we needed were “knowledge workers” who could sit at screens and process information. Today, all that “knowledge work” is about to be taken away by computers, and the jobs crying out to be filled are for plumbers, electricians, engineers and other skilled trades: the things hardest to automate. And what are we being sold meanwhile? “Flexibility”, which is another word for “unskilled”. If you need to be “flexible” because “who knows what the future will bring?”, what point is there in acquiring any expertise? Yet another generation of rudderless, vulnerable young people prevented from exercising their abilities by yet another generation of recklessly irresponsible politicians in thrall to ideology. I’m glad my mum’s not alive to see what her granddaughter and her peers are put through. Sheila Hayman Director’s fellow, MIT Media Lab • As the Guardian letters page on 22 May made clear, year 11 students are suffering high levels of crippling stress, something I see each week in my work as a school counsellor. While the new arrangements that have emerged from the accountability regime cannot be defended and clearly need urgent attention, counselling can provide an effective way to work with the most overstressed students. It is, therefore, surprising that the recent phase two report of the Care Quality Commission’s children and young persons’ mental health review, published in March, makes little reference to the part that school-based counselling may play in helping students. A trained counsellor in every English secondary school would be a welcome starting point in tackling the current mental health crisis in young people. Stephen J Decker Chartered psychologist, Chelmsford • Your front-page report on depression risk for bright girls and girls from poor families (19 May) made painful reading. I study all too many such articles since my son took his own life last year. He was a second year student of maths and philosophy, a high achiever with all A*s at A-level and on course for a first at a Russell Group university. The causes seem to be financial hardship and pressure at school. This is evident at my children’s school, once a relaxed environment with excellent pastoral care, but now short of funds. It is brimming with information on exams, work experience and internships, as our children are shoehorned into an ever more exacting exam system and culture. They are referred to as students from a young age – where has their childhood gone? With such a strong emphasis on hard work, they can arrive at university with a neurotic need to spend more time than is healthy in the library to get that essential first-class degree. Universities are struggling with an epidemic of anxious students taking antidepressants and requiring counselling services. If girls are more at risk at school, young men are more at risk when they get to university, presumably because girls mature earlier than boys, but they face the same social, academic and financial pressures. I live in a small, affluent town of just under 10,000 people and I know too many bereaved parents like myself. We are mourning a young schoolgirl in her early teens and two male university students, from one school and in a two-year time frame. We don’t need to fund more studies, we need to address the pressures at school and university, urgently. Name and address supplied • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Increased use of drones, in sectors from construction or defence to energy or logistics, will employ hundreds of thousands of people and lift GDP by almost 2%, according to a report by accountants PwC. While pilots and police have often viewed drones as a problem, the report predicts 76,000 unmanned aerial vehicles will be in UK skies by the end of the next decade for commercial or public use, saving billions in efficiencies. It says many existing jobs will go, with drones able to quickly map, inspect or transport in places that are difficult for people to reach. Drones are likely to replace posts from stock controllers to helicopter pilots as they allow speedier visual access of everything from giant warehouses to power lines. Already used widely in utilities to inspect infrastructure, drones are likely to replace expensive helicopter use in land surveys, the report says, while oil rig inspections have become safer and cheaper using the devices. Remote crop spraying could extend in agriculture to drone monitoring with thermal cameras, to give more data on plant health and irrigation than is visible to the human eye. PwC predicts cost savings of £16bn annually through their use and estimates that in the long run there will be 628,000 people working in the drone economy, potentially in more highly skilled jobs overall, including building and programming the devices. Elaine Whyte, of PwC, said: “Drones have the potential to offer a powerful new perspective for businesses across a variety of industries, delivering both productivity benefits and increased value from the data they collect. “I envisage that the advantages of drone technology will be well established within the decade – not only for business purposes but also for helping to protect our society, for example, through being used by the emergency services. There is a need for current UK drone regulation to advance to see the estimations in our report become a reality but it’s positive to see the government already taking proactive steps to address this with the draft drones bill.” The draft bill was due to be published this spring. The government said it would pave the way for drone use in business or public service but also help police crack down on their misuse after concerns about privacy and safety, particularly for planes. Last week pilots and air traffic controllers issued new guidelines on drones to their members in response to a growing risk that they said regulation was so far failing to address. Many thousands have been sold for leisure users and pilots have reported dozens of near collisions around airports. In 2017 there were 92 official reports of incidents involving drones and planes, with some near misses on large passenger jets, which the pilots union Balpa said had the potential to cause catastrophic accidents. Whyte conceded that drones were still often seen as toys, adding: “The immediate focus must be on developing society’s confidence in the technology to help drive acceptance and increase adoption. There is a huge opportunity to help solve some of business and society’s most important problems.” The aviation minister Baroness Sugg said drones would bring significant economic benefits and the government was attempting to harness their potential through its industrial strategy. She added: “They are already improving people’s lives – helping the emergency services and keeping key national infrastructure like rail lines and power stations safe. Excitingly this is just the beginning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/28/stockport-man-hit-by-car-dies-salisbury-club-brinnington","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T20:58:11Z","webTitle":"Murder inquiry begins after man hit by car and killed in Stockport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/stockport-man-hit-by-car-dies-salisbury-club-brinnington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/stockport-man-hit-by-car-dies-salisbury-club-brinnington","fields":{"headline":"Murder inquiry begins after man hit by car and killed in Stockport","bodyText":"A murder investigation has been launched after a man died and several people were injured when a car collided with pedestrians outside a bar in Stockport.

London’s publicly owned transport operator is bidding to take control of the Argentinian capital’s metro system, the Guardian has learned, in what would be the first time in recent years TfL has expanded overseas. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, is understood to have raised the potential bid with Argentinian officials during a recent tour of South America, where he promised to seek post-Brexit trade deals. Under the proposal, TfL would use its expertise to help install a management team to run the Buenos Aires network, with staff potentially drawn from the existing London network. The news that the publicly owned TfL could export its rail expertise comes as British commuters struggle with the botched implementation of a new timetable for privately run rail services across large parts of the country. In London commuters have experienced widespread cancellations on Thameslink services, which are not controlled by TfL. The Buenos Aires contract is potentially worth about $3.5bn (£2.6bn) over 10 years, with TfL in line for about a quarter of that sum. TfL is bidding as part of a consortium that includes the French business Keolis and the Argentinian Corporación América conglomerate. The final bid is due to be submitted within the next few weeks, with the TfL consortium facing competition from the Paris Métro and the local Argentinian provider. Many UK railway franchises are ultimately controlled by foreign nationalised railway companies, leading to regular complaints that British commuters are subsidising commuters in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. If TfL’s bid for the Argentinian contract is successful it would represent a rare case of money flowing back from overseas into a publicly owned UK transport organisation. TfL faces a funding squeeze after losing its £700m central government grant, lower-than-expected passenger numbers, and the decision of the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to impose a fare freeze during his first four-year term. As a result, Khan has ordered the creation of Transport for London Consulting, building on a manifesto commitment made during his 2016 election campaign. The new organisation has a brief to pitch for work around the world and reinvest profits in London’s transport network. The organisation says any overseas work will not interfere with its domestic operations. TfL announced last week it has hired Helen Murphy to run its new consultancy arm and she is due to take up the job next month. The transport organisation has also signed a deal with a third-party consulting group to license its contactless ticketing system to other metros such as Sydney. A TfL spokesperson said: “We are examining a wide range of options to generate additional commercial income to invest in running and modernising transport in London. This potentially includes helping with the operation of transport infrastructure on behalf of other cities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/28/spider-man-of-paris-to-get-french-citizenship-after-rescuing-child","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:09:54Z","webTitle":"'Spider-Man' of Paris to get French citizenship after child rescue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/spider-man-of-paris-to-get-french-citizenship-after-rescuing-child","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/28/spider-man-of-paris-to-get-french-citizenship-after-rescuing-child","fields":{"headline":"'Spider-Man' of Paris to get French citizenship after child rescue","bodyText":"As an undocumented migrant in France, Mamoudou Gassama knew it was best to keep his head down, to not draw attention to himself. But when he spotted a young child dangling from the balcony of a fourth-floor Paris flat he felt he had to act. In that split second, Gassama, 22, did not think of himself or the threat of discovery and deportation back to Mali. Instead, in an extraordinary feat of strength and bravery that has earned him the nickname “Le Spider-Man”, he pulled himself up from balcony to balcony, before lifting the crying four-year-old to safety. It later emerged the child had already dropped one floor before he was spotted dangling from the railings. On Monday, after the video footage went viral and Gassama was hailed a hero, attention quickly turned to his status as one of the country’s many migrants sans papiers (without papers), who have no official access to housing or jobs, and no right to remain in France. Far from being thrown out of France, however, Gassama found himself sitting with President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace. He was promised documents allowing him to stay, and a fast-track process to gain French nationality. He was also offered a job with the Paris sapeurs pompiers, the city’s fire and emergency service. Macron gave Gassama a medal for an act of “bravery and devotion”, signed by the police prefect and declaring the French Republic’s gratitude. Filmed in the gilded reception room of the palace, Gassama hesitantly described seeing the child hanging on to the balcony railing at around 8pm on Saturday when he was on his way out. He had acted “without thinking”, he said. “There were people shouting and honking their horns … I didn’t think of anything, I ran across the road directly to save him. Thank God I saved him.” He said he only realised what he had done after he hauled the child to safety. “My legs went wobbly when I got inside the flat,” he said. “Bravo,” Macron replied. Gassama, who has nine brothers and sisters, told BFM TV that when he had the child in his arms he asked “why did you do that?”. But the child did not say anything. Gassama said he only fully realised what he had done when he was in the apartment, looking down. Gassama was accompanied to the palace by his brother Diaby. Asked if he had anything to say to the president, Gassama seemed overwhelmed, so Diaby replied: “We want to be officialised. We have no papers but we want them so we can work in good conditions and we need homes.” Diaby said his brother was living in temporary housing. “It’s a bad situation but we live with it. We will take the opportunity to ask [the president] for this.” Afterwards, faced with a barrage of television cameras and journalists, Gassama seemed lost for words. “He gave me a present,” he said of Macron. “It’s the first time I’ve had anything like this. I’m very happy.” Macron tweeted that in recognition of Gassama’s “heroic act”, his status in France would be made official with a carte de séjour (residency card) “as quickly as possible”. The president also invited Gassama – who has been living without official papers in Paris since he arrived from Mali in September – to put in a request for naturalisation. The interior minister, Gérard Collomb, confirmed that he would personally ensure Gassama’s request would be accepted. The government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux tweeted: “This act of immense bravery, faithful to the values of solidarity of our republic, should open the door to him to our national community.” The city’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, and her deputies vowed to help the young man in his attempts to remain in France. In the footage recorded from the street, a man and woman in the neighbouring flat can be seen spotting the boy from their balcony. The man grabs the child’s right arm but appears unable to pull him to safety because of a dividing wall between the balconies. Gassama said he asked the child how he came to be hanging from the balcony in the 18th arrondissement in the north of Paris. “He didn’t answer. I asked where his mother was and he said she had gone to a party,” he told journalists. The father of the child was detained overnight for alleged parental neglect, and is to appear in court in September. Police said the child’s mother was not in Paris at the time of the incident and the boy was now in the care of social services. On Monday, the deputy president of the far-right Front National, Nicolas Bay, sounded a more cynical note about Gassama’s residency status. “If you tell me, we’ll make that one official because of his act of bravery and we’ll expel all the others’, I’ll sign up to that,” Bay told France 2 television. Only a handful of undocumented migrants have their status regularised in France for acts of public service or “exceptional talent”. In 2015, Lassana Bathily, also from Mali, was given asylum after helping hostages taken by the terrorist Amedy Coulibaly at the Hyper-Cacher supermarket, and assisting police and special forces to end the siege. The French documentary maker and commentator Raphaël Glucksmann wrote on his Facebook page: “Like everyone else, I admire the bravery of Mamoudou Gassama. But I dream of a country where it won’t be necessary to put one’s own life at risk scaling a building to save the life of a child in order to be treated like a human being when one is a migrant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/28/boris-johnson-hobbled-by-lack-of-foreign-office-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T10:11:39Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson 'hobbled by lack of Foreign Office power'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/28/boris-johnson-hobbled-by-lack-of-foreign-office-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/28/boris-johnson-hobbled-by-lack-of-foreign-office-power","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson 'hobbled by lack of Foreign Office power'","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has been “hobbled” as foreign secretary partly by a Whitehall refusal to make the Foreign Office a strategic department spanning diplomacy, trade and overseas development, according to the chair of the foreign affairs select committee. Tom Tugendhat suggests that bringing trade, intelligence and overseas development issues under the control of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) would provide better coordination to meet the challenges of the post-Brexit era. In a speech on Tuesday to the Rusi defence thinktank, Tugendhat says his proposals will require a revolution at the heart of government. After the EU referendum, the FCO was dismembered, with the responsibility for Brexit negotiations going to the new Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU). Tugendhat argues that this shift led to a further power grab by the Cabinet Office, taking key Brexit talks closer to the prime minister. At the same time, responsibility for trade negotiations was handed to a self-standing department, diminishing the Foreign Office’s clout in the commercial area of foreign relations. In his speech, Tugendhat will say: “Successive foreign secretaries – including the current one – have been hobbled. They’ve had the title, but they haven’t had the power.” The Foreign Office “has lost control of key aspects of overseas influence, like trade and development, and has been obliged to take part in a tug-of-war with the Cabinet Office over anything that involved national security and the EU. This has created silos in our foreign policy, reducing our ability to balance across areas of influence. “The success or failure of our foreign policy is now more important to the future health and prosperity of our nation than it has been at any time since the end of the second world war. We need to make the Foreign Office the strategic engine of our foreign policy again.” Tugendhat, seen as a possible future Conservative party leader, has used his status as the foreign affairs committee chair before to criticise the Foreign Office’s lack of strategic direction, claiming the phrase “global Britain” used by Johnson to explain his vision of UK influence was little more than superficial branding. There is also frustration in the Foreign Office that Johnson’s preoccupation with the Tory leadership means he spends more time positioning himself in relation to Theresa May, and Brexit, instead of developing a coherent stance towards Europe, China and Russia. Tugendhat will argue that “insight, influence, trade, alliances and force” are the five UK strengths that must be balanced, and call on the government to bring them together under the Foreign Office. Tugendhadt argues that “Diplomacy can only go so far with decisions about aid trade and defence taken elsewhere”, adding “the foreign office should be given strategic oversight of a budget of perhaps even up to 5 % of GDP to cover the needs of all the related departments”. But he stresses that although the foreign office would be adopting a new coordinating role as the strategic engine of foreign policy, this would not entail the abolition of DFID, or the ministry of defence saying they each had a technical expertise that required a separate reporting role to the cabinet. The diplomatic service has long been jealous of the large budget available to the Department for International Development. In conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office has been surreptitiously clawing back some of the DfID budget. Control over parts of the overseas development budget has been handed to other departments to use through new spending streams, such as the Conflict and Stabilisation Fund, or the Prosperity Fund. There has also been a rise in the number of ministers working in DfID and the Foreign Office. The international development select committee is due to publish a report that criticises the lack of accountability of the funds, and questioning whether the money is being spent on overseas aid as defined by international rules. The Foreign Office expects the DExEU, headed by David Davis, to fold back into its remit again at some point. Some inside the Foreign Office argue this should happen next year, if and when Britain legally leaves the EU, and the union regards the UK as a third party. Others claim the bulk of the detailed negotiations over trade, security and foreign policy will remain to be sorted after March 2019, meaning Davis’s department will need to remain in place at least until the end of the transition period, which could extend beyond 2021. There are also growing doubts about the extent to which Liam Fox’s trade department will have a worthwhile role, especially if, as seems increasingly likely, the UK remains in some form of customs union with a common external tariff. Depending on the attitude of the EU and the terms of the final deal, a close EU-UK customs union would restrict the department’s ability to negotiate bilateral trade deals outside the EU, making the department largely redundant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/28/the-hour-we-knew-nothing-of-each-other-edinburgh-lyceum-peter-handke","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T11:22:43Z","webTitle":"'Gloriously risky': Edinburgh residents play 450 characters in wordless play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/28/the-hour-we-knew-nothing-of-each-other-edinburgh-lyceum-peter-handke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/28/the-hour-we-knew-nothing-of-each-other-edinburgh-lyceum-peter-handke","fields":{"headline":"'Gloriously risky': Edinburgh residents play 450 characters in wordless play","bodyText":"An exuberant jogger crosses paths with a weeping woman; a defeated football fan stumbles around a champagne-quaffing toff; lovers embrace as a blind-folded prisoner is dragged towards execution. In The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other, Austrian playwright Peter Handke offers a vivid and sometimes troubling people’s pageant in his famously wordless script that describes 450 different characters as they pass through an ordinary town square. Later this week, the Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh twists the human kaleidoscope even further by staging the play for what they believe is the first time entirely using volunteers, in a production that certainly boasts the largest cast that the venue has ever hosted. It is, explains movement director Janice Parker, a “gloriously risky” project, to invite nearly 100 non-professionals, the majority of whom have never stood on a stage before, to perform a notoriously abstract and challenging work – not least in the mammoth practicalities of fitting such large numbers into the wings at the same time while complying with health and safety regulations. The guiding principle of the production has been access. Potential cast members were not auditioned, but invited to taster sessions; if they concluded that the project was for them and could commit the required rehearsal time on Friday evenings and Saturdays, they were in. The key to managing the biggest team she has ever worked with, says co-director and Lyceum associate Wils Wilson, has been preparation. She brandishes a script in which every cast member’s name and photograph is attached to notes on their interests, skills and allotted parts. Every single entrance has been numbered and linked to accompanying costumes and props. The feat of choreography and coordination is evident in rehearsal, as individuals criss-cross the stage at different speeds, performing separate mimes, or get drawn into mini-dramas as they go, amazingly never once banging into each other. Some characters are instantly recognisable – Charlie Chaplin twirls his cane and a sprinkling of mythological creatures add a surreal tone to proceedings – while others are more quotidian, leaving it open to the audience to write their own stories around each appearance. As a movement specialist, Parker is used to working without words, but Handke’s script offers roles and actions for each character. “Actors always want to know, ‘But why am I doing that?’ and here I can say, ‘Stick to the task’. Not having words to learn frees the body so much: they are doing, often things that they do every day.” The sense of collective endeavour is powerful among cast members too: David Hunter, a 58-year-old NHS practice manager, is a regular visitor to the Lyceum and suffered a serious brain injury last year that affected his mobility and speech. “From a personal point of view, it’s been a tremendous experience,” he says. “Everyone has been so supportive, especially helping me work on the movement and coordination.” The production marks the end of David Greig’s second season as Lyceum artistic director, but was the first pitch that he made to the Lyceum board, he explains. The use of a community cast bookends with his autumn 2016 debut, his own updating of Aeschylus’s 2,500-year-old tragedy about a refugee crisis, The Suppliant Women, which similarly used local volunteers to carry the work. The Hour took longer to come together, says Greig: “The logistics are hard because of the sheer scale.” “Since [the initial pitch], we’ve had Brexit, Trump, Scotland in an ongoing fractious state, and this play reminds us of the ordinary miracle that we mostly run along together.” The play, he believes, says that we must “take care of this fragile rubbing-along, that we mustn’t take it for granted”. While the human panorama offers moments of great humour and tenderness, others are more disturbing, hinting at the darkness stalking the edges of the ordinary. Greig notes that the play was written in 1992, in the political context of the Yugoslav wars. “Also Handke was exploring the public space as a place of dream and imagination and surprise,” he adds, “and I want the Lyceum to be an engine of civic energy and transformation.” The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other is at the Lyceum, Edinburgh, 31 May–2 June.

At the stroke of midnight here, on the evening of 29 March 2019, one of those fluttering flags will be lowered. My view of Jean-Claude Juncker’s hideous Berlaymont building will be a little less cluttered, and Britain will no longer be a member of the European Union. I arrived in Brussels nearly 18 months ago as the newspaper’s bureau chief, from where I’ve had the mixed blessing of watching close up the twists, turns and positively cringeworthy contortions on display in the Brexit talks. Whether an arch-Remoaner or a fervent hardline Brexiter, most followers of the process would agree that the UK’s extraction from Brussels is proving to be a singularly painful exercise. It is akin to a high-stakes poker game in which one player is always bluffing, is well known to be doing so, and is therefore, rather unsurprisingly, repeatedly exposed. The process is unlikely to become any more comfortable for the UK as we approach the formal withdrawal date, before entering and leaving a 21-month (or longer!) period of transition as a rule-taker, and then launching into a potentially endless argument, debate and deliberation about whether it was all worth it, and what to do now with our hard-fought freedom and global reach. If some in the Conservative party think that leaving the EU will put an end to its own internal agony over Britain’s place in Europe, I fear they will be deeply disappointed. As some people say in Switzerland, negotiations with the EU, once started, never truly come to an end. But let’s start at the beginning. I came to Brussels from the Palace of Westminster, where I was the Observer’s policy editor, again with a close-up view of something pretty unpalatable. The result of the referendum on EU membership, 52% to 48% in favour of Brexit, triggered an immediate earthquake in British politics. But, in terms of the British government actually engaging with the EU on its Brexit, there was really very little going on by the time I arrived in the Belgian capital. Historians call the first few months of the second world war the “phoney war”, such was the lack of actual action in the early stages. And so it was here. Under the so-called article 50 process, designed by the British diplomat Lord Kerr in the event of a member state asking to leave, the British prime minister needed to hand in a letter of notification for a two-year negotiation period on the terms of Britain’s withdrawal to begin. There is a lot of talk today about May’s lack of foresight in triggering those talks without having prepared a plan for the future. At the time, though, there was simply a lot of griping that it was taking so long to put in the letter and get the thing going. Nine months had passed before Sir Tim Barrow, Britain’s ambassador to the EU, handed it to Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, during which time the EU had refused to talk with Whitehall about Brexit, beyond a few logistical discussions. It was clear from there that these talks were going to be on the EU’s terms. So the great letter-giving was the point at which the proper talks, and reporting on them, could get going? No. Far from it. The prime minister, in her wisdom, called a general election a few weeks later. That announcement was certainly a shock in Britain, but in Brussels, it was welcome. Juncker, the president of the European commission, had even taken time out to privately lobby May in favour of calling it. For all of May’s election-campaign talk about Brussels loving the idea of a weak prime minister to exploit, in reality they wanted a strong one who could face down the Brexiters. Democratically enhanced, she could be open with the British public about the trade-offs and compromises that would be required. At the time the greatest fear in Brussels was that the divorce bill (initially resisted, later settled at £39bn) would be used by some in the party to push the UK to walk out of the negotiations, prompting the hardest of all Brexits. Of course, once again neither May nor Brussels got what they wanted from the British voting public. But neither, it turns out, has it been the divorce bill that has injected the greatest drama and danger into the talks. Of all the surprise bumps in the road, from the general election to the bizarre moment when it emerged that Spain intended to use the Brexit talks to progress their centuries-old ambitions over Gibraltar, the one that could still upend the whole thing is the issue of avoiding a border on the island of Ireland. It is this issue that encapsulates the central problem of Brexit. In leaving the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, Britain has sealed its fate: there will have to be border checks between it and the club. If a border is to be avoided on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland is in effect going to have to remain part of that club. That might seem dogmatic and unreasonable to some in the UK. And there is a danger, certainly, of a correspondent from the Guardian in Brussels going native, given the paper’s editorial line and its doubts over the sagacity of the Johnsons and Goves of this world. But the EU kindly vaccinates against that. It isn’t so attractive a thing, close up, either. A startlingly white organisation, last year the European commission launched a diversity drive to recruit “women, staff with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex (LGBTI) staff and older staff”, yet a spokesman was surprised, even indignant, when I asked why there was no mention of ethnic minority groups. Its decision to pay Turkey, and fund the Libyan coastguard, to keep refugees from crossing its border is full of moral hazard. The pandering to Viktor Orbán, the populist, anti-Islamic prime minister of Hungary – who is a member of the same pan-European political grouping as Juncker, Tusk and the German chancellor Angela Merkel – is pretty nauseating. The European parliament is full of showboaters, idle expense-spongers and a fair share of cranks. Meanwhile the commission’s handling of Britain’s negotiation requests can be rough to the point of outrageously rude, sometimes even self-defeating, with a smug smile never too far from some of the senior officials’ faces. After all, the UK’s humiliation has been a real career-enhancer for some. But perhaps it is only after sitting with EU officials and hearing them talk in lovingly protective terms about the “normative order” of the EU – the institutional and legal architecture that gives each of the member states the necessary trust in each other to keep on going – that one can understand quite how limited are the choices on both sides. You hear often from diplomats and officials that the talks aren’t a matter of punishing Britain. That is true, to a point. But what these talks certainly are about is not allowing the UK to disrupt a complex and evidently fragile architecture that has just about kept the peace between nations that do not have a great record in peacekeeping. When you are inside the club, you can play around with the rules a bit. Outside, the rulebook plays around with you. One of my most enjoyable articles to write while here was a piece comparing and contrasting today’s farce with Britain’s failed 1961-63 accession talks, which in the end were stopped short by General de Gaulle’s “non”. A 28-page account penned by the UK delegation – marked “secret” – had warned the prime minister Harold Macmillan that their counterparts had “insisted that our position was that of the demandeur” and the “existing rules must in principle be regarded as sacrosanct”. A better deal than that offered to members was not on the cards. It would, the UK officials subsequently complained to their political masters, “have been helpful if we could have formed a clearer view as to what would be negotiable” rather than put forward “proposals … which in the event proved quite unnegotiable”. It took a decade for Britain to rethink its approach, swallow it all, and join the club in 1973. To misquote Mark Twain: “There is no such thing as a new story”. Perhaps I’ll watch that 28th flag go back up again in a decade’s time too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/28/talking-horses-pat-smullen-up-and-about-and-winning-the-fight","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T09:06:47Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Pat Smullen 'winning the fight' after cancer diagnosis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/28/talking-horses-pat-smullen-up-and-about-and-winning-the-fight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/28/talking-horses-pat-smullen-up-and-about-and-winning-the-fight","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Pat Smullen 'winning the fight' after cancer diagnosis","bodyText":"Bank Holiday Monday’s best bets, by Chris Cook It was great to see Pat Smullen up and about at The Curragh yesterday, showing no signs of ill health that I saw, having been battling cancer for the past couple of months. The Derby-winning jockey of 2016 was found to have a pancreatic tumour and is now receiving chemotherapy but said: “I think we’re winning the fight.” The 41-year-old said his first symptoms were back pain, which he was initially inclined to put down to the sort of wear and tear that all jockeys suffer over time. But he consulted Irish racing’s much-respected medical advisor Dr Adrian McGoldrick, who got him the help he needed. “It’s a tough regime but thankfully I’m taking it well,” Smullen said. “I’ve got an unbelievable medical team taking care of me. They have a programme for me and I’m getting through it. “You have to be mentally strong. It’s not easy, as we know. But I’m blessed with a great family that are giving me huge support, standing square behind me. The amount of messages I’ve received from around the world, from racing people, has been nothing short of overwhelming and that has helped me to focus my mind to fighting this and it’s given me great strength.” I’m sure all Talking Horses readers will join with me in sending our best wishes to Pat and looking forward to the day when he climbs aboard another Dermot Weld good thing. It’s a bank holiday, so we’re not short of action and I thought I’d come up with a fairly obvious nap in The Wicket Chicken (3.45) at Huntingdon. So it was slightly disconcerting to see her chalked up at 6-1 last night. A modicum of apparent support has taken her down to 5-1, which looks good to me. She won her only point, a mares race in Ireland a couple of years ago, and the form of that looks respectable, the second having since won a handicap hurdle for Ian Williams off the same mark The Wicket Chicken has today, while the third has won three points since then. The Wicket Chicken won a couple of modest hurdle events last summer and is not to be judged harshly for a couple of beaten efforts in handicaps that came at intervals over the past year. She’ll be sharper for the latest of those, three weeks ago, and should be a much better proposition over fences. You can get 7-2 at Redcar about Scottish Summit (4.45), a well-related type who finally looks like getting his act together after a reappearance win at Nottingham. The other one I like is Lamb Or Cod (3.55), who put up his best effort for ages when second at Newton Abbot a fortnight ago and should be straighter for that run. He’s 5-2 for a veterans’ chase at Cartmel. Finally, who would be Andrew Cooper this week? Epsom’s clerk of the course has to provide ground that is safe for the best young horses of England and Ireland, who will race there on Saturday, but is facing a forecast that makes that pretty tricky. High temperatures all week will dry out Epsom pretty quick and I imagine he’d like to put a bit of water down at some point but there might be quite a bit of rain on Thursday, which makes that problematic. Good luck to that man!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/29/doctors-skripal-poisoning-salisbury-hospital","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T23:01:06Z","webTitle":"We didn’t expect Skripals to survive, says Salisbury poisoning doctor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/doctors-skripal-poisoning-salisbury-hospital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/doctors-skripal-poisoning-salisbury-hospital","fields":{"headline":"We didn’t expect Skripals to survive, says Salisbury poisoning doctor","bodyText":"A hospital consultant who treated the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, for exposure to the military nerve agent novichok did not initially think the two would survive, he has revealed. Staff at Salisbury district hospital have described the extraordinary situation they faced when the Skripals were brought in for emergency care after being found unconscious on a bench in the town after their attempted assassination on 4 March. Doctors said there was concern over the potential scale of the incident and if more casualties would be admitted as a result of contamination. Dr Stephen Jukes, an intensive care consultant, told BBC2’s Newsnight in an interview to be broadcast on Tuesday: “When we first were aware this was a nerve agent, we were expecting them not to survive. We would try all our therapies. We would ensure the best clinical care. But all the evidence was there that they would not survive.” On admission, the medical team suspected both were experiencing an opioid overdose, but that diagnosis quickly changed to a nerve agent poisoning. Dr Duncan Murray, the head of intensive care, recalled his shock as he spoke to the nurse in charge, “and it was this conversation I really could never have imagined in my wildest imagination having with anyone”. Once the nerve agent was diagnosed, it was simply a matter of keeping the Skripals alive. They were heavily sedated and given heavy doses of drugs designed to protect them from the effects of the poison to help restart their bodies’ natural production of a key enzyme. But when DS Nick Bailey, one of the officers who had attended the scene, was admitted shortly afterwards with similar symptoms, hospital staff started to wonder if they too might fall victim to the nerve agent. Lorna Wilkinson, the director of nursing at the hospital, said: “I suppose the key marker for me was when the PC [Bailey, see footnote] was admitted with symptoms – there was real concern as to how big this could get.” She said she thought: “Have we just gone from having two index patients [to] having something that actually could become all-consuming and involve many casualties? Because we really didn’t know at that point.” The Skripals and Bailey have been discharged from hospital. When asked for their long-term prognosis, Dr Christine Blanshard, the medical director, said: “The honest answer is we don’t know”. The “total world experience” of treating novichok poisoning was that at the Salisbury hospital. “It’s safe to say we’re still learning,” she said. The hospital received advice and help processing tests from international experts including from the Porton Down defence research laboratory, renowned for its chemical weapons expertise, said Murray. Yulia Skripal was discharged in April and she made a statement thanking the hospital last week. It was several more weeks before her father was able to be released. Moscow has repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack. The interviews will be broadcast on Newsnight on BBC2 on Tuesday 29 May. This article was amended on 30 May 2018. An earlier version referred to PC Nick Bailey.

I love those of Siena and San Gimignano and the skyscraper clusters of Manhattan and Dubai. I admire the design of London’s Canary Wharf, and of the Shard, if only it had not been dumped on Bermondsey. I do not love the ugliness now being scattered at random along the banks of the Thames or the squalor of London’s skyline. As art historian Vince Scully said of New York, he once “entered the city like a god; now one scuttles in like a rat”. We have seen nothing yet. The latest survey from New London Architecture, the only body monitoring the city’s towerscape, is nothing short of sensational. At the turn of the century, the metropolis had some 30 towers over 20 storeys. Two years ago 115 were planned or under construction. Now, according to NLA, a staggering 510 are proposed. No plan for this proliferation has ever been published. No mayor has ever put it to the voters. Unlike any other European country, skyscrapers can go up wherever developers want, provided only that they do not spoil a view of St Paul’s Cathedral. It is “wild west” planning. The capital is not alone in England. Manchester is facing a 40-storey slab, which will loom over the Victorian streets like something from outer space, while acres of inner suburb lie derelict. In Bristol a single 26-storey tower is being allowed next to Castle Park, in a city where nine storeys is supposedly the limit. Most astonishing of all, a 25-storey tower is proposed for the heart of ancient Norwich. These cities should be struck off the tourist itinerary. Ever since the turn of the millennium, skyscrapers have acquired “iconic” status as harbingers of wealth, even if much of that wealth is funk money from foreign dictatorships. They are loved by virility-obsessed mayors. Ken Livingstone wanted to ape Manhattan. Boris Johnson went to Malaysia in 2014 to promote his Battersea towers as “inward investment”, as if an empty tower was a machine tool factory. In the same cause, Liverpool 10 years ago wanted 50 towers, some covered in wind turbines. Leeds proposed two 54-storey towers to signify “civic spirit and economic zest”. Birmingham wanted 10; Croydon five. A pillar of luxury flats seemed glitzy, glamorous, macho. These towers have nothing to do with housing need or land shortage. Almost all are “luxury residential” and, at least in London, investments with few permanent residents. Figures are obscure, but most estimates put 60% of prime London sales going to foreign buyers, most as “buy to leave”. A tower is a developer’s “signature”, easy to sell at the property auctions that crowd hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong. The gargantuan Battersea power station site even has a Malaysia Square to attract investors. In 2016 a Guardian investigation revealed that at the 50-storey tower in Vauxhall – which even the planners rejected until mysteriously overruled by John Prescott – just 10% of occupants were on the electoral register. No one can tell what will happen to these investments when the current property dip in London bites. The assumption must be that many of the blocks will experience the usual cyclical slump, moving into multi-occupancy and possibly social housing. The industry says service charges will stop this, and a downturn will make little difference as many flats are just nest eggs for laundered cash. So dumb is British planning that these are still classed as “meeting housing need”. The virtue of skyscrapers to investors is precisely why they are so damaging to city vitality. They are locked, gated, anonymous and family-hostile. No one cares if they are empty or blight the surrounding communities. And they have little to do with the much-vaunted “densification” of British cities. London may boast the lowest housing densities in Europe – the LSE’s density chart puts central London at just a quarter of central Paris. But even if they were full, the towers rarely offer higher densities than traditional Victorian terraces in their neighbourhoods. The aborted “Paddington pole” had fewer units than a rival street-based plan. Britain’s urban housing market is conditioned by its profligacy in its use of buildings. High stamp duty and a failure to tax living space have produced its biggest housing failure: underoccupancy. They are a growing disincentive to downsizing. Britons occupy 2.5 rooms each, as against 1.5 in the 1980s. The way to galvanise the housing market is not to build towers; it is to tax property and end stamp duty. As for alternative forms of urban renewal, there is no mystery. Anyone seeking thoughtful “high-density, low-rise” need only go to London’s King’s Cross. Here is development where smart planning has delivered a fusion of old and new, work and play, nature and community, at some of the highest densities in the capital. Towers are an irrelevance. An American friend gazing at the horizon from Waterloo Bridge asked me if it was all down to corruption. I had to explain that in London, planning was so bad it had no need of corruption. Some developers are asked for sweeteners in the form of a dribble of cash for a local primary school or a few “affordable” flats. But the reality is that planners and councillors lack the guts to stand up to developers, and if they do, some mayor or minister overrules them. There cannot be another city in Europe that would have permitted London’s Walkie Talkie and One Blackfriars, and their obscenely bulging upper storeys there purely to maximise rentals. Tall buildings are always prominent, and therefore matter to good design. Such a statement would seem second nature in France or Italy or Germany. Rome is the most corrupt place I know, but Romans would never do to the Tiber what London has done to the Thames. London gave its governors a postwar skyline still by Canaletto. They have returned one by Jackson Pollock. I know some people like towers as urban sculpture, but that is no reason for their likes to be imposed on everyone else in perpetuity. And do they really want 500 of them? Towers are the enemies of social vitality. They are silent stakes driven through a city’s sense of community. They are mere memorials to Britain’s greed for foreign cash in the 21st century, and to a newly philistine public realm. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/29/cuba-calls-on-us-and-canada-to-investigate-sonic-attack-mystery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T15:00:25Z","webTitle":"Cuba calls on US and Canada to investigate 'sonic attack' claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/cuba-calls-on-us-and-canada-to-investigate-sonic-attack-mystery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/29/cuba-calls-on-us-and-canada-to-investigate-sonic-attack-mystery","fields":{"headline":"Cuba calls on US and Canada to investigate 'sonic attack' claims","bodyText":"The most senior scientist in Cuba has called on his opposite numbers in the US and Canada to assess the evidence behind claims that mysterious attacks in Havana left American and Canadian diplomats with inexplicable concussion-like brain injuries. Luis Velázquez, a neurologist who was recently appointed president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences, has asked the US and Canadian national science academies for a joint scientific inquiry to examine the evidence behind the alleged attacks. The move reflects a growing sense of frustration in Cuba that the country is being blamed for harming foreign embassy staff even as governments and independent experts remain baffled as to what form of attack could have made the diplomats ill. Some scientists have questioned whether attacks even took place and say the wide range of symptoms reported by the embassy staff could be explained by a number of common medical conditions, or be driven by psychological factors in the high-stress environment the staff work in. The inquiry Velázquez has called for would see some of the most eminent scientists in the world pore over the evidence to date with the aim of better understanding what, if anything, happened to the affected individuals. The US National Academy of Sciences confirmed the approach but declined to comment further. The US slashed the number of staff at its Havana embassy and expelled 15 Cuban diplomats last year after 24 American staff and family reported feeling unwell with headaches, dizziness and problems with their eyesight, hearing, sleep and concentration. Many said their ailments came on after they heard strange noises that ranged from grinding and cicada-like chirps to the buffeting caused by an open car window. While unnamed US officials claimed in media reports that the diplomats were victims of “acoustic attacks”, an FBI investigation found no evidence that sonic weapons had been used. Last month, Canada said it would call home the families of diplomats at its embassy in Havana, where 10 staff have reported similar symptoms. A spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada said an investigation into the cause was ongoing. “There have been no new incidents since the early fall of 2017,” they said. “Diplomatic families who have returned to Canada, however, have continued to experience symptoms.” Last week, the US issued a health warning to its citizens in China after one of its consulate staff experienced the same types of symptoms to those in Cuba. A formal assessment of the American diplomats’ health commissioned by the US government was published in March by doctors at the University of Pennsylvania. The preliminary report in the Journal of the American Medical Association describes a new syndrome that resembles persistent concussion in people who have not received blows to the head. But in a letter published in the Journal of Neurology, Sergio Della Sala and Robert McIntosh, both neuroscientists at the University of Edinburgh, claim the US report is seriously flawed. Della Sala said much of the evidence the doctors used to propose a new concussion-like syndrome came from six diplomats who each took 37 cognitive tests. The tests looked at visual and auditory attention, working memory, language, reasoning, movement and other cognitive abilities. In their report, the US doctors reveal that all six embassy staff who had the full battery of tests had some brain impairment or another. But Della Sala and McIntosh say anybody who took the tests would have been classed as impaired. They point out that it is standard practice with cognitive tests to measure people’s performance against others in the population. Often, a person has to score in the bottom 5% to be considered impaired. But the US doctors set the threshold at 40%, meaning that by definition, four in 10 who take the test will be “impaired”. Della Sala and McIntosh ran a simulation that looked at the probability of passing all 37 tests when the threshold for failure was set so high. “The chances that somebody will be without an impairment is zero,” Della Sala said. “We ran the simulation 1,000 times, and never, ever is there one single individual who appears to be normal. They are all classed as impaired.” He added: “I’m not denying that they may have discovered a new syndrome, but the point is that the evidence they have provided is nonscientific. The paper is faulty. Even if the results are preliminary, a threshold that verges on half the population is unheard of. I cannot see how any reviewer could have looked at the data and said they are fine. This is not a little thing. It is a threshold unknown in science or clinical practice.” In their Journal of Neurology paper, the scientists conclude: “With the criteria used, the neuropsychological symptoms of the proposed new syndrome have a worrying lack of specificity: everybody is affected.” Mark Cohen, a professor of neurology and pioneer in functional brain imaging at University of California, Los Angeles, said there was insufficient evidence to link the diplomats’ health problems to the sounds they heard. “These are symptoms which are typical of many, many causes,” he said. “It is an incautious leap to presume that the cause was related to the reports of sounds heard by these diplomats.” Neither the US State Department nor representatives from the University of Pennsylvania responded to requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/28/siya-kolisi-south-africa-first-black-captain-engalnd-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T14:15:51Z","webTitle":"Siya Kolisi to make history by becoming South Africa’s first black captain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/28/siya-kolisi-south-africa-first-black-captain-engalnd-tests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/28/siya-kolisi-south-africa-first-black-captain-engalnd-tests","fields":{"headline":"Siya Kolisi to make history by becoming South Africa’s first black captain","bodyText":"Siya Kolisi will become South Africa’s first black captain after being handed the role for the Test series against England next month. The 26-year-old flanker was the vice-captain to Eben Etzebeth last year and temporarily took over when the second-row was off the field but has been awarded the role on a full-time basis for the three-Test series. Chiliboy Ralepelle was the captain of a South Africa team against a World XV in 2006 but, with Etzebeth and Warren Whiteley injured, Kolisi will be the first black player to captain the Springboks in a Test in their 127-year history. The appointment comes two days after Rassie Erasmus named a squad which includes five overseas-based players – Sale’s Faf de Klerk, Willie le Roux of Wasps as well as Duane Vermeulen, Bismarck du Plessis and Francois Steyn. Erasmus has wasted little time in making changes since taking over from Allister Coetzee but the former Munster director of rugby denied Kolisi, who captains the Stormers, has been appointed out of tokenism. South Africa’s stated aim is for 50% of the World Cup squad next year to be black players as part of transformation goals but Erasmus said: “I know Siya is a good leader and I am excited about what he can offer us. I have always understood the transformation issues and that they are part of the way we are heading and I have bought into that. “We are trying to fix all the wrong things that were done in the past. The recent things that happened did not have a bearing on this decision because my contract was signed long before. The players we have in this squad deserve to be here and I am not trying to fabricate things.” Kolisi will not be considered for selection against Wales in Washington DC on Saturday so Pieter-Steph du Toit has been named as the captain for that match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"games/2018/jun/21/battletech-review-initially-ponderous-then-glorious","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"BattleTech review – initially ponderous, then glorious","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/21/battletech-review-initially-ponderous-then-glorious","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/jun/21/battletech-review-initially-ponderous-then-glorious","fields":{"headline":"BattleTech review – initially ponderous, then glorious","bodyText":"BattleTech, a turn-based game of sci-fi warfare in the vein of the deft alien-invasion drama XCOM, can leave a poor first impression on players not well-versed in the plastic robots and cardboard counters of the revered 80s tabletop game. Unfortunately, that impression can endure for hours, but if you can pierce its dour and unhelpful exterior, BattleTech becomes a smart and gripping realisation of what happens when 80-tonne titans clash. In BattleTech, an enemy mech (a bipedal giant tank piloted by a human) is not merely a mass of health points to be whittled away by your squad’s abundance of missiles, lasers and shells. Instead, it is a walking, massively armoured puzzle. Concentrate fire on a leg to temporarily topple it, on an arm to destroy its most lethal weapon, or on its head to neutralise its driver. Though the giant robots might suggest instant fireworks, BattleTech is an unashamedly ponderous game, more akin to second world war tanks carefully seeking out each others’ weak spots than Optimus Prime ripping girders off Megatron. Unfortunately, it conveys its many exotic combat concepts with all the thoughtfulness of a Lonely Planet guide that only says “arrive at your destination. See things.” Information vital to your building-sized squad’s survival is effectively outsourced to fan-made guides and videos. Without those, hours can be spent in a desperately slow war of attrition, your dozens of weapons mere insect bites upon your foes’ iron hides. Coupled with the drab presentation – your missions take you to dozens of planets, all of which seem to resemble an overcast day in Lancashire – and an abundance of unnecessary delays and continental-drift-speed animations that add up to hours of dead time, it’s all too easy to dismiss BattleTech as dull. Perseverance yields enormous rewards, even though the game’s significant presentation failings should not be dismissed. Taking down an enemy mech is an accomplishment that never ceases to be deeply gratifying, while there is a singular horror to witnessing one of yours knocked to the ground by a hail of missiles or a thump from a fist the size of a horse, whereupon your foes are free to eviscerate any part of it they choose. A turn-based game has the inherent tension of waiting to see what happens in the enemy round, but the fact that a mech can lose multiple limbs and keep fighting is a delicious remix. Can you regain the upper hand if you have no hands? And, at the end of it all, will the costs involved in repairing all the damage to your mechs outweigh the profits earned from completing the mission? Between these missions, BattleTech has a clunky but substantial management mode, in which you upgrade your mechs and their pilots, hire and fire replacements, and choose between mercenary contracts to restock your abused coffers. The mech side of this is a tinkerer’s paradise, allowing you to spec up your squad’s weapons and armour to your heart’s content, at least once you have built up the confidence to move away from stock setups. The long game of BattleTech, however, is building new mechs by accruing shattered bits of leg and torso from the battlefield. Once you have got three pieces of salvage from the same type of mech, you get yourself a free one. This element of the game is like the intergalactic robot Pokémon, striving to fill your ranks with one of each available giant metal monster. It is once you shift into this mindset that BattleTech’s true splendour emerges through its superficially sterile murk. Missions are no longer fought merely to be survived, but to carefully neutralise enemy pilots without destroying their impossibly precious steel shells. Coming home with a 90-tonne trophy that you can then field in your next battle is a glorious reward for a perfectly executed plan. BattleTech, on the other side of those achingly slow and uncertain first hours, is a blissfully satisfying war game. • BattleTech is out now for £39.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/blue-light-led-screens-cancer-insomnia-health-issues","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T17:15:01Z","webTitle":"The truth about blue light: does it really cause insomnia and increased risk of cancer?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/blue-light-led-screens-cancer-insomnia-health-issues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/blue-light-led-screens-cancer-insomnia-health-issues","fields":{"headline":"The truth about blue light: does it really cause insomnia and increased risk of cancer?","bodyText":"Long attached to visions of clear skies and calm seas, the colour blue historically could not be more welcome, refreshing and natural. Yet, because of the proliferation of blue-emitting LEDs in our artificially lit lives, blue light has come to represent bleary eyes, sleeplessness and the poor health associated with disruption of the circadian rhythm. Of the spectrum of lightwaves emitted by the sun that our eyes can detect, it is the shorter “blue” ones that get reflected and bounced around most by the molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere. They are the reason the sky is blue. So why is blue light apparently so bad for us? Earlier this month, a study published in The Lancet Psychiatry looked at data from 91,105 middle-aged people and found that those with disrupted sleep patterns were more likely to have depression or bipolar disorder. The worst affected were described by one of the authors of the paper, Professor Daniel Smith at the University of Glasgow, as those with “very poor sleep hygiene – people on their mobile phones at midnight checking Facebook or getting up to make a cup of tea in the middle of the night”. He reiterated the now common advice from sleep experts: switch off electronic devices an hour before bedtime. In March, the chief medical officer, Sally Davies, advised caution in using devices emitting blue light while more research is done into its potential harm. Then in April researchers at the Barcelona Institute of Global Health linked increased risks of breast and prostate cancers to blue light exposure at night (an association was found, but whether the light exposure caused the cancers through circadian disruption is unknown). What we do know is that undimmed LED screens and lamps give off more blue light than traditional light sources, such as incandescent lightbulbs. And we are using backlit devices more than ever, whether checking social media and bank balances or grappling with heavy workloads, right up until lights out. The reason manufacturers have switched to brighter LED lights is efficiency. With traditional incandescent lightbulbs, says John O’Hagan of Public Health England’s centre for radiation, chemical and environmental hazards, “95% of what was produced was heat, and only 5% was light.” As well as staying cooler, LED screens have the added benefit of being thinner, lighter and longer lasting, with stunning colour resolution. One indication of nagging worries about blue light is the increasing availability of anti-blue-light products – including beauty treatments claiming to protect skin from the light from phones and laptops, and anti-blue light lenses. In lab experiments, high exposure to blue light has been shown to damage animal retinas, but there’s no evidence that current levels of exposure are harming humans’ eyes. “The hype around the blue light hazard has got a bit out of control,” says O’Hagan. An advert by Boots Opticians claiming that blue-light filtering lenses could protect consumers from retinal damage, eye strain and fatigue was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2015. When researchers test the blue-light levels in devices, says O’Hagan, “they don’t come anywhere near the international exposure limits even for prolonged viewing, and are only a fraction of what you’d get just walking outdoors on a cloudy day.” Working on his laptop, he says, is “trivial compared to me walking outside and looking up at the sky – not at the sun, just the sky.” If humans were damaged by blue light exposure per se, we would have known about it long before LED screens dominated our lives. “There’s still an awful lot that we don’t know about this,” he concedes, “but I’m fairly convinced blue light is not causing any injuries as such.” It is blue light’s role in governing circadian rhythms that poses greater concern for public health. “If you go back in time,” says O’Hagan, “as soon as the sun went down you went to bed, and got back up again when the sun came up. It isn’t natural to extend your day with artificial lighting. People are also doing activities in the evenings they wouldn’t have done even 20 or 30 years ago and that stimulation may be having far more effect than the light itself.” Not that long ago, he says, “your television was a relatively small device in the corner of the room. Now you’ve got a TV completely filling the wall; you are immersed in it. We don’t know what the impact of that is and maybe it’s not a problem at all. But we need some research doing on it.” “Blue light is not sinister,” says Stuart Peirson, of the sleep and circadian neuroscience institution (SCNi) at Oxford University. “You get changes particularly in the blue part of the spectrum around dawn and dusk and so our bodies have evolved to be able to detect these changes, because they are what’s important for setting our clocks. It’s just that we’ve subsequently invented devices that emit light and we’ve filled our environment with them and made them addictive. If you go to bed at night and stare at your bedside lamp for 10 minutes, that will shift your clock, it’s just that nobody does that.” The focus on blue light began, he says, “over 15 years ago, when we discovered there is a type of photoreceptor in the eye that detects light, but for circadian responses rather than visual responses.” These include, he says, “setting the circadian clock, regulating sleep and alertness, and also things like hormone responses such as melatonin.” So as well as our visual photoreceptors, known as rods and cones (rods for night sight and cones for bright light and colour vision), we also have photosensitive retinal ganglion cells for circadian responses, and these are particularly sensitive to blue light. “But what we’ve subsequently learned is that the rods and cones [which are sensitive to a spectrum of light frequencies] also help regulate the circadian responses, while the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells also work as light meters. The photosensitive retinal ganglion cells don’t exclusively absorb blue light, it’s just that they are better at absorbing it than, say, red light. If you cut out blue light, says Peirson, “you’re still getting activation of the circadian system, albeit less.” A cleverer way to tackle the problem, if you’re not prepared to lower the house lights and give devices a miss towards bedtime, “is to change the colour temperature of the display – how warm or cool it looks.” Frustratingly, the only study Peirson knows of into the efficacy of doing this, using software called f.lux, was inconclusive. “But in fact just dimming the brightness will make a difference,” says Peirson. “The night mode that many devices offer makes the display dimmer. Even if you don’t have night mode, dimming LED lighting by 50% would be less bright to those ganglion cells than a fluorescent or incandescent light.” Peirson is taken with an idea mooted by a colleague of his from Harvard, that in many ways, light is like a drug. “It can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes. The key point is knowing when we need it and in what dose.” Is blue light also the reason we get eye strain or tired eyes after prolonged computer use? John Lawrenson, a professor of clinical visual science at City University of London, isn’t convinced. In a review of robust studies into blue light-blocking lenses, he found “very little in terms of significant differences in satisfaction with blue light-blocking lenses and standard lenses.” This is partly because the lenses can only block a fraction of the blue light, but also, he says, the new term “digital eye strain” can have many components to it – wearing the wrong glasses, dry eyes, or just sitting in front of the computer too long. Children’s eyes are more sensitive to blue light, because, says O’Hagan, “as we age our blue light vision decreases. By the time you get to about 20 your blue light vision is rubbish.” Overall, however, most people are not affected by any of these issues. “Some people are, know they are and therefore should probably be switching devices off at least an hour before they want to go to sleep. It may have nothing to do with blue light. It’s just light, staring at it and keeping stimulated. For those who do have problems, did they have problems before? Are they particularly sensitive to the light? We don’t know.” And of course eyes differ, as do circadian rhythms; there are not only larks and owls, but an entire spectrum in between. “The best thing people should do,” he says, “is get out at lunchtime. There’s a lot of evidence that the light you get in the evening is less important than the dose of bright light you got at lunchtime. And it gives you exercise and makes you feel better.” And while the internet is extremely useful, “it’s important for people to stop and do nothing for a while. If you want good sleep, you need to prepare for sleep.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/28/daniel-morgan-new-delays-hit-inquiry-into-31-year-old-case","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T16:16:40Z","webTitle":"Daniel Morgan murder: new delays hit inquiry into 31-year-old case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/daniel-morgan-new-delays-hit-inquiry-into-31-year-old-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/daniel-morgan-new-delays-hit-inquiry-into-31-year-old-case","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Morgan murder: new delays hit inquiry into 31-year-old case","bodyText":"The official inquiry into the murder of Daniel Morgan has hit new delays and will now not report until next year – 31 years after the private detective was murdered, allegedly as he was about to expose police corruption, the Guardian has learned. Morgan, 37, was a private detective who co-owned a small south London agency, Southern Investigations. He was found with an axe embedded in his head in a south London pub car park on 10 March 1987. No one has ever been convicted of the murder, although the Morgan family and police are sure who the prime suspects are. The inquiry was announced in May 2013 by the then home secretary Theresa May. May said she was appalled by the suffering of Morgan’s family as they fought for justice and to expose former officers in the Metropolitan police, as well as journalists in Rupert Murdoch’s media empire and their links with suspects. The Morgan family say the Met has been delaying the inquiry and has been too slow to hand over documents relating to the case. The Met says it has already handed over 1m documents. The murder has modern-day implications involving former employees of the now defunct News of the World newspaper. Some say the case shows the need for a new Leveson inquiry into police and media corruption. The campaign for justice has been led by Daniel’s brother, Alastair Morgan, who said: “This is Britain, this is the way things are here. If you ever confront corruption it takes a lifetime to deal with it, as we have seen before with the police. “There has been delay after delay, you become inured to it. We were told by the [then] home secretary the process would take a year.” The first murder investigation was mired in corruption, with one detective replacing Morgan in his role at Southern Investigations, where he worked alongside one of the prime suspects. That former detective went on to work with the News of the World on its stories and one of the prime suspects received hundreds of thousands of pounds from the Murdoch paper for information. After a fresh criminal investigation the Met announced in 2007 that the motive for the murder was probably that Morgan “was about to expose a south London drugs network possibly involving corrupt police officers”. Morgan said he would fight on: “How can I give up at this point? I’ve got no choice, I’m not walking away.” An inquiry spokesperson said: “Providing no further relevant documentation or evidence is received in 2018, beyond what is currently expected, the panel hopes to complete drafting its report in 2018 before submitting it to the home secretary in 2019. “A number of events occurred during 2016-2017, including the hearing at the start of 2017 of a civil action by [former suspects for the murder] against the Metropolitan police service. “A trial was held and findings made by the court and, as a consequence, additional documentation was received by the panel during 2017, which then had to be considered in depth. The panel is also now considering a large volume of material which is being incrementally provided to the panel during 2018.” The Met said it was cooperating with the inquiry: “The Metropolitan police service has worked closely with the Home Office and the Daniel Morgan independent panel to create a mechanism that allowed for the exceptional and full disclosure to the panel, to enable them to achieve their aim of shining a light on the circumstances of this case and to introduce safeguards around disclosure of the material. “It has been an extremely complex process for many reasons, including the volume and nature of the material involved, and the fact there was no statutory framework to govern the disclosure process. “The MPS continues to provide its fullest possible support to the work of [the panel], who have had access to over one million pages of information.” The panel is believed to be investigating another death for potential links to the Morgan murder. Four months after Morgan’s killing, in July 1987, DC Alan Holmes was found shot dead in his garden in what was officially declared a suicide. Some in policing are no longer confident of that conclusion. One police source said they believe Holmes had told Morgan of the conspiracy involving corrupt officers and criminals to import drugs into the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/28/pregnant-breastfeeding-models-key-bumper-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T16:48:20Z","webTitle":"Why pregnant and breastfeeding models are the key to bumper sales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/28/pregnant-breastfeeding-models-key-bumper-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/28/pregnant-breastfeeding-models-key-bumper-sales","fields":{"headline":"Why pregnant and breastfeeding models are the key to bumper sales","bodyText":"Fashion loves to break its own rules, then unbreak them, then pretend the rules didn’t exist, then act as though everyone knew the rules all along, and since from the outside there is only one rule – be thin – this leads to some quite complex conversations. One year, you will find a plus-size model on every catwalk, and the next year they will have vanished. But the final frontier is the pregnant woman, or – pretty much interchangeably, because you always look pregnant for ages after you are, unless you’re Madonna – the breastfeeding woman. There was that brief moment in 1991, when Annie Leibovitz put a gravid Demi Moore on the cover of Vanity Fair wearing nothing at all (commentators describe her pose as the “hand-bra”). Nothing came after. The pregnant woman remained culturally invisible, which really is a curious sensation when you’re in it, given how ginormous you are. New York fashion week broke that article of faith last year, when the Eckhaus Latta show featured Maia Ruth Lee, who was eight months pregnant at the time, wearing a cardigan dress with a perfectly domed opening for her mighty tum, like something a midwife might design if he or she were in such a rush they wanted to measure everyone’s fundus by eye. But that reminded everyone: there actually had been some pregnant catwalk models, this decade. You could fit them all into two taxis, like the Lib Dems, but nine is more than none. There was Jourdan Dunn for Jean Paul Gaultier’s spring/summer 2010 show and Italian model Bianca Balti for Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s autumn/winter 2015 collection. New Zealand model Ashleigh Good was the final showstopper in the Chanel show for autumn/winter 14/15, looking so pure and punk, so breathtakingly wonderful, that close observers may have felt that chill of the truly unattainable standards of fashion: to meet its trend criteria, you might have to get pregnant. Victoria’s Secret has been at the vanguard, accounting for three of those nine. But its catwalk always has an uncomfortable relationship with the fashion mainstream, being too raunchy and saucy and seeming to miss the point (it’s art, not clothes-porn), but every now and then sailing past the point to make a new and possibly better one. Jenni Kayne, an LA brand you might put into the category athleisure, saw sales triple after an image of TyLynn Nguyen breastfeeding went up on billboards in New York this month, defying marketing truisms (who last bought something they saw on a billboard? Nancy Reagan?) but also deeper assumptions about where our ego sits in relation to images of female beauty. If we were simply spectators to the more urgent male gaze, a breastfeeding woman would be like a regular woman, only not as good. But if we’re projecting ourselves, our hopes and memories, on to the image, then it makes perfect sense for this to spike sales, since breastfeeding is a much more profound romantic experience than, say, having a shower. It would be fanciful to claim that pregnant models do much to spread the idea that pregnancy is, in itself, beautiful. But I still find the development quite heartening, for putting the female audience at the centre of an art form. For a bloody change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/29/martha-kearney-speaks-of-humiliation-at-being-groped-in-her-20s","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T23:00:06Z","webTitle":"Martha Kearney speaks of 'humiliation' at being groped in her 20s","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/martha-kearney-speaks-of-humiliation-at-being-groped-in-her-20s","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/martha-kearney-speaks-of-humiliation-at-being-groped-in-her-20s","fields":{"headline":"Martha Kearney speaks of 'humiliation' at being groped in her 20s","bodyText":"Martha Kearney has described the “horrible and humiliating” experience of being groped by senior members of staff while working as a political reporter during the 1980s. The new presenter of Radio 4’s Today programme said her experience as a reporter on radio station LBC, when she was in her 20s, had left her with a distaste for bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace. “I didn’t complain,” she told this week’s edition of the Radio Times. “It was the world of work, the rough and tumble of the newsroom. The young women I work with at Today have zero tolerance. I hope #MeToo willI make a difference.” The radio presenter said such experiences were sometimes wrongly dismissed as character-forming and she regrets not standing up to senior journalists at the time: “I wish I’d felt stronger, less intimidated, but in my 20s, bosses were powerful people.” Kearney joined Radio 4’s flagship news programme from The World at One earlier this year, as part of a job swap with former Today presenter Sarah Montague. Listening figures for the BBC programme remain high, with just over 7 million people tuning in on a weekly basis. Today’s reputation for setting the agenda in the political world means it comes under substantial scrutiny - especially following the appointment of Sarah Sands, a former editor of the London Evening Standard, as the programme’s boss. One of the programme’s continual debates is whether to scrap the religious Thought for the Day segment, where a religious figure discusses a topical issue and how it relates to faith. Kearney, who wakes up at 3.15am so she can be in the studio from 4am onwards, said she has come to appreciate the slot. “In the past, I would have run to the radio to turn it off,” she said. “I’ve come around to the view that a time for reflection in the morning, which is only a couple of minutes, isn’t a bad thing at all.” She also told the magazine that she expected longstanding co-presenter John Humphrys to continue for some time, despite constant suggestions he could be facing retirement: “Sitting next to him in the studio, he’s crackling with energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/28/anyone-fancy-nice-glass-cockroach-milk","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T15:05:37Z","webTitle":"Anyone fancy a nice glass of cockroach milk?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/28/anyone-fancy-nice-glass-cockroach-milk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/28/anyone-fancy-nice-glass-cockroach-milk","fields":{"headline":"Anyone fancy a nice glass of cockroach milk?","bodyText":"Cockroaches aren’t generally associated with good places to dine, but that could change soon because the insects are the latest fad in the superfoods craze. So-called cockroach milk – or post-natal fluid – is secreted from the critter in the form of crystals to nourish its 50 or so hatchlings – and humans could enjoy this nourishment too, according to researchers from the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine in India, who claim that the “milk” derived from the crystals boasts many nutritional benefits. “The crystals are like a complete food – they have proteins, fats and sugars. If you look into the protein sequences, they have all the essential amino acids,” Sanchari Banerjee, one of the main researchers, told the Times of India. This non-dairy alternative is said to taste rather like cow’s milk, but, given that a cockroach is significantly smaller than your average cow, it would take an army of the insects to make up one glass of milk. Also, according to the science news website Inverse, the cockroaches die in the process of extracting the fluid, thus making the whole enterprise “neither feasible or efficient”. The mass-market viability of insect products hasn’t stopped companies such as Gourmet Grubb from making imitation ice-cream with “entomilk” – a non-dairy milk made from sustainably farmed insects. The company says that entomilk is rich in protein content, as well as iron, zinc and calcium. Alongside insect-based dairy alternatives, eating insects whole is becoming a more common sight in western diets. So, if wolfing down multiple-legged invertebrates has no effect on your gag reflex and you would like to do your bit for the environment, there are sites, such as Derby-based Crunchy Critters, where you can fill your virtual basket with packets of freeze-dried and dehydrated insects, from barbecue mealworm to salt-and-vinegar crickets and garlic chapulines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"theguardian/2018/may/28/no-one-compares-like-londoners","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T16:03:00Z","webTitle":"No one compares like Londoners | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2018/may/28/no-one-compares-like-londoners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2018/may/28/no-one-compares-like-londoners","fields":{"headline":"No one compares like Londoners","bodyText":"Must the news forever be given a metropolitan slant?

The white kids want to know where he is from. The answer is “here”, same as them, but that’s not what they’re asking. After 9/11 they call him Osama. His parents are from Pakistan. When he visits Karachi, his relatives point out his US accent. He lives between two worlds, belonging to neither. Then, in the sixth grade, something happens. He is doing a science project on Isaac Newton. He visits the public library of the small town in Pennsylvania where he lives, and, browsing books about Newton the scientist he comes across another Newton – Huey P Newton, cofounder of the Black Panther Party. In 1973, Newton published an autobiography called Revolutionary Suicide. Intrigued by the title, the boy picks up the book, and it changes his life. This is the scene that opens Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump. It’s vividly drawn, and sets the stakes for what follows. Asad Haider has written a book about identity, politics, and the relationship between the two. In particular, he has written a book about “identity politics”, a phrase that, like “political correctness”, is extremely slippery, but which generally means an emphasis on issues of racial, gender and sexual identity. Identity politics finds critics everywhere. Throw a rock at a rack of newspapers and you’ll probably hit an editorial condemning it. Conservatives such as Republican House speaker Paul Ryan blame it for polarisation, while liberals like the Columbia University historian Mark Lilla hold it responsible for Donald Trump’s victory, applying the baroque logic that letting people use their preferred gender pronouns is why Democrats struggle to be seen as the party of working people. Haider is also a critic of identity politics, but with a crucial difference: he knows the history of the term and is working from within the tradition that produced it. As he explains, the idea has radical roots. It originated with the Combahee River Collective, an organisation of black lesbian feminist socialists in Boston who published a landmark statement in 1977: “This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else’s oppression.” This is the original demand of identity politics, and it’s one that Haider embraces: for a revolutionary practice rooted in people’s identities as racialised, sexed, gendered and classed individuals who face interlocking systems of oppression. These systems have to be fought together, by organising people of different identities in what Haider calls “a project of universal emancipation” devoted to dismantling all of the structures that make them unfree, including and especially capitalism itself. But if anticapitalist revolution is where identity politics began, it has since become something quite different, and is now invoked by certain liberals and leftists to serve distinctly non-revolutionary ends, Haider argues. It involves members of marginalised groups demanding inclusion, recognition, or restitution from above – a seat at the table. These demands are made in response to very real injuries endured by those groups. But their method, he says, ends up strengthening the structures that produced those injuries in the first place. Drawing on Wendy Brown’s idea of “wounded attachments”, Haider contends that identity politics causes people to become invested in their marginalisation as a source of identity, and to continuously enact that identity as a form of politics. This approach can extract occasional concessions from the system but cannot build the power necessary to transform it. Building that power will require forging a “new insurgent universality”, Haider believes. This doesn’t mean pretending that everyone is the same. It doesn’t mean elevating one identity – that of the white male worker, say – above all others. Rather, the universality that Haider wants is built from below. It is “created and recreated in the act of insurgency”, as people come together to combat the common enemy lurking behind their particular oppressions. Freedom for ourselves – whoever “we” are – is inseparable from freedom for everyone. If emancipation is always self-emancipation, self-emancipation is always a collective endeavour. Collective self-emancipation doesn’t require abandoning one’s identity – if that were even possible – but linking it with those of others in widening circles of solidarity. The story that opens Haider’s book is a good example: solidarity across identities is how a Pakistani-American boy could find inspiration in a long-dead Black Panther. Indeed, what Haider found so inspiring about Newton was precisely his vision of a solidarity strong enough to span the world. As an African American in a profoundly racist country, Newton couldn’t escape his identity. Neither could Haider, in a country convulsing with Islamophobic hatred. Yet “Newton did not stop with his own identity”, Haider writes. “His experience led him beyond himself – to take up a politics based on solidarity with Cuba, China, Palestine and Vietnam.” Armed with the explanatory power of the black radical tradition, and Marxism more broadly, Newton connected the dots between different injustices. Haider follows this example, wielding the same tools to advance his critique of contemporary identity politics and make his case for a radical alternative. He draws on a wide range of sources, examining an interracial uprising in colonial Virginia and the riots in Newark three centuries later; exploring the ideas of WEB Du Bois, Judith Butler and Barbara Fields, among other great thinkers. And he regularly loops back to recent history, to analyse Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and the other mobilisations that have moulded our political moment. The result is riveting. Haider moves deftly over difficult terrain. His prose is precise and propulsive. His Marxism is not a mausoleum but a living, breathing thing, coursing with what Lenin called “the concrete analysis of the concrete situation”, faithful to the method of historical materialism while flexible in the face of a fluid social reality. And he writes as both a militant and a theorist, one who believes that theory is integral to political struggle and that theoretical rigour has political stakes. The function of rigorousness, Louis Althusser once said, is to distinguish between “true ideas and false ideas”, between ideas that “serve the people” and ideas that serve its enemies. The American left has shown signs of life recently, but it has no shortage of enemies. Defeating them will require, among other things, ideas. Haider’s book contributes several. We will need more. • Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump is published by Verso. To order a copy for £9.34 (RRP £10.99) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

That’s what her two loving sons say and they want it written the way she would have. Her friends and former colleagues have been told, yet it may appal some lifelong admirers to have it said out loud. But her ability to confront hard truths and break old ideas of decorum is the reason so many read her for decades. With her usual no-nonsense rationality, she wrote with fearless clarity on the end of life. Katharine is now 90, living in a care home, suffering from Alzheimer’s, with little understanding left, no knowledge of where she is or why. She often doesn’t recognise people, can no longer read and curiously sometimes talks in French, not a language she knew particularly well: she will never read or understand this article. In other words, she is not herself. Her old self would not recognise herself in this other being who sits in the care home dayroom. What or who she has become is a difficult philosophical question, but she is no longer Katharine Whitehorn as was. Pause here to celebrate the real Katharine, the breaker of conventions with pioneering humorous columns about everyday life. Now standard fare, her Observer column delivered an electric shock to women’s pages of the 1960s, then filled with woollies, jellies and the etiquette of hats and gloves. Her 1963 praise of “sluts” – slovenly women, nothing to do with sex – made her famous for asking, “Have you ever taken anything out of the dirty-clothes basket because it had become, relatively, the cleaner thing?” Frankness about untidy lives was her hallmark. After joining the Picture Post in 1956, she wrote as a single woman in London; her Cooking in a Bedsitter remained in print for more than 40 years. When I started out on the Observer in 1968 as a junior on its miscellaneous Pendennis column, she was a megastar columnist, 20 years older than me, culturally and politically of another generation in another firmament. Though unswervingly for women, she never quite belonged to the feminist waves that followed her. Her warm insight into women’s actual lives – married to difficult men, coping, juggling – cast a caustic eye on mundane details and great questions alike. Her sons say without doubt that if the real Katharine could see herself now she would be horrified, never having wanted to end up as she is. Indeed, most people find the prospect of this ending a negation of self, denial of a life’s work and character, a mortifying indignity no one should suffer. Who wants to leave family and friends with a final memory of themselves as a vegetable, a distortion, an alien being? But even those who think carefully about how they definitely don’t want to end up find that rational plans, made in good health, usually slip away during a step-by-step medical decline, no longer in sound enough mind. Too late to say stop. St Joseph, the patron saint of the good death, deliver us from this evil – though it’s the religious, with their 26 bishops and other believers in parliament, who have repeatedly prevented us from gaining the right to die in dignity, despite years of overwhelming public support for this final freedom. Katharine wrote often of this, so we know what she thinks – or thought when she could still think. Ten years ago she reported for the Guardian on Oregon’s right to die laws with strong approval – except she thought only allowing the terminally ill to choose death didn’t go far enough. “Oregon at least shows the way forward for dealing with a problem that is not brought about by too little health care, but almost by too much – by our ability to keep people alive long after they would once have served their term.” In a YouTube interview you can see her airing that view. In 2013 she wrote a column headlined What the Death of My Cat Taught Me About Assisted Dying, asking why it’s cruel to keep a sick and suffering pet alive, but not a human. She complained that the current endless debate on assisted suicide would “limit it to people who are pretty certain to die in a short time anyway. If it were me, I would dread, far more than suffering just weeks before the end, the prospect of being incapacitated … Nobody insists that a cat has to be within weeks of death before we let it go; surely we should not deny release to humans with nothing but wretchedness ahead.” She ends, “How I wish one could wear a poison ring, as featured in Jacobean dramas, and refuse ever to be parted from it. No assistance would ever be necessary.” But that mystic ring that, with one magic touch, one kiss, sends its victims to instant death is denied to us. The dying are forced to stay when they long for the end: my mother dying in pain asked the doctor acerbically, “Where’s Dr Shipman when you want him?” Not there, no easeful death. No doubt the law will change, by slow degrees, allowing a slight hastening of death to those with imminent terminal diagnoses. But the greatest horror of all is Katharine Whitehorn’s fate, not dying, yet dead to all that makes life worth living. If there is value in an existence living only in the minute, a mind with no yesterday, and no tomorrow beyond the next meal, that’s not an existence she valued. And surely the real Katharine Whitehorn, the one in her right mind, is custodian of herself, arbiter of what or who is her real self and when to discard an empty husk? (And no, this personal custodianship has no bearing on the rights of disabled people.) Yet that’s denied to her, through no one’s fault. She wrote a living will, which her sons say demand she not be officiously kept alive beyond her wits. Yet there she sits, in a state she strove to avoid. She is on no life-sustaining medication that could be withdrawn: a body can long outlast its mind. She has survived cancer. Her sons say if she ever suffered pneumonia – once called “old man’s friend” – they would obey her and tell doctors to withhold antibiotics. Until then, she sits in God’s waiting room, surely a wicked God to wipe out all that makes a person who they are, without taking their life. How many times have I sat with friends, promising one another that we won’t let this happen to us. Yes, we’ll find the pills to do the deed, find the willing purveyor on the dark web. (No, none of us knows how to access the dark web.) We will know the right day, just before losing our minds. But that’s a comforting delusion. Chances are, we will not be in charge of our fate. Under current tyrannical law, a living will can’t save us from dementia. Mostly, Katharine Whitehorn is placid, but in rare flashes of depressed lucidity, her sons say she asks for it to end, to stop now. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/01/the-best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T08:00:46Z","webTitle":"The best recent thrillers – review roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/01/the-best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/01/the-best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup","fields":{"headline":"The best recent thrillers – review roundup","bodyText":"After an eight-year hiatus Henry Porter is back with Firefly (Quercus, £14.99), in which a 13-year-old boy has escaped from the refugee camps in Greece and is on a dangerous odyssey to Germany and freedom. But he has knowledge that has put him in the firing line of an Islamic State terrorist cell; they are determined that he must die before he can reveal details of operations in Europe. MI6 operative Luc Samson is tasked with tracking down the boy (codenamed “Firefly”), using his expertise in Arabic to win over his terrified charge and save him from his ruthless pursuers. Firefly marks the welcome return to fiction of a writer and journalist who has often decried the surveillance society. And it’s perhaps his concern for our loss of personal freedom that drives this galvanic novel: it’s not the all-seeing eyes of the security services that will prevent a large-scale atrocity, but the actions of one good man, Samson. With its vivid portrait of the flood of refugees moving west from Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey, the book could not be more timely, and Porter’s sympathy for the dispossessed is as cogent here as his skill at sustaining narrative tension. Political concerns are also at the heart of Darling by Rachel Edwards (4th Estate, £12.99), which focuses on the EU referendum result and its effect on levels of racism in the UK. Shortly after the vote to leave, the eponymous narrator gets abuse in the street for the colour of her skin. She is defended by another single parent, a white widower called Thomas. The couple develop a relationship and marry, but Thomas’s teenage daughter, Lola, has no affection for her new black stepmother, and the conflict between the two has disastrous consequences: a prologue tells us one of the characters will die. But which one? The writing here is unvarnished but persuasive, and Edwards’ societal concerns are threaded through her novel without cut-and-dried judgments. Some readers may balk at the way she makes virtually every character irritating – no easy sympathy is invited for Darling herself, with her faux-ingratiating tone of voice, while Lola has all the off-putting characteristics of a resentful teenager. There is clandestine evil at the heart of the book, treated with ambiguity rather than straightforward condemnation. The response to the three Raj-set novels of Abir Mukherjee has been one of unalloyed praise, not least for the fact that these exuberant narratives are so nuanced in their treatment of that era. Emotionally damaged English policeman Sam Wyndham encounters trouble in 1920s India alongside his intuitive Sergeant “Surrender-not” Banerjee, who may seem to be the Watson to Wyndham’s Holmes, but is actually the more perceptive of the two. Smoke and Ashes (Harvill Secker, £12.99) has Wyndham struggling with the opium addiction he is obliged to keep hidden. Less able this time to rely on Banerjee, he becomes involved with two cases – one of which, in a drugged stupor, he himself staggers across – where the bodies have been mutilated in ritualistic fashion. Rendering the investigation less important, meanwhile, are seismic events connected with the struggle for Indian independence. As in previous books, it is the flamboyant evocation of 1920s Calcutta that makes this such a mesmerising read. Charles Cumming’s The Man Between (HarperCollins, £14.99) continues the author’s steady upwards trajectory; he will soon be snapping at the heels of such masters as John le Carré and Gerald Seymour. In this standalone thriller naive novelist Kit Carradine is drawn into the duplicitous world of espionage. Carradine, seduced by what he sees as the glamour of British intelligence, is more than ready to take on the task of travelling to Morocco to track down Lara Bartok, an enigmatic fugitive who is linked to global terrorism. She has been a key figure in Resurrection, a Baader-Meinhof-like group that kidnaps and murders rightwing politicians and journalists (an early victim here is a female journalist who bears a resemblance to a controversial UK pundit). Inevitably, Carradine is attracted to the seductive Lara and is forced into a fateful decision. Barbara Nadel’s distinctive Istanbul-set Inspector Ikmen thrillers combine brightly coloured scene setting with deliciously tortuous plots – the resourceful Ikmen is always struggling with intractable cases. In Incorruptible (Headline, £20.99), the body of a young woman has been found crammed into a dustbin and festooned with cut flowers. Ikmen discovers that she was hailed as “the blessed woman”, apparently cured of cancer by a miracle and subsequently declared a messenger of the Virgin Mary. This beatific Christian reputation had not endeared her to the Muslim community, and many wanted her dead. But is there something else in her family history that has brought about her murder? Nadel has never shied away from contentious issues, and her provocative edginess makes this a forceful entry in the series. Robert Crais honed his craft on seminal American TV cop shows, notably Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice, and like his inspiration Raymond Chandler, he uses Los Angeles as a deliriously kaleidoscopic backdrop for his writing. His sardonic private eye Elvis Cole is securely fixed in the constellation of literary detectives, as is Crais’s other recurring character, the hard-as-nails Joe Pike. In The Wanted (Simon &amp; Schuster, £14.99), Tyson, a teenage burglar of upmarket homes, is being tracked by two brutal murderers, keen to retrieve a stolen laptop. Cole and Pike are hired by the mother of the missing boy to find him, and soon both duos are converging on Tyson – with violent results. Not vintage Crais, perhaps, but he still expertly delivers his customary modern-day riff on the 1940s hardboiled idiom.

The responses revealed a deep divide in Italy over the country’s inclusion in the eurozone. For supporters, Mattarella – who is an expert in constitutional law – took a necessary stand against encroaching populism, which they argue threatens to plunge Italy into another financial crisis. For his opponents, it was a heavy-handed, political veto against a legitimate and qualified choice – a former Bank of Italy official called Paolo Savona – whom Mattarella unfairly opposed for his Euroscepticism. Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the anti-establishment and populist Five Star Movement, called for Mattarella to be impeached, in a rare rebuke of the president by the leader of the country’s biggest political party. The tumultuous events, which have plunged Italy into a political crisis – some say it is its first constitutional crisis – have thrust Mattarella, an enigmatic and sombre public official, into the limelight. In the immediate aftermath of the election on 4 March, which resulted in a hung parliament, most analysts expected Mattarella to avoid an interventionist approach. But on Sunday, in the face of demands that he accept the nomination of an anti-euro finance minister named Paolo Savona, days after Italian markets were hit by doubts over whether the new populist government would adhere to fiscal constraints set by Brussels, Mattarella stood up against the populist leaders and rejected the choice. While it was seen as a surprisingly robust pushback by the president, it was a move that some people who have followed Mattarella’s career say was born out of his Sicilian past, and the tragic event that drove him into politics. Nearly 40 years ago, it was Piersanti, Mattarella’s brother and governor of Sicily, who was the politician in the family, while Mattarella was focused on legal studies. In January 1980, a mafia assassin murdered Piersanti as he sat in his Fiat with his wife and children, as they were heading to mass. Mattarella was one of the first on the scene – a famous photograph captured the moment he held his dying brother’s head in his lap – and decided to enter politics shortly after his brother died in hospital. “He is an example of an Italian moderate, a Christian Democrat, but with one special feature, which is that he experienced the killing of his brother,” said Sergio Fabbrini, the head of government studies at Luiss University in Rome. “He is gentle, moderate, but he is also very stubborn. He is someone who cannot be easily threatened by a young politician like Di Maio,” he added. In his former hometown of Palermo, old friends of the president spoke out in defence of Mattarella. “[He] has shown extraordinary respect for our constitution,” said Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo. “His decision is a choice that reflects not only the Italian people’s will but the constitutional principles.” It was a view echoed in Piazza Florio, in Palermo, where Sicilians regard the populists as having tried too hard to push Mattarella into a corner. “He has proved he has got a strong character. He has got balls. He is teaching those politicians a lesson: don’t mess up with a Sicilian,” said Giuseppe La Barbera, a bar owner. Others saw possible dangers ahead. “They thought Mattarella was a fool. They thought he was stupid. But guess what? He is smarter than them. And he did the right choice. What scares me are the consequences of his decision,’’ said Francesco Fiore, who is retired. Mattarella’s decision to block Savona, which in turn spurred Guiseppe Conte to resign and on Monday forced the president to appoint a new interim prime minister, Carlo Cottarelli, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, also reflected his authority as Italy’s president. Former presidents, including Mattarella’s predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano, have vetoed nominated ministers under previous governments, but in those cases, the prime ministers, including Silvio Berlusconi, have agreed with the president’s decision. Why did Di Maio and his coalition partner, the far-right leader Matteo Salvini, press Mattarella? Fabbrini at Luiss University said it reflected a populist desire – like by Donald Trump or the Nigel Farage in the UK – to test institutional authority, and paint all institutions as being part of the country’s “elite”. But, Fabbrini said, it would not be easy to portray Mattarella as a member of the so-called elite, given his Sicilian roots."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/28/football-transfer-rumours-emil-forsberg-to-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T08:15:27Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Emil Forsberg to Arsenal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/28/football-transfer-rumours-emil-forsberg-to-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/28/football-transfer-rumours-emil-forsberg-to-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Emil Forsberg to Arsenal?","bodyText":"RB Leipzig midfielder Emil Forsberg could become Arsenal’s first signing since the appointment of Unai Emery as manager. Valued at £47m, the Swedish “anti-Zlatan” has also got antennae twitching at Atlético Madrid and Juventus. Freiburg’s Turkish defender Caglar Soyuncu has revealed that Arsenal are after him too and has said he’ll hold talks with the club in the coming weeks. Soyoncu will cost around £35m, while the Gunners also have Juventus full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner lined up in their cross-hairs. The Swiss international is available on a free transfer from 1 July and Arsenal are reported to have a deal in place to sign him. Having made it clear that he’s not entirely satisfied with life at Real Madrid in the immediate aftermath of their latest Champions League win, bicycle-kicking Welshman Gareth Bale is once again being linked with a summer move to Manchester United. José Mourinho is believed to be unconcerned by the amount of time Bale spends sidelined by injury, although some reports suggest Real’s match-winner is not hugely enamoured with the dreary manner in which Manchester United play under his potential new boss. German champions Bayern Munich are also understood to be monitoring the 28-year-old’s situation with interest. Having used his post-match interview to hint that he too might leave the Bernabéu this summer, Cristiano Ronaldo has since expressed regret over his comments and was decidedly more coy about his future during Sunday’s homecoming celebrations. While much is regularly made of the manner in which Real “always find a way” to win the Champions League, it’s difficult to escape the conclusion that it was Liverpool who found a way to lose it on Saturday night. Most people’s big finger o’blame is pointing at Loris Karius, whose brace of blunders either side of Gareth Bale’s stunning overhead kick gifted the match to the Spanish side. Having had question marks over his future going into the final, the German seems extremely unlikely to play again for Liverpool, who are expected to ramp up their interest in AC Milan’s Gianluigi Donnarumma, Roma’s Alisson and Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak. Not deemed good enough to get in a very ordinary Everton’s side last season, Ademola Lookman was farmed out on loan to RB Leipzig and impressed the Bundesliga side’s bosses so much they want to make the move permanent. Manchester United are ready to bid the thick end of £100m to bring Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic to Old Trafford, while Real Betis are eager to sign Andreas Pereira, the Brazilian winger who has spent the past two years on loan at Valencia and Granada. In other news pertaining to United, reports in Italy suggest Paul Pogba would quite like to go back to Juventus after a mixed season in which he shipped a lot of criticism. And finally, Fulham will begin their preparations for life back in the Premier League by signing 20-year-old Auxerre midfielder Lamine Fomba."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/may/29/the-biggest-losers-productivity-commission-finds-super-funds-wanting","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T14:15:55Z","webTitle":"The biggest losers: superannuation funds found wanting | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/29/the-biggest-losers-productivity-commission-finds-super-funds-wanting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/29/the-biggest-losers-productivity-commission-finds-super-funds-wanting","fields":{"headline":"The biggest losers: Productivity Commission finds super funds wanting","bodyText":"A landmark report by the Productivity Commission has slammed the performance and transparency of the $2.6tn superannuation industry. It has made major recommendations directed towards making it easier for workers to choose their default fund, gain better returns and higher retirement balances, and to drive underperforming funds out of the industry. The report, released on Tuesday, is the third stage in the commission’s examination of the superannuation industry, which came out of recommendations from the Murray inquiry into Australia’s financial system, and assesses the industry’s efficiency and competitiveness. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And it finds much wanting. Over a quarter of the 74 funds offering a MySuper product failed to meet benchmark performance returns – accounting for 1.7 million member accounts and $62bn in assets. And such was the lack of transparency in the system that a mere five funds out of 208 provided the commission with information on their rates of return across all 14 assets classes, and 71% gave no response on the level of fees for related parties. The commission found it to be an industry with little sense of competition or accountability. It aims to change that. It also seeks to lower fees, given it found that they are higher “than those observed in many other OECD countries”. This is not just some theoretical issue – the commission estimates that a third of super accounts (about 10 m) are unintended multiple accounts – joined purely because of taking a different job. It estimates the fees and premiums in these accounts “erode members’ balances by $2.6bn a year.” The commission calculates as well that if members in underperforming MySuper products had instead been moved to the median of the top-10 performing products, “they would collectively have gained an additional $1.3bn a year.” Early last year the commission’s draft report proposed a shake-up of the way the default superannuation system is organised. Currently the biggest beneficiaries of the default system are industry funds as the fund can be made default as part of an enterprise bargain agreement. The banks of course would love to be able to get their hands on that money, given new entrants each year bring $1bn into the system. But the proposed system should give very little comfort to the retail superannuation sector, which is shown by the commission’s research to be woefully underperforming. It’s no real shock that retail funds on average perform worse than industry or corporate funds (which cover specific employees – such as Telstra and Qantas). Annual data from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority has consistently shown this to be the case. In every year since 2007-08, retail funds have on average had the worst five year annualised rates of return. In the five years to 2016-17, retail super funds averaged a return each year of 8.1%, compared with the average of 10.2% for industry funds: On an annual basis, in every year bar one of the past 14, industry super funds have on average outperformed retail funds: But what the Productivity Commission has discovered is that while the averages certainly favour industry funds, that does not mean being in an industry fund guarantees you good performance. The commission found that of the 20 underperforming funds, nine were retail (more than half of retail funds), six were industry, three were corporate and two were for public service. And of the 26 underperforming default products, 12 were retail, 10 industry, three corporate and one public sector products. Of the worst 10, five were retail funds, three were industry and two were corporate. The problem is it is basically just bad luck should your employment mean you end up in one of those dud funds or products. And it is a costly bit of bad luck. The commission estimates that a 21-year-old full-time worker with a salary of $50,000 who is in the median underperforming MySuper product would retire with a balance $375,000 lower than if they were in the median top-10 product – equivalent to seven and half years’ lost pay. To combat this, the commission proposes that rather than have a default fund, new employees submitting a TFN (tax file number) would be able to choose from a list of up to 10 of the best funds. This list of the “best in show” would be decided by an independent panel against clearly defined and published criteria, and would be updated every four years. The commission argues the list should be chosen “on the basis of achieving the best outcomes for members” and “should particularly consider long-term net returns and fees, as well as each applicant’s investment strategy, intrafund advice, governance and track record on identifying and meeting member needs”. When starting a job, workers would go to the ATO website, see the list (which would be randomised so as not to give advantage to the first listed fund) and also have “simple and comparable metrics on each product’s features.” The commission found that under such a system young workers would be able to make informed choices and be clear about what they were most concerned about – namely fees and rates of return. This certainly works in favour of industry funds, given the commission found that fees for such funds “on average remain well below the fees charged by retail funds”. The list would no doubt be very contentious – as would the appointment of panel members by the government of the day. The commission argues that, as the responsible minister would not be able to override their recommendations and the list would be subject to judicial review, the process should not become politicised – especially as the criteria would be clearly set out. This process would create a massive incentive for funds to perform well – but brings with it also a greater level of transparency that would have flow-on effects even for those in self-managed super funds and for underperforming funds. The creation of a best in show list would mean, for example, that financial advisers would need to justify why they are recommending a client not join one of those funds – especially if it is shown to be underperforming against the benchmarks. The commission also recommends giving Apra more teeth. It recommends legislating for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to apply the MySuper outcomes test, and that authorisation (legislation for this is currently before the Senate) and MySuper rules be strengthened so that funds are required to audit-level standard verification of their outcomes test assessment, with comparison against other products in the market, and determination of whether members’ best interests are being promoted, at least every three years. It also recommends that funds report to Apra each year on how many of their MySuper members have switched to a higher-fee choice product within the same fund – to prevent those funds on the “best in show” list using it to “upsell” members into weaker-performing and higher-fee paying products. The commission argues that should funds fail to meet these conditions — or persistently underperform over five or more years – Apra should repeal their MySuper authorisation. And that would be death for the fund – something the commission would welcome. Karen Chester, the deputy chair of the Productivity Commission, argues that this process should see underperforming funds either improve, exit the system or merge with a better-performing ones that would provide better outcomes for its members. She argues underperforming funds “need to be accountable for their performance” and “own the outcome for their members”, asking themselves “can I lift my game? If the answer to that is no, should I exit or should I arrange a merger? Which of those two options is in the best interests of my members”. She argues such a process is better than the regulator having to step in and decide the fate of the members. The report will no doubt be seen as highly political – it recommends, for example, the passing of the legislation before the Senate that would see stronger reporting on the outcomes test for MySuper funds, but also that one third of all fund directors be independent – something that would mostly affect industry funds given their directors are notionally split between employer and employee representatives. But given industry super funds accounted for eight of the top 10 funds and 14 of the 18 top-performing default products, it should not be afraid of this report – it vindicates their performance. And the best in show list would likely reward industry funds – and more importantly, bring rewards to workers both current and future. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/28/new-zealand-cull-cow-mycoplasma-disease","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T06:08:28Z","webTitle":"New Zealand to cull more than 100,000 cows to eradicate Mycoplasma disease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/new-zealand-cull-cow-mycoplasma-disease","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/28/new-zealand-cull-cow-mycoplasma-disease","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand to cull more than 100,000 cows to eradicate Mycoplasma disease","bodyText":"New Zealand will become the first country in the world to try to eradicate the cow disease Mycoplasma bovis, culling tens of thousands of cows in the largest mass animal slaughter in the country’s history. Government and farming sector leaders have agreed to cull 126,000 cows and spend more than NZ$800m ($560m) over 10 years in an attempt to save the national dairy herd and protect the long-term productivity of the farming sector, which is New Zealand’s second biggest export earner. Mycoplasma bovis was first detected in New Zealand in July last year, and manifests in mastitis in cows, severe pneumonia, ear infections and other symptoms. Since it was first discovered, 26,000 cows have been culled, and the disease is classified as “active” on 37 properties. Despite initially being contained to farms in the South Island, the disease has continued to spread and reached the North Island earlier this year. New Zealand police have launched a combined investigation with the Ministry of Primary Industries into how the disease made its way to New Zealand, and leapt between the two islands. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said: “This is a tough call – no one ever wants to see mass culls. But the alternative is to risk the spread of the disease across our national herd. We have a real chance of eradication to protect our more than 20,000 dairy and beef farms, but only if we act now. “Speaking with affected farmers in recent weeks it is obvious that this has taken a toll, but standing back and allowing the disease to spread would simply create more anxiety for all farmers.” Ardern said total eradication of the disease was possible as it was not yet widespread and had presented in only one strain. New Zealand is the world’s largest exporter of dairy, producing 3% of all the world’s milk. It has 6.6m dairy cows. Government forecasts estimate if the disease was allowed to spread unchecked, it would cost the industry NZ$1.3bn in lost production in 10 years. This month’s budget was described as “conservative” by the finance minister, who said he was keeping money in the kitty to deal with adverse events. The Mycoplasma bovis outbreak was the “rainy day” the government was planning for, Ardern said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/03/westpac-lost-files-of-hundreds-of-clients-whistleblowers-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T18:00:54Z","webTitle":"Westpac lost files of hundreds of clients, whistleblowers say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/westpac-lost-files-of-hundreds-of-clients-whistleblowers-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/westpac-lost-files-of-hundreds-of-clients-whistleblowers-say","fields":{"headline":"Westpac lost files of hundreds of clients, whistleblowers say","bodyText":"Westpac’s wealth management arm lost the files of hundreds of customers it was supposedly providing with financial advice, whistleblowers have revealed. BT Financial Group realised the customer files were missing in 2013 while conducting a massive operation to digitise its hard copy records. The project involved scanning roughly 38m pages, and helped BT meet the demands of the 2013 future of financial advice laws, which put the onus on banks to prove they were acting in their clients’ best interests. One source with knowledge of the project, who requested anonymity, said about 10,000 customer files were thought missing, although 8,000 were later found in branches across the country. He said the remaining 2,000 were re-created using information held by the business. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “They were only doing it to cover their arses. It was a complete cover-your-arse exercise, rather than having to do anything with the actual client,” he said. “It was clear from the first meeting I went to that they were on dodgy ground. They were just trying to make the best of a bad situation.” BT Financial Group disputed the numbers. A spokeswoman said only 215 customer files were detected missing. Evidence provided to the Senate in 2015 suggested a total of 89,000 advice files were digitised. It is unclear how long the files were missing before BT’s 2013 digitisation project, or how much the customers had been charged in fees while their records were lost. When BT realised the files were missing, they brought the customers in for a free consultation about their financial plans. “At the conclusion of this digitisation process, BT proactively identified a small number of client files that were not retrieved,” the BT spokeswoman said. “We contacted all affected clients and offered those clients a free consultation on their individual situation and financial plan.” A second source, who spoke to Guardian Australia independently of the first, said the files had gone missing for a variety of reasons. In a small number of cases, he said files went missing after questions were raised about the quality of financial advice. “There used to be instances where an adviser would get a query on particular advice, and the file would go missing,” he said. But there were often less nefarious reasons for their absence, he said. “They’ve had planners where client files had been stolen,” he said. “This was a broader activity to try and find all the files, so just because you couldn’t find a file it didn’t necessarily mean it had bad advice.” He said the process of recreating files wasn’t necessarily a bad one. Files were often re-created from information stored on financial planning software, which was reliable. “it doesn’t feel like you’re actually rewriting history, you’re just relying on another data source to get it,” he said. BT Financial Group has faced other scandals in recent years. It was found through the royal commission to have charged at least 2,000 customers for fees without providing any financial advice, a scandal it expects will cost it $21m. It was also found to have failed to warn rivals about financial advisers it knew to be dodgy. The corporate regulator took the company to the federal court last year for cross-selling Westpac’s superannuation products when advising clients. BT’s life insurance arm was also found to be rejecting about 37% of total and permanent disability claims. The company began a process of remediation in 2015 to detect instances where it had given bad advice or no advice while charging customers, and pay compensation. BT’s executives told a Senate inquiry in 2015 that it had found 11 planners who had given bad advice. Those planners had advised about 2,300 customers. When it gave evidence to the Senate, BT believed its remediation program would last 12 months. Its recent evidence to the banking royal commission suggested the remediation program was still going, three years later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/29/aflw-coaching-fiasco-raises-clear-issues-for-head-office","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T20:39:14Z","webTitle":"AFLW coaching fiasco raises clear issues for head office | Kate O'Halloran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/aflw-coaching-fiasco-raises-clear-issues-for-head-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/29/aflw-coaching-fiasco-raises-clear-issues-for-head-office","fields":{"headline":"AFLW coaching fiasco raises clear issues for head office","bodyText":"Last week, the Adelaide Crows announced the appointment of their new AFLW senior coach: Matthew Clarke. Clarke is also an assistant coach with the club’s AFL men’s side, and as a result, will have the full-time, year-round coaching role that departing premiership coach Bec Goddard coveted. Here are some facts: contrary to some reports, Goddard was offered a full-time role at the club, but it was not the role she desired. Eager to progress her professional development in coaching, Goddard sought a full-time role with other coaching duties to supplement her AFLW head coaching gig. The Crows, however, said they were not able to offer that, as all the men’s coaching department roles were full. Instead, they offered her a role in the AFLW off-season in their administrative department, for a rate of pay comparative to that of other administrators at the club. As Sam Lane critically pointed out in her column for the Guardian, Goddard (as well as her fellow coach Michelle Cowan) was already situated in the lowest pay bracket among her AFLW head coach peers – with wages in season one ranging from $40,000 to $100,000. Put together this information and you can see why Goddard walked away from the offer. As Lane wrote in the same column before Clarke’s appointment, one of the other irrefutable facts of this situation is that both Goddard and Cowan “wanted nothing more than to progress in elite AFL homes yet both have walked voluntarily”. They left their clubs “emotionally shattered” and it appears both are now lost to the AFL. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day It is incumbent on the AFL and its stakeholders, including the clubs, to do something about this dreadful situation – because as it stands it is a problem that affects women in a way it doesn’t affect men. Consider this: the Crows have said they could not find a role for Goddard in their men’s coaching department. Yet, after leading the Bulldogs to a premiership in his second year at the helm, Paul Groves was offered a new, expanded role as line coach for the men’s VFL side. Why was that kind of offer extended to Groves and not Goddard? The Crows might say the Bulldogs showed Groves undue favouritism and as such, “created” a role for him. But traditionally, that is what AFL clubs do to retain perhaps their most valuable commodity: a premiership coach. Clarke comes into the role with the benefit of already holding a coaching position at the Crows. He is the men’s ruck coach, a role he will continue in the AFLW off-season. When it was put to the Crows that Clarke seemed to be the direct beneficiary of the kind of dual role Goddard would have liked, they argued that this was possible because Clarke was already appointed at the club. How then could they could have offered the role to a hypothetical female candidate in a way that would make the position desirable? The Crows did indeed interview two women for the job, but if successful they would have been offered the same deal Goddard was: an administrative top-up role. There are some clear issues for head office. Undoubtedly, there are some women for whom this kind of offer would appear too good to refuse given how scant such opportunities are in this cloistered environment. But is this a gender equitable model to aspire to? This is the question the AFL should be asking, and taking steps to address. The AFL has since clarified that it is developing a program “to help develop female coaches” that will be announced in due course. This is a welcome and much-needed initiative that needs care, forethought and courage. A brave first step would be to own up to – and actively do something about – the existing gendered divide in the AFL. It is no secret or surprise that men are more likely to have existing football roles at clubs, therefore finding themselves in an ideal position to take on the role of coaching an AFLW team, which has a shorter season (although it should be made clear that for an eight-week competition, the role is equivalent to more like 26 weeks). An obvious way to address this would be to examine ways to promote and nurture women in leadership roles at clubs. The ideal case study, however, would not be Peta Searle: sidelined as she has been from the coaches’ box since Alan Richardson’s arrival. Beyond that initial step lies a more uncomfortable predicament. The AFL must then do its best to ensure that women who do breach the inner sanctum are valued in the same way other coaches are (especially premiership coaches). Put it this way: would Alastair Clarkson have been offered an administrative role to keep him at Hawthorn? On SEN radio, Daisy Pearce was asked about her thoughts on coaching career paths for women in AFLW after Goddard and Cowan’s departures. Pearce responded by saying that “as a player, I would selfishly want the best coach for the job, whether that be male or female.” The Melbourne captain went on to clarify that she could not comment on the Adelaide situation specifically, and that pathways must improve to entice more women (such as current AFLW players) into leadership and coaching in the AFL. But with due respect to Pearce, there is surely little more Goddard could have done to prove herself the best person for the role – having won a premiership in the inaugural season with a team split across two states. Her side was also a win away from the chance to defend that title in season two. Another uncomfortable fact of the matter is that Goddard is an outlier when it comes to gender equity in the sense that her record does withstand the dubious merit-based test. Yet most women won’t even make it to where Goddard did, nor have the chance to prove themselves in that regard. This is where merit-based arguments fail. After all, as Georgina Dent put it on the issue of women’s underrepresentation in the Liberal party, “to believe merit is a wholly fair proposition is to believe men are disproportionately and overwhelmingly more talented, capable and accomplished than women in virtually every realm”. In that sense, it is perhaps Pearce who said it best. “Maybe it’s not a coincidence that these four women [Goddard, Cowan, Searle and Meg Hutchins] haven’t thrived in this environment,” she said on SEN. “It’s worth a look to make sure there’s not something environmentally or culturally that’s disallowing women to thrive in these roles.” The truth is, Goddard did thrive. And it still wasn’t enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/28/monday-briefing-abortion-vote-spells-trouble-for-may","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T05:22:12Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Abortion vote spells trouble for May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/monday-briefing-abortion-vote-spells-trouble-for-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/28/monday-briefing-abortion-vote-spells-trouble-for-may","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Abortion vote spells trouble for May","bodyText":"Top story: Pressure mounts for Northern Ireland to relax laws Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories as you build up for a warm – and possibly wet – bank holiday. Theresa May’s alliance with the the Democratic Unionist party appears to stand in the way of a swift parliamentary vote on relaxing the abortion laws in Northern Ireland. After the Republic voted overwhelmingly on Friday to legalise terminations, there were widespread calls for the north to change its stance and swing into line with the rest of the UK. The Labour party was joined by Conservative MPs and the Royal College of Midwives in calling for change and a pro-choice group will keep up the pressure for reform as it plans to tour Northern Ireland offering abortion pills. The quickest route is seen as a vote in parliament where a majority of MPs would back the measure. Another option is legislating for a referendum in the north. But the prime minister doesn’t want to do either because it would alienate the deeply conservative, anti-abortion DUP on whom she depends to keep herself in power. No 10 says it is a “devolved” issue and must be sorted out locally. The only problem is, Northern Ireland’s executive has been suspended for a year ... * * * Italy crisis deepens – Italy’s nascent rebellion against Brussels has come unstuck – for now at least – as the prime minister-in-waiting, Giuseppe Conte, resigned after the country’s president refused his choice of a hardcore Eurosceptic as finance minister. Sergio Mattarella, who is unelected, said he couldn’t accept the appointment of 81-year-old Paolo Savona because he might “provoke Italy’s exit from the euro” and spook businesses and investors. Mattarella appears poised to ask a former IMF official, Carlo Cottarelli, to form a technocrat government today but the populist parties who installed Conte, M5S and Lega, will fight tooth and nail to stop him. Either way, Italians seem likely to be voting again by the autumn. * * * Festival deaths – A music festival in Hampshire has been cancelled after two young people died on Saturday amid warnings of a “dangerous high strength” batch of drugs. The two victims were named locally as Georgia Jones, 18, and Tommy Cowan, 20. They were both from Havant and had attended the Mutiny festival on Saturday to see Dizzee Rascal headline. Georgia’s mother, Janine Milburn, mourned her daughter on social media and warned other youngsters to avoid drugs. * * * Holiday heat – The south-east of England could see the hottest day of the year so far today with the temperature expected to push the mark of 29.1C set in April. Scotland will see the most prolonged sunshine but it won’t be as hot there as in the south where the humid weather is also likely to bring thunderstorms later in the day. They are not expected to be as severe as the ones which dumped a month’s rain on Edgbaston in Birmingham in an hour last night and caused flash flooding across the Midlands. One stretch of the M5 was submerged and had to be closed. * * * Trouble in store – If you’re wending your way home through a train or motorway service station today you might be able to judge if WH Smith is Britain’s worst shop. A poll published today by Which? ranks the ubiquitous newsagent rock bottom out of 100 retailers, with much of the ire directed at its often messy mix of newspapers, confectionery and irritating promotions. Topping the list jointly were beauty specialist Lush, the cut-price health and beauty chain Savers and the toy chain Smyths. * * * ‘Spider-Man of the 18th’ – A 22-year-old immigrant from Mali has been likened to a superhero after climbing up the face of a block of flats in Paris to rescue a small child trapped on a balcony. Mamoudou Gassama took just a few seconds to scale the building and pull the four-year-old boy to safety. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, praised him for his “act of bravery” and called him “Spider-Man of the 18th”, referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place. Lunchtime read: Amid Irish joy, a thank you to Britain Brexit has raised many questions about Britain’s place in the world, especially about our attitude to migrants. So it’s interesting to read Anne Enright’s open letter to Britons thanking them for offering hope to Irish women seeking abortions for so long. “Thanks for putting up with decade upon decade of another country’s problem and not turning this into a political argument or a cause of difficulty – but just getting on with it as the women arrived,” she writes. The abortion vote was clearly the standout story of the weekend and we also have a piece from Dublin about how it was the joyous culmination of years of campaigning for activist Anne Marie Keary. Sport Finally, 109 years after the Gazzetta dello Sport decided to hold a bike race across Italy to boost sales, Britain has its first Giro d’Italia winner. Yet despite Chris Froome’s win in Rome, questions remain about whether, with an adverse analytical finding, he should have been taking part at all. Joe Root says England were “collectively under par” in their chastening nine-wicket defeat to Pakistan in the opening Test at Lord’s. Corruption allegations have cast a shadow but the tourists had their house in order with England in a mess. Jürgen Klopp will make a renewed attempt to prise the goalkeeper Alisson from Roma this summer as he looks to upgrade Liverpool’s squad following defeat in the Champions League final. Chris Ashton’s return to Twickenham always had the potential to be proper box office and the former England winger scored a stirring hat-trick of tries for the Barbarians against his formner team-mates. British Davis Cup sensation Cameron Norrie is playing in only his third major but he has a method on red clay that may keep him at the French Open for a while. And yet another dazzling performance by LeBron James means the Cleveland Cavaliers are in the NBA playoff finals at the expense of the Boston Celtics. Business Asian stocks made gains overnight on hopes that the US-North Korea summit might still, after all, go ahead next month. Maybe. That mean the oil price slipped back a little. The euro has had a good session so far, bouncing back from a six-month low after the Italian president nixed the choice of a Eurosceptic as finance minister. The pound is buying $1.333, but is down at €1.137. The papers There is no agreement on the top story this morning. The Telegraph splash head says “Use extra funding for tech if NHS is to survive”, while the Times reports on a pay rise for the armed services. They both touch on Brexit, but the FT leads on it with the headline “Lack of ‘no-deal’ plan weakens May’s threat to quit Brexit talks’. The Guardian leads with the aforementioned Northern Ireland abortion story, and also reports on the deaths of two festivalgoers in Hampshire linked to a bad batch of drugs. Several others lead with quotes from the mother of one of the victims, 18-year-old Georgia Jones: “Don’t die like my little girl,” says the Sun, while the Mirror says “Two pills and my little girl was gone”.

Hosted by Coachella promoters Goldenvoice and its parent company AEG (founded by controversial Republican donor Philip Anschutz), the bumper 10-day event was set to oust long-term residents Field Day, Lovebox and Citadel from east London’s Victoria Park. Really, this wasn’t a straightforward case of imperious corporate giant v the little guys – Lovebox for one is owned by promoter behemoth Live Nation – but that hasn’t prevented APE from acquiring the air of a bland business venture. It’s difficult to detect any specific identity among the branded displays and colossal Pizza Express concessions, and while its displaced forebears all have distinct party lines – Field Day continues to act as a hipster haven, Lovebox has doubled down on rap and R&amp;B and Citadel focuses on indie and extra-musical entertainment – the All Points East lineup seems strung together by neither style nor sensibility. That said, the festival’s big bookings are strong enough to warrant a little fuzziness elsewhere. Friday’s main stage sported a double dose of New York City nostalgia from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and LCD Soundsystem – eminently danceable and insistently poignant, they are the platonic ideal of festival headliners. While you could argue that Saturday’s bill-toppers the xx also boast those qualities, the London trio weren’t quite as compelling: their tendency to revert to a glacial pace meant their set sagged slightly in the middle. More triumphant was Father John Misty’s polyphonic folk, and Lorde, whose unorthodox pop amassed euphoric heft along the way. The afternoon bills felt thin, though there were gems to be found. Hookworms provided a warm blast of emo-punk; Stefflon Don gave a masterclass in sonorous dancehall; Hercules and Love Affair showcased sumptuous disco. In fact, there was a strong dance music showing, with a DJ-dedicated stage and a weekend-long outing for James Murphy and Soulwax’s brilliant makeshift club Despacio. It was left to Sunday headliner Björk to create a lasting impression for this rather disparate series of shows. Doubling as the first UK date on her European tour, her stunning avant-pop opera had a suitably awesome backdrop in the form of a (real) full moon and lightning display – plus a lush woodland stage set. Largely a showcase of songs from last year’s “Tinder album” Utopia, the title track’s pastoral woodwind was quickly flooded by treacly bass, and the twisted bucolicism continued from there: glitchy storms of production juxtaposed against impish flautists and Björk’s unmistakable voice. The latter, both urgent and brittle, ensured that even old hits such as Human Behaviour bristled with life. In many ways, Björk’s performance felt detached from the surroundings – her career has been defined by idiosyncrasy and integrity, which aren’t exactly All Points East buzzwords – but it provided an undoubtedly sublime climax to the weekend nevertheless. Not that this spelled the end of All Points East’s debut outing: the next few days will see the festival grounds stage free community-minded events, while the final stretch will be filled, confusingly, by a trio of one-off gigs that very much resembles another three-day festival. It remains to be seen whether its backers believe it’s worth carving out any sort of coherent character for All Points East. Currently little more than a showcase for high-calibre (and presumably pricey) headline acts, its debut proved a decent if not especially distinctive addition to the festival calendar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/28/barnaby-joyce-lost-right-to-demand-privacy-after-selling-story-mp-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T08:55:34Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce lost right to demand privacy after selling story, MP says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/28/barnaby-joyce-lost-right-to-demand-privacy-after-selling-story-mp-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/28/barnaby-joyce-lost-right-to-demand-privacy-after-selling-story-mp-says","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce lost right to demand privacy after selling story, MP says","bodyText":"Barnaby Joyce can no longer complain about his privacy being invaded after reportedly accepting a $150,000 payment for a tell-all interview, said the man dumped from the frontbench by the former Nationals leader.

Joyce’s colleagues have shied away from publicly criticising the decision, with most only saying it was a private matter, following a pattern set on Sunday, when the news of the interview payment broke. “What Barnaby and Vikki decide on is their decision – I’m not going to be second-guessing what they should or shouldn’t be doing,” David Gillespie told Sky News. “I wouldn’t be doing interviews for cash, but that’s their choice.” National party stalwart John “Wacka” Williams told ABC radio it was “up to him to decide” what Joyce did with his private life. “I’m not going to make a judgment one way or another about whether he’s doing right or wrong.” But privately, Joyce’s colleagues are fuming that the former deputy prime minister has, according to one Coalition colleague, “once again grabbed the headlines, just as we were making some leeway”. “Every time we start to get back on track, he comes out with something new,” the colleague said. “Every single time. Every time. “He popped up last week, talking to the cameras again [about the live sheep export trade], so he has obviously decided he’s had enough time in the wilderness, and now we are dealing with him accepting money to talk about the relationship which derailed everything we have been trying to do all year. He just needs to shut the hell up.” The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, declined to comment when asked if politicians should be accepting money for interviews, only saying he did not believe there needed to be legislation to prevent it from happening. He did not address whether the regulations that dictate MPs’ behaviour and responsibilities needed to change. But Chester said he was “uncomfortable” with politicians accepting money for interviews. “It is a personal matter and it has been played out very publicly, and I am uncomfortable about chequebook journalism as a rule. My background is as a journalist, so I am uncomfortable about that,” he said. “And I am also uncomfortable about members of parliament being paid for interviews. This one is a bit different because, as I understand it, the payment is to go into a trust fund for his son. “And there is a third party involved – Miss Campion – who has every right as a private citizen to sell her story if she likes. It is pretty complex, but as a matter of principle, I am not a big fan of chequebook journalism or MPs being paid for interviews.” Joyce has not publicly confirmed the amount, or that it was either he or his partner who are responsible for a complaint to the Australian Press Council about News Corp coverage of their relationship, which ultimately led to his forced resignation as Nationals leader. Earlier this year, Joyce, in an unpaid interview with Fairfax, asked for privacy for his family, declaring it was time to “move on”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/28/unfortunate-the-carbon-tax-coincided-with-soaring-network-costs-rod-sims-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T06:26:34Z","webTitle":"'Unfortunate' the carbon tax coincided with soaring network costs, Rod Sims says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/28/unfortunate-the-carbon-tax-coincided-with-soaring-network-costs-rod-sims-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/28/unfortunate-the-carbon-tax-coincided-with-soaring-network-costs-rod-sims-says","fields":{"headline":"'Unfortunate' the carbon tax coincided with soaring network costs, Rod Sims says","bodyText":"The timing of the carbon tax was “unfortunate” because it coincided with soaring electricity network costs that have underpinned increases to household bills, the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has told a forum in Brisbane. The ACCC is next month due to hand to government its final report on the electricity market. The body’s chairman, Rod Sims, said on Monday he was unable to reveal specific details but gave some hints about the direction the inquiry had taken. Unlike the interim report, which was released last year and which charted factors that had caused bills to increase over time, the next phase would outline a “tricky” path to ultimately bringing those prices down, Sims said. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon He also flagged tougher “enforcement action” against power retailers whose pricing and discounting remained confusing. “We’re going to see how we can get the retail market less opaque,” Sims said. “We are looking at taking some enforcement action. We’ve done it before and it didn’t sort out ... this sort of behaviour. So we think something more is required.” Speaking at a Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) energy forum in Brisbane, Sims said there was a simple fix for the gas market. He said gas prices soared after states such as NSW and Victoria put in place effective moratoriums on onshore drilling. “Ultimately, what the gas market needs is more gas,” Sims said. Sims said transitioning the electricity market towards renewable energy had been a complex process, but that it was not the main contributor to the spike in household prices. Network charges, and not the cost of renewables or the carbon tax, had the biggest impact on bills. “The main reason our power prices have gone up is because of network costs, which have pretty much nothing to do with ... whether they’re generated by renewable energy or coal,” Sims said. “When we started tackling climate change and the carbon tax was introduced was the same time that network charges were going through the roof. The timing was quite unfortunate.” Sims said subsidies for renewable projects would “close to disappear” by 2020 and new projects from then would need to link to the energy grid to be profitable. “In a sense we didn’t transition to renewables, we went straight to them,” he said. “The way they were subsidised didn’t link them to the energy system. They were subsidised to be there, not linked to the energy system, so you had a mismatch.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/30/australia-enters-the-unknown-in-new-era-of-world-cup-coverage","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"Australia enters the unknown with new era of World Cup coverage | Jonathan Howcroft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/30/australia-enters-the-unknown-in-new-era-of-world-cup-coverage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/30/australia-enters-the-unknown-in-new-era-of-world-cup-coverage","fields":{"headline":"Australia enters the unknown in new era of World Cup coverage","bodyText":"The mellifluous ooh sound Les Murray fashioned when forming the word football is the source of vivid Proustian memories throughout Australia. It transports the world game’s true believers to weekend afternoons watching Murray and Johnny Warren putting the world to rights. For tourists to planet soccer it’s the soundtrack to the World Cup, those quadrennial winters when Murray invited himself into the nation’s front rooms to steward the uninitiated through festivals of futbol. For the first time since Mexico 1986 Murray will not be headlining Australia’s World Cup broadcast. He died last year aged 71, three years after announcing on-air that Brazil 2014 would be his last tournament in front of the camera. He leaves behind enormous shoes to fill. The task of maintaining Murray’s World Cup legacy falls not only to his successors at SBS, but Optus Sport, the pay-TV provider that is attempting to pivot from telco to Australia’s home of live football. For Russia 2018 Optus Sport have sub-licensed the World Cup rights from SBS. In a deal that satisfies anti-siphoning regulations, every minute of Russia 2018 will be available to Optus Sport customers while a hand-picked 25 matches plus highlights remain on free-to-air. Those matches include all Australian group games, two quarter-finals, both semis and the final. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day In other words, it’s still possible to engage with the World Cup without putting your hand in your pocket, but if you want the total immersive experience it’s going to cost a little extra: $14.99 per month to be precise, unless you’re an Optus customer with access through a complementary service, like a postpaid mobile or broadband connection. All the content will be streamed online, accessible via an app or found on TV through interfaces like Chromecast and Apple TV. It is a step into the future, and one not welcomed universally. Australian consumers are accustomed to major sport being accessible for free and without the technological risks associated with streaming services – such as the ones experienced by Optus Sport during the early days of its coverage of the English Premier League. It will take time to establish consumer trust, but executive producer Richard Bayliss is confident it is a mission his team can accomplish. “The technology is now is light years ahead of where it was a year or two ago,” Bayliss tells Guardian Australia. “And there are scores of people whose job it is to make sure everything goes off without a hitch and having seen how hard they’ve been working in the lead-up to the World Cup I don’t think people should be concerned at all.” It remains to be seen if Optus Sport can pull it off. Credibility is on the line with the World Cup representing the highest profile test to date of the nascent platform, and they can expect the slightest malfunction to be pounced on by disgruntled subscribers with any errors magnified by rival media agencies. The on-air production sounds ambitious with Bayliss, Mel McLachlan and Jules Breach anchoring a live broadcast stretching for 11.5 hours through the Australian night. Around the matches there will be supplementary content delivered from the Red Square studio, all with a focus on capturing the real-time experience and responding to unfolding events. For their sake, let’s hope there’s plenty to talk about. Over at SBS Lucy Zelic has inherited the hot seat from Murray and she will anchor the one live free-to-air match as well as the daily wrap show that will go out at 5.30pm AEST. “It will be a very poignant moment when we first go on air without Les,” explains Stuart Randall, executive producer for sport at SBS. “But we’re going to ensure we honour his memory throughout the tournament and we’re going to do a couple of little things to ensure he has a presence throughout our coverage.” For fans alternating between offerings, SBS’s package contains one notable advantage – live commentary from Martin Tyler, arguably the most respected English language football commentator. Otherwise the talent on display across productions will feature the usual assortment of former players and coaches, doubtless engaging in varying levels of air-filling analysis and “banter” to which we have become accustomed. SBS has opted not to invest in any supporting entertainment content this year, which means no Jimeoin’s Full Brazilian or Santo Sam &amp; Ed’s World Cup Fever. “Football is about many things,” Murray intoned during his final piece to camera at Brazil 2014. “But most of all it is about joy, a medium by which our lives can become more fun, something which makes us smile through our toils. The World Cup, more than the football, is about having a good time, about having a party, and as parties go, this has been the grandest of them all.” The next party begins with the opening ceremony from Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday 14 June. Australia’s first encounter is against France two days later.

They eat our crops and livestock, attack the wildlife that we want to protect, or the game that we want to shoot. The most common predators we routinely cull are foxes and crows followed by stoats, weasels, magpies and rooks. But other species protected by law are increasingly under the spotlight – including ravens, buzzards and badgers. There is an imbalance in the UK’s suite of predators. We have disrupted the natural order over centuries, by taking out many, if not all, of the top predators – wolves, bears, eagles, goshawks etc – that would naturally keep the others in check. Today the question of which predators we kill, where we kill them, how many we kill and who decides all this is one of the most divisive that conservationists face. Predator control is often brutal and bloody. It means killing some species so that others may live. It may mean shooting a fox that is hunting to feed cubs, so that a colony of Arctic terns can nest. It might require killing hundreds of crows so that sheep can lamb in peace. A life for a life. During the recent warm weather I went on a train journey. We slowed down in the middle of large fields. Close to the track was a Larsen, or “calling bird”, trap: a spring-loaded device for catching magpies and crows. The sun beat down on the steel cage with its lone prisoner. It was a stark image amid the heat shimmer and the short, green crops. The train lurched forward and the scene receded, but the image stayed with me because I knew what would happen to the corvids that answered the call of the captive and entered the trap. Either their necks would be broken or their heads smashed against a wall or the side of a vehicle by the farmer or gamekeeper. It is a quick and, I hope, painless death if done well, but it is still disturbing to picture birds killed in this way. The decoy is used time and again until it ceases to be effective. It too is then killed and a new bird takes its place. It is an efficient way of catching “pests” or “vermin”, as corvids are often called. Crow populations now stand at around 1 million breeding pairs throughout the UK. Their numbers have risen steadily since the 1960s. They have readily adapted to our intensively managed landscapes, and numbers are on the up – as are Larsen traps. The same tension between pragmatism and compassion is found in our attitudes to foxes. Around a quarter of a million now live in the cities and wider countryside. Many tens of thousands are shot each year, including those that are rounded up from city streets and released “humanely” into the green belt. Foxes can have a devastating effect on colonies of ground-nesting birds, such as curlew and lapwing, birds in serious decline, as well as poultry and lambs. Throughout the UK, farmers, gamekeepers and nature reserve managers kill an awful lot of animals so that others may live, and many nature lovers rail against this slaughter of our native wildlife. Compassionate conservationists, as they are called, say crows and foxes are not to blame; the problem is the way we use the land, and we should put that right rather than kill anything. An easy first step, many believe, is for the game industry to stop the release of 35m pheasants into the countryside each year, boosting numbers of predators by providing easy-to-hunt food and roadkill for them all year round. We live in a small country with myriad interests and cultural biases and where 75% of the land is farmed, much of it intensively. The harsh reality of our stewardship of nature is an ever declining number of wild species. Picking all this apart is incredibly difficult, and this is a void to be filled. The world of conservation is sorely lacking strong, honest, courageous and visionary leadership that speaks the truth and is unafraid of opening dialogue. At present it doesn’t come from the wildlife NGOs, which worry that membership may fall if the realities of predator control – which sometimes they have to practise – are widely known. To help start a civilised conversation, we need a common language that eradicates derogatory terms such as “vermin” and “pest”, which degrade wildlife. The dialogue, currently polarised between the shooting, landowning interests and anti-shooting voices, should instead be positive and inclusive, not accusatory and finger-pointing. A very good starting place is the recognition that we all want the same thing – a nature-rich country – and we must work together despite our differences to overcome the challenges of climate change, a growing human population and diminishing wildlife. If we are to tackle our reputation as one of the most nature-depleted countries on earth, a civilised debate on predator control is badly needed. • Mary Colwell is the author of Curlew Moon"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/28/labor-increases-newspoll-lead-over-coalition-52-to-48","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T22:38:56Z","webTitle":"Labor increases Newspoll lead over Coalition 52% to 48%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/28/labor-increases-newspoll-lead-over-coalition-52-to-48","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/28/labor-increases-newspoll-lead-over-coalition-52-to-48","fields":{"headline":"Labor increases Newspoll lead over Coalition 52% to 48%","bodyText":"Labor has increased its lead against the Coalition in Newspoll to 52% to 48% in two-party-preferred terms, despite a fall in popularity for Bill Shorten and majority support for the government’s company tax cut package. The Newspoll, released on Monday, found that 63% of voters support a 25% rate of company tax ahead of a two-month campaign for five Super Saturday byelections on 28 July, in which Labor is running hard against the government’s plan to extend that lower rate to larger companies. At Labor’s Victorian state conference on Sunday Shorten warned that the only way to stop corporate tax cuts was to elect Labor federally. He used factional backing from the Australian Workers’ Union and the Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union to shut down debate about imposing a time limit on offshore detention of refugees and asylum seekers. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The five byelections, scheduled for the last day of Labor’s national conference, which will now be rescheduled, come at a critical time for Shorten. The opposition leader’s personal popularity lags behind Malcolm Turnbull. The Newspoll found that Turnbull had extended his lead as the preferred prime minister, up a point to lead 47% to Shorten’s 30%, down two points and reaching one of his lowest levels since the 2016 election. The poll was the 66th straight poll in which Shorten has recorded a negative approval rating, although among Labor voters Shorten enjoyed 39% support as preferred Labor leader compared with Anthony Albanese on 22%. Among all voters Albanese is the preferred Labor leader, with 26% support compared with 23% support for Shorten and his deputy, Tanya Plibersek. The Coalition lost one point in primary support, down to 38%, while One Nation increased its vote by two points. The latest Guardian Essential poll and the previous two Newspolls had the Coalition trailing 49% to Labor’s 51% in two-party-preferred terms. Labor is campaigning against the government’s plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 25% for companies earning more than $50m a year but is wary of signs that the Coalition may drop the package. On Sunday Shorten told the Victorian Labor conference he was “damn sure Australians do not want to give a $17bn tax cut to the big banks”. It was a matter of “when, not if” the government dumped the corporate tax cut policy. But in preparation for a shift in Coalition policy, the opposition leader warned that the only way to ensure the policy never returned was to elect Labor. “If you want to see the corporate tax plan dead, buried, and cremated, do not believe what the investment banker and those who sit opposite tell us,” he said. “Because you know that if they ever control the Senate, that corporate tax plan, that rotten scheme, will be right back on the agenda.” Campaigning for the five byelections is in full swing, with Shorten to visit a GP super clinic in Devonport with Labor’s candidate for Braddon, Justine Keay, on Monday. Despite Labor fury at the 79-day delay before the byelections, the timeline will allow Shorten to put off damaging internal debates at the party’s national conference over asylum seeker policy. On Sunday Shorten said he was “very committed to making sure the boats don’t start again”. “The current government would like to say that there’ll be another policy; there won’t be,” he said. “We also just happen to think that we shouldn’t be leaving people in semi-indefinite detention for five years just to achieve this.” Labor for Refugees activists and delegates were outraged by the decision to postpone their plan to impose a 90-day time limit on offshore detention, as the motion was referred to committee. The CFMMEU Victorian secretary John Setka defended the decision as “democracy at work” on the conference floor. On Monday Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, told Radio National it was “not unusual” for motions to be referred to committee and the immigration policy would be discussed at the national conference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/ruth-davidson-michael-gove-tory-dream-ticket","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T17:08:08Z","webTitle":"The Gove-Davidson axis is a Tory dream ticket.

But does it have legs?","bodyText":"It is close to an iron rule of politics that leadership pacts and succession plans never succeed. Anthony Eden grew so frustrated waiting for Churchill to make way that his health suffered grievously. The briefly fashionable idea that Michael Heseltine would replace John Major, paving the way for Michael Portillo to take over, never came to pass. And as for the supposed “Granita deal” between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, enough said. So I approach with caution this weekend’s reports that Michael Gove could succeed Theresa May as a “caretaker prime minister” next year and then yield place, in smooth transition, to Ruth Davidson before the next general election. First of all, there are at least five other contenders for the top job who would not be sanguine about such a cosy arrangement. Second, politics rarely respects the lessons of game theory, in which wise participants seek “the action of greatest mutual benefit”. The default setting of the trade is Darwinian in its ruthlessness and chaotic in its patterns. Self-interest trumps collaboration; blueprints curl up in the flames of unpredictability. What is true is that Davidson and Gove have a strong affinity that surprises those who do not appreciate the nuances of their respective political identities, and are puzzled that an arch-remainer and one of the principal architects of Brexit should be on speaking terms, let alone be friends. In recent days, the environment secretary has been heard describing Davidson as one of the best reasons for the Tories to feel optimistic about the next general election. Davidson, for her part, knows that Gove is far from the tweedy reactionary of caricature. Last week they joined forces to launch the new thinktank Onward, whose explicit mission is to broaden the Tory party’s appeal – recognising, in Gove’s words, that Conservatives have to offer “a reforming, forward-looking agenda that responds to the concerns of the entire nation”. If that sounds like a statement of the obvious, take it from me: it is a proposition a great many traditional Tories still regard as faddish sloganeering. Gove’s championship of Brexit has obscured the complexity of his politics. Yes, he is an unapologetic believer in Britain’s departure from the EU, a passionate unionist, and the first Briton to interview Donald Trump after his election as president. But he was also one of the first senior Tories to press the case for greater social liberalism, an early apostle of what became Cameronism, and has long been a strong proponent of a Toryism rooted in decency as well as competence. As secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs since last June, he has tried to reconcile this apparent contradiction and demonstrate that it is a false dichotomy. Broadly, his argument is that Brexit will enable Britain to impose stricter rules governing animal welfare, higher standards in food quality control, and tougher action on plastics and other threats to the environment. This counterintuitive notion of “progressive Brexit” may invite scorn from those who see Gove as the incarnation of wicked Toryism. But his performance at Defra has earned him widespread plaudits from green groups, NGOs and sustainability activists who expected to hate him. Who could possibly oppose his launch this weekend of a review of England’s national parks or his heavy hint that we need more such protected areas? So the notion of a close understanding between Gove and Davidson makes perfect sense. The suggestion that Gove may take a second run at the leadership is no less plausible: he is a politician on manoeuvres, seeking to escape definition by Brexit alone. But I struggle with the notion of a caretaker leadership followed by a frictionless handover to Davidson. As Scots, she and Gove should know well the warning of their national poet: “The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men/Gang aft agley.” Were Gove to become leader – and prime minister – would he really want to yield power so quickly? Indeed, why should he? Which leads us to Davidson. Blissfully pregnant and engaged to her partner, Jen Wilson, the Scottish Tory leader is entertainingly brusque with Conservative modernisers who make the pilgrimage to Holyrood to urge her to seek a Commons seat and run for the top job. She asks them to name a prime minister who has left No 10 sane, in good health and with his or her relationship intact. More seriously, Davidson believes that she needs experience of governing as well as leadership if she is to present herself as a prospective prime minister. To which the answer is: become an MP, await your inevitable promotion as a minister, and get yourself ready. The “dual mandate” rule means that she could simultaneously hold seats in the Commons and the Scottish parliament (between 1998 and 2004, the late Ian Paisley was an MP, MEP and a member of the Northern Ireland legislative assembly). One of her closest allies tells me that he sighs inwardly when he sees a central London 0207 number flashing up on his phone, suspecting that it is another metropolitan Tory imploring Davidson to come to Westminster and save the party. “Why would Ruth want to be the fag-end prime minister of a fading government?” asks another Scottish Tory. “She knows exactly what she wants the party to be. But the time has to be right.” Davidson does indeed have a distinctive vision of modern Conservatism – open, pluralist, socially liberal, authentic, generous, relaxed – and it is one that scares the hell out of Labour. Just as Jacob Rees-Mogg is the Tory leader of whom Corbyn’s strategists rightly dream, so she is the contender of their nightmares. She is the only senior Conservative who could make the “absolute boy” of the left look like yesterday’s tomorrow man. But where Davidson’s supporters are wrong is to believe that she should bide her time and wait for the stars to align – or even that she has the option to do so. In modern politics, you don’t get to choose your moment: the moment chooses you. The spotlight sweeps across the landscape, capturing you in its blaze – and then, if you do not seize the opportunity, it moves pitilessly on. Convenience doesn’t come into it. She is by some distance the best hope the Tories have, and the sooner they, and she, act upon this reality, the better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/may/27/rupert-everett-gears-up-for-the-next-chapter-moving-in-with-his-mum","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T16:53:16Z","webTitle":"Rupert Everett gears up for the next chapter: moving in with his mum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/27/rupert-everett-gears-up-for-the-next-chapter-moving-in-with-his-mum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/27/rupert-everett-gears-up-for-the-next-chapter-moving-in-with-his-mum","fields":{"headline":"Rupert Everett gears up for the next chapter: moving in with his mum","bodyText":"He has lived the wild life in Hollywood and New York, partied with Madonna, hung out with Andy Warhol, and sniffed poppers with Hardy Amies but Rupert Everett’s next chapter promises to be more sedate: he’s moving in with his mum. “It’s done, I’m there,” the actor told Hay literary festival in Wales. “It’s very peculiar, I’m not sure if it’s a wonderful thing, or a tragic thing yet. “You spend so much energy getting away from home, but there’s something about age … you feel dragged back to the beaches of youth. I don’t know how it’s going to work out.” Everett visited Hay to talk about his film The Happy Prince, in which he plays Oscar Wilde. Written, directed, produced by and even starring him, it has taken Everett 10 years to get the financial backing to finally get it made. He admitted his career had been characterised by dramatic highs and lows but he would not have it any other way. “Everything good that has happened to me has happened because of failure in a way.” Everett said he had four years of fame and success in Hollywood starring in films including My Best Friend’s Wedding in 1997. But being an openly gay actor meant it was tough and there was never an option of hiding his sexuality because he enjoyed being out on the gay scene too much. “It was impossible to do anything else but play the gay best friend... and after a couple of gay best friends what can you do? People get bored with it. We have in Hollywood a world where straight people can play gay parts but a gay person does not have the same access to play straight parts. “Once I tried to move on from playing those parts, I was thwarted every time, sometimes quite dramatically. It was like hitting a brick wall.” He said things were changing but not fast enough. “In Germany, a fairly liberal country, there is not a single gay actor who is out. Not much in Italy, not much in France so I think it is still an issue.” Moving in his with his mother, a redoubtable figure in her 80s, is his next project. The house in Wiltshire has been split between them. “It is in the countryside, I’m going to be able to work and write and do some other projects.” Everett, who’s turning 59 on Tuesday, predicted: “There are going to be quite a few ‘star wars’ between us.” His Oscar Wilde film has been screened at film festivals and garnered good reviews with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw writing: “It is a part he was born to play, and he does it with exactly the right kind of poignantly ruined magnificence.” He has speaking in Hay with the BBC’s Alan Yentob, who spent five years making an Imagine documentary on the 10 years it took Everett to make his passion project film. Everett said it could not have been made without financial backers knowing that Colin Firth would be in it. He first met Firth as a young man seeing him on stage and having a complete crush.

There are real senses of loss in those countries – it’s beneficial to us as a nation to listen to those appeals.” He told the audience a friend of his had come up with a solution: “He said we should have a special version of Supermarket Sweep where every country is given a huge shopping trolley and two minutes in the British Museum. Maybe he’s right, maybe that’s the way forward.” Olusoga, who arrived in the UK from Nigeria as a child, has a particular interest in the Benin bronzes that are housed in the British Museum and other museums across Europe. He said the case to return them was particularly compelling. “I think it’s a very, very clear case of appropriation and theft,” he said. “They were taken in 1897 during the raid on the Palace of Benin. The palace was destroyed; they were taken and then sold to pay for the cost of the military adventure. Everyone was open about this – steal this stuff, send it to pay for the cost of the bullets. It’s just such a stark case of theft.” He said there were around 4,000 objects taken from the Nigerian palace that were national treasures. “The idea that your national treasure would be in the museum of another country is something that as British people we would find absolutely impossible to get our heads around,” he said, “but that’s what Nigerians have to think about. “The things that we regard as the greatest cultural artefacts, the greatest things we ever produced, our greatest works of art are in the museums of other countries, and we know the date they were taken and the circumstances they were taken.” If museums only sent what was back in storage, “you would have the biggest collection in Nigeria”. One of the most high-profile and perennially contentious cases involves the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum, taken from Greece by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century. Olusoga believes they should go back, as should objects taken from the summer palace in Beijing in 1860 by Elgin’s son. Olusoga said he was brought up in Britain by his mother who was determined that her mixed race children would remain connected to their father’s culture. He was taken to the British Museum and made, “I should stress the word ‘made’”, to read books about African history and Benin. The Benin bronzes are particularly powerful. “You can’t look at them and not remember where you are when you’re looking at them. Their situation, their geography is part of the story. They are wonderful works of art but they are mainly spread across Europe and America, and therein lies the story.” There is a moral case for repatriating objects but also a self-interest one in terms of making friends, Olusoga said. Museums argue that, by law, they are not currently permitted to deaccession the objects. Many have agreed to repatriate human remains, however, and the V&amp;A recently raised the prospect of sending back treasures taken from Ethiopia – after the capture of the mountain city of Maqdala – on long-term loan. Many museums have such loans in place but some believe they should go much further. The debate was given impetus in November when Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said in a speech: “African heritage can’t just be in European private collections and museums.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/27/liverpool-real-madrid-jurgen-klopp-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T16:09:53Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp’s alchemy requires new ingredients to reach next level | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/27/liverpool-real-madrid-jurgen-klopp-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/27/liverpool-real-madrid-jurgen-klopp-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp’s alchemy requires new ingredients to reach next level","bodyText":"Close to one in the morning, deep in the concrete bowels of the Olympic Stadium, Jürgen Klopp sighed with some feeling and prepared to put away the frazzled but stoically brave face he’d brought to the final post-match press conference of Liverpool’s season. There were two last questions from local media. Both were essentially expressions of pleasure at Klopp’s presence in Kiev, where he is hugely popular for reasons that range from Liverpool’s diaspora support to that translatable sense of authenticity. (“I like this Klopp,” was the verdict of one ex-Soviet citizen of a similar age. “He is for the collective”.) Question one went a bit like this: “Jürgen, as the last rock star of the modern era, would you say this season has been a battle for authenticity against the depraved stadium-rock football of Big Capitalism or what?” Question two was even more affectionate, and is probably best summarised as: “Mr Klopp, would you please just say something so I can bask in the glow of your charm and feel that beaming Jürgen-power envelop the room one last time before this is all over?” As ever Klopp played it straight. No. He’s not a rock star. But thanks. And no, Liverpool are not a force of red-shirted people-power fighting against uber-capitalism. They’re a business that also pays a lot of money for players just like Real Madrid. As for question two, well he’s fine, thanks. But he’s also about to turn 51 years old and has a very long journey home. At which point exit Klopp, bowed with a touching familial sorrow, like your favourite uncle at a funeral, and showing all the angst, the soul ache and desire to do it all again right now given the chance that you would expect from a manager of his pedigree. In fairness both questions were on point. Liverpool’s run to the final of the Champions League was remarkable for exactly these reasons. Firstly, Klopp has spent, net, almost nothing on players during his time at Anfield. In fact, player recruitment is trading at a slight profit for the club’s owners FSG. Despite this, Klopp’s team has retained a place at European football’s great gushing financial teat. Win or lose in Kiev, there will be trebles all round in the boardroom. There was some obvious evidence of this on the pitch. Madrid have not been football’s number-one spenders of late. But with the game in the balance they could still bring on Gareth Bale, a player at least as good as anything in Liverpool’s starting XI. For their part, Liverpool lost Mohamed Salah and were faced with a toss up between an unfit Adam Lallana and Dominic Solanke, who has scored just once in professional football. They had nine shots at goal with their star player on the pitch and four in the hour without him. Salah Can Karius may sound like a serviceable spine to the team, but as a gameplan it’s not enough – not least when Salah goes off and someone else has to do the carrying. And really what Liverpool do next is the most interesting question here, one that speaks directly to the lessons to be learnt from a 3-1 defeat to the masters of the modern club age. Madrid’s regal meringues, the cream of European champions, were resilient and also fortunate in Kiev. Yes, these are some creamy, jammy, chewy meringues but while the difference on the night was marginal, it was also consistently and insurmountably marginal. Madrid won because they have a stronger bench, a stronger attack, a stronger midfield, a stronger defence and a stronger goalkeeper. For half an hour in Kiev Liverpool’s plan to negate this pedigree was working. Forced to adapt by Salah’s elimination from the game – a clever foul by Sergio Ramos but not a deliberate attempt to ping his shoulder – they had no other gears to fight against these strengths. And so the game slipped away. By the end of 90 minutes Toni Kroos and Luka Modric had made 159 passes combined, 151 of them successful. Their opposite numbers James Milner and Jordan Henderson completed 50 passes between them. There is a significant gap to make up in basic footballing artistry, a gap Klopp’s blitz-attack plans can swarm around and over if everything is perfect. But he does probably need some help now. This was the nugget of truth concealed in the second closing question in Kiev. Klopp has been a transformative personality. He is wonderfully charming. He has done a wonderful, alchemical job with this group of players. This time last year Trent Alexander-Arnold was being nominated – and failing to win – the Premier League’s PL2 player of the season award. While Ramos was lifting this trophy last summer, Andy Robertson was being relegated with Hull. And yet Robertson lost nothing in the comparison with Marcelo, just as both Liverpool full-backs have looked entirely at home on this stage, utterly in tune with the focused, fast-forward nature of the run to Kiev. Klopp has the right to expect a little more now. He has provided a wonderful service to Liverpool’s owners: primping the global brand; forcing the club back to the grand stage of European football; opening up lusty revenue streams; and at no point questioning the resources at his disposal. Liverpool FC is in rude health thanks to the successful ground redevelopment, and above all the good vibes, the basic positivity created by the spectacle of full-speed Klopp-ball. There is another side to this: Klopp is a stayer. But he isn’t just popular in Kiev and Liverpool. It is possible for a star manager to outgrow the players at his disposal without a little consistent investment. This doesn’t have to be extreme, just well-judged. Look at Madrid: Marcelo and Casemiro came from obscurity in Brazil; Kroos was unwanted elsewhere; Modric was a handsomely rewarded punt; while Ramos was perhaps the handsomest punt of all. But as a minimum Klopp will probably want a new goalkeeper and a central midfielder in addition to the inbound Naby Keïta. The defence looks pretty sound now given Virgil van Dijk’s ability to steady whoever stands next to him, but a high-quality centre-forward to share Roberto Firmino’s load wouldn’t go amiss in this attacking team. Fight, run, harry and be damned has been a wonderful plan A this season. Liverpool can bask in the memories of some genuinely thrilling, high-spec football. But as ever with Klopp this is a moment not to stop, but instead to press even harder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/28/cristiano-ronaldo-future-real-madrid-champions-league-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T07:59:48Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid’s glory interrupted by internal politics with a twist | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/28/cristiano-ronaldo-future-real-madrid-champions-league-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/28/cristiano-ronaldo-future-real-madrid-champions-league-final","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid’s glory interrupted by internal politics with a twist","bodyText":"Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, said we had heard it all before but we had not, not quite like this. Sergio Ramos had not even collected the European Cup, their third in a row, when Cristiano Ronaldo referred to it in the past – to all of it. “It was nice to be at Madrid,” he said, standing pitchside at the Olympic Stadium, Kiev. Was? “In a few days I will give a response to the fans, because they have always been at my side.” And so a historic moment shifted. The night had yet another narrative. A few minutes earlier a pitch invader had stood between Ronaldo and a goal in the final, which might have helped to bring some of the sentiment to the surface but this, he later admitted, had been brewing for much longer: “When you hold on and hold on, when you have a heart and you’re honest, sometimes you lose control.” The stress on “have” as he stood by the pitch revealed that, while fans have supported him, others have not. There was a reflection of that desire for affection in the remark made by Sergio Ramos shortly after. Literally, it translates as: “Cris likes to let him himself be loved,” and it implies a want, a need, a call for attention, for appreciation. Back in Madrid, at the statue of Cibeles where they celebrate titles, he got that. There were chants of “Ronaldo, stay!” But while the fans’ relationship with him has not always been perfect, when it comes to those whose support he has missed, Ronaldo was thinking principally of Pérez, and it was Pérez who responded. “Now is not the time for individual issues; the club is more important than anyone,” he said. What came next was even more pointed. “I am glad he has five European Cups, like me.” And then he said it: “The same thing is heard every summer and then nothing happens.” They had not expected to hear it now, in the midst of celebration. They also did not expect to hear something similar from Gareth Bale, although that did feel different, Zinedine Zidane saying: “I understand him.” Ronaldo had just won his fourth European Cup with Real Madrid, his fifth in total. This is their fourth in five years. Luka Modric likened it to the Bulls, the Lakers and the Celtics, basketball teams that established a dynasty. “Now you can call this a dynasty too.” Marcelo called it a “special night” but now he was forced to field different questions. They all were. In the post-match press conference Zidane shrugged: “What do you want me to say? I can’t change what he said. But now it’s important to enjoy the moment.” By the time Ronaldo appeared again it was past 1am and that message had clearly been conveyed to him as well. “The timing was not ideal,” he conceded. He insisted he did not want to sully the moment for his team-mates, “the real champions here”, and the contrition seemed genuine. But he was not backing down. “Do you have something important to say?” he was asked. He replied: “Yes, of course; I’m not going to hide that. Maybe it wasn’t the time to say something, to get something off my chest, and I don’t want to throw away the credit that Madrid deserve, because this is something historic. But I won’t hide. I have a week now, to be calm, then I will join up with the national team on 4 June and I’ll say something. It was not the right moment and I didn’t mean to say that [then] but when you’re honest and you have a heart, things come out.” Things a little like this have come out before, which is what Pérez was getting at. He did not sign Ronaldo but rather inherited a done deal and the relationship has not always been good. Ronaldo has publicly said he was “sad” before, he had felt alone at Fifa galas, during his legal battle with the Spanish tax authorities, and there have been difficulties over contract renewals. One theory is that the pursuit of Neymar has not helped, just as it did not help when Pérez once told Ronaldo that he could go if he brought them money to sign Messi instead. Before Ronaldo last renewed his contract, negotiations had often appeared at breaking point. A year ago A Bola, a Portuguese sports newspaper, claimed he wanted to leave. Ronaldo never denied it but almost three months later he did remind people that the words were not actually his. These words were. “I cannot guarantee I will be at Madrid next season.” He was swift to insist this was not about money – nor jealousy. “I have five Champions leagues, five Ballon d’Ors, I’ve been top scorer six years in a row. Who am I going to be jealous of?” Madrid know how important he is – or the players do, anyway, and so does Zidane – but at some point the club know they will have to confront a post-Cristiano Ronaldo era. His position has ramifications for Bale, too; the departure of one may help prevent the departure of the other. The question embarking on a new era is when and how. Ronaldo is 33 and Pérez is not averse to starting now but Ronaldo has accelerated since he turned 30, becoming more effective than ever. “I know what I give the club,” Ronaldo insisted. Others, he feels, perhaps do not. This has a long way to go, even if in the next few days he does, as promised, make an announcement and even if that does reveal a determination to depart, with everything that implies. Or if he announces a change of heart, a rapprochement. It might be that nothing happens, just as Pérez claimed, but this cannot play out quite like those other times; we have not heard this before. “Where would you be better off than here?” Ronaldo was asked. “Difficult,” he said. “This is the best club in the world but life is not all about glory.” No, but the moment was supposed to be. It was almost 3am when Ramos left the stadium. He dashed past journalists waiting for a word – about the final, about history, about Mohamed Salah, about Bale’s goal, now of course about Ronaldo. He hurried past, grinned, winked and nodded at the huge trophy he carried in his hands, as if to say this is all that matters. And on Saturday night in Kiev it should have been."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/12/birdwatch-garden-warblers-are-losing-their-scrub-habitat","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T20:30:10Z","webTitle":"Birdwatch: garden warblers are losing their scrub habitat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/12/birdwatch-garden-warblers-are-losing-their-scrub-habitat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/12/birdwatch-garden-warblers-are-losing-their-scrub-habitat","fields":{"headline":"Birdwatch: garden warblers are losing their scrub habitat","bodyText":"Some birds are very well named: such as the cuckoo, treecreeper and song thrush. Others, including Kentish plover, grey wagtail and garden warbler, are almost wilfully misleading. Garden warblers are, unlike their cousin the blackcap, hardly ever found in gardens. They prefer thick scrub, a transitory habitat that is becoming harder and harder to find in our increasingly tidy countryside. One of the few places I still come across them is along the disused railway track running through the heart of the Avalon Marshes in Somerset. From the beginning of May, they sing their scratchy, warbling song, whose rapid tempo always reminds me of a skylark. The good news is that, unlike the more skulking blackcap, garden warblers are often very obliging, sitting right out on a willow branch, in full view. Some people regard the garden warbler as a rather underwhelming bird, and it doesn’t have any obvious features – no contrasting eye stripes or flashes of colour. Yet that open face, with its black, beady eye, combined with that charming song, are for me a true spring delight. • Stephen Moss’s latest book, Mrs Moreau’s Warbler: How Birds Got Their Names (Guardian Faber) is out now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/27/we-need-to-clean-up-our-act-on-roadside-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T16:02:37Z","webTitle":"We need to clean up our act on roadside pollution | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/27/we-need-to-clean-up-our-act-on-roadside-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/27/we-need-to-clean-up-our-act-on-roadside-pollution","fields":{"headline":"We need to clean up our act on roadside pollution","bodyText":"We must cut through the smog of rhetoric if we are to have clean air. Through deft political sleight of hand, the environment secretary Michael Gove’s defence of what the government is doing to address air pollution (Letters, 24 May) diverts attention from the cause of dirty air in most of our cities: diesel-fuelled vehicles. This risks slowing down the action required to tackle air pollution at a moment when more and more people are becoming aware that it is a serious risk to health in places beyond London. As city leaders, we are keen to work with ministers to tackle the wider challenges of air pollution, but this requires a government strategy that has cleaner transport at its heart. We need a national framework so that residents and businesses can make the shift as quickly as possible to less polluting ways of moving around. We know many measures need to be tailored to local conditions, but a consistent, national approach that acknowledges the seriousness and urgency of the situation is essential. That is why we continue to ask for a number of measures, including a diesel scrappage scheme and clean air legislation. It is not that roadside emissions matter above all else, but that we have only just begun to focus our activity on tackling this urgent threat to public health – and we recognise we have a long way to go. Freight, taxis and buses all need cleaning up if our cities are to thrive, and business opportunities for Britain for leading the shift could be missed if we take our eye off the ball. We urge an honest approach to what is working and what is not, together with the focus necessary for us all to tackle this public health crisis and secure the future of generations to come. Cllr Judith Blake, Leader Leeds city council, Cllr John Holdich, Leader Peterborough council • Michael Gove’s letter is a blatant attempt to divert attention away from diesel towards other sources of particulate pollution. Areas in breach of the EU air quality for small particulates are all urban, and if the more stringent WHO annual limit is applied, 85% of the urban population across the EU is exposed to levels above 10 microgrammes per cubic metre of air – and 100% in central London. It is disingenuous to pretend that the situation is improving. Levels of Benzo(a)pyrene, a carcinogenic subset of particulate pollution, have risen by 52% since 2000 due to the unprecedented rise in diesel usage. Instead of protecting old fashioned polluting technologies, Gove should be looking towards a greener future that benefits all members of society, and not just the car manufacturers. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Former chair, Campaign for Lead Free Air • The government’s clean air strategy is yet another example of its focus on meeting targets for air pollution, rather than truly improving our health. What is needed is greater understanding of overall exposure to air pollution – outdoors, indoors, across transport networks and in the workplace so solutions can be targeted. Legislation should also protect workers from exposure where businesses can take action to provide cleaner air. We welcome the strategy’s reference to WHO limits for PM2.5 rather than the higher EU limits, as well as a broader focus on pollutants, but the government’s plans to delegate responsibility locally are flawed. More centralised science-based research as to the cost-effectiveness of different solutions to reduce exposure is required – this cannot be resourced locally. Sophie Power CEO and co-founder, Airlabs • Motor traffic is the main source of air pollution in towns and cities, but so far the government has fallen woefully short in detailing how it plans to reduce car use and support more people to walk, cycle and use public transport (Wood burners could feel the heat in pollution crackdown, 22 May). More than 2,000 schools and nurseries in England and Wales are located within 150m of a road with illegal levels of air pollution, and research from Living Streets shows that one in three parents are now taking air pollution levels into consideration when choosing their child’s school. One in four cars in morning peak traffic are on the school run. Making it possible for more families to walk to school is an effective and practical way to reduce air pollution. This stands to have a much bigger impact on the air quality in our towns and cities – and around our children’s schools – than targeting the minority of people who use wood burners. Tompion Platt Head of policy, Living Streets • Your editorial highlighting the continued problems of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at the roadside significantly underplays the impact other pollution sources have on the health of the UK population (23 May). While excessive NOx from Euro 4 and 5 vehicles truly has been a Europe-wide scandal, the impacts of poor air quality on public health and the environment arise from overall exposure, not just from one pollutant and time spent at the roadside. The new Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) clean air strategy proposes that the largest overall national benefits can be realised through simultaneously reducing emissions from a wide range of sectors, and that is supported by the latest scientific evidence on atmospheric chemistry, health and ecosystem effects. Prof Alastair Lewis National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of York • You really got Gove rattled in your editorial of 23 May, which said that road transport contributes hugely to air pollution. Methinks he doth protest too much! He should be spending time sorting it out instead of trying vainly to defend the government’s woeful record. I have huge concerns for schools on busy roads with playgrounds a few metres from toxic fumes. Catherine Roome Staplehurst, Kent • Reading your article on particle pollution in London classrooms (Report, 25 May) provided me with the information I have been looking for – particle size. I first raised concerns about this in the spring of 2014 when all my spiders suddenly died. The response from various environmental departments was pure complacency, despite my pointing out that the most probable explanation was particle size, the same size that lodges in the human lung. The particle size that reaches the alveoli and lodges permanently is between 5 and 0.5 microns. Larger particles don’t get there, smaller ones are exhaled. Over time they build up, leading to various forms of pneumonoconiosis. There is no effective treatment and no one is immune. Government policy, as usual, is if we do not know what to do about it, pretend it is not happening. I am not being melodramatic when stating that in time it will kill us all. There is going to be massive healthcare demand far beyond what the health services can cope with. It will probably take 25 years plus to begin to show, but it is probable that the increase in respiratory diseases is largely due to the present levels of particulate matter in the air we all breathe.

To cheers of delight, the popular trainer’s Alpha Centauri finished strongly to poke her nose ahead in the final 100 yards of the Irish 1,000 Guineas here. One could almost call it a weekend of frustration for Aidan O’Brien, who generally dominates Flat racing in Ireland but had to make do with second and third places in a Classic for the second day in a row. But consolation is never far away for the Ballydoyle man, who saddled a one-two in the Tattersalls Gold Cup and is still the envy of all trainers in that he has the hot favourite for Saturday’s Derby being cosseted at his stable. This day, however, belonged to Harrington, who now ranks among the great dual-purpose trainers in the sport’s long history. Perhaps her recent achievements could be called one of the great, late flourishings in all sport since it was only last year that she got her first wins in the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Irish Grand National. “Fantastic!” was her verdict as she joyfully greeted her grey filly. “I’ve finally got a Classic. I’ve been second and third and the horses have always run well. This is a dream come true for me, it’s almost as good as winning a Gold Cup.” Prompted to reflect on her Classic near-misses of years gone by, Harrington named Jack Naylor, runner-up in an Irish Oaks, and Princess Sinead, third in this race six years ago. “And I had one that was second in the Irish Leger but you can’t call that a Classic, really, with the older horses and the geldings that turn up in it … ” On a colder, damper day at Cheltenham in March last year, moments after Sizing John had won a very different sort of race for Harrington, she was asked if there were any more targets in racing she wanted to hit. Getting a Classic was one and training a winner at Royal Ascot the other. Alpha Centauri – “a beautiful filly, a lovely filly to have” – has delivered one of those and could get the double up in next month’s Coronation Stakes, for which her odds have now been slashed from 40-1 to 7-1. She was evidently fancied by someone for this prize, being returned at 12-1 after figuring at three times those odds in the days before. Could It Be Love fared best of the four O’Brien runners in second, a position that surely flatters her as she was granted an uncontested lead on a fast surface. Happily stayed on at one pace to be third; it is to her credit that she has been placed in two Classics but she started favourite for both and does not look like building on her juvenile heroics. Front-running tactics also played well in the Tattersalls Gold Cup, in which Lancaster Bomber made all. Cliffs Of Moher, his shorter-priced stablemate, stayed on dourly to be second but looks hard to win with. His main contribution here was in leaning on the British-trained favourite, Defoe, who ended up in a pocket but was beaten in any case. Roger Varian admitted that 10 furlongs on fast ground was too sharp for Defoe and he will now consider races like the Hardwicke and the King George, hoping for ground no faster than good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/28/abortion-vote-thank-britain-irish-women-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"After the abortion vote, I want to thank Britain.

Thanks for doing it after the UK joined the European Union and through all the public bitching about Europe that followed, and also when Brexit has made things uncertain between your country and the rest of the world. Thanks for, maybe, thinking about this issue and then deciding you were just not going there, because there was too much suffering involved. Thanks to the clinics who took in Irish women born in the 1960s, women who were fleeing not just public shame but also expulsion from their families, homes and jobs: the clinics that took in those women in the 70s and 80s when they were anguished, trapped and dismayed by a pregnancy that would estrange them from their own lives. Thanks for not making it a social issue, as our social problems eased, for not talking about poverty or illegitimacy, for not focusing on how or why a woman “got herself” here, but focusing simply on the immediate and future risk to her wellbeing. Thanks for being, in practice, steady in your defence of the rights of women to make their own decisions and exercise their right to bodily autonomy. And, you know, there were probably a few nurses or doctors who were tired or indifferent. But really, overall, thank you. Thank you for not making Irish women feel more ashamed. Thanks for not making things worse. Thanks for being there for them when they were at their lowest ebb, for not blaming them, or raging at them, or calling them whores, or telling them to offer it up for the Holy Souls. Thanks for not saying they got themselves into this mess, now they may get themselves out of it. Thanks for not throwing them out into the street for daring to ask for an abortion, but for saying: “Yes. We can help.” Soon you won’t need to do this any more. On Friday, Irish people voted in a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment to the constitution of Ireland. For the first time in the history of the state there is the possibility that abortion will become legal on the sacred soil of Ireland. Because, although abortion was banned within our borders, the right to travel abroad to have an abortion was enshrined in the constitution by a referendum that was held in 1992. This made the prejudice completely clear. Such things could happen, but not at home. Shipping out our problematic and fallen women was part of an attempt to keep our own place pure. And what did that make you? Perfidious Albion. Perhaps this is one reason why your government never did get involved: the whole issue was so riddled with paradox, doublethink and make-do. We know that these things sometimes have to happen, but for God’s sake, let them happen abroad. Never mind the few who get “caught out” – who cannot, for some reason, make it to the airport because they are too young, or have no passport, or because they are too sick to travel, or too close to death to make it across to you. These hard cases are awful, not because we as a society are awful, but because they have no boarding pass. So thanks for putting up with this also, with our cruelty, our purity, our anguished writhing about. Thanks for not shouting at us, your closest neighbour, to say that we were in a trap of our own devising, that we should grow up, manage our own problems. Thanks for realising that we did not know how to be Irish, which is to say Catholic, and to do this too. Thanks for your patience. Some time in the last few decades, the trap began to loosen and let us go. We realised that Irish soil was not sacred, that it was soil like any other. Our lives were ordinary, and were not perfect. Our women were not more lovely than other women, and Britain was not a dumping ground, or an enemy, or a place of foreign and pernicious influence. It was a country almost in charge of itself, as we were almost in charge of our own. It was time to set some fantasy of purity aside, and get real. There is one corner of the island, however, that remains sacrosanct. Or infantile. Or in denial. Despite the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, abortion is not legal there either. This anomaly now cries out for reform. It is proof, if proof were needed, that a culture is not the same thing as a country, and national borders are only one kind of dividing line. The control of reproduction is a tribal matter. It is often phrased as a question of belief or of religion, but it is also an attempt to control the lives of, and the fertility of, “our own” women and girls. So thank you for not joining in the nonsense, for not drawing lines or treating us as breeding stock for one tribe or another. The care you afforded Irish women is a sign that our cultures have all kinds of conversations, exchanges and interactions, many of them hidden, complex and benign. So when you in Britain despair about how people are treated within your borders, when you despair about how migrants are treated when they cross into your lands, remember that you did a hard thing, quietly and for a long time, one that garners little praise. And that hard thing made the lives of Irish women bearable. Just the fact that we knew you were there. • Anne Enright is an Irish author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/08/northern-rail-extend-lakes-line-closure-chris-grayling-lake-district","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T09:06:21Z","webTitle":"Northern rail under fire for asking to extend Lakes line closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/northern-rail-extend-lakes-line-closure-chris-grayling-lake-district","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/northern-rail-extend-lakes-line-closure-chris-grayling-lake-district","fields":{"headline":"Northern rail under fire for asking to extend Lakes line closure","bodyText":"The under-fire rail operator Northern has been accused of breaking promises after it asked to extend the closure of a line in the Lake District following weeks of misery for commuters. The company announced on Monday that it was suspending the Lakes line between Oxenholme and Windermere for two weeks as part of a mass cancellation of services. But on Thursday night, Northern said it wanted to continue the suspension for a further two weeks, prompting calls for the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to intervene. Grayling told the House of Commons on Monday he was “profoundly unhappy” about the line closure and “not prepared to accept more than the current two weeks” of suspension. The former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, one of the MPs representing the area, described Northern’s request as a “disgrace” and called for the transport secretary to reject it. Cumbrian businesses have warned the closure of the line risks doing irreparable harm to the region’s tourism industry. The line, which was earmarked for closure as part of the Beeching rail cuts in the 1960s, is a vital link to some of the most idyllic spots in the Lake District. Speaking to the Guardian on Friday, Farron said: “This iconic line that escaped the Beeching axe now faces death by Northern’s incompetence and the government’s inaction. “Chris Grayling promised on Monday that he would block any extension to the Lakes line cancellation. He must keep his word and tell Northern to do its job and run trains.” The Department for Transport has yet to return a request for comment, but BBC Radio Cumbia reported the department had not objected to the longer suspension. Grayling is facing questions about whether he approved the extension, after earlier indicating he would not. Transport for the North, a statutory body that advises the government on strategy and investment, said it “reluctantly accepted” Northern’s request to extend the line closure on the basis that the operator said reopening the line as planned would cause further delays in Cumbria and beyond. John Cridland, the TfN chairman, urged Northern to examine ways in which the line could be restored “by the beginning of July at the latest”. “It’s disappointing that we are in this position, as communities and businesses rely on the Lakes line service,” he said. “Northern must now do everything they can to get a train service running again on that line as soon as possible. This cannot go on for a prolonged period. “Northern has said that passengers would be likely to experience further cancellations and unscheduled delays across the Lakes and wider network if services are reinstated. As the voice of the north’s communities, we cannot responsibly insist that they take that operational decision. The passengers come first.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/11/feral-horses-are-incompatible-with-a-world-heritage-area-its-one-or-the-other","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T02:49:09Z","webTitle":"Feral horses are incompatible with a world heritage area.

It's one or the other","bodyText":"Last year, I drove up to the New South Wales high country with my oldest son. We arrived at Geehi, found a camp site, rigged up our rods and waded into the crystal clear water, hoping to snag a trout. Between casts, my attention was drawn to a pair of black cockatoos, sailing overhead. Looking up, I noticed the main range of Kosciuszko. Ancient and imposing, granite worn smooth by rain and snow, embroidered with lichens and wildflowers. I don’t know how long we stood there, in silent awe of the jagged peaks, but it’s a treasured moment frozen in time. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday In the weeks leading up to this trip, this place had been occupying my mind. As a member of the NSW threatened species scientific committee, I’d been involved in monthly day-long meetings for the past few years, participating in detailed discussions with people who knew far more than me about frogs and plants, bats and snails. I’m an ecologist — for the past 25 years, I’ve studied interactions between plants and animals — working out why some areas support more diversity, why particular plants and animals have positive or negative effects on their communities. This group of independent experts, appointed by the NSW minister for the environment was charged with synthesising available information about species, communities and ecological processes, advising government on the top priorities for management. With shrinking budgets and the ever-present spectre of unprecedented climatic conditions, we wanted to ensure we were giving government the most up-to-date advice in our determinations. We worked diligently through hundreds of pages of journal articles and reports, emails from experts and concerned stakeholder groups. One of the determinations we were working on was listing feral horses as a Key Threatening Process. The literature was quite clear on this issue. As with deer, goats and all the other exotic ungulates in Australia, these large hoofed animals have dramatic impacts on soils, breaking through the delicate crusts that hold them together, compacting the soil down so that they can no longer soak up water when it rains. But horses have a range of other effects. Unlike native grazers, they need to drink daily, chopping up creek-banks as they come and go. And because they don’t chew their food as much as deer and goats, many seeds pass through intact, including many weeds, tracked far into remote corners of this rugged country miles from management trails. Some of the clearest information about how horses affect Australian environments comes from the high country, where fenced-out plots demonstrate just how dramatically they’ve altered these alpine communities. Within Kosciuszko national park, a 2008 report found 76% of stream banks were degraded in areas with horses, compared with 11% in areas where horses didn’t occur. We, the scientific committee, tallied the information, compared it with international benchmarks, finessed the language to ensure it was balanced and evidence-based, then voted and moved on to the next determination. While this draft determination was open for public comment, John Barilaro, the outspoken Nationals state member for Monaro and deputy leader of the NSW government introduced a bill into parliament. The proposed legislation protects feral horses within Kosciuszko national park, requiring all future management plans for this National Heritage Listed area to consider the cultural significance of horses. We felt gutted. Not only did this fly in the face of the document we had just prepared for government, it made a mockery of the years of careful scholarship distilled within it. Discussing this issue with my wife and sons, we decided that if this bill was passed, I would have no option but to resign. And last Wednesday, the bill was passed without amendment. The minister for environment our committee directly advised gave the brumby bill her strong support. The next day, I resigned, sharing my letter over Twitter. Much has been written about this issue, but let’s be crystal clear — feral horses are incompatible with protected area management. It’s one or the other. You can have brumbies and trail-rides and epic mountain adventures on horseback, but all of these things cannot occur within a national park without causing further damage to the very flora, fauna and ecological communities the park was established to protect. Putting horses, mountains and the complexities of feral animal management to one side, this issue brings into very sharp focus the disdain our government shows for science. Being a “clever country” necessarily involves listening to our scientific community. If governments continue to ignore considered advice from the very panels they sanctioned specifically to give them considered advice, a lesser Australia awaits. An Australia where sharing quiet moments with your kids, wading along a crystal clear mountain creek, is no longer possible. Our rivers fouled, our mountains choked with weeds. Maybe they’ll tell stories about that instead. Or write poems. • This article was amended on 13 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to Kosciuszko as a world heritage area.

The next time you’ll see this Australian team it will be when they face France in Kazan, on June 16. If they play like that against Griezmann, Mbappe and Pogba, they will get absolutely gubbed. But weird things happen at the World Cup. Thanks for reading! Well, what to make of that from an Australian perspective? A win’s a win’s a win, but they were entirely unconvincing for the majority of the game, the first goal a rare moment of quality and the second an absolute gift. Their attack was a little toothless and the defence shakey, although admittedly the latter only really became so after Mat Ryan went off and Brad Jones came on. Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins + 2: Oh boy. Oh boy oh boy oh boy. The slapstick is catching: Irvine gets down the left, he hooks his left foot around a cross and Kadar is there - under precisely zero pressure from zero attackers - to neatly slot the ball between his own goalkeeper’s legs. The nutmeg was a nice, if slightly too flamboyant touch. 90 mins: Eesh, that was unnecessary. Three minutes of added time. 89 mins: Well that was weird. Fiola put a cross in from the right, only one Hungarian attacker seemed half-interested in going for it, had Sainsbury left it then Jones would have collected it with no problems at all. But for some reason, at the last minute Sainsbury ducked his head into the ball, sending it past Jones as he frantically put on the brakes and tried to clear up his colleague’s horrendous rick, but to no avail. Oh, Trent... 86 mins: Cahill and Vinicius go up for a header, they clash bonces but only the Hungarian seems to suffer any pain. Cahill trots off with nary a care in the world. 83 mins: Cahill amongst things straight away, going up for a header with Dibusz from a big cross to the back post, but he fouled the goalkeeper and a free-kick is thus awarded. 80 mins: Well this can’t be good news: Juric, of course carrying that knee injury, has to come off after himself only coming on at half-time. There didn’t look to be a specific incident and he wasn’t in obvious, troubling pain, but unless this is a truly unconventional motivation technique by Van Marwijk then it could be bad news for his chances in Russia. Tim Cahill replaces him. 78 mins: Fiola (who came on for Lovrencsics just before the goal - sorry) gets into a tangle with Mooy, and unconventionally tries to get himself out of the tangle by lifting the Huddersfield midfielder off his feet with his back. Which was a bit weird. He gets a booking for it, anyway. 76 mins: Hungary go close to getting straight back in it, as Varga curls a free-kick over the wall but Jones skips across to make a fairly straightforward save. 74 mins: Well that worked out nicely. In his first involvement since coming off the bench, Arzani cuts in from the left, just outside the box and shoots. There was some power behind it but Dibusz in the Hungary goal really should have saved it. Impact rating: instant. 72 mins: Change for Australia: Daniel Arzani replaces Kruse. 70 mins: Risdon loses the ball by tripping over his own feet, which sort of sums up this performance from Australia. Leckie has to commit a foul to stop Hungary countering. 68 mins: Irvine gets involved straight away, shooting from just inside the area but it’s saved fairly easily. Again, not quite happening for Australia. 66 mins: Leckie drives towards goal and shoots, but it’s a fairly lame effort, well wide and never really looking like doing otherwise. Meanwhile Kleinheisler comes off, and Marton Eppel replaces him. 65 mins: Another set-piece: long-shot combo for Hungary, as Lovrenscics collects a half-cleared corner and launches a shot from way out, but it goes over. 64 mins: A substitution for Australia, as Jackson Irvine comes on for Rogic. 63 mins: Leckie puts in a cross from the left but there’s no Australian forward there. It only becomes dangerous when Loverencsics tries an absurd flicked clearance that only manages to rebound towards his own goal, but it’s easily saved. 61 mins: Change for Hungary, as Szalai goes off, Daniel Bode taking his place. 60 mins: Hungary go close again: Lovrencsics gets down the right and hooks his right foot around a cross, finding Szalai ahead of the near-post, but the angle was almost impossible and his header goes into the side-netting. 58 mins: Eeesh: Jones comes for a corner from the left, nobody in his general vicinity but not so much flaps at the ball as lets it bounce off his palms. Luckily for him he was in so much space that nobody was there to pick up the pieces of his clanger. 55 mins: A few minutes of peace, as both teams just knock the ball around a bit. A little quiet time. 51 mins: From the resultant free-kick, the ball drops to Sallai who controls nicely on his chest, does his best to get his foot over the shot but despite it having some serious power behind it, it zips over the bar. 50 mins: Leckie leaves one on Kleinheisler, but it was one of those where he went to hook the ball but the opponent arrived from over his shoulder, nicking said ball and getting himself kicked in the process. 49 mins: Australia already look sparkier: Rogic drives into the box but is crowded out, then in the next phase Mooy tucks a nice pass to Kruse, steaming down the right side of the box, but his cross is overhit. 47 mins: Sorry, make that three changes: Mile Jedinak replaces Luongo, and Brad Jones gets a go in nets in place of Ryan. 46 mins: And we’re away again for the second-half: one change for Australia, as Tom Juric - still nursing that knee injury - replaces Nabbout up top. Peeeeeeeeeeeep. Not the best half for Australia: indeed, if they play like that in Russia then it’s going to be a pretty grim few weeks all told. Aside from flurries at either end of the half, they’ve created little and of course taken none of what they have come up with. Interesting to see what Van Marwijk does at half-time. 45 mins + 1: On the stroke of half-time, Hungary go close once more, as Kadar gets on the end of a corner, and Risdon has to clear off the line. 45 mins: Mooy shoots from the resultant free-kick, but the less said about its power or direction the better, probably. 44 mins: A booking for Jozef Varga, who chases Rogic from the centre-circle to about ten yards outside the box, all the while with a handful of Australian shirt, then he manages to keep a straight face while protesting his yellow card. 43 mins: Australia win a corner on the right, which Mooy lines up. He sends it to the far post, it’s half-cleared and breaks to Kruse who shoots...but without much direction and it goes harmlessly wide. 40 mins: Luongo tries a defence-splitter from deep, but it’s intercepted. Just not happening for Australia at the moment. 37 mins: And Hungary go close once more, with what might have been the goal of the year: Kleinhesiler regards a ball dropping at just the right height, launches into a brilliantly-struck volley which kisses the top of the crossbar. What an astounding strike that would have been. 34 mins: The lively Sallai looks to create some mischief on the left, but rather carelessly runs the ball out of play instead. 31 mins: Good lord, Hungary should be in the lead. on their right, Varga dispossesses Milligan, the ball is squared to Szalai in the box occupying the space where Milligan probably should have been. He measures the shot, it’s saved, but then rebounds past Ryan off Risdon, who then actually does quite well to stop his own ricochet from dribbling over the line. 30 mins: Hungary on the other hand have looked surprisingly decent. Sallai produces a lovely bit of skill to skip down the left but his cross is easily gathered by Ryan. 27 mins: Slightly frustrating stuff so far from Australia. They haven’t quite been able to get any proper flow going, and although they’ve created a couple of chances, nothing especially convincing either. They haven’t really been bad, it’s just they haven’t really been good either. 23 mins: Ambitious from Szalai: he drifts to the back stick and tries a big, Ronaldo-style bicycle kick, but skews it rather so it very nearly turns into a decent cross more than a shot. 22 mins: Busy minute: Ryan scrambles to gather the ball in the six-yard box after Kleinheisler’s shot is flicked goalwards by Szalai, then Leckie goes into the book for a stupid slap on Sallai’s back. He might have been lucky this isn’t a competitive game: a referee might have been tempted to bring out a different coloured card if so. 20 mins: Things livening up a bit now. Big chance for Australia as Leckie finds Kruse in the middle, 12-odd yards out and with a clear path to goal, but he snatches at the shot rather and sends it carelessly over the bar. 19 mins: Half chance for Hungary: they have a free-kick from deep on the right, its curled over and Vadocz is there at the back stick, but he wellies the volley when a little more art might have been more appropriate, and it goes wide. 17 mins: Australia hit the bar! Nabbout drops deep and curls a lovely cross in from the left, and it finds Kruse about 12 yards out. He twists his body and flicks a left-footed volley that dips over Gulasci and hits the underside of the bar. The flag was up so it wouldn’t have counted, Kruse just straying beyond the last man, but that was still lovely work. 14 mins: Hungary have been the better team so far, even if that is somewhat damning with faint praise. Australia have barely got into the final third, bar that early header, while the hosts have launched one or two promising attacks, at least. 11 mins: Sallai gets down the left, then plays a lovely reverse pass to the overlapping Szabo, but the Hungarian left-back absolutely leathers his cross, Aleksandar Kolarov-style, and it sails harmlessly out of play. Subtlety overrated, clearly. 9 mins: Little bit of needle early on, some wee digs here and there from both teams. Perhaps they’re just trying to trick their brains into thinking this is a super-competitive match. 7 mins: A long pass down the right from Lovrencsics looks for the run of Varga, but there’s too much on the ball and it skips out for a goal-kick. 5 mins: Predictably enough, Szalai gets a smidge of revenge by barging Sainsbury over from behind. The referee gives them both a talking to, presumably telling them to be friends and if they can’t play nicely, then they’re not going to play at all. 3 mins: Trent Sainsbury has done some damage already: going up for a header, he barrelled into the back of Szalai, who crumples in a heap on the floor and has to briefly retreat for some attention. He’s fine, though. 2 mins: Australia win a corner on the left, which Aaron Mooy takes short then crosses when returned to him. Leckie gets his head on it, but he was a good 15 yards out and with barely any momentum: it floats over the bar, gently, delicately, like a feather on the breeze. 1 min: We’re away. Australia are in their change kit of green with gold trim. Hungary in all white with bits of red and green. The teams are out, anthems are being played - the Hungarian going for a bit longer than the fans anticipated, starting to applaud while the band still played. The stadium is, I would guess, maybe half full, if that. But the ones who are present have some sort of vuvuzela-esque horns, which frankly is not ideal. If you’re in the UK and you like ‘things’, you can pick up your super soaraway World Cup preview today. From all good newsagents, and also WH Smith. A welcome, from uncle V. The Hungary team is in now. In the entry below... Have you read our implausibly comprehensive guide to every player at the World Cup? Almost certainly not all of it. Get stuck in. No Hungary team announced yet. Perhaps they’ve been overtaken by a profound sense of ennui after the defeat to Luxembourg and have just decided to sit in the park this afternoon. Can’t massively blame them. It’ll be in the post with the Australia team when it is eventually put out. Care for a little pre-match reading? Jonathan Howcroft on Tim Cahill: Ante Jukic on Bert van Marwijk and the centre-forward question Ange Postecoglou on impending humiliation Hungary Gulasci, Jozsef Varga, Vinicius, Kadar, Szabo, Kleinheisler, Szalai, Vadocz, Sallai, Lovrencsics, Roland Varga. Subs: To follow... Australia Ryan; Risdon, Milligan, Sainsbury, Behich; Luongo, Mooy; Leckie, Rogic, Kruse; Nabbout. Subs: Degenek, Meredith, Cahill, Juric, Jerman, Jones, Jedinak, Vukovic, Irvine, Petratos, Arzani, Maclaren. Listening to and reading some of the previews from around the globe, it doesn’t seem like there’s a huge amount of optimism ahead of this World Cup. Apparently even Brazilians and Germans aren’t especially positive about their chances, and when those two aren’t whooping it up then you know the general mood isn’t exactly positive. Where would you pitch Australia in that? Clearly nobody is expecting to win the thing, but what would constitute success? Is getting to Russia already success? Given the relative turmoil that comes with losing a manager shortly after qualification brings, and a tough draw, is merely a respectable showing the group a success? Is making the knockout stages a success? Beyond that? Preparations seem to be going roughly as well as can be expected, aside from Tomi Juric’s injury scare, with Bert van Marwijk’s gameplan a little more simple and pragmatic that Ange Postecoglou’s. The 4-0 win over the Czechs may have been against a team who would rather have been doing something - anything - else, but a 4-0 win is a 4-0 win. The preparation specifically for this game hasn’t been ideal, after Van Marwijk returned to Holland to visit an ill friend, his flight to Budapest delayed so he missed the first training session. Will Tim Cahill get a run in this one? Van Marwijk’s emphatic response to that question earlier this week was: perhaps. “Maybe I will let him play for a period,” the Dutchman said. “He needs it but he will not become a better player by one game. The problem was already in the last half-year...When I need him he must be ready. We’ve discussed that and he’s ready for that. If it’s thirty seconds or thirty minutes, when I need him he will be ready.” Today they face a Hungary team in something of a mess, who not only didn’t qualify for the tournament but drew with the Faroe Islands while doing so, and lost to Luxembourg in a friendly last November. Will this prove a meaningful exercise for Australia and Van Marwijk, or a glorified training game? Let’s find out...

The party will use the occasion to launch a book with a reboot of the values articulated by Robert Menzies in his “forgotten people” speech and essays. A bunch of high flyers from inside and outside the party have contributed essays to Menzies 2.0 – Malcolm Turnbull (naturally), former prime minister Tony Abbott and other Canberra types both established and up-and-coming, a mix of men and women, and the federal crew versus people in the states. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The editor of the compilation did issue one instruction: Labor and the Greens were banned words. The objective was simple: this exercise was about expressing Menzian liberalism in a contemporary political context. It wasn’t about producing yet more talking points, or the cage fights that power the 24/7 news cycle, but numb and alienate the voters. This was about ideas and enduring values. I’m interested to see the results. It’s reassuring to me that people in the Liberal party are engaged in an articulation of what the political movement stands for 76 years on from Menzies and his famous speech, because one of their weaknesses during this period in government is that it hasn’t always been obvious. Also not always obvious is whether or not senior players grasp that winning government means communicating to a broad constituency. One episode from the political week tells a story. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday held the press conference treasurers always hold when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases an update of the national accounts. This week’s news was good, if you don’t mind the mildly disconcerting feeling that the Australian economy at the moment is being powered by mining exports and the national disability insurance scheme. Setting that minor oddity to one side, economic growth crept back over 3%. In an effort to communicate the various trends in the economy, Morrison touched down with an anecdote about utes. Having grown up in the bush, I obviously have no objection to utes at all. I learned to drive in one – an old three-on-the-tree bush basher, in my best friend’s paddock. I’m also on board with treasurers trying to find modes of communication that reduce complex ideas to simple cut-through concepts. Morrison prides himself on speaking the language of the tabloids when it comes to his portfolio, and I don’t criticise him for it. If you want to get things done in government,best find a means of being able to explain your ideas to a mass audience buffeted by the chronic oversaturation created by our highly connected universe. So good one, Scott. Bring on the utes. Except the ute anecdote persisted. Utes on the streets, cranes in the sky – these were concrete metrics of economic recovery. This was the story Morrison wanted to tell about the Australian economy in June 2018. Watching on, I wondered how this story related to me. To put it simply, it didn’t. I should add at this point I wasn’t physically at the press conference, because it was a busy morning. I’d just filed a news story. So I watched in my office. If I’d been in the room I would have been in adversarial mode, focused on trying to tease out a news line – I wouldn’t have consumed the press conference in the more distant way voters do. So I was watching like a voter. “Too much of the utes, Scott,” I thought to myself, feeling myself mired dispiritingly in a seriously blokey episode of death by anecdote. Then we got to women. The treasurer was cranky (as he sometimes is) when information is presented to him that he regards as disruptive to his flow. We got to women because Labor had asked the parliamentary budget office to crunch some numbers about the distributional effects of the income tax cut on male and female taxpayers. In a not terribly surprising development, the analysis showed men benefitted more from the tax cuts than women, particularly from the higher-end tax cuts. The reason for this is simple. Men earn more than women. There is a gender pay gap. There are also more men in the workforce, particularly at the higher end of the nation’s pay scales. So if you cut people’s taxes, men will do better than women. It’s not a conspiracy. It’s just good information to have. The reason you do distributional analysis is to try and work out if the sum of your policies might have implications you haven’t thought through. This is a government that wants to maximise participation in the labour market. They say it often. But one of the drags on female participation in the labour market, for example, is women, (often secondary earners), being hit with higher effective marginal tax rates (which is a loss you calculate when you put together income tax and the withdrawal of some other government benefit). If you are tinkering with tax policy and you care about participation, this is something that’s good to bear in mind. Understanding how the tax cuts flow between the genders could be a building block in a broader exercise of understanding. Here’s one example of putting various pieces together. A recent report from KPMG called Ending Workplace Discrimination Against Women looked at the impact of tax and the childcare subsidy on a hypothetical professional women working part time and earning $100,000. When they crunched the numbers to work out whether it was worth this woman returning to full-time work, they discovered the woman would be a grand total of $26 a week better off if she worked five days after childcare expenses were factored in. So getting into the weeds: wondering how the benefits flow – and what might be the distributional consequences of various measures – isn’t a thoughtcrime. As practice goes, it’s actually optimal. Without this kind of thinking, as a government, you are flying blind. If you do an analysis identifying that the benefits flow to men at a ratio of almost three to one by the time the Coalition’s tax cut plan reaches stage three – you might think about being more generous at the low and middle-incomes end, where the benefits flow to women and men almost equally, just on a principle of fairness. If you didn’t care about fairness, if you only cared about boosting labour market participation and maximising the output of the economy, you might briefly countenance whether you might be better off targeting your tax relief at people who might respond to the policy signal. But Morrison was outraged to find people were asking questions about gender distribution in his GDP press conference. There was a tart rebuttal, followed by an observation that journalists were silly to be giving this material the time of day. “The tax system does not discriminate on gender. You don’t get pink forms and blue forms to fill out your tax return. That’s not how it works,” the treasurer said. “They’re one colour, they assess one thing – what you earn – and you pay tax on what you earn. So it’s just a nonsense of an argument. I’m sorry, I reject it and I’m surprised people are giving it this much credibility. I would have thought you would have seen through that.” Bizarrely, some of my male journalistic colleagues appeared duly chastened by this manufactured outrage. If you were watching on as a woman, however, you might have felt something else. Annoyed might be a polite way of putting it. Excluded might be another feeling. First, your story of economic participation didn’t really feature in the treasurer’s telling of what’s happening in the economy – unless you happened to have bought a ute recently. Adding to the ute-led recovery was the gratuitous smackdown on pink forms and blue forms. I mean, really? Seriously? How patronising can you get? I’m not sure about whether communicating to women who might be inclined to vote Liberal will be part of next week’s Menzies 2.0 reboot. One can only hope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/08/french-open-2018-semi-final-marco-cecchinato-dominic-thiem-rafael-nadal-juan-martin-del-potro","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T16:36:11Z","webTitle":"French Open 2018: Rafael Nadal to face Thiem in final after win over Del Potro – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/08/french-open-2018-semi-final-marco-cecchinato-dominic-thiem-rafael-nadal-juan-martin-del-potro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/08/french-open-2018-semi-final-marco-cecchinato-dominic-thiem-rafael-nadal-juan-martin-del-potro","fields":{"headline":"French Open 2018: Rafael Nadal to face Thiem in final after win over Del Potro – as it happened","bodyText":"And to get you in the mood for tomorrow’s women’s final, here’s Kevin Mitchell on Stephens v Halep: I’ll leave you with a quick report on Rafa Nadal’s victory over Juan Martin del Potro. Earlier today Dominic Thiem beat Marco Cecchinato in three sets to reach Sunday’s final. Let’s hope it’s a good one - though it might be wise to expect more drama when Simona Halep and Sloane Stephens meet in the women’s final tomorrow. Thanks for reading. Bye. Rafael Nadal signs a few autographs and then he’s on his way, off to rest for his 11th French Open final. His opponent on Sunday will be Austria’s Dominic Thiem, who will be playing in his first grand slam final. Thiem has beaten Nadal twice on clay but the Spaniard crushed him in their semi-final here last year. It’s hard to see him pulling it off. Rafael Nadal, the second man after Roger Federer (Wimbledon) to reach 11 finals at the same grand slam, speaks! “The first set was very difficult. Juan Martin had a lot of opportunities and I was a little bit lucky to win it. It’s incredible to play here. I feel very fortunate to play in front of this crowd. Without working hard and without going through tough moments and without still being focused on your passion of the game, it is impossible to be here. Still being here is something I never dreamed about. Dominic Thiem is an amazing player. He beat me in Madrid this year and he has great power. I have to play my best. I have to improve a little bit. I believe I can be ready for that final. It’s going to be a tough one but I will fight all the way.” Rafa Nadal pumps his fist, embraces Juan Martin del Potro and accepts the crowd’s love. He was under pressure in the first set but he was never going to be denied after taking the lead. Del Potro gave it his all and he’s given a generous ovation as he walks off court but Nadal was far too good. Again. There’s no chance of Nadal wobbling, even when he goes to 30-all. He tortures Del Potro with a series of brutal forehands and eventually earns a match point. Del Potro, wearied and battered, hangs his head and takes a deep gulp of air. Nadal serves wide and Del Potro’s return’s called out. That’s it. Rafa Nadal will face Dominic Thiem in his 11th French Open final. Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-1, 5-2 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Del Potro holds to love. Nadal will serve for it. “On clay, Nadal now carries the same aura that Borg, Sampras and Federer did when they were winning multiple Wimbledon’s,” says Simon McMahon. “It’s hard to imagine them losing. Indeed, like a prime Mike Tyson or Phil Taylor, or the Scottish football team in 1978, most opponents are beaten before they enter the arena. Maybe Thiem will be different, but I doubt it.” Third set: Nadal* 6-4, 6-1, 5-1 Del Potro (*denotes server): Nadal holds and moves a game away from his 11th French Open final. The crowd’s dozed off. Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-1, 4-1 Del Potro* (*denotes server): This is painful to watch. And kind of dull. Nadal breaks again. Third set: Nadal* 6-4, 6-1, 3-1 Del Potro (*denotes server): Nadal’s taken to 15-30. THERE’S LIFE IN THIS ONE YET. Del Potro even gets it to deuce. What a titanic battle! Until Nadal holds, that is. Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-1, 2-1 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Del Potro holds to love, like it matters at this stage. Third set: Nadal* 6-4, 6-1, 2-0 Del Potro (*denotes server): Nadal holds to love, whacking a forehand down the line to land another blow on Del Potro. Third set: Nadal 6-4, 6-1, 1-0 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Del Potro double-faults and nets a forehand. Nadal has three break points. He nails the first with a backhand down the line. Serving for the set, Nadal shrugs of losing the first point and wins the next three. Two more set points, then, and this time he shows no mercy, taking the first with an accurate serve. Second set: Nadal 6-4, 5-1 Del Potro* (*denotes server): This time last year the first semi-final between Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka still hadn’t finished. How times change, eh? Now Nadal’s sniffing out a bagel as he moves into a 0-30 lead. A brutal smash makes it 15-40; two set points. But Del Potro, such a fighter, grimly fights to deuce. Somehow he holds and, with more than a hint of irony and self-deprecation, thanks the heavens. Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 5-0 Del Potro (*denotes server): This is a demolition now. Second set: Nadal 6-4, 4-0 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Del Potro smashes to save a break point. It feels like the air’s been let out of the ground. Nadal is relentless and Del Potro is toiling, sending another forehand long. Del Potro clings on for a while but Nadal eventually breaks him, spiritually and physically. This is done. Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 3-0 Del Potro (*denotes server): Hang on! At 30-all, Nadal nets a backhand to give Del Potro his seventh break point. But no. You can relax again. Nadal comes up with a storming forehand winner and goes on to consolidate the break. Second set: Nadal 6-4, 2-0 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Uh oh. Nadal swiftly earns three break points. Del Potro nets a forehand. Thanks for playing, Juan Martin. Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 1-0 Del Potro (*denotes server): The challenge for Del Potro is to get over the disappointment of losing that set as quickly as possible. That won’t be easy. Nadal hasn’t made a habit of squandering winning positions and although he’s taken to deuce in this game, he isn’t in danger of being broken. All that pressure from Del Potro and now the big Argentinian’s in trouble after a wonderful flicked backhand from a counterpunching Nadal makes it 0-30. Del Potro responds with a trademark forehand for 15-30 but Nadal’s soon clutching two set points after a spinning forehand winner. Del Potro saves the first. But then he nets a backhand. He’s annoyed. You have to admire Nadal’s sense of timing. It’s utterly ruthless from the Spaniard, who’s been on the ropes for much of the first set. First set: Del Potro 4-5 Nadal* (*denotes server): Del Potro can’t handle the Nadal forehand on the first point and he’s out of position when the Spaniard runs forward to punch a volley away. But Del Potro wins the next point and then he shows sprightly movement to reach a Nadal drop shot and win a battle of wits at the net for 15-30. Then Del Potro kisses the line with a waspish backhand for two break points. This is a huge moment. Nadal, so nerveless, saves the first with a drop shot. There wasn’t much Del Potro could do about that but he looks aghast when he spurns the second break point with a dreadful forehand that sails long and wide for deuce. He has another chance when a Nadal backhand clips the tape and goes wide but this time he frames a forehand and swipes at thin air. Ouch. You can’t keep missing those chances against Nadal, who raps a sharp backhand from right to left before showing deft reflexes at the net to hold. Nadal’s saved six break points in this set but Del Potro will have to serve to keep it alive. First set: Del Potro* 4-4 Nadal (*denotes server): Del Potro is serving with new balls and he wins the first point. Then he rams a backhand down the line for 30-0. Another hold. Del Potro seems to be over that early injury scare. First set: Del Potro 3-4 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal glides to a comfortable hold. First set: Del Potro* 2-3 Nadal (*denotes server): The trainer has been and gone. Del Potro trudges on. He decides it’s time for a drop shot. Nadal engages in a dink war but Del Potro has the answers to make it 15-0. The game goes to 40-30. Del Potro holds when Nadal sends a forehand return long. First set: Del Potro 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes server): If Del Potro’s still hurting, he’s hiding it well. He moves into a 0-30 lead on Nadal’s serve again. Nadal fights back, though, making good use of the drop shot to climb to 30-all. A Del Potro error makes it 40-30 and Nadal holds. Del Potro will seek treatment from the trainer now. First set: Del Potro* 2-2 Nadal (*denotes server): Del Potro shot a wry smile at his box and shook his head at the end of the previous game. This is a concern. He’s called for the trainer during the next changeover. On we go for now, though. But Nadal will smell blood and he makes it 0-15 with a forehand winner, Del Potro nowhere near it. That said, Del Potro can be a bit of an actor sometimes. He wins the next two points and when it goes to 30-all, he digs deep and finds some forehand winners to hold. First set: Del Potro 1-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): A punishing rally on the first point ends with Nadal being overpowered and netting a backhand. Nadal’s looking a bit edgy and a wild double-fault at 0-30 hands Del Potro three break points. Nadal saves the first two, though, and then he’s relieved to see Del Potro net a forehand pass on the run. Deuce. Nadal proceeds to wrongfoot Del Potro with a forehand, causing the Argentinian to wince and hold his left hip. Has he stretched something there? Let’s hope not. Nadal holds and Del Potro limps back to his chair. First set: Del Potro* 1-1 Nadal (*denotes server): Wallop! Clobber! There’s the first big forehand from Del Potro. Then comes a lighter touch, a Murray-esque backhand lob for 30-0. He’s mixing it up well. Another huge forehand - registered at 102mph - makes it 40-0. An ace is enough for a comfortable hold. First set: Del Potro 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): The second men’s semi-final begins with Rafa Nadal serving. Del Potro never beaten Nadal on clay before. You fancy he needs a good start. He makes an authoritative one, crunching into a 0-30 lead, heaving hitting penetrating Nadal’s defence. Nadal wins the next three points, though, and holds with a Cecchinato-esque drop shot. We’ve had the coin toss. Rafa Nadal will serve first. Here come the players. Big cheers for both men. Juan Martin del Potro, the gentle giant, is such a popular character. And Rafael Nadal ... well, he’s Rafa Nadal. Hello again. Rafael Nadal has won his past 15 grand slam semi-finals, a run that stretches back to the 2009 US Open. His conqueror at Flushing Meadows? A certain Juan Martin del Potro. That said, Nadal absolutely destroyed Del Potro in four sets at last year’s US Open. It’s a hot day in Paris and Nadal looks virtually unbeatable on clay. How can Del Potro, even with that huge forehand, hope to outlast him over five sets? So it’s Nadal v Del Potro next up then. Jacob is back from his lunch break and he’ll guide you through the second men’s semi-final. Bye! So after bowing out at the semi-final stage at Roland Garros in 2016 and 2017, Dominic Thiem reaches his first grand slam final, where he will meet one of Rafa Nadal or Juan Martin del Potro. Remember Thiem is the last person to beat Nadal on clay, when he beat the Spaniard in the quarter-finals of the Madrid Open last month, to end Nadal’s run of 25 matches on clay – a 51-week unbeaten stretch. Clay is definitely Thiem’s best surface, he has a 75% winning rate on it compared to a 54% winning rate on hard courts. Many have had Nadal as certain for the title here since Djokovic went out, but whoever comes through the second semi-final, it’s not going to be easy against the Austrian. Thiem speaks! “I think the big key was the second set because it was a close tie-break. I saved two set points and luckily I won it. It was 6-4 and the one thing I wanted to do was win the set and I missed an easy volley at one moment which was not a nice feeling.” “It’s very important to regenerate, and have a good breakfast tomorrow. I’ll study my opponent, whoever it is, and then full power on Sunday!” Cecchinato heads straight off court to rapturous applause. What a brilliant tournament he’s had, he should move up towards the top 20 with what he’s done here, 27th is what some people are saying. The Italian has been a pleasure to watch, particularly those drop shots. Will be interesting to see how he adapts his game on grass. I suspect he has the game to do well, if he can keep this confidence high. Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 1-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): You know what I said about Thiem’s backhand not being that graceful? I take it back, he’s ripped a gorgeous inside-out shot right into the far left corner. Postage-stamp stuff. That said, Thiem is 15-30 down, and an error gives Cecchinato two break points! Signs of life! Thiem saves the first with relentless hitting from one side to the other, then wins the other with Cecchinato so tired from the previous point that he can just return a second serve into the net. At deuce, you sense that’s Cecchinato’s final chance gone. Thiem makes no mistake, picking up a cheap point to go to match point and then again battering an exhausted Cecchinato from side to side before a simple forehand winner. Thiem wins! Third set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-7, 1-5 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato is on the board in this third set. But there is only muted applause. Thiem looked as though he was saving his energy for the next service game, batting a backhand into the tramlines to give the Italian some respite. Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 0-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem makes his first mistake in 10 points with a loose forehand. 15-30 down, he then rips a huge serve down the T for an ace. Cecchinato does well to come to the net and set up a smash, but he can only cannon it into the net. The Italian’s face is expressionless, his previously animated supporters silent in the stands. One final error from Cecchinato gives Thiem his fifth straight game. However, Cecchinato has fallen apart here, it’s been impressive the professional way Thiem has picked him off, hitting winners when he needed to, as well as percentage shots to let Cecchinato make his own mistakes. Tactically very astute, this. Third set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-7, 0-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato’s legs are gone, and he’s now playing ambitious would-be winners, but with his feet in a lazy position. The footwork just isn’t there. One shot goes wide, the other into the net. Four straight points for Thiem, and the Austrian breaks to love. This match looks over. Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 0-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem wins the game to love. It’s a radically different game to the one we enjoyed at the end of the second set. Cecchinato may have the more graceful one-handed backhand – Gasquet-esque – but Thiem’s is flatter and more powerful. Cecchinato doesn’t look like he can handle the power – he’s mentally flat – and can only watch as Thiem floats a beautiful lob on the gallop just inside the baseline to close out the game. Third set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-7, 0-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem races into a 3-0 lead and has a half-chance to break, but two sloppy errors lets the Italian back into the game. It goes to deuce with Cecchinato failing with an ill-advised drop shot that finds the net. Another poor slice gives break point to Thiem, and the Austrian makes no mistake! Thiem breaks at the first time of asking with the cutest of drop shots. Cecchinato in real danger of falling away here. Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 0-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato somehow survives at the net, two sublime defensive volleys keep him in the rally, before Thiem inexplicably hits one wide down the line. At 15-30 down, Cecchinato has his first point, before Thiem powers down two unreturned serves to close out the first game of the third set. Hello everyone. What a tie-break that was. Sitters were missed, drop-shots were, er, dropped, and nerves were frayed. Cecchinato showed great mental strength against Djokovic, but he may be in too deep here. He’s got to win the next three sets to make the French Open final. Let’s see if he can do it – Thiem to serve first. I’m going to get some lunch before Nadal v Del Potro. Michael Butler will guide you through the third set. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 10-12 Thiem* (*denotes server): This is Thiem’s fifth set point. It’s the third he’s had on his serve. This, you feel, is surely it. Cecchinato isn’t going to give up without a fight - but Thiem sinks to his knees when he sees a forehand pass from the Italian fly long! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 10-11 Thiem (*denotes server): A fine return from Thiem forces Cecchinato to dribble a forehand into the net! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 10-10 Thiem (*denotes server): After a grinding baseline rally, it’s Thiem’s turn to produce a spinning backhand drop shot and get himself out of a deep hole! This is staggering. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 10-9 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem whacks a forehand long! Cecchinato has a third set point and this time it’s on his serve! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 9-9 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem produces a marvellous, snorting, deep second serve to confound Cecchinato and wipe out the set point! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 9-8 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem stoops and nets a backhand slice. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 8-8 Thiem (*denotes server): Under pressure? Why not just choose a drop-shot? Cecchinato is absurd. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 7-8 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem’s spot on with a volley this time. He has his fourth set point. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 7-7 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato can’t return a kick serve from Thiem. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 7-6 Thiem (*denotes server): Having saved three, Cecchinato earns his first set point with a huge forehand! What a turnaround! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 6-6 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato saves the third set point as he chooses to leave a Thiem forehand, which lands just long! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 5-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): Incredible! Thiem sends a forehand to the left corner. Cecchinato manages to slice it back but Thiem’s there with a backhand volley - only to make a total mess of it! Cecchinato lives on! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 4-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato saves the first, racing forward to beat Thiem with a forehand at the net. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 3-6 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem rips a forehand return from right to left to earn three set points. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 3-5 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato’s in the right place for a volley after more extravagant drop-shotting. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 2-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Another forehand winner from Thiem. He’s two points from a two-set lead. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 2-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem smashes to good effect. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 2-3 Thiem (*denotes server): A long rally ends with Thiem battering a monstrous forehand away. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 2-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Another drop shot from Cecchinato. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 1-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem hooks a forehand from right to left. Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 1-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): A magnificent, angled return puts Cecchinato in control of the rally, though he’s in danger of blowing it when he fails to put away a couple of smashes. No matter: he turns to the trusty drop shot to win the point and the crowd’s approval! Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 0-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem dominates the rally and eventually forces an error from Cecchinato. Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): We’ll have a tie-break. You’ll remember that Cecchinato won a couple on Tuesday. Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-5 Thiem (*denotes server): We reach the point where Cecchinato was broken in set one but lightning doesn’t strike twice. He holds comfortably and has earned a tie-break at the very least. Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 5-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Thiem scoots into a 40-0 lead. Cecchinato chops a sliced return at him to make it 40-15 but that’s as close as it gets. Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 5-4 Thiem (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all. A grinding rally ensues. Thiem’s the first to blink, spraying a forehand wide when it might have been more prudent to keep testing Cecchinato’s focus. The game goes to deuce but Cecchinato has the resolve to dig deep and hold. Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 4-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem treats Cecchinato to a taste of his own medicine, drop-shotting for 15-0. Thiem’s feeling the heat a little, though, and a missed backhand makes it 30-all. Just as well he volleys well, though, and it’s game when Thiem swings an ace down the middle. Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 4-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato crunches into a 40-15 lead. Thiem knocks a forehand return long. This is turning into a very tight set. There’s tension but little drama. But you feel it’s warming up nicely. Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 3-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato still can’t make any impression on Thiem’s serve. On we trundle. Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 3-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem has a sniff at 15-30 and a pungent drop shot from Cecchinato allows the Austrian to claim two break points. Cecchinato wipes them both out, though, volleying and then serving well. The game goes to deuce and again Cecchinato clambers to safety. Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 2-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem’s finding it a breeze on serve. As long as that remains the case, it’s hard to see him losing. Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 2-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato’s refusing to let losing the first set affect him. He holds to 15. Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 1-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem races into a 40-0 lead. No fuss: he holds to 15. Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 1-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato tries one drop shot too many at 30-all and Thiem forces him to spurt a backhand wide. Break point. The Italian thinks about changing his racket. Instead he hangs on a bit and produces a sublime, feathery drop shot to make it deuce. Then he changes his racket. The Italian turns up the power and holds. A fine piece of serve-volleying makes it 40-15 to Thiem. Two set points. A big serve on the first is enough to end the argument. Thiem pumps his fist. This is his to lose. First set: Cecchinato* 5-6 Thiem (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all and Cecchinato’s under pressure when he nets a tame forehand, gifting Thiem a break point. A long rally ensues but hard as Cecchinato tries to match Thiem, the Austrian’s power is too much. He softens the Italian open up with some devilish backhands and then spanks a forehand down the line to break. He’ll serve for the first set. First set: Cecchinato 5-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato tries a drop shot and Thiem reads this one, scampering forward to belt a backhand down the line for 15-0. Another missile makes it 30-0 and it’s not long before it’s 40-0. Despite an awful miss with a forehand, Thiem volleys smartly to hold to 15. First set: Cecchinato* 5-4 Thiem (*denotes server): There have been moments when Thiem looked like he was going to run away with this set. Now he’s the one under pressure. He’s the one who’s missing and Cecchinato’s the one who’s causing problems, a backhand down the line helping him carve out a 40-0 lead. The Italian holds to love and Thiem will serve to keep the set alive. First set: Cecchinato 4-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): At 0-15, Cecchinato gets a little lucky with a blocked return off a sharp serve and Thiem’s unable to do anything other than stick the ball into the net for 0-30. The Austrian’s still not got over his confusion by the time he limbers up for the next point, double-faulting to hand Cecchinato three break points. Thiem scrubs them all out, forcing deuce, but he’s facing a fourth break point after butchering a simple volley. He can’t escape this time. Cecchinato bellows as he watches a Thiem backhand sail long and we’re back on serve! First set: Cecchinato* 3-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato’s in trouble after double-faulting to make it 0-30. He clambers back to 30-all, though, and then he raises his confidence by drop-shotting and smashing to perfection for 40-30. But the game goes to deuce, Cecchinato unable to keep the errors from infecting his play. He’s starting to get annoyed. But he clings on again. This set isn’t done yet. First set: Cecchinato 2-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): It’s all very precise from Thiem at the moment. He’s not missing much. A fantastic, whipped forehand makes it 40-0 and he holds to love thanks to a fast serve out wide. First set: Cecchinato* 2-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Trailing 0-15, Cecchinato nails his first ace. That was timely. Another good serve makes it 30-15 but then he dumps a forehand into the net. He’s not quite there at the moment. He tries to serve and volley on the next point and Thiem easily guides a backhand pass down the line to make it 30-40, only to waste the break point by netting a backhand return. From there, with the use of one of those nifty drop shots, the Italian holds. First set: Cecchinato 1-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. But Cecchinato’s struggling to get into Thiem’s service games. The Austrian holds to 15. First set: Cecchinato* 1-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato settles his nerves a little, holding to love without ceremony. He needed that. First set: Cecchinato 0-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem’s dialled in. He races away with this game, consolidating the break by holding to love. Cecchinato’s up against it already. First set: Cecchinato* 0-1 Thiem (*denotes server): The first men’s semi-final begins with Marco Cecchinato serving and straight away we’re treated to a backhand battle. It ends with Thiem spraying long. On a sunny Paris afternoon, though, Thiem’s soon showing off his power, ramming a forehand down the line for 30-all. Then Cecchinato knocks a backhand wide, giving Thiem an early break point, but the Italian saves it with a sharp forehand. Thiem’s finding his range, though, earning another break point thanks to more fearsome hitting on the forehand side, and he takes this one when a rasping backhand return forces Cecchinato to send a backhand long. The players are out. They’ve smiled for the cameras, they’ve flipped a coin, they’re knocking up. It’s almost time. It’s 1-1 in the head-to-head between Marco Cecchinato and Dominic Thiem, although they haven’t met since 2014 and have never played each other in a grand slam. That isn’t much of a guide, is it? Once this one’s over, it’s Rafael Nadal and Juan Martin del Potro. Nadal is going for his 11th French Open title, while Del Potro’s just happy to be wielding his hammer. But the Argentinian’s a big threat. He’s beaten Nadal before, albeit not on clay. Hopefully he’s rested well after a tough battle with Marin Cilic. Everybody loves an underdog story but it isn’t all sweetness and light when it comes to Marco Cecchinato, as Kevin Mitchell reports: There is, however, an elephant in the room at this otherwise uplifting party: Marco Cecchinato. His should be the fairytale of the tournament and, to a large extent, it is: the 25-year-old Italian, ranked 72 in the world, who came from two sets down to win 10-8 in the fifth of his opening match and went on to put the former champion Novak Djokovic out in a heart-stopping quarter-final. Yet allegations of match-fixing have hung over him for nearly three years, even though he was allowed off on a technicality when the Italian federation failed to meet a deadline in the appeals process. As detailed in the New York Times last year Italian investigators tapped into WhatsApp messages between Cecchinato and his friend Riccardo Accardi that suggested he might recoup betting losses on Italian football at the 2015 Mohammedia Challenger in Morocco. Accardi and his father used multiple accounts to bet on Cecchinato at 7-1 to lose in straight sets to the world No 338 Kamil Majchrzak, which he did. Cecchinato denied the allegations and appealed – and the Italian federation’s processes broke down to the extent that he escaped without censure. The Tennis Integrity Unit did not respond to Guardian inquiries on Thursday as to whether they were taking the investigation any further. Hello. It’s Dominic Thiem’s third consecutive French Open semi-final and the good news for the brilliant young Austrian is that the man standing on the other side of the net isn’t a member of the Big Five. Thiem was blown away by Novak Djokovic in 2016 and although he gained revenge over the Serbian in their quarter-final last year, he was no match for a rampant Rafa Nadal two days later. This time, though, his opponent is Marco Cecchinato, the world No72. Cecchinato might have made himself one of the stories of the tournament after stunning Djokovic on Tuesday but Thiem really couldn’t have asked for a better draw. Mind you, Cecchinato isn’t to be taken lightly, even though the Italian hadn’t won a single grand slam match before arriving at Roland Garros last month. The 25-year-old, who is the first Italian to reach the last four here since Corrado Barazzutti 40 years ago, has a gorgeous single-handed backhand and he showed no nerves in that mesmeric fourth-set tie-break against Djokovic. Yet Thiem, who demonstrated his clay smarts by thumping an ailing Alexander Zverev in his quarter-final, will be kicking himself if he blows the opportunity to reach a maiden grand slam final. Play begins at: 12pm BST, 1pm in Paris."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/09/universities-rely-too-much-on-foreign-student-fees-auditor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T20:00:05Z","webTitle":"Universities rely too much on foreign student fees, auditor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/09/universities-rely-too-much-on-foreign-student-fees-auditor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/09/universities-rely-too-much-on-foreign-student-fees-auditor-says","fields":{"headline":"Universities rely too much on foreign student fees, auditor says","bodyText":"Australian universities have a “market concentration risk” because of their increasing reliance on overseas students, the New South Wales auditor general has warned. University revenue from fees paid by overseas students increased by 23% across NSW in 2017, the report shows. The overseas cohort now brings in $2.8bn for universities in NSW, and accounts for 28% of total revenue. And with only a handful of countries making up the bulk of fee-paying students – China provided 54% last year, followed by India and Nepal – the auditor general warned that universities must weigh up their reliance on the overseas student market. “NSW universities should assess their student market concentration risk where they rely heavily on students from a single country of origin,” the report found. “This increases their sensitivity to economic or political changes in that country.” The increased dependence on foreign fee-paying students is particularly stark because of the relatively limited pool of countries from which the majority of overseas students come. Data published in the auditor’s report reveals that 37% of NSW universities’ total student revenue came from overseas students from just four countries. At one university, as much as 71% of overseas student revenue comes from a single country. While the auditor limited its scope to NSW, Department of Finance data shows that it’s not alone in its reliance on foreign students. In 2016 fee-paying overseas students contributed $6.2bn to university revenue nationally. Victoria had the largest share – raking in $2.1bn of the total. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The higher education program director for the Grattan Institute thinktank, Andrew Norton, said universities were taking a “calculated risk” on overseas students. “Every university is aware that international student revenue is not guaranteed, and that the biggest risk is the China market due its scale and [the] danger of Chinese or Australian government decisions causing the number of students to fall,” he said. “I believe they have taken a calculated risk. They know that the China boom probably won’t last forever, but that they might as well take the money while they can.” The controversy this week over the Australian National University’s decision to pull out of negotiations with the John Howard-backed Ramsay Centre over the establishment of a degree in western civilisation is in some ways a proxy for a larger issue. The Ramsay Centre is offering universities a share of a $3.3bn bequest at a time when government revenue is shrinking. The NSW auditor found that government funding as a proportion of total revenue decreased by 6.4% over the last five years, and the federal government’s plan to freeze commonwealth grants funding at 2017 levels would “put pressure on the universities to expand other sources of revenue and contain their costs”. “Universities are expanding other revenue streams to decrease their reliance on grant funding,” the auditor stated. “The revenue stream that has increased the most significantly over the past five years is overseas student revenue.” Adrian Piccoli, the former NSW education minister and now head of the Gonski education research centre at the University of NSW, said universities were “making a business decision”. “You can’t blame universities for that,” he said. “I actually don’t think the growth in international students would be any different even if there was additional commonwealth funding because it’s still additional revenue. “They wouldn’t be sitting back, they’d still be pursuing it. It’s a source of revenue, it’s in the national interest and it’s good for the general economy.” But it will pose difficulties for smaller and regional universities. The auditor’s report showed that while overseas student funding was increasing dramatically, the leverage was not equally shared. Two universities in the state – the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales – accounted for more than 50% of total revenue from overseas students. Similarly in Victoria, the University of Melbourne, Monash and RMIT make up the bulk of overseas student revenue. But regional institutions such as the University of New England and the University of Newcastle – the only two in NSW that still draw more than 45% of their revenue from government grants – will be squeezed harder by the the freeze on commonwealth grants. “They’re in a difficult position because if you can’t control revenue, you have to control costs,” Norton said. “It may mean cutbacks in some of those institutions in research or capital building.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/08/arctic-monkeys-review-royal-albert-hall-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T09:58:34Z","webTitle":"Arctic Monkeys review – cheesy irony dissolves into masterful rock'n'roll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/08/arctic-monkeys-review-royal-albert-hall-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/08/arctic-monkeys-review-royal-albert-hall-london","fields":{"headline":"Arctic Monkeys review – cheesy irony dissolves into masterful rock'n'roll","bodyText":"The Royal Albert Hall, a music hall with ideas about its station, is a weirdly apposite place for the Arctic Monkeys to play. The band’s most celebrated mode is the fast, literate indie-punk of their first LP which modulated into brawny desert blues and then on to soulful, swaggering stadium rock for their most successful album, 2013’s AM. But throughout, there’s been another style, where Alex Turner seems to don a suit and croon for the bingo-playing masses: you can hear it as he address the “scummy man” in When the Sun Goes Down, or in The Jeweller’s Hands at the end of Humbug, or his take on John Cooper Clarke’s I Wanna Be Yours from AM. And it’s this style that the band’s new album, Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino – performed live here for the first time in the UK – expands upon. Turner takes the twisted light-entertainer shtick of Scott Walker, or his fellow Sheffield expat Jarvis Cocker (Pulp’s This Is Hardcore sounds like a major touchstone) and uses it on supper-club songs that shimmer like the cheap chandelier fittings in your grandma’s house. Some might say this is a pose, that’s he’s insulating himself with quotation marks: an ironic crooner giving it some smirking razzle-dazzle. Maybe so, but just as he regards his peers with both fondness and disgust on A Certain Romance, Turner can happily hold two opposing thoughts – he might be taking the piss a bit, but when he lets his voice soar, he finds himself meaning it too. Both these sides and more are on show at this often masterful showcase of British rock’n’roll. Opening with Four Out of Five, a droll fantasy of a gentrified moon, Turner makes self-mocking simian shapes around the slow ‘okey cokey of the rhythm section. With his slicked-back hair he resembles the psychopathic Bob from Twin Peaks crossed with a minor Scarface goon, though later, when he tucks it behind his ear, he is briefly a prim 1950s secretary. Later he says “We’d like to play you now the title track of our new LP” like Dean Martin, with full-bore irony, and at one point introduces guitarist Jamie Cook like an R&amp;B star showing off his band. But they all can’t help but feel it. Knee Socks is almost cruel in its funky exactitude; Cornerstone is brimming with restless romance; One Point Perspective sees Turner makes priapic poses with one of his many beautiful guitars, but is genuinely sexy. The band, bolstered by supporting players on keys and acoustic guitar, are immaculately drilled – sometimes too much so, as on Pretty Visitors, which hops around with math-rock fussiness, or She Looks Like Fun, which looks tremendously enjoyable for Cook but will surely not hang around their setlist for long. Much better is when their chops are transmuted into pure energy: Brianstorm, Don’t Sit Down ’Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair and View from the Afternoon swerve too fast through their corners and are all the better for it. The drummer Matt Helders, a mere timekeeper during the Tranquility Base material, is transformed into a dynamo; with a spotlight behind him, he becomes a tub-thumping Godzilla on the rear wall. Wherever they turn, irony dissolves and Turner, acting out lyrics like “I lost my train of thought” or “she held me very tightly” with am-dram theatricality, can’t help but be a real rock star even as he plays with the role. In the end, every side to the band – funk troupe, garage punks, aloof posers, heartfelt songwriters – coheres on the closing R U Mine?, a diamond anthem that tightens and collapses at all the right moments. Now armed with what is essentially a greatest-hits set, Arctic Monkeys have become a band who can do everything – it might be a construct, but it feels so real."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jun/08/markets-fall-g7-trump-bt-boss-patterson-quits-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T16:16:46Z","webTitle":"Inmarsat rejects takeover approach; G7 worries hit markets - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/08/markets-fall-g7-trump-bt-boss-patterson-quits-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jun/08/markets-fall-g7-trump-bt-boss-patterson-quits-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Inmarsat rejects takeover approach; G7 worries hit markets - as it happened","bodyText":"European markets have closed in the red tonight, hit by worries that G7 meeting will develop into a diplomatic punch-up. The FTSE 100 shed 23 points, or 0.3%, while German’s DAX lost 44 points, or 0.35%. Italy’s FTSE MIB was the big loser, dropping by almost 2% as traders fretted about the new Italian government. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stocks spent much of the session in the red as trade tensions weighed on investor sentiment. The G7 meeting gets under way today in Quebec, and investors are cautious as certain trading relationships are a little strained. Those talks in Quebec will run for hours and continue tomorrow (although without Donald Trump). Leaders are being pushed to make gender equality a top priority, alongside climate change and trade. Keep an eye on our website for the latest developments. Goodnight! GW Newsflash: British satellite company Inmarsat had found itself in a takeover battle. Shares in the company jumped by 13.5% today, sparking speculation that the company could be ‘in play’...and it is! Inmarsat has just told the City that it has rejected an approach from US rival Echostar. It says: The Board of Inmarsat plc notes today’s recent press speculation and movement in its share price and confirms that it received a highly preliminary and indicative non-binding proposal from Echostar Corporation in relation to the potential acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Inmarsat (the “Proposal”). After carefully considering the Proposal with its advisers the Board rejected the Proposal on the basis that it very significantly undervalued Inmarsat and its standalone prospects. The Board remains highly confident in the independent strategy and prospects of Inmarsat. Echostar now has until 6 July to make a firm offer, or walk away. Inmarsat is now valued at around £2.2bn, following todays share price move. Italy’s debt has come under pressure today, sending yields on Italian government bonds higher. The FT says the are several factors, both at home and in Frankfurt..... Strategists are uncertain over how the newly-formed populist government will work with Brussels, and also over its fiscal plans. At the same time, a string of hawkish speeches from ECB policymakers earlier this week have revved up expectations that the central bank will announce next week the end of its bond buying programme. Quantitative easing has been a boon to eurozone government debt, helping push yields lower. European Council president Donald Tusk, who is attending the G7 meeting, insists that European delegates will maintain a united front. Tusk also played down the idea that Russia could be readmitted to the gathering, despite Donald Trump’s comments earlier: He said: “This morning I had the first and very good, promising meeting with Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and I am convinced that here at the G7 we will have a fully united European position on all issues. Including on Russia. I am not talking about details but about the more general common line. Tusk also put his finger on the challenge facing world leaders: BT’s shares are still near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this afternoon, as traders digest the exit of CEO Gavin Patterson. They’re currently up 1.1% at 205p. Back in 2013, when Patterson was appointed, they were worth 300p, so there’s been some value destruction on his watch. BT’s shares did rise early in Patterson’s tenure, hitting £5 in 2016. But they then fell back as BT struggled to hit growth and earnings targets - despite spending a lot of money on sports rights. Last month’s profit warning, released alongside the latest strategy, was the last straw, sending shares to six-year lows. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “Perhaps fittingly, Gavin Patterson’s tenure was very much a game of two halves. The rise of BT’s Sport coverage, which has stepped up to challenge the dominance of Sky initially brought some good times for investors. However, it’s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT’s share price graph resembles something of a black run; pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. Ultimately, this is what’s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down, and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it’s time for a change. Here’s our news story about Trump’s comments: US stock markets have followed Europe and Asia’s lead, and dipped in early trading. It’s a modest fall, though; the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 40-odd point, or 0.15%., while the Nasdaq is down 0.5%. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has reportedly backed Trump’s call for Russia to be reinstated. It raises the prospect of the G7 becoming the G8 again... unless it shrinks to become the G6 first, of course. Breaking: The pound is falling as the Europe Union’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, gives a thumping thumbs down to the UK’s latest proposal. Barnier has rejected Theresa May’s proposal that Britain should stay in the customs union until the end of 2021 unless a new customs agreement is agreed once Brexit has occured. He is telling journalists in Brussels that the backstop cannot apply to the whole UK, but could apply to Northern Ireland. Barnier also takes issue with the ‘time-limited’ nature of the UK’s offer. He insists that “backstop means backstop” (a wry jibe at May’s claim that “Brexit means Brexit”). This has to be a backstop that provides a guarantee under all circumstances. This is another blow to the UK’s position - which was only agreed yesterday after crunch talks between May and Brexit secretary David Davis. Barnier also claimed that the UK’s position is “paradoxical” (because London wants to leave the EU but maintain many of its advantages). The pound has dropped by 0.5% against the US dollar, or 0.66 of a cent, to $1.336. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: Trump has added further spice to the G7 meeting, by telling reporters in Washington that Russian president Vladimir Putin should be joining the throng in Quebec: Russia’s membership of the G8 (as it then was) was suspended after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Given events since, such as the Salisbury Novichok attack, I don’t think Putin is welcome back.... Trump also declared that Canada, the EU and Mexico all treat America very badly when it come to trade, meaning we can dial down expectations for a successful G7 even lower.... Donald Trump’s social media sledging isn’t doing much for the mood on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by 136 points at the open, or around 0.5%. America’s increased isolation on the world stage is worrying traders, says Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. While Trump has at times appeared friendly with certain other heads of state in the past, the relationships have at least appeared to have become more hostile since tariffs were imposed on the European Union, Canada and Mexico by the US last week. The G7 meeting has become more like a G6+1, with Trump choosing to isolate the US on a number of issues from trade to Iran and climate change. The Nasdaq is heading for an 0.8% drop, with Apple called down 2% following reports it is taking a “cautious” approach toward upcoming iPhone shipments this year. Trump has thrown down the gauntlet: We’ll try to hold the president to that last pledge.... However, I suspect the talks will mostly centre on the recent tariffs imposed by the United States on its allies: In another sign that America is detaching from fellow advanced economies, Donald Trump will actually leave the G7 meeting early. The president is due to leave Quebec on Saturday morning, meaning he’ll miss the summit’s second day. Trump is flying to Singapore for his historic meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. The talks could lead to a thawing of tensions between the two countries; but with such unpredictable leaders, anything is possible. My colleague Julian Borger explains how the Trump-Kim meeting could unfold: Trump has sought to play down expectations, characterising the meeting as “getting-to-know-you, plus”. But without a substantial “plus” in the form of progress in the direction of disarmament, the meeting will widely be deemed a failure. And to achieve that progress, Trump will have to make significant gestures towards what Kim wants most – security guarantees. Both leaders will go into the Singapore meeting with cards in their hands, representing quick, deliverable concessions. The big question next week will be which cards they play and in what sequence. At a minimum, Kim will be expected to formalise the current suspension of nuclear and missile testing. He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment. His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details – how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable. Just in: Donald Trump is limbering up for the G7 meeting by firing another attack at Canada over trade tariffs: Trump is referring to Canada’s “Supply management” regime, a long-running point of dispute between the two countries. This system specifies fixed prices paid to farmers, strict quotas for how much they can produce, and a tariff wall to prevent cheaper imports from abroad. The result: stable incomes for farmers, who are protected from bankruptcy in lean times, at the cost of higher prices for Canadian consumers. American farmers, though, want to send their own milk and butter north, and Trump is pushing their case. Emerging market currencies are being hit badly today, as investors scramble into the safety of the US dollar instead. The South African rand, the Turkish lira and the Indian rupee have all suffered sharp falls. This kind of action puts pressure on domestic policymakers to consider raising interest rates to prevent capital flight - a move that also hurts economic growth. Yesterday, Turkey’s central bank hikes its benchmark rate to a blistering 17.75%, from 16.5%, in an attempt to prop up the lira. Angela Merkel has received some unwelcome news as she prepares for the G7 meeting -- German industrial output and exports both fell in April. Factory output across Germany shrank by 1% in April, dashing expectations that it would rise by 0.3%. The Federal Statistics Office also reported that German exports fell by 0.3% in April while imports rose by 2.2%. That helps to narrow Germany’s trade surplus, so could be welcomed by its neighbours. The wider concern, though, is that trade war fears are hurting demand for German goods. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management is gloriously unimpressed by this weekend’s G7 shindig, arguing that little will be achieved in Quebec. But markets could slide if Donald Trump falls out badly with fellow world leaders. Donovan says: Several heads of government disappear off for a taxpayer-financed weekend mini-break in Canada today. The G5, G7, G8, and now G6 plus 1 have never really accomplished very much after the first burst of enthusiasm with the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s. This meeting will be no different. Because the G6 plus 1 is about spin not substance, the risks for markets come from the visual from this meeting. The US is looking isolated. This is not the isolationism and protectionism of the 1930s. In the 1930s everyone put up trade barriers against everyone else. This time the US is putting up trade barriers against everyone else, and everyone else is carrying on just as before. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says the international trade system is more complex than Donald Trump suggests.... Donald Trump’s attacks on the EU and Canada have sent traders racing to sell risky assets, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Interest rate realities are sinking back in ahead of what’s going to be a not particularly cordial G7 summit in Canada. It’s little wonder that risk-aversion has returned. Odeluga points out that G7 summits can often disappoint -- but his week’s one could be especially worrying: Even under ‘normal’ circumstances, markets tend to write-off the chances that G7 summits will result in concrete communiques with lasting impact. The current U.S. administration back-tracked on climate-related pledges within weeks of the last meeting. It also took its first steps on the trade war path despite the anti-“protectionism” sentiments addressed in the prior G7 statement. With new U.S. tariffs now lodged against all but one of the remaining six members and Trump tweeting his still combative mood overnight, some leaders might be wondering if there might be more productive ways to spend their time this weekend. No wonder markets are falling. Overnight, Donald Trump launched a fierce attack on his fellow G7 leaders via Twitter, accusing Europe and Canada of treating America unfairly. Trump signed off that he’s ‘looking forward’ to meeting Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macon in Quebec.... having further stoked the feud between the US and the rest. Macron responded more tactfully, tweeting that tensions are rising everywhere, and the G7 meeting will be demanding. A wave of selling has swept through Europe’s trading floors this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 58 points or 0.75%, to 7645 points. Nearly every share is down -- BT jumped 2.5% at the open, but has now subsided. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames geopolitical worries: A likely feisty G7 meeting in Quebec appears to be the main thing driving the markets lower. Investors are either worried that nothing will get resolved, or Trump will become more entrenched in his aggressive approach to trade. Germany’s DAX has also started the day badly - down 1.1% - while France’s CAC is down 0.6%. BT tweets... ...because the incumbent is being kicked out by the chairman?... Geoff Cutmore of CNBC questions whether BT will stick with Patterson’s strategy to revitalise BT, and cut 13,000 jobs, if he’s now surplus to requirements. Cutmore’s colleague, Karen Tso, points out that transforming BT into a tech-focused company is a huge challenge: It emerged earlier this week that BT shareholders were agitating for change, with top investors demanding talks with chairman Jan du Plessis. We wrote on Monday that du Plessis has already held meetings with investors, with more planned. Clearly the mood wasn’t great. As one top investor told the FT: “I don’t have much faith in Gavin....Since he took over [five years ago], it has not been a happy time for shareholders. I am not sure he is the right man for the job.” Today’s statement suggests that du Plessis and the rest of the board came to the same conclusion, deciding that ‘a change of leadership’ is needed. As Richard Fletcher of The Times puts it, du Plessis has now ‘ousted’ Patterson: A wobbly day’s trading in Asia has seen Japan’s Nikkei drop 0.5%, China’s Shanghai Composite index lose 1.5%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng lose 1.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says G7 worries are mounting. The G7 meeting starts today in Quebec. Traders will be paying attention to see if any progress is made regarding trade talks. President Tump is in the eye of the trade storm, and he is letting the world know he means business, and he is determined to get the best deal for the US. At the moment, investors aren’t overly concerned about the state of play, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a pain threshold. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some breaking news to start the morning: Gavin Patterson is stepping down as chief executive of BT, in the face of criticism from investors. The telecoms giant has announced that Patterson will leave later this year -- after concluding that a ‘change of leadership’ is needed. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company said that it had already started the process of looking for his successor, and expected to appoint a new chief executive in the second half of the year. Jan du Plessis, chairman of BT, thanked Patterson for his contribution but said the company needed a change in leadership. He said: “The board is fully supportive of the strategy recently set out by Gavin and his team. The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has though demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.” Patterson was clearly under pressure; BT’s share price hit its lowest level since 2012 last month. It emerged earlier this week that some investors were losing patience with Patterson, who has been spending billions of pounds on sports rights such as Premier League football in an attempt to attract customers to its TV service. This looks like a rather humiliating way to go, just four weeks after announcing a new strategy and thousands of job cuts. More on that shortly.... Also coming up today Investors will be watching La Malbaie in Quebec, as Canada hosts the G7 meeting of world leaders. It could turn into a G6 +1, though, as America faces criticism over its trade policies from the UK, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada. European markets are expected to fall, with the FTSE 100 called down 35 points, after Asian markets dropped back. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says ‘risk aversion’ is rising, as investors fear the meeting will be fraught. Given the quiet economic calendar today, the continuing trade spat between the US its closet allies will attract a good deal of attention as the G7 summit begins. The broader US market posted its first loss in 5 days as the recent equity rally, and more specifically tech rally, faltered, whilst investors started to show unease over the potential climate at the G7 Summit. Souring investor sentiment resulted in a softer session for Asia and indicates a weaker start for Europe on the open.

About 57,000 drivers aged 75 and over displayed symptoms when they renewed their driving licences during the 12 months to the end of March, according to the national police agency. Under a change to road safety laws introduced last year, drivers who showed symptoms of dementia were required to see a doctor as part of efforts to cut the number of accidents involving older motorists. According to police, more than 2 million drivers underwent cognitive function tests during the year ending in March, and just over 57,000 were suspected of having some form of dementia. The police agency said about 1,900 older drivers had their licences revoked or suspended, while another 16,000 voluntarily surrendered their licences. While the overall number of road traffic deaths fell to a record low last year, police are increasingly concerned about the spike in serious accidents involving older drivers. Many involve drivers mistaking the accelerator for the brake, and driving the wrong way along motorways after entering via interchanges and toll booths. A 90-year-old woman was arrested in May after running a red light and killing a pedestrian near Tokyo. Three other people were injured. The same month, a woman in her 70s drove her car into a hospital waiting area in south-western Japan, injuring 13 people. And in November last year, two people were killed when a car driven by an 83-year-old woman rammed into them at a hospital near Tokyo. As a super-ageing society, Japan is at the forefront of a dementia crisis that experts warn will affect other countries with growing older populations in the decades to come. According to the health ministry, 4.6 million people are living with some form of dementia, with the total expected to soar to about 7.3 million people – or one in five Japanese aged 65 or over – by 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/09/historic-northern-territory-treaty-agreement-means-the-old-way-is-finished","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T23:00:06Z","webTitle":"Historic Northern Territory treaty agreement means 'the old way is finished'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/09/historic-northern-territory-treaty-agreement-means-the-old-way-is-finished","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/09/historic-northern-territory-treaty-agreement-means-the-old-way-is-finished","fields":{"headline":"Historic Northern Territory treaty agreement means 'the old way is finished'","bodyText":"For a small Aboriginal community in Australia’s Northern Territory, Barunga has seen some big promises. On Friday the chief minister of the territory, Michael Gunner, arrived at Barunga festival to sign an agreement to undertake a treaty process that he called “an open slate. We will start with nothing on or off the table.” Gunner’s message was also directed at his own side of the table. “Change of this order may be the hardest within government itself. We’re the biggest risk. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “So I’m saying to the departments, this is non-negotiable. The old way is finished.” “At the pace communities are comfortable, the government is ceding decision-making power back to where it belongs – the communities.” Gunner told the crowd he was proud to have signed the memorandum of understanding, calling it “the most significant Aboriginal affairs reform in the NT this generation”. “It is right we lead this process because it is decent, because we are alive to Aboriginal culture like no other jurisdiction, but also because it is smart. Treaty – reconciliation, healing, empowerment – is fundamentally good for every Territorian.” The chairman of the Northern Land Council, Samuel Bush-Blanasi, said it was “momentous.” “We’ve got a big journey ahead of us. The MOU gives us high hopes about the future, and I hope the government stays true to the spirit of the MOU.” That note of hope was echoed by the chairman of the Central Land Council, Francis Jupurrurla Kelly. “I hope a treaty will settle us down together and bring self-determination. “Today we bounced the ball,” Jupurrurla Kelly said, “but we don’t want to stay the only players in the game. The next steps must be led by Aboriginal people across the Territory so that … everyone can have their say.” Tiwi Land Council’s Gibson Farmer Illortaminni was more cautious. “We’ve got to be careful and understand each other about what we want, because we don’t want to have the same problems we’ve had in the past. The MOU is a good start, but we’ve got a long way to go.” The treaty agreement kicked off the annual Barunga festival. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the historic Barunga statement, presented to the then prime minister Bob Hawke, calling for Aboriginal self-management, a national system of land rights and compensation for loss of lands. Hawke said he wanted to conclude a treaty between Aboriginal and other Australians by 1990, but it never happened. “The petition now hangs on the wall of Parliament House like a spectre,” Gunner said in his address. “The well-meaning promises 30 years ago at this place have washed away, like the song says, writing in the sand. I am proud to say that Barunga is a place of history again.” The exhibition includes gifts presented to Hazel Hawke in 1988, and other items never before seen by the public. The Institute of Aboriginal and Islander Studies (AIATSIS) helped curate the exhibition. The chief executive of AIATSIS, Craig Ritchie, told Guardian Australia: “The Barunga statement is an enduring declaration of the power of Aboriginal peoples’ connections to country. “We hope this exhibition encourages all Australians to engage with this important moment in our history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/08/canada-closer-to-legalising-marijuana-after-senate-vote-in-favour","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T03:21:24Z","webTitle":"Canada closer to legalising marijuana after senate vote in favour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/canada-closer-to-legalising-marijuana-after-senate-vote-in-favour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/08/canada-closer-to-legalising-marijuana-after-senate-vote-in-favour","fields":{"headline":"Canada closer to legalising marijuana after senate vote in favour","bodyText":"Canada’s senate has voted to legalise recreational marijuana, clearing a major hurdle as the country moves towards becoming the first in the G7 to fully legalise the drug. The country’s upper chamber voted 56-30 on Thursday in favour of legislation aimed at ending more than 90 years of prohibition. The senate, however, added nearly four dozen amendments, meaning the legislation will now return to the House of Commons for consideration. The federal Liberal government, led by Justin Trudeau, introduced the legislation last year in a bid to make Canada the second country in the world to legalise the cannabis, after Uruguay. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada. The legislation divided the responsibilities between the federal and provincial governments, with Ottawa responsible for regulating production while leaving it to provinces and territories to decide how the drug will be distributed and sold. Once passed and implemented, those who want to grow their own marijuana will be limited to four plants per household. Canadians will be allowed to carry up to 30 grams of dried cannabis for personal use while those who sell or give marijuana to minors or who drive under its influence will face stiff penalties. Since becoming the Liberal leader in 2013, Trudeau has argued that the decriminalisation and regulation of marijuana would help keep the drug away from children and ensure profits don’t end up in the hands of what he described as “criminal elements.” While the sale of recreational marijuana is not expected to begin until August or September, the senate vote was one of the major obstacles standing in the way of legalisation as Conservatives senators sought to block the initiative. The many amendments added by the senate – and which will now be considered by MPs – reflect some of this opposition, such as tighter restrictions on advertising by cannabis companies and allowing provinces to prohibit home cultivation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/09/an-inflatable-screen-and-8000km-the-film-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T00:53:57Z","webTitle":"The inflatable screen taking Indigenous film back to the Top End","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/09/an-inflatable-screen-and-8000km-the-film-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/09/an-inflatable-screen-and-8000km-the-film-festival","fields":{"headline":"The inflatable screen taking Indigenous film back to the Top End","bodyText":"As dusk falls on the small community of Beswick, children gather in a circle to dance, impromptu, to the didgeridoo. In the air is the sweet, thick taste of anticipation. Tonight, the inaugural Northern Territory Travelling Film festival (NTTFF) – consisting of a giant al fresco inflatable screen, blown up by hand in each of the 10 Indigenous communities it lands in, covering about 8,400 kilometres – is coming to town. But there is another reason for the feeling of tension. Billed in the program is Finding Maawirrangga, the 2017 documentary in which actor and musician Balang T Lewis – the star of The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith – returns to his grandmother’s country to learn his songlines. It is the first time the short film has been shown since Lewis died suddenly last month, aged just 59, from a heart attack. In a prescient scene, Lewis stares at the camera. “I am not going to the grave without my songs,” he declares. “The film was just emotional – it took my breath away,” says Lewis’ cousin, 52-year-old Lillian Ngalmi Joshua, thumping her heart with her fist. The film was, for Ngalmi Joshua, “a celebration of him, after we buried him and [said] goodbye to him.” Murrungun man Lewis was a giant in the remote Arnhem Land community, where he returned in 2001. It is in Beswick that he and his wife Fleur Parry founded the Djilpin Arts Aboriginal Corporation, as well as the Walking with Spirits festival. As Julia Morris, producer of Finding Maawirrangga, puts it: “He’s the dreamer and she’s the doer.” Reminders of his funeral, held just days before the film screening, are everywhere: inside the Beswick art gallery, a photo album of Lewis is propped up with a bunch of plastic roses; just to the left of the outdoor cinema screen is the bower shade, a shelter topped with a mass of leaves, where family and friends came to pay their respects. Lewis shot to fame in 1978, plucked from obscurity to play the title character of The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith: a half-caste Aboriginal man haunted by systematic discrimination and abuse. He more recently starred in a critically acclaimed Aboriginal King Lear titled The Shadow King, was a regular on the Melbourne theatre scene, and toured Australia and the globe with his jazz duo Lewis &amp; Young. Yet too often his work, and that of other Indigenous actors and filmmakers, was not seen in the communities from which it came. The film festival was founded so that audiences could access “stories that reflect back their lives,” says Britt Guy, creative producer of NTTFF’s touring company Accomplice. “The NT is exported to other places ... but quite often the communities themselves don’t get to celebrate their films, their stories.” This is exacerbated by a severe lack of cinemas: in the Northern Territory film screens are located only in Alice Springs, Katherine, and Darwin. To combat this, and to tackle remoteness head on, the film festival has brought the buttercup yellow Mobile Solar Cinema to viewers. From 21 May to 9 June, a free program of 10 shorts made by local filmmakers was taken to 10 Aboriginal communities. (There were also ticketed outdoor screenings across iconic locations including Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Park.) Guy shrugs and points to her vehicle, covered with a thin veil of dust: “It’s two people in a trailer for four weeks travelling thousands of miles. That car and that trailer is all there is to the NT Travelling Film festival.” Reactions have varied from town to town, as the festival has crossed language lines. “Different communities can understand the in-jokes, so you get completely different laughs in different places,” says Guy. “With the passing of Mr Lewis, that film in particular – as we’ve come closer to where he is from – has also [led to] a period of reflection for some of those communities that hold family members.” The festival is ambitious in scope. But Torres Strait Islander dancer and comedian Ghenoa Gela insists the mission matters. “Stories can actually help people,” she says, in the nearby country town of Katherine. “If you see something similar to your own story there on the big screen, you find a sense of validity in yourself. It can shift your perception.” Ngalmi Joshua agrees: “It is very important when we find ourselves, coloured people, on a project on a big film.” Lewis, famous both on and off the screen, was “a real character of the Territory,” insists Guy. Yet as someone who straddled both the white and black worlds (his mother was Aboriginal, his father Welsh), he also made significant sacrifices to pursue the arts. “He had a lot of weight on his shoulders that he had to carry,” notes Morris. “Jimmie Blacksmith changed his life for good and for bad. It opened up the world and travelling and people, but also it took him away from his family.” In Finding Maawirrangga, Lewis delves deeper into such issues, discussing banishment from his community due to cultural missteps on the stage. “I’ve been punished too long and I never gave up,” he says in the documentary, directed with grace by Dylan River Glynn McDonald. His journey to the Sandy Island of Maawirrangga, achieved through learning the Thumbul corroboree, was a homecoming of sorts. Lewis’ death leaves a gap: the “voice that can speak to many different parts and people of Australia,” maintains Morris. For now, though, bringing Finding Maawirrangga to Beswick, even for one night, was for many as much a moment of great pride as well as sadness. “An Aboriginal in the film industry, you know, making a name for himself ...” artist Ivan Ngalmi, partner to Lewis’ cousin Ngalmi Joshua, says, tailing off and shaking his head. “He didn’t call himself a white man or yellow. He was an Aboriginal.” Nine-year-old Lydia, Ngalmi Joshua’s whippet-smart granddaughter, may have lost someone she loved. But she has also been inspired. “I was so happy,” she says, sitting under the stars after watching Finding Maawirrangga, in which she featured. She sticks out her tongue, with shyness. “I want to be an actor. I want to be famous too.” • The Guardian was a guest of the Northern Territory Travelling Film festival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/defamation-laws-must-balance-protecting-reputations-with-freedom-of-expression","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T04:48:56Z","webTitle":"Defamation laws must balance protecting reputations with freedom of expression | Derek Wilding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/defamation-laws-must-balance-protecting-reputations-with-freedom-of-expression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/defamation-laws-must-balance-protecting-reputations-with-freedom-of-expression","fields":{"headline":"Defamation laws must balance protecting reputations with freedom of expression","bodyText":"It’s no surprise New South Wales is the state to kick-start a national review of defamation laws. This state has long been recognised as the hub of reputation litigation in Australia, and this was confirmed in a study we published earlier this year. In looking at cases in the five years since 2013, we found more matters reached a substantive decision in NSW than in all other states combined. More importantly, these cases are now quite different from the matters considered at the time Australia’s uniform defamation scheme commenced in the mid-2000s. Although each state and territory has its own laws, and matters are heard in the courts of each jurisdiction as well as in the federal court of Australia, the legislation across the country is by and large the same. And although NSW has the bulk of litigation action, all jurisdictions face a similar dilemma: the majority of matters now involve digital publication, and some of these publications – social media posts, for example – were unimagined at the time the scheme was implemented. So it’s good to see the start of what will hopefully be a national reform process, with the attorney general of NSW taking his recommendations to a meeting of his counterparts in the other states and territories this week. The review in NSW started in 2010 but has only just reached the stage of a published report and recommendations. Consultation across the country is now likely to ensure that the law strikes the right balance in protecting people’s reputations while also allowing for freedom of expression. There’s a particular need to ensure that journalism is not hampered by laws which prevent legitimate exposure of wrongdoing and critique of decisions and actions, especially by those in public life. While this “chilling effect” on reporting has long been a criticism of the way some of our laws are drafted, the latest review grapples with a more recent phenomenon: the emergence of defamation actions by individuals against other individuals about comments made on social media and other digital platforms. When we looked at this in our study, we found that public figures only comprised about one fifth of the plaintiffs in defamation cases. Media organisations were the defendants in only about one quarter of cases. Even so, some decisions awarded substantial damages for Facebook posts, text messages and blog comments. Some of these were serious matters involving accusations of fraud and sexual misconduct, but NSW district court judge Judith Gibson has noted a trend towards smaller, more trivial matters finding their way into court. These might involve comments made in forums that most people would never consider to be “publications” under the law of defamation. Indeed, a number of these matters involve defendants who don’t have lawyers representing them in court. Some of the cases even result in judgment entered against the defendant without a full testing of the merits of the claim – individuals who simply made a post on social media sometimes don’t even respond to the law suit. As judge Gibson has also noted, one of the problems with digital publication is that there is effectively no time limit on bringing a defamation action because the law sees it as being republished whenever someone downloads it – even if that’s the social media post this ordinary individual made years ago. So the review conducted by NSW makes some important moves in addressing the kinds of matters that might get to court and the ways in which claims might be put and defences argued. This in turn might help to knock out some of the many matters that do not make it to court but are the subject of time-consuming correspondence by media organisations and, in some cases, settlements made simply to avoid the costs of full litigation. The trials of journalists coping with writs and threats over many years have shown that defamation law is a fraught and expensive process. It’s also risky for plaintiffs: our study found that while there are some enormous awards of damages for public figures, overall plaintiffs were successful in only around one third of matters – and even then, the damages may be small compared to the costs. While the current recommendations are the work of only one state, this is a national issue. Let’s hope the attorneys general work together to review and modernise defamation legislation. These laws have an important role in protecting reputation but they need amendment to help them address the contemporary environment and to stop them impeding legitimate freedom of expression. • Derek Wilding is co-director of the Centre for Media Transition at University of Technology Sydney. • Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/07/wakefield-wigan-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T22:24:49Z","webTitle":"Wakefield run in five tries to pile on the agony for struggling Wigan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/07/wakefield-wigan-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/07/wakefield-wigan-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wakefield run in five tries to pile on the agony for struggling Wigan","bodyText":"Shaun Wane insisted on Thursday night that “there is no panic at all” at Wigan, after yet another defeat for the Warriors amid off-field turmoil at one of Super League’s most famous clubs. This was Wigan’s third successive defeat since the sudden decision from Wane to announce he would be ending his 30-year association with the club at the end of this season. The Warriors have scored just four tries in those three games. The headlines which accompanied the ill-fated behaviour of the Tomkins brothers last weekend have stolen much of the spotlight in the past seven days, but it is impossible to avoid the fact that on the field Wigan’s form has collapsed since news of Wane’s impending departure broke. “There’s absolutely no panic at all,” Wane said. “We have to improve and we need to be better, work harder, and I need to be smarter. But they’re a strong bunch, and I know people will enjoy the position we’re in.” Home games against Wigan usually bring out the best in Chris Chester’s Wakefield side, and by the end it was hard to argue with the final scoreline being so comprehensively in Trinity’s favour. Like Wigan they, too, have only league matters to focus on after exiting the Challenge Cup but it is not unreasonable that, with more performances such as this, a top-four push could be realistic. They have now beaten the league’s top two at home this season. With one of their greatest sons, Neil Fox, in attendance, this was a performance of which he would have approved. “We want to be in that top six every year, and it’s really important for us now to invest a bit more money in the team – but we’re looking up, not down,” Chester said post-match. Wakefield took an early lead when some wonderful lead-up play allowed the wing Ben Jones-Bishop to cross. Ryan Hampshire improved that try with a penalty before Bill Tupou finished well shortly after. Trinity’s dominance emanated from the strength of their pack, and after the outstanding David Fifita won them another penalty Hampshire improved again to make it 14-0. By the time Wigan scored via Gabe Hamlin, it ended a barren run of 184 minutes without a point. Trailing 14-6 at the break, it was clear the first score after half-time was vital. It went to Wakefield as Jones-Bishop superbly picked a Sean O’Loughlin pass with the visitors pressing to race the length and, realistically, consign Wigan to yet another defeat. Tom Johnstone then produced a magnificent finish after another Wigan error, and while the visitors did briefly threaten a thrilling finish when Tom Davies and Morgan Escare scored it always felt a stretch too far for a side so dramatically out of sorts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/08/friday-briefing-backstop-fudge-and-meltdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T05:25:05Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Backstop, Fudge and Meltdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/friday-briefing-backstop-fudge-and-meltdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/08/friday-briefing-backstop-fudge-and-meltdown","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: Backstop, Fudge and Meltdown","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Imagine Trump doing Brexit’ Hello, welcome to Friday. I’m Warren Murray with more jargon to add to the Brexit lexicon. Theresa May has bent to secretary David Davis’s demands over the “backstop” that would keep Britain in the EU customs union for the sake of an open Irish border. But divisions persist in the cabinet over Brexit – as evidenced by a secret recording of Boris Johnson, where he warned of a “meltdown” on the road to exiting the European Union and dismissed the Irish border issue as “folly”. The foreign secretary criticised Philip Hammond’s Treasury as “the heart of remain”, saying it had focused on “mumbo jumbo” predictions about short-term disruption, instead of the potential gains from leaving the EU. “Imagine Trump doing Brexit,” Johnson told Tory dining partners at Chatham House. “He’d go in bloody hard … There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very, very good thought.” May has agreed to a backstop “fudge” that says the UK “expects” new, permanent customs arrangements with the EU to be in place by the end of December 2021. It placates Davis, while remainers say it is cosmetic with no legal force. On a plane to the G7 summit in Canada, May refused to give a cast-iron guarantee that the backstop would only be temporary. She emphasised it might never be used. “I’ve always been clear that this was time limited and as we’ve said today [Thursday] the end state at the latest will be in by the end of 2021 and we will be working to ensure that it is in earlier than that.” Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, made what appeared to be a quip on Twitter: “Is it an all-weather backstop?” * * * Life on Mars – Yes it’s another of those headlines but in this case the facts behind it are quite promising. The venerable Mars Curiosity rover has drilled into a piece of mudstone and found chemical traces of organic compounds. “It is not telling us that life was there,” says Jennifer Eigenbrode, a Nasa biogeochemist, “but it is saying that everything organisms really needed to live in that kind of environment, all of that was there.” It points to the Mars of long ago having had lakes that held the carbon-based compounds necessary for life similar to our own. Could life still be there? “These molecules could have been part of life, but they could also have been food for life,” said Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist. “This is very promising for the preservation of potential ancient life on the planet.” * * * G7 begins – Donald Trump looks set to clash with everyone else as the G7 summit gets under way in Quebec today. France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy will be lobbying the US president to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. The UK, Germany and France will demand that European companies having dealings with Iran are spared from US sanctions. More pressing are steel and aluminium tariffs, with the EU poised to impose retaliatory measures on American goods ranging from jeans to motorbikes. Sharp words have circulated between several of the leaders: Emmanuel Macron of France has called for the G7-minus-one to resist Trump’s attempts to impose a “crude hegemony” while Canada’s Justin Trudeau called Trump’s tariffs “unilateral and illegal”. Trump hit back, claiming that Canadian trade policy was “killing our agriculture”. * * * Daily Mail’s next editor – Geordie Greig has been drafted across from the helm of the Mail on Sunday to take over from Paul Dacre as editor of the Daily Mail. Greig has been described as “50% courtier, 50% old-school hack” by a former boss. In contrast to Dacre, at the Mail on Sunday he took an anti-Brexit line. Greig also formerly edited the Evening Standard, and wrote a biography of the artist Lucian Freud. * * * ‘Left to die’ – A 38-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer was denied potentially life-saving chemotherapy for nearly six weeks in what refugee support groups say is another manifestation of the “hostile environment” policy. Kelemua Mulat, from Ethiopia, is now receiving the treatment after the Christie hospital in Manchester managed to override a Home Office decision that she was not eligible for NHS care. Mulat has been refused asylum but is appealing, saying she is part of a pro-democracy group whose members have been sentenced to death or long jail terms. * * * ‘New room in the Great Pyramid’ – An unheard album of John Coltrane’s music has been found and will be released at the end of this month. The session, recorded on 6 March 1963 in New Jersey, features the legendary jazz saxophonist in what is regarded as his “classic quartet”. The master tape was lost but it turned out Coltrane had given a copy to his soon-to-be ex-wife and it remained in her family. Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album comes out on 29 June. The British jazz and improv saxophonist Evan Parker told the Guardian: “This release is most welcome – the ‘classic quartet’ was where Coltrane did his best work.” Lunchtime read: ‘We had a name for ourselves: Travellers’ “I can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations; I was brought up to know the Romani language,” writes Damian Le Bas as he goes back on the road to reconnect with his Traveller roots. “I was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm; a mental Gypsyland.” Eight months into his journey to rediscover the stopping places of Traveller life, “I realised how sparsely furnished my van was … bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I’ve been missing a trick.” With his Mum’s help the van was soon decked out: “An Islamic purple velvet hanging … matching Bedouin horse-cloths … brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.” Sport Gareth Southgate has admitted he has “serious decisions” to make over his preferred lineup for England’s opening group game at the World Cup after a much changed team impressed in the 2-0 dismissal of Costa Rica, which served as a productive run-out for a starting team of Plan Bs and second-choicers. England football fans visiting Russia are at serious risk of homophobic, racist and anti-British attacks and have been offered only “vague reassurance” about their safety by the Foreign Office and police, MPs have warned. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen has rejected suggestions he should change his driving approach, saying he might “headbutt someone” if he is questioned any further on being involved in incidents at every race this season. Sloane Stephens brushed aside Madison Keys in an all-American semi-final at Roland Garros to set up a French Open final against Simona Halep, after the Romanian top seed defeated Garbiñe Muguruza. The mouthwatering prospect of Anthony Joshua finally facing the American Deontay Wilder in a huge heavyweight title reunification fight has moved several steps closer. And England have capped plenty of overseas-reared rugby players over the years but none has had a shorter run-up than Brad Shields, their latest newcomer. Business It was the proverbial tough day at the office for executives at some top companies yesterday. TSB boss Paul Pester was lambasted by MPs for not coming clean about the bank’s IT troubles, while M&amp;S execs were told they wouldn’t be getting their usual bonuses because of the retailer’s poor performance. Meanwhile 11,000 jobs are at risk at House of Fraser and Poundland. The FTSE100 due to drop 0.4% according to futures trading. The pound is flat at $1.342 and €1.137. The papers “We must take the fight to the enemy” – that’s the Times’ take on the secret Boris Johnson recording. “Hammond gets both barrels from Boris”, cheers the Daily Mail. In the Telegraph: “Boris: May must show more guts on Brexit” – see how BoJo gets the first-name treatment but Theresa May doesn’t? The Express says Theresa May has declared “Brexit back on track” after striking a compromise deal with her cabinet.

This one-day tour match between Sussex and Australia, innocuous enough when the fixture was first scheduled, was one such occasion. Sometimes they are drawn to the presence of a great player, or one on the precipice of a major landmark. This match, however, was notable not for who was here but who was not. Coming less than three months after that incident with the sandpaper in South Africa, Australia’s bid to rebuild their team, and reputation, begun with a trip to the seaside. It was a trip, however, without the former captain Steve Smith, his then-deputy David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, all serving bans for their involvement in the ball-tampering affair. Injury has also put paid to Australia’s vaunted seam attack of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. The feeling therefore was that Australia are here for the taking and this match, in front of a capacity crowd and less than a week before they take on England, was a chance for a first glimpse. Australia ran out 57-run winners but England, who top the one-day international rankings, will not feel too threatened. The opening batsman D’Arcy Short, whose struggles against spin continue, provided some entertainment at least as the comedy villain for Thursday night’s stage. To the crowd’s delight, and just at the point of the evening when the beer taps become locked at right-angles, Short, at square leg, dropped his opposite number Phil Salt to identical shots in consecutive overs. Salt duly peppered the ball to all parts for a 33-ball half-century, which he brought up with consecutive sixes, before succumbing to a yorker for 62. No one inside Australia’s top eight exceeded a run-a-ball strike rate, although Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis had at least shown earlier that not all high-quality Australian batsmen have been exiled to Canada. They compiled steady, if not stellar, knocks of 78 and 110 respectively to steer Australia to 277, an ultimately comfortable total. A mid-order collapse, in which four wickets fell for 13 runs inside five overs, will worry the visitors, however. “It has been a bit of a pattern I guess so that’s something we are going to try and fix,” said Stoinis, the game’s sole centurion. “I think we feel the pressure of a few dot balls. You’ve just got to bat your way through it. Obviously everyone is a good player, and for the team it’s important that if you get in you take the game as deep as possible.” Ashton Agar’s three wickets will provide some encouragement, but the world champions know there is much to improve, including their fielding – four catches were dropped. “It’s probably not something we’ve got to work on now,” said Stoinis. “We work on it every training session. These things happen. First game back, it’s no stress.” Stoinis was in an equable mood. Asked if the message from Justin Langer post-scandal was to go out and have fun, he shrugged. “We haven’t spoken about it too much to be honest,” he replied. “It’s more the fact that we are so lucky to be playing cricket, we are in these [Australian] clothes, we are with a group of mates, travelling through England, playing at beautiful grounds against good opposition and going into a big series.” From an English perspective, the return of the right-arm seamer Jofra Archer to the ground where he made his first-class debut against a touring Pakistan side two years ago also brought him three wickets on a placid pitch. After his globetrotting exploits in the Big Bash League and Indian Premier League, Archer’s performance will only strengthen the calls to accelerate his England qualification. During the buildup there had been an air of intrigue as to how the tourists would compose themselves in front of a potentially hostile crowd. But a sunny weekday afternoon here was not the place for such a reception. Hove – or “Sussex by the Sea”, the county’s affectionate nickname and moniker for the charming fairground anthem which accompanied its players onto the field – is not known for its antagonistic crowds. Most punters, blazers on, beer in hand and gently jostling between the heaving hospitality tents, were here for a good time. On a day where most of working age are otherwise engaged, the atmosphere was one of a typically relaxed county cricket crowd: more convivial chatter than hostile environment. It was not until 8.30pm that any sandpaper jibes started echoing around the ground. Even then it was only really the alcohol working its magic; “If you love sandpaper clap your hands,” is hardly the most original line, after all. Not that Australia were too fussed. “The banter was pretty good that I heard,” Stoinis said with a laugh. “You could hear them all singing, it was all in good spirits.” It is lucky perhaps for the tourists that this new era has begun not on Australia’s shores, but almost 10,000 miles away, in mid-winter back home and at the height of the Australian Rules Football season: they have avoided the glare of their home media. Like their performance on Thursday however, Australia realise that changes in perception, and evidence that they truly are a team transformed, will not come immediately. Slowly but surely, and with likely a few wobbles in the middle, they must build the foundations for an innings, and a future, far bigger."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/07/richard-scudamore-devil-you-know-quits-while-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T19:54:00Z","webTitle":"Richard Scudamore: the ‘devil you know’ quits while he’s still ahead | David Conn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/07/richard-scudamore-devil-you-know-quits-while-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/07/richard-scudamore-devil-you-know-quits-while-ahead","fields":{"headline":"Richard Scudamore: the ‘devil you know’ quits while he’s still ahead","bodyText":"After two decades carving out total dominance for the Premier League, Richard Scudamore was able to announce his surprise resignation at a high point of his own choosing – a happy position not enjoyed by some who challenged that supremacy over the years. The arc of his stellar career serving the 20 clubs which form the Premier League in any given season is pockmarked with the early departures of other talented chief executives, particularly at the Football Association, whose authority he was repeatedly determined to resist. As a chief executive entrusted by the top clubs with great authority, his record is a reflection of the Premier League’s development itself: its glittering achievements and for many, glaring frustrations. The official farewell thanks to Scudamore from his friend Bruce Buck, Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea chairman, and chairman of the league’s remuneration committee which fixed Scudamore’s salary package at £2.56m last year, noted his most obvious achievement: the Premier League’s “outstanding growth”. Scudamore’s era has been a twinning of football with money – and with Sky pay TV, which he singled out for thanks himself. He is personally associated with delivering billions for clubs to spend on players and coaches who would generate yet greater audiences and revenue. However unnecessarily territorial he has appeared to people who feel football should be run in a more cooperative way, and the observation that he has been in the right place at a time of media industry transformation, insiders say his competence cannot be questioned. For the employees whom he supports, he is clearly an encouraging boss and he was gracious in thanking the staff, mentioning their “sense of fun” as well as professionalism. His leaving was the third Premier League announcement of the day, following two he will have seen as victories. The final two UK TV packages for 2019-21, with £4.464bn already banked, were sold to BT Sport and Amazon Prime, football’s breakthrough first internet streaming platform. There was also the agreement for the so-called “big six” clubs to have more of the international rights money and no longer share it equally, as they have since the Premier League’s original breakaway formation in 1992. Scudamore was satisfied to achieve a consensus as the top clubs, all owned by mega-wealthy overseas investors, have pushed relentlessly for more. But he may also have seen these two developments heralding a changing landscape, coming battles by the big clubs for more money, which may have played into his decision to bow out now, still at the top. The timing just before another World Cup puts the focus on one of the frustrating areas of Scudamore’s and the Premier League’s supremacy. Improving the England team was the stated justification for the First Division breakaway to form the Premier League in 1992, although the clubs’ main motivation was not to share the coming TV bonanza with the Football League’s other three divisions. England’s international performances have not improved since in any way commensurately with the league’s triumph, and the multiplication of overseas players, coaches and investor-owners must be a factor. Scudamore has resisted engaging with that debate as much as he has been able to, and concentrated instead on trying to improve clubs’ youth development. It has been a great pity that this period has seen turf wars with the FA and a diminution in its role as a proper governing body – including of the Premier League – when overall stewardship has been seriously needed. Scudamore has also defended the Premier League skilfully from occasional government sniffs at regulation for excessive ticket prices, profiteering and other sources of supporter dissatisfaction. Partly he has done so by pointing to the money, now £100m a season – 3.6% of TV revenues – going to grass roots facilities and community projects, which he has maintained and supported. He has also delivered £100m in “solidarity” with the EFL and National League, barely fording the gap, but hungrily accepted by their clubs. Some football people have felt comfortable with Scudamore despite the perception of him as an aggressive fighter for the Premier League, appreciating his roots as an English football fan. Some pictured a possible alternative, say an obsessively commercial US-style chief executive, who might think ending promotion and relegation makes sense, and came to the conclusion about Scudamore: better the devil you know."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/08/labour-party-backing-safe-standing-english-football-stadiums","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T21:30:35Z","webTitle":"Labour calls on government to back safe standing at English football stadiums","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/08/labour-party-backing-safe-standing-english-football-stadiums","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/08/labour-party-backing-safe-standing-english-football-stadiums","fields":{"headline":"Richard Scudamore: Premier League clubs should have safe standing choice","bodyText":"The Premier League has come out in favour of allowing its clubs a “local choice” as to whether to introduce safe standing. The decision – announced by the outgoing executive chairman, Richard Scudamore – came as the Labour party demanded the government drop an intended review of safe standing and instead back its introduction without delay. Until this week the Premier League has stood back from the debate, insisting it wanted to compile more evidence on the appetite for safe standing. In the meantime the English Football League has taken a lead on the matter and last month called for clubs to be given a choice whether to install standing areas. This is a position the Premier League now shares. “We are looking to make sure we’ve got all evidence and all the data to feed into government on a review they’ve pretty much committed to holding,” Scudamore said. “I think we will look to work with that review in order to create the position where our clubs have choice – which is a local choice based on their own stadia, their own circumstances, in order to enable them to, if they wish, to be able to offer alternatives to all-seat [stadiums].” Labour has gone one further, calling for the laws which prevent standing at grounds in the Premier League and the Championship, to be changed within weeks. The matter is due to be debated in parliament on 25 June but the shadow sports minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, said any plans for a review should be dropped. “There have been enough consultations,” she said. “The government made a rushed announcement. I feel it’s not time for a review now. We have all the information we need. This is about English fans enjoying our national sport safely, and the government just needs to get on with it.” According to Scudamore, Premier League research has found that 70% of supporters would wish to have the choice of standing at their club’s matches. He said his main concern now was that the introduction of safe standing would not mean enforced seating in other areas of the stadium. “The one biggest fear we’ve got is that we do not want the introduction of a small standing area and there be a total enforcement of sitting elsewhere,” he said. Meanwhile, the Premier League has announced plans to revise its rules around agents in an aim to create greater transparency both for clubs and players. New proposals were given unanimous support by Premier league clubs this week, according to the outgoing executive chairman Richard Scudamore, and will now be worked on with the FA before being finalised. The Premier League also intends to share the proposals with Fifa, which is also reviewing the role of agents. The new proposals include • A requirement for agents to pass an exam to represent players in England. • A need for agents to have a UK bank account (with players and clubs only able to pay into that bank account). • A requirement for agents that receive payments from players in England to submit annual financial reports to the FA detailing the payments they have received. • A need for an agent to be paid over the length of a player’s contract (not lump sums) “We came up with 17 recommendations which were unanimously approved by the clubs and most are about transparency and ensuring the player is at the centre of the transaction,” Scudamore said. “We want to be sure that he knows who he is signing for, making sure he’s educated, educating his parents too. We are trying to put the player more in control.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"games/live/2018/jun/10/e3-2018-live-news-biggest-video-game-event-of-the-year","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T03:22:10Z","webTitle":"Day one of E3 2018 gave us new Halo, Gears of War, Fallout, and Elder Scrolls VI – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/live/2018/jun/10/e3-2018-live-news-biggest-video-game-event-of-the-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/live/2018/jun/10/e3-2018-live-news-biggest-video-game-event-of-the-year","fields":{"headline":"Day one of E3 2018 gave us new Halo, Gears of War, Fallout, and Elder Scrolls VI – as it happened","bodyText":"Developers have started to tweet from the Xbox conference. Here is the crew from Rare, so we can expect some Sea of Thieves news. If you’re just joining us, here are the key revelations from Monday’s Xbox and Bethesda presentations. Read our full summary of the day’s events right here: Xbox Halo Infinite, Devil May Cry V, Gears of War V, Battletoads and Cyberpunk 2077 revealed. A new From Software adventure Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice unveiled. Microsoft has five new first-party studios including Ninja Theory and Playground Games. Bethesda Elder Scrolls VI announced, as well as a new mobile adventure named Elder Scrolls Blades. A long-rumoured science fiction action RPG Starfield revealed. Fallout 76 is to be an online multiplayer title, but will still retain many elements of the single-player experience. Doom and Wolfenstein both getting sequels in the form of Doom Eternal and Wolfestein Youngblood. Thank you for joining us for day one of our E3 live blog! Tomorrow we’ll be back for Ubisoft and Sony’s press conferences, from 12pm to 8pm PDT. On a night slightly marred by some awkward stage moments, Bethesda closed its E3 conference giving fans exactly what they wanted: the announcement of Elder Scrolls VI. Absolutely nothing was revealed about the title apart from a glimpse at a vast landscape, which suggests we’re a long way from release. The first announcement of the night was Doom Eternal, a sequel to the much-enjoyed Doom reboot. Offering “Hell on Earth” and twice as many demon types as the last title, the game will be debuted at QuakeCon in August. Also getting a new sequel is Wolfenstein – subtitled Youngblood, it’s a co-operative shooter featuring Jess and Soph, the twin daughters of series hero BJ’s Blazkowicz. Their quest is to locate their father in a Nazi-occupied 1980s Paris. Then Todd Howard arrived on stage with a series of revelations, including the intriguing news that Fallout 76 will be an online multiplayer title. Participants will still create characters and head off on story quests, but they’ll now meet other players en route. According to Howard, the population will be kept to dozens rather than thousands of players, and you’ll all be able to co-operate or fight over resources. Nuclear weapons will also factor with players searching for launch codes before firing missiles at whatever they want. A new mobile game, Elder Scrolls Blades was revealed, offering a narrative adventure that uses the phone screen to produce tactile combat, courtesy of swiping movements. P vs P and P vs E modes were both mentioned. Howard also revealed a brand new science fiction RPG franchise named Starfield, which Bethesda has apparently been working on for several years. There were no further details. But the big news was the Elder Scolls VI announcement, which was really just the logo placed over a rather gorgeous landscape. It was a mere tease, but enough to leave us wanting much more. Okay, that’s it from Bethesda. It was a rather mixed presentation with some awkward humour and stilted attempts to draw louder whoops from the audience. But then they announced Elder Scrolls VI so everything is forgiven. But that’s literally all Todd Howard says about this long-awaited sequel. What a tease. Bethesda has been working on a brand new next generation single-player game in a new epic franchise named Starfield. “Our first wholly original franchise in 25 years,” says Howard. The studio has apparently spent years working on the game, which looks to be science fiction-based. Elder Scrolls is coming to smart phones. It’s a massive first-person RPG with console-quality visuals, but “a uniquely mobile experience”. The new combat engine will use a swiping mechanic to time sword thrusts. There are spells as well as melee combat. There will be several modes of play including The Abyss and endless dungeon and Arena, where you battle other players. In The Town, you’re an exiled warrior returning home to build a new town. As it levels up, you unlock new quests and items, and players can visit their friends’ towns. It’s coming to consoles and PCs as well as phones. There will also be a VR version and all the versions connect. It’s coming this autumn for free. You can register for early access at www.playblades.com Fallout Shelter is coming to the PS4 and Nintendo Switch and it will still be free to play. These versions are coming out tonight. Fallout 76 will feature a new building system that will let you construct bases wherever you like, and also take them with you as you play. Homes will come under attack from monsters and you’ll be able to work with neighbouring players to defeat them. There will also be multiple nuclear missile sites on the map, which players will be able to use against each other. That spells apocalyptic trolling potential. Players need to attain the letters and numbers from a nuclear launch code by looting downed enemies – you’ll be able to team up with other players to collect the codes you need. Once an explosion happens, players can raid the site to discover rare and exotic items. 100% dedicated servers says Howard, which gets some whoops. There will be a beta test and a special edition that comes with a glow-in-the-dark map and a power helmet with lamp and voice modulator. Sometimes you don’t know if Todd is joking or not. It’s out on the 14 November. Ah next up is a new trailer showing Reclamation Day, the moment the inhabitants of Fallout 76 come out into the world. The world will feature new lighting and landscape technology, with 16 times the detail. You’ll be able to view distant weather systems. You’ll travel through six distinct areas each with their own enemies and rewards, and Todd promises that they’re using real-life West Virginia legends to bring the area to life. But the big news is that Fallout 76 is an online multiplayer game. You can still play solo, exploring the world, doing quests, levelling up, etc, but this will take place in a world populated by other players. ‘Open world survival, where every character is another play’ was an idea that apparently came up in the studio four years ago. Howard calls the mode ‘softcore survival’: death doesn’t mean the loss of progression or your character. You go into a world with dozens of other players rather than hundreds or thousands. You can join your friends when you want and all your progression goes with you. “We’ve created a wide open world with very few rules... you’ll decide what happens,” says Howard. This is a pretty intriguing take on the multiplayer survival concept. And hey, at least it’s not Fallout Royale? Todd Howard is on stage to talk about Fallout 76 – after a fun joke about Skyrim Alexa. It’s four times the size of Fallout 4 and set in the hills of West Virginia. But we’re getting the same trailer as the one shown at the Xbox event. New Prey and Wolfenstein VR experiences announced by Pete Hines who F-bombs the Nazis once again. A co-op spin-off from the acclaimed alternate WWII shooter series is coming next year, featuring BJ’s twin daughters fighting for survival in a 1980s Paris overrun with Nazis. Excellent anti-Nazi F-bomb just dropped by the Wolfenstein developers on stage there. There is a new mode coming for Prey called Typhon Hunter, where five players compete against one who plays as a mimic and can disguise themselves as various everyday objects. Imagine being fragged by an office chair. Prey is getting a “huge” new update with new modes, including Survival. There will also be a new DLC called Moon Crash where the enemies, hazards and loot will all be different each time you play. It looks like a procedurally generated shoot out. To be honest we’ve been distracted by the use of the brilliant You Spin Me Right Round by Dead or Alive as the demo soundtrack. RIP Pete Burns. Love this from UK-based game developer Rob Fearon. Possibly the only KLF reference we’ll get for E3 this year. Quake Champions is being opened up to everyone, via a pre-release trial. And if you get in now you’ll be able to play for free after it launches. There’s a new trailer coming – we’ll post that in a bit. The rebooted Doom is getting a sequel. “You want more badass demons,” asks Bethesda. “There will be twice as many”. “You want hell on Earth? We just teased it”. The game will be debuted at QuakeCon in August. That’s all we’re getting on that. Matt Firor director of Elder Scrolls online announces that the game now has eight million players. The next DLC will be Wolf Hunter, a dungeon pack based around werewolves. This will be followed by another DLC which Firor promises will dive into Argonian lore and culture. Who doesn’t want to do that? Bethesda is relaunching its card game Elder Scrolls Legends with overhauled visuals and it’ll be available on Xbox One, PS4 AND Nintendo Switch. This is possibly not the news that a lot of people wanted to see about Elder Scrolls. In Rage 2 you play as Walker “the last ranger of the wasteland”. We’re shown a demo of the Eden Space Port mission, with Walker approaching in his heavily armoured buggy, firing missiles at enemy vehicles. The base is controlled by a mohican-sporting gang named the Goon Squad. Switching to on-foot, there is a lot of shooting among shipping containers. On completing a mission objective you pick up a new ability named Shatter which lets you thrust people across the wasteland. Getting Bulletstorm vibes here. So it’s off to a noisy start with Andrew WK performing live with his hit song ‘Ready To Die’. Bethesda head Pete Hines is on stage letting us all know about the company’s recent history. He’s made a joke about Walmart Canada accidentally leaking the details of Rage 2. Okay so we’re starting with what looks like a corporate video for new employees. It’s time for our second big press conference of E3 2018! Keza is now inside the Bethesda venue! Keza is currently queuing to get into the Bethesda event. Look who she’s spotted outside. Couldn’t move on without mentioning Battletoads, which is coming to Xbox One and PC courtesy of Dlala Studios, which originated from Microsoft’s Lift London studio, and is now based in Essex. Microsoft has described the game as offering “body-morphing genre mashups, three-player couch co-op, 4K hand-drawn 2.5D graphics, and broad non-specific feature declarations.” Just before Bethesda, another quick thing on Microsoft. Veteran industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls of IHS Markit, has summed up the Xbox event. “Microsoft ended March 2018 with an Xbox One installed base of 39.1 million compared to 76.6 million for Sony’s PS4. While, Xbox One X has sold well, Microsoft needed its E3 showcase to deliver on first party studio output and its platform exclusives to reap the marketing benefits of the technical and power advantages of Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro. The showcase did not disappoint, with a total of 18 exclusives revealed and on show, and the return of many fan favourites including Halo. Based on this showing and other third-party announcements, it looks like early 2019 is going to be very crowded for game releases.” Okay, what are the odds on a Doom or Quake Battle Royale spin-off? 100 Space Marines dropped into a demon-infested base, running about trying to find the chain gun while picking up keys to gain access to new map areas? And a rail gun and rocket jumping would certainly be fun in a Battle Royale environment. Ah, a cute take on the Microsoft conference from game developer Adriel Wallick. There were indeed a lot of cute critters during the presentation. Well, that’s enough of Microsoft for now, we think. Let’s turn our attention to Bethesda and its press conference which is starting in 90 minutes. Obviously Rage 2 and Fallout 76 will feature heavily, as will Quake Champions. But what else? A new Doom? Elder Scrolls... stuff? No one seems to be expecting a big new series. Speaking of Fallout 76, for those that missed it, here’s footage of the longer trailer that was shown at the Microsoft conference: We’ve just had our first play on Forza Horizon 4. A demo at the Xbox Showcase, which followed Microsoft’s press conference, provided a brief jaunt through the game’s four seasons. On the spring section, a race through a beautifully lit woodland, complete with swathes of bluebells, provided huge muddy puddles to scorch through and ramps to fly over. The Autumn section involved racing along a country lane in the twilight, with leaves bustling across the track. The winter section took place at night, the snowy track lit by your headlights, reflecting off the icy surface – all the graphical niceties we expect from Playground Games. There’s a real sense of the English countryside in the scenes we saw – tiny cottages, lambs gambolling in the fields. It was quite a pleasant place to be after a thunderingly loud Xbox show. People are playing some of those newly-announced games in the Microsoft Theatre right now, bathed in green. Forza Horizon 4 is proving popular. Commenter Knowles2 says: “It will be interesting to see if Microsoft investments into studios actually pay off. Microsoft acquisition of studios in the past have been mixed, with Microsoft losing much of the talent that made the studios worth acquiring in the first place.” This is true - and applicable to every time a studio gets snapped up by a huge company, not just Microsoft. EA’s acquisition history is often rolled out as an example of what happens when good talent gets swallowed. How developers fare after an acquisition like this depends hugely on the creative leadership of the companies in question; plenty of studios thrive under corporate ownership, too, but it’s never a totally painless transition. Here’s the teaser trailer for Cyberpunk 77, which is happily much more colourful and much less gritty and rain-soaked than the conventional cyberpunk aesthetic - at least on the evidence of this video. I’d almost forgotten that Xbox head Phil Spencer mentioned at the end of that press conference that the next Xbox consoles are in development. That’s no great surprise: the research and development cycles on games consoles take five years at least, so the beginnings of that process would probably have started shortly after the release of the Xbox One. But the fact that Microsoft chose to mention it now makes you question why. Will we see new Xbox consoles this time next year? Or maybe even earlier? I doubt that any new Xbox console actually be released until 2020, but perhaps Microsoft is laying the groundwork for an early announcement. Little fact: Microsoft now has double the number of game development studios than it did last year. Promising. For those just joining us, here’s what’s happened so far at E3 2018’s first big news day. Microsoft showed 50 new games for Xbox and PC during its E3 2018 conference, kicking off with a new Halo game called Halo Infinite. Three new Gears of War games also made an appearance: one on mobile (Gears Pop!), one for PC (Gears Tactics), and one for Xbox One (Gears 5), starring returning character Kait Diaz. Forza Horizon 4 is a new racing game that’s played in an online world where every driver you meet is another human being. It’s set in the UK, with dynamic weather and seasons that players across the world will experience at the same time. But the company went further than the usual driving and shooting, showing a sequel to a beautiful platform game Ori and the Blind Forest, a skateboarding game called Session, an exploration game about a tiny fox, a new game from the developers of Dark Souls names Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, a game about a boy who pretends to be a superhero, Disney-themed Japanese role-playing game Kingdom Hearts, and several other games that broaden the Xbox One’s line-up. Microsoft has also bought or established five new game studios, a huge investment in new creative talent. UK developers Ninja Theory (makers of Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice) and Playground Games (of Forza Horizon) are both now Microsoft studios. It has also acquired Undead Labs and Compulsion Games, and established a new studio in Santa Monica called The Initiative. There were first looks at some anticipated games from other developers. Bethesda showed a first trailer for Fallout 76, set in the immediate aftermath of nuclear war. Ubisoft’s The Division 2 has players protecting the populace of a ruined Washington DC after a pandemic destroys the US population. Dying Light 2 is a zombie survival game that builds a better story based on choice and consequence on top of the gore and terror of the first game in the series. Impossibly stylish demon-slaying action game Devil May Cry, from Capcom, returned after a 10-year absence. And Jump Force, from Bandai-Namco, pits anime stars against each other in a colourful fighting game. Cyberpunk 2077, from the developers of The Witcher 3, was also shown for the first time. Commenter Amanbro asks: “Is it too much to ask for companies to show actual live gameplay? That’s the main thing I’m interested in.” That press conference was especially heavy on cinematic trailers, wasn’t it? Apart from those five-minute looks at The Division 2, Forza Horizon and Dying Light, I’m not sure we saw anyone actually play something on that stage. Then again, when you’ve got 50 games to cram into 90 minutes, there’s not a great deal of time to show how something actually plays. Our correspondent Keith is still at the Microsoft theatre - he’ll be hopping in with some opinions on some of these new announcements once he gets his hands on a controller. Xbox One has been trailing the PlayStation 4 both in terms of sales and creativity for the past few years, so Microsoft really needed a strong showing at E3 this year to show it wasn’t out of ideas. I didn’t see anything particularly left-field today - E3 is always dominated by the most expensive and popular games around, so that’s no surprise - but I did see a broad spread of fun and interesting-looking things, and a lot of investment in talent. Phil Spencer has done a lot to turn the Xbox division around. Keith will be interviewing him later - look out for some quotes. That last-minute glimpse of Cyberpunk 2077 was a good closer, too, though inevitably I want to see what the game actually looks like when you’re playing it. Very much hoping that it will be shown in greater detail later this week. Can we talk about Devil May Cry 5? It’s great to see the series back with Capcom for the first time in 10 years, but I’m also slightly sad to see 2013’s DmC airburshed from history. Its storytelling was brilliant and Dante had never been sexier. Now that its developer Ninja Theory is owned my Microsoft I doubt we’ll ever see another Devil May Cry in that style. Here’s the trailer for Devil May Cry 5: Loads more trailers turning up on YouTube now from the conference. Here are a few that got a bit lost in the shuffle during the main show: Session, a new skateboarding game: And Tunic, a game about a tiny fox exploring a big world: Bethesda’s press conference starts in a few hours - we can expect that to be very Fallout-focussed, after that teaser trailer shown at the Microsoft conference. In the meantime, stay with us for some analysis, and some reactions to that Xbox showcase. That’s it for Microsoft’s press conference. That was a very impressive number of new games, with more variety than Xbox has shown in some years - it will be a while before that massive investment in new development studios pays off, and a lot of what we saw there will be out in 2019 or even later, but I’m nonetheless encouraged to see an Xbox lineup that moves beyond driving and shooting with confidence. A final stunt before the end, though: a trailer for Cyberpunk 2077, a new game from the makers of The Witcher 3. This is the first we’ve ever seen of it. I’ll drop that trailer in as soon as it’s available - it showed an unexpectedly colourful city full of cyborgs. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, is back out on stage to close the conference, heading off rumours at the pass by saying that Microsoft is working on its new generation of Xbox consoles - I wouldn’t be surprised if we see those consoles next year, but it could even be 2020. Here’s a trailer for Gears 5, showing an encouraging character-focussed direction: Gears 5 got a predictable boisterous welcome from the crowd - just about equalling Battletoads immediately before it. Gears Pop! is a mobile game based on Funko Pop toys Gears Tactics is a PC strategy game Gears 5 is a shooter for Xbox One A third new Gears of War game (the rumours were true!): Gears of War 5, the one that everyone was really waiting for. The main character is Kait Diaz - a female star is a first for the series. But there’s a second new Gears game: Gears Tactics, made especially for PC. It’s a turn-based strategy game that looks along the lines of XCOM. A new Gears of War game now, but not quite what everyone was expecting: it’s a mobile game based around those little Funko Pop toys that are everywhere at the moment (does anyone else think they’re super ugly, or is it just me?) Just Cause, quite possibly the most videogamey game of all time, is also making a return: Just Cause 4 will be out in December this year. Clearly lots of anime fans in the audience at the Xbox event. Huge very long cheers for Jump Force. Well, this is unexpected: Microsoft is bringing back Battletoads, a game that’s known more for its meme status than as something people actually played. That’ll be out in 2019. More post-apocalyptic stuff next: “every day we rise from the dead to choose between bad and worse”. Cheery. This is zombie-killing survival game Dying Light 2. Chris Avellone (of Planescape Torment, fans of PC RPGs) is the narrative designer. Looks like story and player choice will be prominent here alongside the gore. Here’s a first look: Bandai-Namco’s new game Jump Force pits characters from One-Piece, Naruto and Dragonball Z against each other in a very colourful fighting game. It’ll be out in 2019; I’m betting it’ll feature other Shonen Jump anime/manga characters too. We really are seeing a LOT of games here. They promised 50, and I think we’ve got a good few still to go. Another new game, Tunic, featuring “a tiny fox in a big world” was briefly shown - I’ll drop the trailer for that into this liveblog soon as it’s up. Well Devil May Cry V may have got the biggest crowd reaction here since the Halo opener. The notoriously difficult Cuphead, most memorable for its incredible 1920s-animation-style visuals, is getting a new island full of bosses early next year. I look forward to throwing my Xbox controller through the window once again. Now we’re seeing a new Devil May Cry, Capcom’s long-running demon-slaying action series, featuring the impossibly stylish, smart-mouthed protagonist Dante. It’s called Devil May Cry 5. It’s been in development for 4 years and has leaked a few times, but this is the first time we’ve actually seen it. The Shadow of the Tomb Raider demo looked nice, but it’s the exclusives that are getting the most reaction here. Here’s a throwback to the heady days of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater: a new skateboarding game called Session. I did think for a second that it was going to be Skate 4, but hey, any new skateboarding game is a surprise in 2018. Microsoft is going big on Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives people access to free games every month. The Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 4 and The Division (the first one) are all being added to the service today. A pretty effect from the Xbox conference... Let’s summarise the announcements so far: A new Halo game, Halo Infinite Ori and the Blind Forest gets a sequel The first proper trailer for Fallout 76 premiered The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a sweet-looking game about a kid pretending to be a superhero Forza Horizon 4, a new racing game set in the UK, is coming out on Xbox One and Windows Microsoft has bought 5 new studios, including Playground Games and Ninja Theory in the UK Playground Games has tweeted about Forza Horizon 4, showing off some of those British environments. The setting has been well-received – and it no doubt saved the Leamington-based studio some money on location research. Ubisoft’s The Division 2, set in Washington DC, imagines an America on the brink of collapse after a pandemic. You play as part of a squad trying to avert civil war in a city ruined by urban warfare. A live gameplay demonstration is showing a squad in the ruined and overgrown botanic gardens, protecting an encampment of civilians with kids. Out of all those studio announcements, it was perhaps Ninja Theory that drew the loudest response here. Phil Spencer highlighted the studio’s ability with emotional narratives, as seen in the acclaimed Hellblade. Psychedelic survival game We Happy Few will be out on August 10th. Playground Games AND Ninja theory are now Microsoft Studios. That’ll mean quite a few newly-minuted UK millionaires in the video game industry. Xbox chief Phil Spencer is back, talking about how the Xbox team has been touring the world in search of new studios to work with. This has resulted in a new Microsoft game studio: The Initiative, based in Santa Monica. Microsoft has also acquired Undead Labs, developer of the recent State of Decay 2. The company has also bought up Playground Games, developers of the Forza Horizon series - and, says Phil, an “entirely new open-world project”. Big surprise: Ninja Theory, developer of BAFTA-winning Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, is now part of Microsoft too. And there’s a fifth! Compulsion Games, which is currently making We Happy Few. This is great news. Microsoft is showing that it’s investing massively in new game development talent. Forza Horizon 4 will be out on October 2nd for both Xbox One and Windows, and will be part of Xbox Game Pass - meaning it will be free to subscribers. The news that Forza Horizon 4 will appear on Xbox Game Pass on the same day as its retail release in October got a huge reaction in the auditorium. Have a look at Forza Horizon 4: they’re currently showing off the same British locations in summer and winter. Forza Horizon is by far my favourite racing series - the last game was set in a very gorgeous Australia. It’s a more playful game than the other Forza racers, which focus more on realistic driving. Forza Horizon 4 - a new racing game from UK studio Playground Games - the next announcement. It’s set in the UK and looks very beautiful indeed. Appropriately, it will feature dynamic weather and seasons to show off Britain’s notoriously ridiculous weather. They’re showing it off by driving through different British locations, including Edinburgh. Every other driver you meet in the game will be a real person, says the developer. There’ll be new stuff for Sea of Thieves, Rare’s multiplayer pirate adventure, in July and September. Just as well, as it launched in a slightly anaemic state. A warm reaction to Kingdom Hearts 3 in the room, especially the Frozen characters. It seems like the Xbox chiefs have been busy building and rebuilding relationships with developers the past couple of years: we’re already seeing a great variety of games here, and not just the predictable Xbox standbys. I certainly never thought I’d be seeing a Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer at a Microsoft press conference. Getting back to post-apocalyptic games with guns: a new entry in the very intense, brutal Metro series, Metro Exodus, is coming to Xbox One. Both Crackdown 3 and Metro have received comparatively muted responses from the audience here – possibly as they’ve been shown off several times before. A quick trailer for the long-delayed Crackdown 3 is followed by the announcement that extremely weird robot-themed Japanese RPG Nier Automata is coming to the Xbox One on 26 June. Good news! The next game is a little different: less post-apocalyptic wasteland, more little kid and his dad having wholesome fun in his all-American home with gentle folk music. It’s called The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, from Life is Strange developer Dontnod- out June 26th. Next up is Todd Howard of Bethesda games introducing Fallout 76 - a prequel to the entire series, featuring some of the first survivors emerging into the new apocalyptic world. Excellent use of the song Country Roads in the demo. And now here’s Todd Howard of Bethesda - who’s having his own press conference in a few hours, but hey. Fallout 4 is coming to Xbox Game pass today - but more excitingly, we’re also going to see Fallout 76, a new Fallout game 4x the size of Fallout 4, set in West Virginia. Next up: a world premiere of the next From Software title, to a raptuous reception. It’s Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which looks like another hardcore crawler, complete with giant enemies, combined horseback and grappling hook combat and a hero has returned from the dead. It’s published by Activision and out next year. The next announcement is a new Ori and the Blind Forest game, Ori and the Will of the Wisps: a beautiful nature-themed platform game. “I will always believe that gaming is the great unifier,” says Phil Spencer, who is apparently so beloved by the Xbox fan audience that they spontaneously started chanting his name. Tonight they are showing 50 games, 18 of them Xbox exclusives, and 15 world premiers. The first trailer of the night is a new Halo game: Halo Infinite, featuring Master Chief and (by the looks of it) the planet from the original game. Xbox chief Phil Spencer is here to explain more. Here’s that trailer: Microsoft has started with a huge crowd favourite. Halo Infinite is the first new announcement. Quite an astonishing response in the audience. We’re kicking off at the Xbox briefing! We’ve just been given the five-minute alert at the Xbox briefing, drawing whoops from the crowd. Expectations are high after Xbox chief Phil Spencer promised 15 new announcements. Another random piece of news from yesterday evening: Kingdom Hearts 3, the long-awaited Disney-themed Japanese RPG, will be out on 29 January next year. Good for you, Kingdom Hearts. You make your mark. The stage at the Xbox presentation has several rows of monitors suggesting that we can expect some big multiplayer demos. Perhaps the recently announced Battlefield V Royale mode? Here’s a pic from Keith Stuart, who’s in the room waiting for the Microsoft conference to begin. We’re expecting to hear about the future of the Halo and Gears of War series today, and hopefully see some new Xbox One game announcements - Microsoft has faced criticism in recent years for relying too heavily on its big franchises instead of taking creative risks with its Xbox developers, so it’ll be interesting to see how the company responds. Microsoft’s press conference kicks off in around 35 minutes, so in the meantime, let’s recap some of the news that’s broken over the weekend. EA Games had an event yesterday that focussed on Battlefield 5, FIFA 19 and Anthem, a new Bioware game where you fly around in mech suits shooting at alien creatures. It looked like a cross between Destiny, Titanfall and Monster Hunter. Some highlights: The UEFA Champions League is finally coming to the FIFA games, starting with FIFA 19 this September You can drive a tank through a building in Battlefield 5 - and it’s also jumping on the Fortnite-inspired Battle Royale-mode bandwagon Respawn is making a Star Wars game called Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, out towards the end of 2019. That is literally all we learned about it. Developer DICE is still making new stuff for the somewhat beleaguered Star Wars: Battlefront 2, including missions from the new Solo movie Unravel Two, sequel to a lovely game about guiding a little guy made of yarn through the Swedish countryside, was announced - and is out now There was another interesting indie game called Sea of Solitude, about lonely humans who turn into monsters A new Command and Conquer game (remember those?) is coming to mobile phones Hundreds of people are currently waiting outside the Microsoft Theatre in LA in the blazing heat. Keith Stuart is with them and it is reportedly exceedingly uncomfortable. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s E3 2018 liveblog. I’m Keza MacDonald, video games editor, and together with correspondent Keith Stuart we’ll be reporting live from the Xbox press conference today, where Microsoft will lift the lid on what’s ahead for gaming on Xbox One and Windows. That kicks off at 1pm PDT (9pm in the UK). Later on, we’ll join Bethesda for a press conference about the new Fallout game, Fallout 76, and whatever else the giant publisher is up to this year. That kicks off around 6.30pm PDT (2.30am in the UK)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/11/violence-tragedy-murder-amilcar-henriquez-panama-football-team","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:30:39Z","webTitle":"Violence, tragedy and the murder of a cherished Panama player | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/11/violence-tragedy-murder-amilcar-henriquez-panama-football-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/11/violence-tragedy-murder-amilcar-henriquez-panama-football-team","fields":{"headline":"Violence, tragedy and the murder of a cherished Panama player","bodyText":"On the day Amílcar Henríquez was killed he had been playing dominoes in Nuevo Colón, Panama. The assassins waited, using the house opposite his as a base where they planned to gun him down. Witnesses heard 23 shots and police found the stolen red Nissan Versa they drove, an AK47 assault rifle, a 9mm revolver and more than a hundred rounds of ammunition. Henríquez, hit a dozen times, was rushed to hospital, where he died. A second man, Delano Wilson, was also killed. Josimar Gómez was wounded. It was 15 April 2017. Henríquez was 33, a father of three small children, and his only fear, he had said, was leaving them. He was also a professional footballer for Árabe Unido and the national team, which he represented 85 times. His penalty gave Panama the only title in their history – the 2009 Copa Naciones – and in his last interview, three weeks earlier, he expressed his hopes of reaching a first World Cup, having narrowly missed out four years before. Now they had one last chance. “We’re fighting for a dream that escaped us, a golden end for this generation after years of suffering and battling,” Henríquez told the fifa.com website. “That hurt marked us all and still saddens; it was taken from us in the blink of an eye.” Henríque’s funeral was held at the Estadio Armando Dely Valdés, his No 21 shirt draped on the coffin. Gary Stempel, Panama coach in 2009, calls it “devastating”. Gabriel Gómez, who has more caps than anyone, vowed: “We have to reach the World Cup for him.” Six months on, a late goal took them there, where they will face England. “What happened hit hard,” says Édgar Carvajal, Panama’s assistant coach. “We have two homes: our own and our team. You look back and see him in the middle: a leader, a role model. We always talked about him, how we had to win in Amílcar’s name.” Hernán Darío “Bolillo” Gómez is the coach who, as Colombia’s assistant, lived through the assassination of Andrés Escobar in 1994 and led Panama to this World Cup. “I took Amílcar to Independiente Medellín. I’ve known him a long time and he was the one saying: ‘Profe, come to Panama, help us.’ The affection was mutual. He was a good man, a leader …” Gómez’s voice trails off. “… and they killed him.” What happened? “Nah, I don’t even want to be involved. I don’t ask. He died. And the pain is there.” Panama’s president, Juan Carlos Varela, vowed to catch the killers and four days later the security minister Alexis Bethancourt suggested the most probable explanation was “rencillas” – a feud. Years before, Amílcar told the story of armed robbers putting a gun to his head and pulling the trigger only for it to jam. This, though, was not the same nor so easily explained. And if it was a feud, what kind? Shot a dozen times, this was targeted, no accident. Arrests were swift – seven were detained, six teenagers – but the case remains open and police will not discuss it. Colón, on the Caribbean coast, is a city marked by drug trafficking, gangs and violence, and Henríquez had played in Medellín. A middle‑aged man wanted in connection with his killing was recently found shot dead. “There are many questions and a lot of pain,” said Pedro Chaluja, president of the Panamanian football federation. Yet, while Henríquez’s is the most significant case, it is not an isolated one. It fits a broader, alarming pattern. Since the shooting of Miguel Tello in 1990, 19 footballers have been killed. Others have ended up in jail. Like Henríquez, José Luis Garcés was shot at; perhaps this generation’s most talented player, he has also been imprisoned. José Calderón, Panama’s goalkeeper, saw a friend shot. José Fajardo, on the shortlist for the World Cup, recently revealed his gang past. And one former gang member says: “I’ve seen many players involved in drug trafficking, crime, gangs, money laundering for the cartels, funding arms … and the outcome is death or jail.” “This is not about football and it’s not just about Amílcar; it’s about society,” Chaluja insisted. The numbers, though, suggest something specific to football and society makes up the players’ reality. “Amílcar is another in that statistic,” says Juan Ramón Solís, president of the recently formed players’ union. “Footballers live in and come from difficult environments. 70% of them are at ‘social risk’. Broken families, lack of education or a truly professionalised football offering real opportunities, infrastructure and youth development.” In that environment crime is incubated, the dangers present. Garcés played with Luis Suárez and Diego Godín at Nacional in Uruguay: there is sadness as well as joy as he contemplates a World Cup he could have been at with his “brothers”. “I got hit by a bullet. They sent them to kill me; they’d been following me all over Panama,” he says slowly, long pauses punctuating his speech. He insists he has never been in a gang, that the shooting was a “family” matter, but adds: “Panama is a complicated country, with gangs, drugs, robberies. Most footballers know that [world]; many take the wrong path and end up in jail. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.” Panama has the lowest homicide rate in Central America – 424 killings in 2017 – and, while it is poor, neither the poverty nor the violence there matches its neighbours’. It does not have an exceptional drugs consumption problem but it is a major point of transit for cocaine out of Colombia towards the US. One police officer admitted 80 tonnes of cocaine were seized last year – “and that’s just what was intercepted”. Cartels have begun paying traffickers in drugs, not dollars, driving a local market, and army decommissioning brought a flood of firearms. There are more than 200 gangs, coalescing in two dominant groups, Bagdad and Calor Calor. In the neighbourhood of El Chorrillo – home of Plaza Amador and birthplace of Rommel Fernández, after whom the national stadium is named – rumba blares, football is played on the streets and gang members stand on corners. Álvaro Robles, a professional for more than a decade, is from here. “Football is a powerful tool,” he says. But, he admits, not powerful enough. “Football has to get to them before ‘others’ do,” he says – and even if it does, there are no guarantees. A friend of Henríquez – a former inmate at Tinjitas who worked for a cartel and was imprisoned for homicide – says: “Footballers are overwhelmingly from the lowest strata of society. In neighbourhoods where it’s 80% crime, they’re vulnerable; the cartels manipulate you.” Outside the church where Robles preaches, Alfredo, a 20‑year‑old fan, says: “There are very poor neighbourhoods, kids with talent but no support. The dangers are there: little work, little money, drugs. Hopefully,” he adds, “the World Cup can help.” “It has united the country,” says Bolillo, and the impact is felt beyond the pitch. Before training, veteran internationals Gabriel Gómez, Blas Pérez and Felipe Baloy address kids invited to the session. “They didn’t talk about football, they talked about life, values,” Bolillo notes later. “That’s fundamental; in our countries we still lack education.” Gómez recalls the “difficult neighbourhoods” from which “almost all of us came”, times when there “wasn’t enough to eat”. Baloy says: “Football changed my life, my family’s life; I learnt things I didn’t learn in my neighbourhood. I’m another person now, thankfully.” Football was a way out for them; for others it was not. They departed – only two of the squad play in Panama – and for those who stay, the game is not always an escape. Club attendances typically number in the hundreds and even the well paid do not earn much over $1,000 a month. Until recently salaries often went unpaid. Rodrigo Tello, a former under-20 international, is in Joyita jail, Panama’s toughest. “Look at my case,” he says. “Robbery! Need! Football hasn’t given me anything. There was nothing to eat, clubs abuse your ability, the system doesn’t help. I thought: ‘I have so much talent and I can’t even help my mum.’ You get ideas, choose a different path. I chose badly.” It runs deeper. The World Cup offers hope, awareness, but there is a long way to go. “Usually, a solid structure supports a strong national team; ours is the other way around,” says Solís. “There’s a lack of facilities, resources, work on the human, social dimension: we need to stop these statistics rising.” One first division coach notes that there is “virtually no coaching, no organisation before 17, 18”, and the difference with baseball may be instructive: it has a formative role, embracing education, parental involvement and personal development, and faces virtually none of the problems football has. You can leave the barrio but the barrio does not leave you; the relationships remain, the ties bind you, surround you. Some suggest that security forces may have warned Henríquez to leave. Solís says: “Many have friends and families in gangs, a past linked to that. Amílcar was an established player, an international who’d played abroad, and so it can be hard to explain. We don’t know his case, but for many players that life, that environment, is hard to leave behind – and that’s where the ‘enemy’ appears, to take their life.” Robles clings to the power football has for good, hope of redemption. Acquitted after being wrongly imprisoned for drugs trafficking, and remarkably lacking in bitterness, he takes footballers into prisons to play against inmates. The goalkeeper Óscar Macfarlane is absent – his team, Tauro, are preparing for the national final – but the side is strong. The first stop is Tinijitas, high above Panama City, where Robles spent five years. At the entrance armed guards sit in a small, sweaty hut; there are concrete workshops with tin roofs, crumbling buildings. Skinny stray dogs lie in the sun. In the middle is a concrete court with small goals, enclosed by endless rolls of razor wire, torn clothing hanging from it. Birds of prey circle. A guard with a machine gun occupies a watchtower. The prisoners’ team comes out; others watch from behind bars. Bobby Brown, who played in Austria, Uruguay and the US, takes a couple aside for a gentle, paternal word: footballers awaiting trial, accused of kidnapping. “They’re not always as they’re portrayed, some are victims of the system: we come, embrace them, play,” Robles says. Then it starts: the game is fast, competitive and the inmates win. At the end they gather: there’s applause, prayer, thanks, and Robles addresses them. “Whatever mistakes you made, we believe in you. The ball can help. You’re not worms, you’re people.” Players, too. At La Joyita, a big, crowded prison an hour east, through caged walkways and checkpoints, new inmates sitting in holding pens clutching small plastic bags and tiny foam mattresses, a Fifa banner hangs optimistically by a dusty red dirt pitch. Support for the national team is painted over a doorway: “Vamos Panama!” An “advertising board” says “God is faithful”, but the place is unforgiving. By the pitch Rodrigo Tello and his team prepare. A small, skilful attacker, like Garcés, he could have been at this World Cup but his career ended the day he arrived here a decade ago; now he wants to help others build theirs. “I cried when I ‘fell’. I was a No 10. I could do it all. I’m 34 now, it’s not the same,” he says. “I made a mistake, I want to give something back. There’s talent here, five or six who can definitely make it. Some have six years left, others longer. The prison director told me he’d let clubs come to see them play.” “We’re the team for Qatar,” one says, grinning. 32km west, the team for Russia prepare for their first World Cup – the “dream” Henríquez had. “You think about it and it’s hard, sad,” Carvajal says the following morning at dawn, sitting in the stands minutes before the session starts. “Wherever he is, he’ll be watching us, sending us the energy he always did.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/10/american-racing-justify-triple-crown","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T16:58:03Z","webTitle":"American racing is the big winner after Justify’s Triple Crown triumph | Greg Wood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/10/american-racing-justify-triple-crown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/10/american-racing-justify-triple-crown","fields":{"headline":"American racing is the big winner after Justify’s Triple Crown triumph","bodyText":"The second Triple Crown winner of the last four decades was greeted as rapturously as the first when Justify crossed the line at Belmont Park on Saturday night, and for the second time in four seasons, American racing will spend the next few months enjoying the glow that only a Triple Crown winner can bring. This is despite the strong likelihood that the remainder of Justify’s career on the track will now amount to less than five minutes of actual racing time. American Pharoah had only two starts after winning the Belmont in 2015: a narrow defeat in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga in late August and a storming six‑and‑a‑half‑length win in the Breeders’ Cup Classic on his way to the stud farm in November. An identical programme would make sense for Justify, who has surely earned a break after six races in four months, but the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth in late July – which is, like the Travers, restricted to three‑year‑olds – has also been floated as a possible target. Saratoga, in upstate New York, is a three-hour drive from both Boston and New York City but, when American Pharoah turned up for the Travers, the crowd was a 50,000 sell‑out and no fewer than 15,000 turned up the day before just to see him exercise on the track. Another interesting point is that attendances were up throughout its seven-week meeting, which shows how a Triple Crown winner can advertise racing in general simply by reminding people that it is there. Justify has already done the same and is now such a valuable stallion prospect that risk-reward considerations will inevitably apply when it comes to choosing a path towards his next career. When a horse has just become only the 13th Triple Crown winner in US racing history there is, in truth, only so much still left for him to achieve. Since a four‑year‑old career seems highly unlikely, a Grade One win in an all-aged race is the one obvious gap on his record that is begging to be filled. If Justify could retire undefeated after taking the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Churchill Downs in November, the Coolmore Stud will feel it has secured a $75m bargain if reports of a sale of Justify’s breeding rights before the Preakness Stakes prove correct. Those reports were denied by WinStar Farm, one of the co-owners of Justify as well as one of Kentucky’s most famous stud farms, which would also be a feasible destination for the son of Scat Daddy when the time comes. Coolmore, though, could shuttle Justify between its operations in the northern and southern hemispheres, as it has done with American Pharoah. As a result, it is in a position to make an offer that WinStar and Justify’s other owners could find it very difficult to refuse, even if it has not done so already. In Britain, where the Triple Crown requires a horse to win over a mile in May and a mile‑and‑three-quarters in September with the Derby in between, we have not enjoyed the boost of a winner since 1970 and the prospect seems more remote than ever after Saxon Warrior’s defeat at Epsom eight days ago. In the States American Pharoah’s first crop of foals will go to the sales this autumn and appear on the track next year and, with Justify now preparing to join him at stud, there should be yearlings by Triple Crown winners on offer at major auctions for many years to come. That in turn will act as a reminder to all concerned that, while the chance of owning a Triple Crown winner remains vanishingly small, it is still a dream that will occasionally come true."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/10/eunice-gayson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T17:04:54Z","webTitle":"Eunice Gayson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/10/eunice-gayson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/10/eunice-gayson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Eunice Gayson obituary","bodyText":"Eunice Gayson, who has died aged 90, was an actor with a film, television and theatre career that spanned several decades. Despite this, she will be forever associated with her unique place in cinema history as the first Bond girl. Exactly eight minutes into the running of the 1962 film Dr No, Sean Connery utters the words “Bond, James Bond” for the first time, in answer to a question from Gayson, whose character has introduced herself at the card table as “Trench, Sylvia Trench”. With typical efficiency, Bond adds Miss Trench to his list of conquests shortly after their casino encounter and he later finds her hitting golf balls in his apartment dressed only in his shirt. Their playful exchange is momentarily interrupted when he is summoned to Jamaica on a mission, a clear demonstration of Bond’s constant juggling of business and pleasure. Unlike the other women on the Bond girl list, Gayson played the same character in more than one of the extremely successful franchise’s films. Trench turns up again in From Russia With Love (1963), when her afternoon punting with 007 has to be curtailed when he gets a call from headquarters. The intention was that Miss Trench would be a regular presence in the films, part of a running joke involving their assignations being cut short when espionage obligations arose at an inopportune moment. Guy Hamilton, the director of the next film in the series – Goldfinger (1964) – had other ideas however, and kiboshed the plan. No matter, for by then Gayson’s claim to cinematic immortality was unimpeachable, even though her voice was not heard in either film: she was dubbed by the actor Nikki van der Zyl. No criticism of Gayson should be inferred – Van der Zyl dubbed the majority of female voices in Dr No and many others in future Bond films. Gayson’s perfectly acceptable vocal performance, playful and seductive, can still be heard on the film’s original trailer. She might have had a different slice of Bond movie immortality had the original plan – that she play the recurring role of Miss Moneypenny – gone ahead. As it was, Lois Maxwell took the role (and played it for 23 years). Nevertheless Trench was an important part – Gayson received higher billing than Maxwell in both films – and the actor helped a nervous Connery during that crucial first scene. She was born in Streatham, south London, the elder of twin daughters and the middle of three children of John Sargaison, a civil servant, and his wife, Maria (nee Gammon). The family moved to Purley, Surrey, then Glasgow and finally Edinburgh, where Eunice enrolled at the Edinburgh Academy. A gifted soprano, she trained as an opera singer and in 1946, aged 18, made her professional debut playing a small role in Ladies Without at the Garrick theatre in London. That Christmas, she was Princess Luv-Lee in Aladdin (Grand theatre, Derby), with the Stage describing her as a “vivacious” performer “who sings, dances and acts extremely well”. By the end of the decade she was appearing regularly on television – in music shows, revues and television pantomimes. In 1954 she was selected to be a panellist on Guess My Story, a programme in the vein of What’s My Line but featuring disguised celebrities. Her film break had come in 1948, in My Brother Jonathan, and her other work on the big screen included Melody in the Dark (1949), Dance Little Lady (1954), Basil Dearden’s Out of the Clouds (1955) and Hammer’s The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), in which she played the female lead. When she was cast in Dr No she was having success on stage playing the Baroness in the original London production (at the Palace theatre, 1962) of The Sound of Music which ran for more than 2,000 performances (she was one of its longest running cast members). Her other theatre work included Over the Moon (Piccadilly theatre, 1953) and Uproar in the House (Whitehall theatre, 1968, taking over from Joan Sims), Victor Spinetti’s production of Duty Free (on tour 1976-77), The Grass is Greener (with Richard Todd, 1971, in Stratford-upon-Avon for the Royal Shakespeare Company), and An Ideal Husband and Kismet (both 1980, at the Connaught theatre, Worthing). One final run in the West End as the grandmother in Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods (Phoenix theatre, 1990-91) was followed by pantomime in the Isle of Man in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Gaiety theatre, 1992). Her 1953 marriage to the writer Leigh Vance was seen by three million American viewers when it was part of the television show Bride and Groom (“sponsored by Betty Crocker’s Piecrust Mix”). The marriage was dissolved six years later and in 1968 she married the actor Brian Jackson. That marriage also ended in divorce but produced a daughter, Kate, who survives her. Kate appeared in the casino scene in the Pierce Brosnan Bond film GoldenEye (1995). • Eunice Gayson (Eunice Elizabeth Sargaison), actor, born 17 March 1928; died 8 June 2018 • This article was amended on 11 June 2018, to add further details of Eunice Gayson’s early life"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/the-complexity-of-supporting-el-tri-on-the-us-mexico-border","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"The complexity of supporting El Tri on the US-Mexico border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/the-complexity-of-supporting-el-tri-on-the-us-mexico-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/the-complexity-of-supporting-el-tri-on-the-us-mexico-border","fields":{"headline":"The complexity of supporting El Tri on the US-Mexico border","bodyText":"Clad in an American national team jersey on the eve of the first US-less World Cup since 1986, Karla Cantu pondered who to follow this summer. So did other members of the Laredo chapter of the American Outlaws supporters’ group. They decided to allocate temporary loyalty via lottery. “We can’t come to a consensus. We’re going to do a draw,” she said. Broadcasters have a commercial incentive to urge bereft Americans to watch Mexico in Russia and the demographic, cultural and geographic ties are obvious. But when “who do you support?” is a proxy for “who are you?”, the debate can be especially personal and complex – especially on a frontier that has become a playing field for nationalistic political games. With sport’s inevitable twining of politics and patriotism, the World Cup can feel like the planet’s most divisive festival of unity even without the influence of a president who views everything as a rivalry match with only two possible outcomes: win or lose. It’s not an attitude shared by many who live at the border. “We have a really interesting mix. We support the US as American Outlaws but we get a little bit of backlash from the Mexico fans because of our heritage, our culture,” said Cantu. “We try and make it a very, I guess, harmony-based environment where we can all thrive, US fans and Mexico fans, and live together in peace.” Laredo is 95% Hispanic - the highest percentage of any large metropolitan area in the US. More than a quarter of residents are foreign-born. It is equidistant from the major Texas city of San Antonio, which has a solid second-tier football team, and Monterrey, home to two of Mexico’s biggest clubs. Facing the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo across the Rio Grande river, Laredo is a place of bridges and barriers. America’s biggest inland port thrums with trains and trucks but is a hub for a vast governmental apparatus of surveillance and separation. Crossing between countries is harder than it used to be. In football, though, Mexico come to you. This time four years ago, the US’s World Cup publicity campaign was built around the slogan: “One Nation. One Team.” Yet, as well as working with the US Soccer Federation, Major League Soccer’s marketing arm, Soccer United Marketing, has long promoted Mexico’s American friendlies. They must be busy. Of the 220 Mexico fixtures from 2007 to the final tune-up against Denmark on 9 June, just over half took place in the US. Of those, 101 were friendlies, two-thirds of them in the US. Over that timespan, El Tri have appeared in 22 different US metropolitan areas. They have played 25 times in Texas and 27 times in California: combined, that is more games in two US states than in the whole of Mexico (46). It makes sense: big stadiums, high ticket prices and a large and ravenous fanbase. There are an estimated 36 million Hispanic people of Mexican origin in the US. Edith Ortiz, the Laredo Heat Soccer Club’s marketing manager, was born in Mexico City and has lived in the US for six years. The 33-year-old watched El Tri in San Antonio and Dallas. “It’s like if you were in Mexico,” she said. “In Mexico, soccer is everything for everybody.” Growing the club scene in Laredo is more of a struggle. When the city found $20m for a sports arena a couple of years ago it built a baseball stadium. The Heat’s fourth-level amateurs play at a basic venue on the campus of Texas A&amp;M International University. On one searingly hot evening last month a few hundred fans perched on metal benches or lounged in the VIP section – a three-deep row of folding chairs along the sideline. Heat matches are a glimpse of an idealised American multicultural future; a youthful, hopeful, happy space that blends many nations into one, even as it splits one nation into many. A 20ft-high inflatable Budweiser can loomed ludicrously behind one of the corner flags. The Mexico star, Javier “Chicharito” Hernández – in the guise of a life-size advertisement – stood beneath the bleachers: arms folded, face fierce, assuring you that El Tri mean business in Russia and advocating that you drink the Mexican football federation’s official beer. The public address system faded out the otherwise incessant Spanish-language pop music and players lined up in the centre circle for the Star-Spangled Banner as everyone directed their gaze to the American flag behind one of the goals. Laredo, with players from 12 different countries in their squad, then thumped another Texas border club, FC Brownsville, 4-1. The Heat’s owner, Shashi Vaswani, was born in India and lived in Hong Kong and Toronto before his family moved to Laredo in 1980. “[I] thought close to Mexico soccer’s got to be prevalent everywhere. Lo and behold there was no high school soccer, no club soccer, zero,” he said. Vaswani, a 52-year-old hotelier and entrepreneur, wonders if the government’s anti-immigrant machinations will simply cement the region’s fidelity to Mexico. Longer term, though, he sees a generational shift. “I think it’s a 70-30 split here and it used to be 90-10, or 95-5, for Mexico,” he said. “The youth we’re right now trying to develop, there’s a 50-50 split. Fifty would say ‘look I’ll play for USA no doubt’, maybe 25 would say ‘I’ll think about it’ and 25 would say ‘I’ll probably play for Mexico’, but I think that’s going to evolve even more … Ten years from now I think you’ll see again a very different Laredo.” As the Heat look to boost their English-language outreach, the US’s failure to reach Russia is a missed opportunity, Ortiz said. “We have been trying to grow the fanbase for the US since we’re on this side and this is kind of setting us back because now people just go for Mexico and that’s their first team; even if they’re US fans, some of them will go for Mexico. Other fans who haven’t decided, they will go for Mexico.” Family tradition also matters, she added. “If they’re little they’ll root for Mexico because they don’t know [anything else]. The older ones will go for both. My daughter roots for both. I’m Mexican but my daughter was born here so she goes for both. And she has been taught to go for both countries.” Rodrigo Marina, the Heat’s 24-year-old play-by-play commentator, was born in Mexico City and moved to Laredo when he was five. “When they play each other it’s hard, I’m a little torn, I’m a little divided. I love to root for Mexico and I love to cheer for the USA,” he said. “I have a lot of friends who were born here, although they do have a heavy Hispanic background they do cheer for the USA; and I have friends that were born in Mexico, migrated to the USA and they just support Mexico to the fullest,” he said. “If they could unite, at least for 30 days, that would be great.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/10/suffragettes-did-commit-terrorist-acts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T16:46:16Z","webTitle":"Suffragettes did commit terrorist acts | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/suffragettes-did-commit-terrorist-acts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/10/suffragettes-did-commit-terrorist-acts","fields":{"headline":"Suffragettes did commit terrorist acts","bodyText":"As the author of a book on suffragette terrorism, I must disagree with Professor June Purvis (Letters, 7 June), who writes that there was no such thing.

This is the same Mary Leigh who, acting with others, poured petrol over the carpets of a crowded theatre, set fire to it and then detonated a bomb. She and the others were later charged with “causing an explosion of a nature likely to endanger life”. This is precisely the same sort of charge that terrorists today might face. The women were not charged with terrorism as such, because no such offence existed at that time. The bomb explosions in places such as Westminster Abbey could hardly be called anything other than terrorism. It is interesting to note that the first terrorist bomb explosion in 20th century Ireland, at Lisburn’s Christ Church Cathedral in August 1914, was the work not of the IRA, but the suffragettes.

The popular view of them as a bunch of cheeky chaps is being challenged: their actions increasingly regarded as fitting the agenda of a global network of the populist right that stretches from Moscow to the Trump White House via the surging nationalist parties of continental Europe. Stories in the Observer and Sunday Times about key figures in the Leave.EU campaign and their connection to Russian diplomats and businessmen are scoops of degree rather than kind. We have known for two years that Arron Banks, the pro-Brexit tycoon, and his closest henchman, Andy Wigmore, visited the Russian embassy in November 2015, just as we have long been aware of the links between Leave.EU and the Trump campaign. What has now been revealed is the sheer scale of these contacts – including a lunch between Banks, Nigel Farage and Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador, just three days after the Leave.EU team had been granted an audience with president-elect Trump in November 2016. It appears that there were multiple meetings between Banks, Wigmore and senior Russian officials between 2015 and 2017. It also appears that the ambassador offered to help Banks broker a deal involving six goldmines in Siberia. This does not seem, in other words, to be routine schmoozing or glad-handing. It has the whiff of a nexus, suggesting a purpose, or multiple purposes. Small wonder that Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, is so keen to interview Banks and Wigmore as part of his inquiry into fake news and digital guerrilla warfare – a field in which Russia leads (full disclosure: I gave evidence last year to the inquiry alongside Carole Cadwalladr, the co-author of this weekend’s Observer report). On Friday, the Leave.EU duo told the committee they would not appear. On Sunday, however, it appeared that Collins had been led to believe that Banks and Wigmore will, in fact, turn up. The nation awaits with excitement. Pollsters will tell you the dominant public emotion now associated with Brexit is impatience. In less than a fortnight, Britain will mark the second anniversary of the EU referendum with nothing like a coherent negotiating position. This week, Theresa May will seek to fend off amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, having spent the past few days desperately trying to maintain a semblance of cabinet unity. No wonder the message from voters is: get on with it. In which context, why bother with the minutiae of a campaign fought and won two years ago? The answer is that this concerns something greater even than Brexit – which is how we conduct politics, the lamentable state of political discourse and whether we mind. Exhibit A is a snappily readable book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, that appeared under Banks’s name in 2016, but was written with the help of journalist Isabel Oakeshott. The book is a remarkable exercise in political pantomime. It presents the Leave.EU team not as bunch of chauvinistic nationalists but a gang of lovable rogues, culturally situated somewhere between Hancock’s Half Hour and Guy Ritchie’s early movies – the ones in which everyone had a nickname like Bacon, Soap or Hatchet Harry. The effect is to present what one might describe as the paramilitary wing of the Brexit movement as well-meaning Del Boys who only wanted to liberate the British from the tyrannous grasp of Brussels and the London liberal elite – and (why not?) have a bloody good laugh along the way. Hence, the key meeting with Yakovenko is depicted as a boys’ boozy lunch in which the ambassador plies the lads with a bottle of vodka he claims was “one of three in a batch made for Stalin”. Banks pronounces it “bloody good” and asks for another. What a geezer! Most intelligence tradecraft is deliberately banal. Did the Bad Boys of Brexit really not know they were being played, or just not care? Was it all too much fun to bother about the boring stuff that lawyers, liberal journalists and remoaners bang on about? I mean: why let the commercial future, global influence and national security of the country get in the way of a good lunch? And if all this strikes you as a bit “inside baseball” – stories about journalists, campaigners and specialist political books – think again. This is a parable of geopolitical imbalance, culture wars and deep political sickness. For here is where we seem to have ended up: under our noses, a well-developed network of far-right and nationalist forces seems to have arisen, apparently digitally mobilised and funded by Russian state actors; the law regulating elections, campaigns and referendums is woefully out of date (passed four years before Facebook was launched); Moscow is laughing at the rest of the world as Trump pleads its case at the G7; the far-right swoons over Vladimir Putin; and Jeremy Corbyn misses no opportunity to give the Russian president the benefit of the doubt over the use of nerve agents on British soil and the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria by his puppet in Damascus. This week, as the Commons votes on the very future of this country, don’t forget how we got here; how badly we underestimated the populist right; and how the leader of the opposition tends to make things easier for Putin, too.

It comes in January 2012 as Chuck Blazer, the general secretary of Concacaf who has recently been flipped, outlines Fifa’s complicated structures and how he, and others, have creamed millions from sports marketing rights. At that point the US prosecutor Evan Norris – who has previously convicted members of the Gambino family, including an assassin with a predilection for dissolving his victims in vats of acid – calls colleagues out of the room before making a triangle with his fingers. It is a simple gesture they all understand. As the author Ken Bensinger explains, it signifies that Fifa fits the classic organised crime “triangle chart”. There is a boss, Sepp Blatter; underbosses in Fifa’s executive committee, and the executives of the six regional confederations. Then, beneath them, the soldiers, the officers of each national federation. There are even consiglieri, the advisers and lawyers who help the bosses behind the scenes. At that moment, says Bensinger, it became clear to those present that they could also use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, to charge large numbers of people in football for crimes stretching back years – provided they could prove they took place as part of a “pattern of racketeering activity”. Six years later, dozens of officials from more than 15 countries have been charged with racketeering, money laundering, fraud and evading tax laws. Yet as the world’s eyes begin to focus on the 2018 World Cup there is a nagging sense that Fifa has been too quick to move on – and too many of us have been too happy to let it. Perhaps we have become immune to tales of sports corruption. Or maybe tales of bureaucrats and backroom deals are too boring compared with what happens on the pitch. If so, Bensinger’s impeccably sourced account serves as a sharp reminder of the gargantuan levels of largesse and excess during Fifa’s bad, bad days – as well as a warning that not enough has been done to prevent them returning. Blazer, a 32-stone American who looked like Santa Claus and would ride around New York in a mobility scooter with a parrot on his shoulder, was seen as one of the game’s more colourful characters. In reality there was only one colour he cared about – the green of the US dollar. In 2011, Concacaf (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football) made $60m – of which Blazer took an astonishing 10% “commission”. In one instance, he also paid himself $300,000 from a $3m Fifa grant used to build the television production studio within Concacaf’s Trump Tower offices. And rather than buy condos in Miami and the Bahamas, he put them in Concacaf’s name even though only he had the keys. Yet there were many others out there on the make and take. Some, incredibly, were even doing it while helping the US authorities. As Bensinger relates, the Brazilian José Hawilla – who was discovered to have paid vast sums of bribes over more than three decades in football through his company, Traffic – approved the payment of millions of dollars to South American football officials even after striking a deal with prosecutors. In 2014 he pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice, and agreed to forfeit more than $151m. Yes, $151m. Not everyone, though, has faced the full force of US justice. Bensinger relates how the Uruguayan Eugenio Figueredo, who was arrested in 2015 and banned by Fifa’s executive committee, escaped extradition to the US thanks in part to behind-the-scenes help from none other than Vitaly Mutko, who invited Figueredo’s American defence attorney to Russia, ensured he got free legal advice and assured him that they had it all covered. Sure enough, Figueredo was extradited to Uruguay, not the US, and has never had to talk to American prosecutors. So how much have things really changed inside Fifa? According to Bruce W Bean, a distinguished law professor at Michigan State University, while there have been reforms – including women being added to the executive council, salary transparency for some Fifa officials and integrity checks for executive council members – they have not gone far enough. In an article in the Palgrave Handbook on the Economics of Manipulation in Sport, published last month, Bean says that while these reforms have “definitely looked good – they have not had a meaningful impact on Fifa – indeed the cynical term ‘Fifa reform’ is best understood as an oxymoron”. It is worth remembering that Fifa still pays no income taxes on its billions of revenue. That it still has not implemented many basic measures of corporate governance, including term limits and independent chairs in executive committee meetings. And that its 25 executive committee members are paid six-figure sums each year as well as generous per diems, first-class fights, gourmet meals and all expenses. When Fifa’s new headquarters in Zurich were opened in 2007, one of the works of art on display was a neon installation in curving script by the Italian Mario Merz. It posed an intriguing question: “Noi giriamo intorno alle case o le case girano intorno a noi?” “Do we revolve around the house, or does the house revolve around us?” When it comes to Fifa, that question is more pertinent than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/10/government-confident-on-brexit-votes-despite-threat-of-rebel-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T07:01:02Z","webTitle":"Theresa May calls for party unity before key Brexit votes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/government-confident-on-brexit-votes-despite-threat-of-rebel-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/10/government-confident-on-brexit-votes-despite-threat-of-rebel-mps","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May calls for party unity before key Brexit votes","bodyText":"Theresa May is to urge her MPs to send a message of unity over Brexit this week by reversing Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, with senior government figures saying they are confident a revolt can be headed off. Ahead of a crucial few days for both the process of Brexit and the prime minister’s authority, May is to address her backbench MPs at the 1922 Committee on Monday evening. The House of Commons is to consider 15 amendments made to the bill in the Lords, covering areas including giving parliament a meaningful final vote, as well as seeking to keep the UK in the EEA customs union after departure. The purpose of the bill is straightforward, May will say, according to extracts of her comments released in advance. “It is putting EU legislation into law to ensure a smooth and orderly transition as we leave.” She adds: “But the message we send to the country through our votes this week is important. We must be clear that we are united as a party in our determination to deliver on the decision made by the British people. “They want us to deliver on Brexit and build a brighter future for Britain as we take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.” The message was reinforced by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May’s de facto deputy, who said rebel Tory MPs faced a “stark choice”. “My parliamentary colleagues will have to decide whether to support the government in restoring the bill to its original purpose of delivering legal certainty, or whether to allow hostile amendments to frustrate those essential aims, restricting the government’s ability to negotiate,” he wrote in the Telegraph. “It is profoundly in our national interest that they should choose the first path.” Ministers and aides have indicated they remain “quietly reassured” that they have the numbers to pass the bill when it returns to the lower chamber on Tuesday. Ken Clarke, the longest-serving MP in the Commons and former chancellor, on Sunday asked rebels to withstand pressure from Tory whips. But one informed source said No 10 believed it would have “the numbers to get through” votes on Tuesday and Wednesday without a major defeat. “It will be close, but it will be done,” the source said. The most likely loss for the government could come on the amendment proposed in the Lords by the Tory peer Viscount Hailsham, which guarantees parliament a meaningful vote on a final Brexit deal. Sarah Wollaston, who is among the likely Tory rebel MPs, said on Monday she was “minded at the moment to vote for the meaningful final vote”. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If it came back to us then, having to have a vote of confidence, we would all vote to support the prime minister. We do support the prime minister.” Wollaston said she would also like to see further concessions on the amendment on the customs union “because it is just a very sensible amendment that says keep it on the table, don’t completely rule it out”. Labour is seeking to keep two crucial amendments after the 15 government defeats in the House of Lords – to maintain a role in the customs union, and to guarantee a role for parliament in approving a final deal. The Brexiter Dominic Raab, the housing minister, said he was reasonably confident the government had the support to see off the revolt. “People thinking about voting against the government this week need to think very seriously about it,” he said on BBC One’s Sunday Politics programme. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, urged Labour to back away from an amendment backing EEA membership. “If you are in the EEA, you are not in a customs union with the EU and to test that proposition, I went to Norway and then I went to the Norway-Sweden border to see for myself,” he said. “There is infrastructure there, there are checks there, you have to hand in your papers. It is totally incompatible with a solemn commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland.” May has a working majority of 14 in the Commons and relies on the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party. In a further development, Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, claimed that a “potentially catastrophic” no-deal Brexit was becoming increasingly possible. As his party prepares to fight the Lewisham East byelection on a platform of guaranteeing a referendum on any eventual deal, Cable said the longer the government appeared deadlocked over Brexit, the greater risk there was of a no-deal departure. “I’d always assumed that the government would more or less get something, a divorce settlement plus a vague commitment to sort things out – Brexit in name but probably not in fact,” Cable said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/10/rafael-nadal-tear-french-open-court-philippe-chatrier-wimbledon-dominic-thiem","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T18:54:26Z","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal sheds tear for French Open court he has made his own | Simon Cambers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/10/rafael-nadal-tear-french-open-court-philippe-chatrier-wimbledon-dominic-thiem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/10/rafael-nadal-tear-french-open-court-philippe-chatrier-wimbledon-dominic-thiem","fields":{"headline":"Rafael Nadal sheds tear for French Open court he has made his own","bodyText":"The tears were new but otherwise things were as they always seem to be in Paris. Rafael Nadal duly collected his 11th French Open title here on Sunday with a brutal, brilliant, resilient and ruthless performance, just as he had done 10 times before. But as Nadal’s uncle, Toni Nadal, said shortly afterwards, “this is not normal”. Less than an hour after the match was completed, demolition workers began to smash up Court Philippe Chatrier, part of the continuing redevelopment that will lead to a roof being in place over the stadium court in two years’ time. This, though, is Nadal’s court, the place he has dominated like no other. His emotions were on show as he shed a few tears when the national anthem of Spain was played in his honour for the 11th time, an obvious sign of what this tournament means to him. Nadal’s 11th title takes his grand slam tally to 17 and even at 32, despite the miles in his legs, who is going to stop him making it 12 in a year’s time? When he was recovering from injury this year, for the umpteenth time in his career, he was focused on this title and nothing – certainly not Dominic Thiem – was going to stand in his way. Even a cramp in his left hand early in the third set, which required a rub-down of his left forearm, did not stop him as he closed out for victory. Uncle Toni, no longer his nephew’s coach but back in his customary seat on the end of the players’ box, two seats down from the current coach, Carlos Moya, summed it up perfectly. “When someone wins 11 times here, for me it’s unbelievable,” he told reporters. “To think that Rafael has won 11 times, it’s unbelievable. I think he is really good.” The understatement was classic Toni but there was nothing understated about Nadal himself. It was his best performance of the fortnight, as Nadal confirmed on court, just when he needed it most. Right from the start of the tournament the Nadal camp knew Thiem was the biggest danger, having seen at first hand what the Austrian can do when he defeated their man in Madrid last month. Having also beaten him in Rome last year, he is the only man to defeat Nadal on clay in the past two years, and the way he had played on the way to the final threatened to make it a classic match. That it was not was testimony to Nadal’s level, which never wavered, despite everything Thiem threw at him. Nadal threw himself across the baseline, retrieving everything. When he had the chance, he thumped his forehand with his customary effect, his dazzling footwork still a marvel even as he enters his 33rd year. The momentary cramp in his left hand gave him a brief scare but he was simply too good, yet again. He is now three grand slam titles short of Roger Federer, the pair having shared the past six slam titles between them. Might he catch him? “I want to think that is possible but I know maybe in a month Federer will win Wimbledon again. I don’t know,” Toni Nadal said. It is eight years since Nadal last lifted the Wimbledon title and he has not been past the last 16 since he reached the 2011 final. The transition from clay to grass is a tough one for him, the loading required particularly difficult for his chronic knees, which nevertheless have held up amazingly well over the years. Last year, he looked good only to lose against Gilles Müller of Luxembourg in a five-set match. It is a tough assignment but with the confidence earned here it is possible. “I think so,” Toni Nadal said. “I thought last year he could win. I thought it, because he played really good, but in the end Gilles Müller just played too good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/10/tyson-fury-tony-bellew","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T21:30:02Z","webTitle":"Tyson Fury dismisses Tony Bellew’s challenge saying he wants someone big","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/10/tyson-fury-tony-bellew","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/10/tyson-fury-tony-bellew","fields":{"headline":"Tyson Fury dismisses Tony Bellew’s challenge saying he wants someone big","bodyText":"Tyson Fury has urged his promoter, Frank Warren, to find him a series of big opponents to help prepare for a heavyweight showdown with Anthony Joshua or Deontay Wilder in 2019 – thus dampening the possibility of an intriguing clash with Tony Bellew. Bellew, who defeated David Haye for a second time last month, tweeted on Sunday that he would knock out Fury before telling him: “Let’s do this.” Fury, however, has other targets in mind after stopping Sefer Seferi in four rounds on a rowdy Saturday night in Manchester. “I want someone big, not small ones,” Fury said when asked about the prospect of facing Bellew. “Look at Wilder and Joshua, they’re big guys. I’ve got to prepare for people like that.” Warren seemed more amenable, though, and suggested that a fight could be made if Bellew was willing to accept terms. “It’s up to Tony Bellew,” he said. “We could do it before the end of the year.” Next for Fury will be a fight against a yet-to-be-decided opponent on the undercard of the Carl Frampton bill in August, although whoever it is will not represent a significant step up in quality over Seferi. For now, at least, Warren’s main priority is to keep Fury active in order to shake off any lingering ring rust and to get his weight down from 19st 10lb to closer to 18st. “I want to keep him busy,” Warren said. “I’d like to get him out in August, once or twice more before Christmas and one of those I want to be a fight that people will appreciate that is a possible main event.” Warren was noticeably cooler about the prospect of an imminent fight with the WBA champion Manuel Charr, saying that while the Lebanese heavyweight was in the arena he had a mandatory defence of his title coming up. “After a couple of fights I’m quite sure Tyson will become mandatory challenger for all these guys and then they won’t be able to get out of the way. When you’re negotiating you want to get them in the No 1 spot. That gets them sitting down or vacating the titles.” Against Seferi there was often more action outside the ring than in it – with Fury appearing more concerned about a mass brawl that broke out in the crowd during the second round than anything Seferi was throwing at him. Once the speed and sting in his punches started to bite, his opponent understandably decided to stay on his stool at the end of the fourth. “It was a bit of a loosener back,” Fury said. “The opponent was quite short, and he was quick. But he didn’t come to fight, he came to come round and run. He took me a few rounds, I was happy. In a couple more fights I will be ready. I’ll have a world title by the end of the year, no problem.” That may be optimistic. That said, this fight alone was never going to tell us much about how rosy Fury’s future is likely to be. Against Seferi, nine inches shorter and five stone lighter, the dice were loaded in his favour. And the house was always going to win. This was more about scrubbing off the ring rust after a 914‑day absence. “He has lost 8st in three months, how many people can do that?” Warren said, not unreasonably. “But he still has got a stone and a half to get off. I want to see him get rid of the weight so he’s actually in a situation that he is training for a contest rather than having to work to lose the weight. Once he’s done that he will be working on his moves, and you’ll see he will get more sharp. “And I don’t care what anyone says, there were a certain amount of nerves there and why wouldn’t there be? He’s been out of the ring over two‑and‑a‑half years.” Earlier, when Fury entered the ring, he was greeted like a returning hero by a near-capacity 15,000 crowd. In the past he has never been a great ticket seller but there was genuine affection at the Manchester Arena for him – although some of that was tempered by Seferi pulling out when the going got tough. As the boos rang out, one reporter’s laptop was ruined by a can of beer flying over it. “I think people can associate with him,” Warren said. “It’s a British thing, isn’t it? We have got that mentality with our heroes. We build them up and we knock them down. But people love him – and the fact he went down to rock bottom, that he was in a bad place, that he was depressed, and he went out and came out supportive of people with similar problems.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/counter-terrorism-orwell-strategy-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"Our response to terrorism is balanced, not Orwellian | Sajid Javid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/counter-terrorism-orwell-strategy-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/counter-terrorism-orwell-strategy-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Our response to terrorism is balanced, not Orwellian","bodyText":"Last year, the UK witnessed a series of sickening terrorist acts which claimed the lives of 36 people and changed the lives of many more. In recent weeks the nation has come together to remember those who paid the ultimate price, and I have seen first-hand the heartache people are going through. Attending the memorial service for the victims of the London Bridge attack, it was clear to me that the people of Britain will not allow these vile terrorists to change our way of life. Their actions will not undermine the freedoms on which this country is built on – but neither will this government as we respond to them. Our updated counter-terrorism strategy sets out how we will deal with the unprecedented challenge we face, and today the counter-terrorism and border security bill will be debated in parliament for the first time. This important piece of legislation will allow the police and MI5 to disrupt threats earlier, and ensure our laws reflect modern use of the internet. It will change existing laws to better manage terrorist offenders and permit more effective investigations. It will also give police more powers to investigate hostile state activity in the wake of the Salisbury attack. These changes will make us safer – but there was no blank cheque when we went about deciding what these new powers would be. The bill is the product of a carefully considered process. We have built safeguards and oversight into this legislation so that the public can have confidence in its proportionate use. We did not just seek the views of the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and MI5 when drafting the bill. We discussed our proposals with the current and former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation – whose job it is ensure that our terrorism legislation is effective, proportionate and serves the public interest. They provided robust challenge – indeed there were times when we did not agree – but their comments and recommendations have shaped and will continue to shape our response. Since introducing the bill last week, critics have already wrongfully accused the legislation of criminalising thought, describing it as a “blind expansion of power”. This could not be further from the truth. Our proposals will be debated and scrutinised as they pass through parliament. This process is a key pillar of Britain’s democracy that terrorists seek to undermine. I totally reject any attempt to simplify today’s debate into one of security versus liberty. This is not a binary choice we need to make. The fact of the matter is there can be no liberty without security. People cannot feel free to live their lives as they wish without feeling safe and secure. The balance lies in making sure that in protecting our freedom and way of life, we don’t undermine it. I love this country and the liberal, tolerant, pluralistic society we are. And I will fight to protect it. Our police and intelligence officers are hardworking, committed people keeping us safe so that we don’t have to worry. Over the past five years, they have foiled as many as 25 Islamist-linked plots. And right now our security agencies are handling more than 500 live operations and have 3,000 “subjects of interest”. That is why we are giving counter-terrorism policing a £50m increase in funding this year – to more than £750m. As well as sufficient funding, I am committed to providing our people with the powers they need to do their jobs effectively. But I want people to know that these powers do not and will not go unchecked. Our bill will be subject to full parliamentary debate as well as ongoing scrutiny by the intelligence and security and home affairs select committees, and indeed the courts. The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation not only examines our laws but also their application. The investigatory powers commissioner, the inspectorates of constabulary and prisons, the biometrics commissioner and a series of other independent bodies hold government, the police and the intelligence community to account. And we listen to them. The counter-terrorism and border security bill is not part of a sinister strategy to create an Orwellian state. It is simply part of my desire to allow the public to live their lives safe in the knowledge that the police have the powers they need to protect us. I look forward to making this case as the bill passes through parliament. • Sajid Javid is the home secretary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/10/tommy-makinson-england-new-zealand-st-helens","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T20:59:02Z","webTitle":"Tommy Makinson’s fine form earns England call-up to face New Zealand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/10/tommy-makinson-england-new-zealand-st-helens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/10/tommy-makinson-england-new-zealand-st-helens","fields":{"headline":"Tommy Makinson’s fine form earns England call-up to face New Zealand","bodyText":"Tommy Makinson is one of three uncapped players in Wayne Bennett’s England squad to face New Zealand in Colorado this month.

Bennett’s squad also includes all three Burgess brothers, with George returning to the fray alongside his twin brother, Thomas, and Sam having missed the cut for the World Cup last year. All three have performed excellently for South Sydney this season in the National Rugby League and they will reunite at international level for the Denver Test. Makinson is one of three wings included, with Ryan Hall and Jermaine McGillvary both being called up, having featured in every game of England’s run to the World Cup final last year. There is no place for the highly rated Wakefield wing Tom Johnstone, though, despite his being called into the elite performance squad this year. Thirteen of that 21-man EPS squad will travel to Denver, with six players from the NRL – the Burgess brothers, Elliott Whitehead, James Graham and Gareth Widdop – completing the group. But Luke Gale, Kallum Watkins and Alex Walmsley have all been ruled out because of injury, leaving open the possibility for Bennett to draft in players from the England Knights. That squad, who will travel to Papua New Guinea for a two-game series against the Kumuls this year, features Hull’s Jake Connor, who has impressed for the Challenge Cup holders this season and has been widely tipped to earn his first Test cap this year. Meanwhile the Leeds wing Tom Briscoe has agreed a new contract with the Super League champions, it is understood.

Last year they made it on to a list of the world’s most endangered historic sites, but their continuing survival will be helped by a grant from the World Monuments Fund to be announced this week. Though expensive to maintain, piers are still much loved by the public. A free family day on Saturday at Blackpool’s North pier attracted an estimated 6,000 people. “A free coconut shy, who could resist it?” said Carl Carrington, built heritage and conservation manager of Blackpool council. “They closed for a week, so everything was freshly painted on Saturday, and people were just blown away by how gorgeous it looked.” The three piers are owned by the same private group, and generally not eligible for public funding. However, their importance to the economy of a town still heavily dependent on tourism is such that the council nominated them to the fund, and is working with the owners to secure their future. The grant will help fund the action plan, bringing together all the interested parties – but the full costs are daunting, with urgent repairs to the North pier alone estimated at £12m. The piers will share $1m (£750,000) with seven other international sites, but the council believes it will be the key to unlocking further funding. “The North pier is right on the doorstep of the town hall, so sitting back and watching it fall into the sea was not an option,” Carrington said. “Our piers are a core part of the history of the Victorian holiday, but if we don’t act now we could lose them all.” The piers will remain in private ownership, but with advice and cooperation with the council, which has already taken on Blackpool Tower and the Winter Gardens. The town’s first pier was the North pier in 1863, built as close as possible to the railway station, which had opened 17 years earlier. It targeted an elite market, and charged a shilling for admission, so as to discourage poorer visitors. Its original theatre was destroyed in a fire, but it still has its 1930s art deco theatre auditorium, one of only five remaining pier theatres in the UK. It is now in the worst condition, but it is the oldest survivor by Eugenius Birch, regarded as the greatest pier designer, and the only one of the three listed by Historic England. The success of the North pier encouraged the expansion of the resort, so a new railway station followed – by 1911, at the peak of the town’s prosperity, it was believed to be the busiest in the world. A second pier was built in 1868, with free admission, a dance hall, a roller-skating rink and fairground rides. The Victoria pier followed in 1893, along with a third station. From the 1960s, cheap air travel meant English people could venture overseas in unprecedented numbers, and Blackpool lost three-quarters of its cinemas and theatres, one of its train stations, and became a day tripper and weekend resort rather than the place where thousands took their only fortnight holiday. Last year the piers found a place on the US-based World Monuments Fund list of the world’s most precious but threatened places. The list is notably eclectic, with places of barely local fame ranked alongside world-renowned sites. This year’s grants include funds for Amatrice, the Italian hill village torn apart by devastating earthquakes in 2016; an imperial theatre in an 18th-century mansion in Beijing; the kitchen garden of the Palace of Versailles near Paris; and a gymnasium at Takamatsu in Japan, built in the 1960s but closed in 2014 when the roof began leaking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/10/inequality-stress-anxiety-britons","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T14:56:46Z","webTitle":"Inequality breeds stress and anxiety.

No wonder so many Britons are suffering","bodyText":"The gap between image and reality yawns ever wider. Our rich society is full of people presenting happy smiling faces both in person and online, but when the Mental Health Foundation commissioned a large survey last year, it found that 74% of adults were so stressed they felt overwhelmed or unable to cope. Almost a third had had suicidal thoughts and 16% had self-harmed at some time in their lives. The figures were higher for women than men, and substantially higher for young adults than for older age groups. And rather than getting better, the long-term trends in anxiety and mental illness are upwards. For a society that believes happiness is a product of high incomes and consumption, these figures are baffling. However, studies of people who are most into our consumerist culture have found that they are the least happy, the most insecure and often suffer poor mental health. An important part of the explanation involves the psychological effects of inequality. The greater the material differences between us, the more important status and money become. They are increasingly seen as if they were a measure of a person’s inner worth. And, as research shows, the result is that the more unequal the society, the more people feel anxiety about status and how they are seen and judged. These effects are seen across all income groups – from the poorest to the richest tenth of the population. Inequality increases our insecurities about self-worth because it emphasises status and strengthens the idea that some people are worth much more than others. People at the top appear supremely important, almost as superior beings, while others are made to feel as if they are of little or no value. A study of how people experience low social status in different countries found, predictably, that people felt they were failures. They felt a strong sense of shame and despised themselves for failing. Whether they lived in countries as rich as the UK and Norway, or as poor as Uganda and Pakistan, made very little difference to what it felt like to be near the bottom of the social ladder. Studies have shown that conspicuous consumption is intensified by inequality. If you live in a more unequal area, you are more likely to spend money on a flashy car and shop for status goods. The strength of this effect on consumption can be seen in the tendency for inequality to drive up levels of personal debt as people try to enhance their status. But it is not just that inequality increases status anxiety. For many, it would be nearer to the truth to say that it is an assault on their feeling of self-worth. It increases what psychologists have called the “social evaluative threat”, where social contact becomes increasingly stressful. The result for some is low self-esteem and a collapse of self-confidence. For them, social gatherings become an ordeal to be avoided. As they withdraw from social life they suffer higher levels of anxiety and depression. Others react quite differently to the greater ego threat of invidious social comparisons. They react by trying to boost the impression they give to others. Instead of being modest about achievements and abilities, they flaunt them. Rising narcissism is part of the increased concern with impression management. A study of what has been called “self-enhancement” asked people in different countries how they rated themselves relative to others. Rather like the tell-tale finding that 90% of the population think they are better drivers than average, more people in more unequal countries rated themselves above average on a number of different dimensions. They claimed, for example, that they were cleverer and more attractive than most people. Nor does the damage stop there. Psychological research has shown that a number of mental illnesses and personality disorders are linked to issues of dominance and subordination exacerbated by inequality. Some, like depression, are related to an acceptance of inferiority, others relate to an endless attempt to defend yourself from being looked down on and disrespected. Still others are borne of the assumption of superiority or to an endless struggle for it. Confirming the picture, the international data shows not only that mental illness as a whole is more common in more unequal societies, but specifically that depression, schizophrenia and psychoses are all more common in those societies. What is perhaps saddest about this picture is that good social relationships and involvement in community life have been shown repeatedly to be powerful determinants of health and happiness. But it is exactly here that great inequality throws another spanner in the works. By making class and status divisions more powerful, it leads to a decline in community life, a reduction in social mobility, an increase in residential segregation and fewer inter-class marriages. More equal societies are marked by strong community life, high levels of trust, a greater willingness to help others, and low levels of violence. As inequality rises, all this goes into reverse. Community life atrophies, people cease to trust each other, and homicide rates are higher. In the most unequal societies, like Mexico and South Africa, the damage has gone further: citizens have become afraid of each other. Houses are barricaded with bars on windows and doors, razor wire atop walls and fences. And as inequality increases, a higher proportion of a country’s labour force is employed in what has been called “guard labour” – the security staff, prison officers and police we use to protect ourselves from each other. Understanding inequality means recognising that it increases school shootings, bullying, anxiety levels, mental illness and consumerism because it threatens feelings of self-worth. • Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett are the authors of The Inner Level: How More Equal Societies Reduce Stress, Restore Sanity and Improve Everyone’s Wellbeing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/11/un-ballo-in-maschera-review-grange-park-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T09:34:18Z","webTitle":"Un Ballo in Maschera review – Verdi goes west in uneven horse opera","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/11/un-ballo-in-maschera-review-grange-park-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/11/un-ballo-in-maschera-review-grange-park-opera","fields":{"headline":"Un Ballo in Maschera review – Verdi goes west in uneven horse opera","bodyText":"Last summer, with the building dust barely settled in its theatre, Grange Park Opera moved into its new Surrey home with a season ambitious enough to bring an episode of Wagner’s Ring cycle to the country house opera either side of a picnic crowd. This year, with the theatre improved with swish new facilities – because nobody loves a Portaloo – the festival is getting bedded in. The best news is that the house orchestra and chorus are now those of English National Opera; ENO’s reduced summer programme means London’s loss is Surrey’s gain. Not everything is new. Those with memories unclouded by interval champagne will recognise that Stephen Medcalf’s production of Verdi’s Un Ballo in Maschera has a set (by Jamie Vartan) thriftily recycled from last year’s Die Walküre. A state room with a balcony around the top, it works well for the palace scenes, less so for the others; the shack where fortune-teller Ulrica plies her voodoo trade is wheeled into the middle of the stage; by the time the full chorus has turned up, things feel cramped and clunky. A sea of stars and stripes at curtain-up tell us this is the censor-mollifying Americanisation Verdi had to make of his original Swedish-set piece, dramatising the true-ish story of the assassination of King Gustav III. The victim in this version is Riccardo, Boston’s governor. Vincenzo Costanzo, caped and masked for the titular ball like a costume-shop Dick Turpin, brings genuine Italianate oomph to the role, but wields his voice like a blunt instrument, with little subtlety or sweetness – qualities found more abundantly in the orchestral playing, conducted with an ear for interior detail by Gianluca Marcianò. Claire Rutter wrings all the pathos out of Amelia’s music, Roland Wood is commanding and stylish as her vengeful husband, and Elisabetta Fiorillo sings Ulrica with a meaty contralto that pins you to your seat. Tereza Gevorgyan’s light soprano makes for an appealing Oscar, but this “page boy” – here a strutting, gun-twirling wannabe cowboy – seems to have wandered in from another opera set a few hundred miles west: another clunky detail in a decent but uneven production.

Her memory of the Battle of Cable Street anti-fascist demonstrations in 1936 was vivid. Family history held that her apolitical sister, Faye, got arrested as a bystander, whereas Bertha, chalking slogans and running errands, and already a member of the Young Communist League, was not. Bertha was born in Whitechapel, third of four children of Rachel and Jacob Markovitch, immigrants from Romania. Jacob was injured in army training during the first world war; he began a relationship with one of his nurses and later abandoned his family. Rachel struggled to bring up her children with help from Jewish charities. From Robert Montefiore elementary school, Bertha gained a scholarship to Central Foundation girls’ school in Spitalfields. She left unwillingly at 16, and became a secretary at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, then for Gollancz publishers, and at Stepney borough council. She married Stan Sokoloff, a fellow Young Communist, in 1940. They counted themselves lucky that he survived four years’ second world war service in Africa and she weathered the London blitz. During the war, Bertha proved an able branch secretary for the Communist party in Stepney at a time of growth. In 1943 she took up war work in a factory where the management noticed she was clumsy on machines but good at maths and at inspiring others: they made her a productivity officer. Bertha was the agent for Phil Piratin who was elected to parliament as the UK’s second ever Communist MP in 1945, and she was elected as a Stepney councillor that year. In 1949, Bertha and Stan, with two young daughters, me and my sister, Ruth, moved from a condemned East End flat to council housing in south London. She left “the party” in 1957 over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Hungary. However, through community-building in St Paul’s Cray, helping to run a campaign for a nursery at Woolwich College, volunteering as a housing adviser in Bromley after retirement, or protesting in 2013 against the closure of Pocklington House, a home for the blind in Northwood where she lived, Bertha was an effective and respected activist all her life. After teaching in infant schools, Bertha graduated in sociology in 1971 at the same London University ceremony as her younger daughter. She loved teaching mature students at Woolwich College in the 1970s, and after retirement enjoyed spending time with her five grandchildren. An atheist but culturally Jewish, in old age she contributed to the social life of Bromley Reform Synagogue. Never happy with historians’ interpretations of East End communism, she wove her own experiences into a book about the dedicated community worker Edith Ramsay (Edith and Stepney: 60 Years of Education, Politics and Social Change, 1987). Her gift for friendship lasted to the end of her long life. Stan died in 2005. Bertha is survived by her daughters and grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/11/agrippina-review-grange-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Agrippina review – classy dissection of political chicanery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/11/agrippina-review-grange-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/11/agrippina-review-grange-festival","fields":{"headline":"Agrippina review – classy dissection of political chicanery","bodyText":"Imperial Rome becomes a modern-day theatre in Walter Sutcliffe’s Grange festival production of Agrippina, Handel’s dark 1709 comedy that takes the events surrounding Nero’s nomination as emperor as the starting point for an acerbic satire on the games played – and lies told – in the name of political expediency. The curtain rises on an auditorium not unlike the one in which the audience is sitting, where we find Anna Bonitatibus’s duplicitous Agrippina setting the protagonists against each other in an attempt to secure the imperial succession for her son. The audience, meanwhile, become the Roman populace as Raffaele Pé’s leather-clad, blinged-up Nerone roams the stalls, touting for support. The set later revolves to reveal a grubby backstage area, where hidden agendas surface as Christopher Ainslie’s idealistic Ottone and Ashley Riches’ dimwit Claudio vie with Nerone for the sexual attentions of Stefanie True’s self-assured Poppea. Sutcliffe’s insights into the self-dramatising nature of political life are clever, astute and wonderfully funny throughout. It sounds good, too. Bonitatibus, a great artist, gives a terrific central performance, gloriously sung, with recitatives and arias flawlessly integrated into a dramatic whole. Pé’s voice is a bit grainy, though his swaying sicilianas have bags of insidious charm, and his big coloratura tantrums suggest real malice. Ainslie does exquisite things with Vaghe Fonti, and Riches has fun with Claudio’s preposterously self-important vocal lines. In the pit, the Academy of Ancient Music play with sensuous clarity for Robert Howarth.

As the struggle to achieve the vote gathered pace, events such as the women’s suffrage march of 13 June 1908 united beauty with political dynamism, as skilfully embroidered banners, and colourful pennants and flags, proclaimed the marchers’ allegiances. The banners infused the processions with an almost medieval sense of dignity and pageantry, no matter that the marchers were abused and insulted by passersby. As the historian Elizabeth Crawford has noted, the air on that day in 1908 was thick with banners depicting important foremothers such as astronomer Caroline Herschel and writer Fanny Burney, banners celebrating the women’s trades and professions, and banners proudly displaying the hometowns of the women marching. Often their slogans were witty and subversive. Portsmouth’s, for example – “Engage the enemy more closely” – appropriated Nelson’s last signal to the fleet at Trafalgar. And East Anglia reversed the famous saying of Pope Gregory the Great, “Non Angli, sed angeli” (not Angles but angels) so that it meant “not angels but Anglians” – that is, not “angels in the house” (to borrow Virginia Woolf’s phrase), but Englishwomen and citizens, who demanded their rights. On Sunday thousands of women took to the streets in the spirit of these astonishingly brave women; they were participants in a mass artwork called Processions, organised as part of the 14-18 NOW commemorations of the first world war. Taking place in Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh and London, the marches were a deliberate attempt to recreate the glorious spectacle of the processions for which Lowndes and others had designed such splendid banners. Women across Britain have been stitching, embroidering, appliqueing and painting banners for months to hold aloft in celebration of those who came before them, but also in acknowledgment of the fact that the fight has only just begun. Women marched for reproductive rights, for an end to period poverty, against the gender pay gap, for equal representation in parliament. As one banner put it: “We have the vote. Now we want equality.” Just as in 1908, the apparently benign and domestic tools of needle and thread have been employed as the weapons of protest. The banners of 2018, crafted with slow and painstaking skill, are the ultimate in analogue communication, but their effect is paradoxically instant, as pictures and footage are posted on social media. Lowndes – who proclaimed that if you could make a pair of curtains, you can certainly make a banner – would be pleased. She would be less pleased that the fight for women’s equality has so far to go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/10/angela-merkel-photo-donald-trump-diplomacy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T18:00:11Z","webTitle":"Merkel's G7 photo says everything about Trump's diplomacy – or does it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/angela-merkel-photo-donald-trump-diplomacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/angela-merkel-photo-donald-trump-diplomacy","fields":{"headline":"Merkel's G7 photo says everything about Trump's diplomacy – or does it?","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, insisted on Sunday that the president was “willing to talk to any world leader”. But a day after Trump left a trail of diplomatic chaos from Canada to Singapore, the site of his summit with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, a picture of world leaders apparently confronting Trump dominated reactions to the G7 summit. The picture was taken by Jesco Denzel, a German government photographer, and released by Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the chancellor, Angela Merkel. It shows Trump, arms folded and eyes glaring, sitting while around him stand a group of world leaders and their advisers. Merkel is centre stage, arms planted on a table, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, standing to her left, arms folded and a look of resignation on his face. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, stands next to Merkel, partially obscured, with the British prime minister, Theresa May, more obscured still at his right. To many observers the photograph, a rare glimpse of diplomatic activity not wreathed in smiles and handshakes, seemed both a summation of the effect of Trump’s “America first” foreign policy and the perfect pictorial accompaniment to a tense couple of days in Canada. Departing Washington on Friday, Trump called for Russia to be readmitted to the G7, four years after it was thrown out over the annexation of Crimea. At a Saturday afternoon press conference in La Malbaie, he blamed Barack Obama for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and complained about the US being a “piggy bank” which he said other countries were “robbing”. In the picture released by Merkel, John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, stands at the president’s right. Showing that images of conflict can be deployed by both sides, the hawkish former United Nations ambassador used the same picture in a tweet issued after Trump’s early departure from the summit. Bolton wrote: “Just another #G7 where other countries expect America will always be their bank. The president made it clear today. No more.” That prepared the ground for Trump’s attack on the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the US withdrawal from a communique on trade negotiated in an attempt to defuse tensions over Trump’s protectionist policy. The release of the picture caused animated commentary around the world about body language and what it might say about relations between the US and its allies in the Trump era. It was followed on Sunday by a furious attack on Trudeau by Trump’s leading economic advisers. But every picture tells a story. Other images of the same gathering suggested a more relaxed interaction, Merkel smiling and Trump making eye contact while Trudeau, also smiling, stood by. The White House issued its own photo, showing a sitting Trump speaking as Merkel, Abe and Trudeau listened. Helpfully, a German journalist tweeted composites of six contrasting pictures of the same moment – and who released them to the press. Still, there appears to be more than a little truth to suggestions that Merkel and Trump do not get on. Saturday was not the first awkward moment between them, and the chancellor has made no secret of her disagreement with the president on trade, his rejection of the Iran nuclear deal and his withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. In March 2017, Merkel’s first visit to the White House saw Trump either fail to hear or ignore the chancellor’s offer to shake hands. A visit in April this year warranted only a working lunch, several days after a state visit by Macron."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/10/arron-banks-self-styled-bad-boy-and-bankroller-of-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T16:15:26Z","webTitle":"Arron Banks: self-styled bad boy and bankroller of Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/arron-banks-self-styled-bad-boy-and-bankroller-of-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/10/arron-banks-self-styled-bad-boy-and-bankroller-of-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Arron Banks: self-styled bad boy and bankroller of Brexit","bodyText":"One of the self-styled bad boys of Brexit, Arron Banks made history by giving the biggest donation in British political history to the Leave.EU campaign. The Bristol-based businessman, who is worth anything between £100m and £250m, gave a reported £12m in cash, loans and services to pro-Brexit causes. Born in 1966 in Northwich, Cheshire and educated at private school, Banks is credited and condemned in equal measure for bankrolling Brexit. The origins of his huge wealth are shrouded in secrecy. He co-founded the Brightside insurance firm and founded the brokers Go Skippy, but much of his wealth is held offshore in Belize, the Isle of Man, the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar, making analysis difficult. The source of some of the money he donated to Leave.EU is the subject of an investigation by the Electoral Commission, which is examining donations worth £2.3m, to assess whether Banks was the true source of the funds. Described as pugnacious and not a man to cross, Banks was a Conservative party donor and member until 2014. He then defected to Ukip pledging a £100,000 donation, which he increased to £1m after William Hague, the then foreign secretary, said publicly that he had never heard of Banks when asked about the defection. “Hague called me a nobody,” Banks said. “Now he knows who I am.” Nor did he stop at £1m. Critics say he bought Brexit with his funding of the populist, social media driven Leave.EU campaign, which engaged in Trump-style tactics focused on immigration. It would be hard today to find anyone in British political circles who does not know the name of the insurance magnate who made front page news when he accompanied Nigel Farage to New York to become the first British political figures to meet Donald Trump after his inauguration as US president. Behind the scenes, however, questions are increasingly being asked about Banks’s wealth and the origins of some of his political donations. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has said in parliament that there was “widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference in western democracies”. Banks has five children and is married to Katya Paderina, his second wife, a Russian who came to Britain on a student visa. Banks has been typically truculent in the past when questioned about his funding. “Gosh I’m terrified,” he tweeted at news of the Electoral Commission inquiry. As more allegations emerge of his meetings with Russian officials in the run-up to the referendum, it remains to be seen how he responds to questioning by MPs on Tuesday when he is expected to give evidence to an inquiry into fake news."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/live/2018/jun/19/reading-group-webchat-with-rebecca-wests-biographer-post-your-questions-now","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T13:07:43Z","webTitle":"Reading group webchat: Rebecca West's biographer on her feminism, HG Wells and politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2018/jun/19/reading-group-webchat-with-rebecca-wests-biographer-post-your-questions-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/live/2018/jun/19/reading-group-webchat-with-rebecca-wests-biographer-post-your-questions-now","fields":{"headline":"Reading group webchat: Rebecca West's biographer on her feminism, HG Wells and politics","bodyText":"Thank you to everyone who posted a question. And a huge thanks to Carl for joining us today and answering them – it is much appreciated. Next Tuesday, we’ll announce our theme for the July Reading group. A clue: it involves voting on the best of 52 books ... And Carl signs off, with a final comment about West and Wells’s nicknames for each other – Panther (West) and Jaguar (Wells): KoloKweel says: Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is one of the great books of the last century, an obvious masterpiece, yet I heard about it by accident, and never hear it mentioned. How could this happen? It seems fairly scandalous, especially when considering the (rightfully) enduring reputation of Pound’s Cantos, for example. Is the book destined to be a lost classic, and is that how it should be? samjordison has another: I first heard of Rebecca West via HG Wells, as I was doing some research on him. I enjoyed the David Lodge book about their relationship. And can’t help but speculate on how they might have influenced each others work ... But I also have a feeling that those associations might not have delighted West. Did she feel trapped under his shadow? Swelter says: I note that The Return of the Soldier was published in the UK and US while the war was still going on. I know that here in the US open dissent against the war was often punished with imprisonment. Was the novel seen as anti-war at the time it was published? MachenBach has another comment – involving a drawing with West’s other name on it: I have a drawing which has a label on the back of the frame saying ‘Dame Cicely Andrews’ and also ‘36 Heathfield Terrace’, and a subsequent label showing ownership of her agent Patricia Kavanagh. My question is twofold: a) what was West’s interest in the visual arts, and b) if the Feds come after me, you’ve got my back, right? MachenBach says: I enjoyed Return of the Soldier, which seemed to offer far more on re-reading than on the first read, as good books ought to. The narrator reminded me a little of the narrator governess in The Turn of the Screw (somewhat self-deluded regarding her own status, more than a tad unreliable); I recall reading West’s (1916?) study of Henry James but don’t remember much about it other than that she was very good on James’s female characters. Would you care to remind me what she thought about James and his female characters? Do you see anything Jamesian (or anti-Jamesian) in Return of the Soldier? Our very own samjordison says: I’m rather proud that we’ve given space to Rebecca West here on the Guardian. And I’ve loved writing about her. But in an age when people are so concerned with essentialism and in limiting who is allowed to talk about what I have sometimes been made conscious that I’m a man talking about a female writer. Do you think that would occur to West/ bother her at all? Where was she when it came to who had a right to say what? And did these questions trouble you as you wrote your works on her? Gramercy says: Recently had the pleasure and privilege of introducing an Albanian immigrant to Black Lamb and Grey Falcon ... one of the greatest books [on the Balkans] ever written. If this world were a fair place, Dame Rebecca would have been canonized long ago by every church, both East and West. originalabsence asks: Is Rebecca an under-served role model for 2018? Women who were big before the 1960s gear-change having been wrongly neglected and forgotten? (She plowed a strong furrow long before conditions became more favourable and the ground more amenable.) AlexandraMullen has a question about West’s reputation and reception: Despite the fact that I have spent most of my life in the classroom, I don’t recall seeing West on any syllabus, even in classes on the feminist novel or novels of the 1920s and 1930s. She was mostly ignored, but occasionally excoriated: one of my graduate school colleagues wrote her dissertation on West, but Columbia’s leading feminist critic, who had at first agreed to be her lead examiner, resigned from her committee on the grounds that the more she learned about West’s politics, the more she loathed her. Finally, the question: As Marxism fades from the academy and thus West’s anti-Marxism seems less of a personal affront to the taste-makers, is West being rehabilitated as a thinker as well as a novelist? allworthy has been reading The Return of the Soldier and asks: What would you say her achievements were? Been rereading Mrs Dalloway and struck by the similarities and differences between the two novels. Written fairly close together. Wonder if you have any views on that? Also what were the challenges for women being published at the time? What should I read next? thoughtballoons has two questions, the first about West’s feminism: It appears to me individualistic and sometimes contemptuous. On one hand, I appreciate that she could, as Christopher Hitchens put it, “detect a pure bitch at twenty paces”, but sorry she had very little respect for women who chose private life and caregiving over public life and politics. In our own time feminism is still divisive amongst women, not the great unifier my generation hoped it would be. Could you give some of your insights into West’s feminism? And the second question. Just as easily as she could sniff out “pure bitch”, she could spot the early warning signs of totalitarianism in a society. She was so politically astute I would love to have her thoughts on what’s going on in modern democracies today, especially the US, which is becoming unrecognizable. What do you think she would make of it? Captain_Flint posted this West quote taken from a Paris Review interview conducted when she was 90 years old: “I’ve never gone anywhere where the men have come up to my infantile expectations. I always have gone through life constantly being surprised by the extreme, marvellous qualities of a small minority of men. But I can’t see the rest of them. They seem awful rubbish.” Yep, life’s tough at 90 years old. I wonder what was West’s opinion about women. Swelter says: I was impressed with both the powerful symbolism and apparent clinical accuracy (based on my reading of more recent case histories) in the way West presented Chris’ amnesia in The Return of the Soldier. How much research did she do into such cases of “shell shock” before writing the novel? Did she have personal acquaintance with any victims of this trauma? Another from palfreyman: A lot of what I’ve seen and read suggests that most readers seem to think The Return of the Soldier is about the war, maybe critical of it, and about the notion of shell-shock (or perhaps PTSD as we might now call it). However it seemed to me, after reading it, that the novel uses these more as plot devices than necessarily major themes. For me, the book is a love story - about the relationship between Margaret and Chris, as well as about Jenny’s unrequited yearning for him. Of course no great novel is “about” only one thing, but a lot of the detail in the work seems to me to have almost been influenced by her paramour’s Tono-Bungay, in which class criticism, social exploration and satire are all part of the mix, rather than being the essential bones of the work. I’d love to know your thoughts on this. Thanks. palfreyman asks: You wrote The Literary Legacy of Rebecca West, and it made me wonder how, if at all, such a sometimes seemingly protean and contradictory writer could be described. Is there any single theme you think that might help define her work? If you were introducing someone to her work, or attempting, would you say: “You’ll like reading Rebecca West because she is ‘X’” whatever X might be? In short, I’m seeking further recommendations on what West to read next, and am hoping for a book that might be quintessence of West and therefore help me understand why she is so influential/popular. If I, having only read the one book so far, read three or four of her books, and like them, I might then be in a position to acquiring one of yours (see - it’s in your interest to tell me all you can!) :) RabBurnout asks: Hi Carl, I really enjoyed Return of the Soldier - I found it wonderful: insightful, profound, evocative and brilliantly written. This is the first novel I have read, but will definitely read more. What are your impressions of this novel, and its place in her oeuvre? Do you think West could be called a modernist? Such was the depiction of the social fragmentation and imminent social upheaval in Return of the Soldier, with its contradictory, unreliable narrator and stylistic innovation. Who influenced West? I’m very reminded of the work of Katherine Mansfield, reading West - something about the style and characterisation, and the empathy, intelligence, insight, and nuance. Am I right in seeing a similarity here? A question from author Amanda Craig, on Twitter: MachenBach has “a general question about biography as a literary form”: I often find the conventional cradle-to-grave biography form a little uninspiring, and wonder why it is predominantly, in many ways, such a conservative literary form. Do you have any thoughts on that, or do you consider your role to be primarily that of a researcher/archivist/historian rather than a writer? There is, I suppose, a more formally adventurous counter-tradition (The Quest for Corvo, Like A Fiery Elephant etc), but this seems to be a niche. Who are the biographers you most admire, and why? A question from Guardian books journalist siancain: I’ve always wondered about her relationship with HG Wells. It’s tempting to look at it through modern eyes as an equal meeting of the minds – she being a fierce critic of his novel, him being attracted to her intellect. Was it really a relationship of equals and did West consider it so? It strikes me that he got the better deal, certainly in terms of sexual freedom. Did West come to resent his ability to come and go eventually? Hello everyone! Thanks so much for all these fascinating questions ... Already plenty of material to keep Carl nice and busy. Reading Rebecca West on the Reading group has been a fascinating subject for discussion this month. Her first novel The Return of the Soldier remains one of the defining descriptions of life on the home front during the first world war, as well as being subversive, compassionate and technically adroit. And it was just the start of a career stretching over 70 years and dozens of acclaimed works of fiction and non-fiction. As well as her literary legacy, there’s plenty of contention and controversy around West. Thanks to her habit of arguing both against extremists at both ends of the political spectrum, she has been claimed (and disowned) by both left and right wings. Her personal life was the subject of scandal and outrage. Famously, she had a long relationship with HG Wells and a son by him who would say “she was minded to do me what hurt she could”. And she baffled plenty of people with her religious beliefs, which took in gentle Christianity, fiercely blasphemous anti-Christianity and Manichaeism. So it’s great to have a genuine expert on hand to tell us more about this extraordinary and impressive woman. Carl Rollyson was the president of the Rebecca West Society from 2003-2007, and the author of three books about her. His comprehensive biography, Rebecca West: A Saga of the Century was described in the Guardian as “authoritatively comprehensive”, and “meticulous” in the New York Times. His essay Rebecca West and the God That Failed focuses in more detail on facets of West’s life, such as her complex relationship with leftwing politics. And The Literary Legacy of Rebecca West considers her long writing career, as well as her numerous posthumous publications. Carl will be an excellent guide – and I speak with extra confidence, because he has appeared on a Reading group webchat before, lending his considerable expertise to a conversation about Sylvia Plath. It may also interest you to know that Carl has written more than 40 books, taking in widely praised biographies of Marilyn Monroe, Sylvia Plath, Norman Mailer, Martha Gellhorn, Susan Sontag and Michael Foot, among others. So, there’s no shortage of things to ask about. But if you are still looking for inspiration, you could do worse than look at West’s final Paris Review interview. This was published in 1981, just two years before her death, when she was coming up for 90 - and was still producing fantastic material: “I’ve never gone anywhere where the men have come up to my infantile expectations. I always have gone through life constantly being surprised by the extreme, marvellous qualities of a small minority of men. But I can’t see the rest of them. They seem awful rubbish.” “I find the whole idea of a professional army very disgusting still. Lacking a normal life, they turn into scoundrels. As Wellington said, they’re despised for being scoundrels and it’s not their fault and they die like flies and have the worst discomforts.” Who wouldn’t want to know more about this person? Carl will be answering questions about her from 1pm (BST) on Friday 22 June - but do please feel free to get yours in early below."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jun/18/hunt-admits-brexit-divident-wont-be-anything-like-enough-to-fund-pms-20bn-boost-for-nhs-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T18:29:13Z","webTitle":"Peers defeat government on Brexit 'meaningful vote' with increased majority - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jun/18/hunt-admits-brexit-divident-wont-be-anything-like-enough-to-fund-pms-20bn-boost-for-nhs-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jun/18/hunt-admits-brexit-divident-wont-be-anything-like-enough-to-fund-pms-20bn-boost-for-nhs-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Peers defeat government on Brexit 'meaningful vote' with increased majority - as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to close down our live coverage for the evening. Thanks for reading. If you would like to read more on tonight’s government defeat in the Lords, my colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story: The House of Lords leader, Natalie Evans, urged peers to reject the amendment. “It is not right that your lordships’ house could have a veto on the deal simply by refusing to consider a motion,” she said, saying the alternative amendment by Hailsham contained “major flaws”. Several former Tory cabinet ministers also spoke out against the amendment. The former leader, Michael Howard, said it “would be to confer upon parliament a negotiation power which has always resided in the hands of the executive in our country”. Former chancellor Norman Lamont said the amendment was unnecessary because parliament would always have the power to act in the event of no deal. “Obviously it would come to parliament, obviously it would be a major event,” he said. “Do we really have to write it down with all these complicated provisions?” “Wake up and smell the coffee”. That’s the message the Liberal Democrats have sent to Theresa May, via the medium of press release, after the government’s Lords defeat. The party’s leader in the House of Lords, Dick Newby, said: Theresa May is making a mess of Brexit. It is time for her to wake up and smell the coffee. This latest defeat shows she can no longer avoid the issue of a meaningful vote. Parliament must be given a meaningful vote on all possible outcomes of Brexit, and this must be guaranteed in writing, in the EU Withdrawal Bill. If the Tories are still confident they can get a good Brexit deal, then they should be more than happy to give parliament this vote. Parliament must be able to decide amongst all the options – including giving the people a final say on the Brexit deal and a chance to exit from Brexit. Matthew Pennycook, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, responding to the House of Lords’ vote on the terms of parliament’s meaningful vote, has said: The Lords have been forced to act to ensure Theresa May upholds the promise she made to Tory MPs. Labour has always maintained that parliament should have the right to a genuinely meaningful vote on the terms of our exit from the EU. If the prime minister’s final Brexit deal is voted down, that cannot give her licence to crash the UK out of the EU without an agreement. MPs now face a decisive vote on Wednesday to guarantee parliament has a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and to take the threat of no deal off the table once and for all. The 22 Tory peers who rebelled and backed the meaningful vote amendment included Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and Sayeeda Warsi. Before voting, they heard Lord Hailsham say at issue was the deal Dominic Grieve, who originally devised the amendment, “believes was agreed with the government” when the bill was before the Commons. Hailsham said Grieve was a man “of the upmost personal and professional integrity” and said he accepted his version of events “without reservation”. Grieve believed he had struck a deal with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, to give MPs more scope in directing ministers in the possible event of a likely no-deal Brexit. That, they hoped would avert a government defeat in the Commons by pro-EU Tories. Grieve said later he was double-crossed and the government went back on the agreement. Hailsham told the Lords the government’s offer “not only fails to deliver a promised ‘meaningful vote’... but is far worse. It is seeking to make it impossible. It deliberately removes the possibility.” Under the new amendment, ministers must update parliament by 21 January 2019 if there is no prospect of a deal with the EU and then have two weeks to return to the House of Commons with a statement on how the government plans to proceed. MPs would then be given a vote on whether to approve the action in statement. Theresa May has suffered a big defeat in the Lords, with peers voting for a new version of the plan to give parliament a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal by a majority of 119. The issue will go back to the Commons on Wednesday where the prime minister is at real risk of a defeat that would take the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit off the table and raise the prospect of MPs, not the government, deciding Brexit priorities in the event of the withdrawal deal being voted down in the autumn. Peers have defeated the government on this issue before. But, unusually, the anti-government majority was significantly bigger than it was last time (normally it starts to shrink at this point) and that may embolden Tory rebels in the Commons. (See 6.16pm.) Theresa May appeared at odds with her cabinet on Monday as she played down the prospect of a full-scale review into the medical use of cannabis oil despite Jeremy Hunt admitting that the government had not got the law right. May has reiterated her much-questioned belief that a new funding deal for the NHS can be financed in part using money saved as a result of Brexit, but said taxpayers should also expect to contribute more. The European commission is refusing to agree to any back-channel discussions between UK and EU aviation agencies to avert a crisis in the event of a “no-deal” outcome to Brexit. Brussels is seeking to bind the UK to the European court of human rights after Brexit in a move likely to infuriate those in the Conservative party championing a break with the Strasbourg court. The government has announced that it will introduce its own bill to ban upskirting after a backbench one was killed off by the Conservative MP Sir Christopher Chope on Friday. Labour has announced that it will seek a vote of no confidence in Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, tomorrow. That’s all for me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Here are the voting figures showing how peers voted on the “meaningful vote” amendment. Some 22 Tory peers rebelled. And the crossbenchers divided more than three to one in favour of the Hailsham amendment. You can read the figures here. Peers have still not finished debating the Commons amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. But no further votes are expected tonight. The bill goes back to the Commons on Wednesday, when the goverment will try to vote down the Hailsham amendment, or “Grieve II”, as he called it. Peers have voted for the new “meaningful vote” amendment by 354 votes to 235 - a majority of 119. Last time when peers defeated the government on the “meaningful vote” issue 335 peers backed Viscount Hailsham, while 244 didn’t, and the majority was 91. Now it is significantly bigger. Two former diplomats are rowing about the EU withdrawal bill on Twitter. This is from Lord Ricketts, former head of the Foreign Office. And this is from Sir Christopher Meyer, former ambassador to Washington. Viscount Hailsham is winding up now. He puts his amendment to a vote. Peers are voting now. Lord True is winding up now. He says it would be a mistake for the Lords to align itself with “a faction in the House of Commons with an axe to grind”. Natalie Evans, the leader of the Lords, is winding up for the government now. She says the Lords have a reputation for high quality scrutiny. But this amendment is a hastily drawn up amendment, she says. She says Michael Howard was right to say MPs will debate the government amendment, and there could be amendments. Lord Bilimoria, a crossbencher, intervenes. He says Evans has said the Hailsham amendment would undermine the government’s negotiating position. But the European parliament will have to approve the deal too, he says. He says no one is saying that will undermine the EU’s negotiating position. Evans ignores his point. She concludes by saying peers should think very carefully before voting against the government on this. Hayter says that, if the government were to reject the Hailsham amendment, parliament would get less say over the withdrawal agreement than the European parliament. She urges peers to pass the amendment. It will then be up to MPs to decide, she says. There is a kefuffle in the Lords because more backbenchers want to speak. But lots of peers shout “front bench” (meaning they’ve had enough and want to move on to the fronbench wind-up speeches) and, after a bit of a stand-off, Lady Hayter, the Labour Brexit spokeswoman goes next. (That is how they organise the schedule in the Lords. It’s a bit odd, but it seems to work.) Hayter says peers should pass the Hailsham amendment so that MPs can consider the agreement Dominic Grieve thought he had reached with the government. Lady Ludford, the Lib Dem Brexit spokeswoman, is speaking now. She says, if the Commons were to reject the withdrawal agreement, that would provoke a crisis. She says the Hailsham amendment will provide a guide as to what would happen next in those circumstances. Like Hailsham, she says the attacks on Dominic Grieve in the Daily Mail last week were a disgrace. She goes on: It shows the degradation of our political and media culture and discourse. Lord Pearson of Rannoch, a former Ukip leader, is speaking now. He is opposing the Hailsham amendment, but peers don’t seem very keen to hear from him and the background rumbling suggests they are eager for him to finish. He wraps up quite quickly, having argued that blocking the referendum result would be undemocratic. Lamont says it is objectionable to suggest that parliament should direct the government in the Brexit talks. And how would it direct the government? He says parliament can already express its views. He urges peers to reject the Hailsham amendment. At times Brexit just feels like a Tory family feud. Lord Lamont, the Conservative former chancellor, is speaking now. He says he is due to have Sunday lunch with Viscount Hailsham in the next few day, but he will be sitting at the far end of the table because Hailsham is so strident, he says. This is from the ITV’s Robert Peston. Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, is speaking now. He says Hailsham said he was proposing his amendment so the Commons would get the chance to vote on “Grieve II”. But the government has tabled its own amendment. That will be debated in the Commons, he says, and at that point someone can table a Grieve II-style amendment, he says. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, says Howard is wrong. The only amendments that would be allowed would be government ones. Howard disagrees. But his Tory colleague Patrick Cormack intervenes to say Smith is right, and Howard is wrong. Howard says he disagrees. Lady Boothroyd, the former Commons speaker, becomes the third person to intervene to tell Howard is understanding of the rules is wrong. Howard says that John Bercow, the current Commons speaker, is currently very keen to accept awkward amendments. Lord True, a Conservative, is speaking now. He says the public are getting fed up with the parliamentary debates on this. People outside this house and outside Parliament are getting a little bit tired of the parliamentary games and the archane language of these parliamentary discussions. They actually want to know when they are going to get Brexit, when it will be delivered and when it will be done. He says Hailsham is acting as a representative for Dominic Grieve. Grieve has been consorting with people who want to block Brexit, he says. Grieve has been taking his orders from Alastair Campbell, he says. And he says yesterday in an interview Grieve talked about collapsing the government. (That is a reference to Grieve telling the Sunday Politics: “We could collapse the government and I can assure you, I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders.”) True says, if Grieve is serious about not wanting to block Brexit, he should accept an amendment making that clear. (True is speaking because he has tabled his own amendment to Hailsham’s amendment saying any motion passed by the Commons in the event of a no deal scenario should not prevent or delay Brexit.) True says the House of Lords must not block the wishes of the people. What people voted for in the referendum must be respected, he says. He says peers must ask if they want to be party to further games that could “collapse the government”, or if they are willing to accept the compromise the government has already offered. He says, if the Hailsham amendment were passed, that could weaken the government’s negotiating position for months and months ahead. Hailsham says the government’s amendment on a “meaningful vote” said that, in the event of the Commons not agreeing a withdrawal agreement by February 15 next year, there must be a vote in the Commons on a motion “in neutral terms”. But a motion “in neutral terms” cannot be amended. That means the Commons will not be able to propose an alternative course of action, he says. He says Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, said recently the government had never used the term “meaningful vote”. That was wrong, he says. He says peers should pass his amendment so that MPs can get the chance to have their own vote on what Grieve thought he had agreed. He asks if it is right that, in the absence of an agreement, parliament should take the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU on a take note notion in neutral terms. In those circumstances, the Commons should have the authority to intervene, he says. He says Theresa May has promised a meaningful vote. That promised has not been honoured. But “Grieve II” would allow this to happen, he says. Was it wise, was it prudent, was it responsible to start the article 50 negotiations without a firm collective agreement as to where we wanted to go or how we were to get there. Was it perhaps a serious error of judgment to trigger the article 50 procedure without there being a firm policy on these matters. Is it right that in the absence of a deal parliament should risk crashing out of the EU on the basis of a take-note motion cast in neutral terms and as a result of the unconstrained decisions of ministers. Hailsham says he has known Dominic Grieve for years. Grieve is a man of integrity, he says. Hailsham says the attacks on Grieve in the Daily Mail last week were “disgraceful”. The authors should be ashamed of themselves, he says. Viscount Hailsham (better known as Douglas Hogg, the former Conservative MP) is speaking now. He says he is proposing F3, which he says he will describe as “Grieve II”. A copy of it is here (pdf). Hailsham says he wants to give peers the chance to vote on the proposal for the Commons to have a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit withdrawal agreement that Dominic Grieve thought he had negotiated as a compromise with Downing Street. Grieve entered talks after agreeing to pull his original amendment (“Grieve I”) during the debate on Tuesday last week. But at the last minute the government ditched Grieve II, and tabled an alternative “compromise” (which wasn’t really a compromise because Grieve said it was unacceptable). In the House of Lords peers are now debating motion F, relating to the “meaningful vote” amendments. Natalie Evans, the leader of the Lords, says it would be wrong to have parliament taking charge of the Brexit negotiations. She says Dominic Grieve himself said in a TV interview yesterday that giving parliament the power to tell the government what it must do would be going too far. She explains the new government amendment, set out here (pdf), amendment F. Turning back to Theresa May’s health spending announcment, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a note by Carl Emmerson and Thomas Pope about what the government is planning. It includes this passage explaining why a “Brexit dividend” will not fund the increase. First, and most importantly, according to the official forecasts (accepted by the government), Brexit worsens rather than improves the public finances. In November 2016, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR, the government’s official forecaster) estimated that, due to economic growth being forecast to be lower than it would otherwise have been, the Brexit vote reduced tax forecast tax revenues to the tune of £15 billion in 2020–21.[3] This outweighs the UK’s net contribution to the EU by a substantial margin, and means less, rather than more money for the NHS and other services. Second, the OBR assesses that in the short- to medium-term the UK will continue to make large payments as a result of the ‘divorce settlement’. After taking this into account, the amount left over for spending elsewhere is relatively small (calculated to be £5.8 billion in 2022–23).[4] Third, even this overstates the extra amount to spend on the NHS, because part of this may be used to replace EU spending that would otherwise no longer take place in the UK, with agriculture the largest single element of spending currently amounting to around £3 billion per year alone. The IFS also says that freezing tax allowances - which is said to be the Treasury’s preferred option for raising money to fund this plan - would raise £3.5bn. But the government needs to raise £21bn to pay for what May has announced, the IFS says. This note helps to explain today’s Times splash. Here is an extract from Sam Coates’s story. The deal was concluded late on Friday afternoon by Mrs May, Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England. However, sources said that the meeting broke up without agreement on where significant chunks of cash would come from. “By the end of the meeting, some sources of funding had been more heavily pencilled in than others,” a ministerial source said. Plans to raise money from freezing all personal allowance and national insurance thresholds at the end of the parliament, revealed in The Times last week, remain leading options and would raise nearly £4bn. Borrowing could account for £8bn to £10bn. Plans put forward to defer corporation tax rate cuts, delivering £6bn, were not signed off. Ministers now hope that the Office for Budget Responsibility will upgrade growth in the budget, reducing the necessary borrowing and tax rises, but the plans remain underfunded by up to £11bn. The UK government will this week unveil the first details of the “settled status” immigration scheme that will apply to Britain’s 3.4 million EU citizens if they want to stay in the country after Brexit, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports. The European commission has published a paper (pdf) on its proposals for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters after Brexit. Here are three slides illustrating EU objections to the UK’s offer. MS means member states. The EU is accusing the UK of wanting the “same rights” as EU member states, but “different constraints” - or cherry picking, as the EU normally call it. Dan Poulter, a Conservative former health minister who has supported the Caldwell family, just told me: Given the strong evidence supporting the medicinal use of cannabis, there is no reason why it should not be available for doctors to prescribe, as may be appropriate to our patients. Children like Billy Caldwell have suffered long enough and the only humane thing to do is recognise that property prescribed medicinal cannabis is a medicine just like any other. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, has written an open letter to Sajid Javid, the home secretary, saying he lost a son to intractable epilepsy and that he thinks doctors should be able to prescribe cannabis oil for use by patients with this condition. In the Commons Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, says the current rules on medicinal cannabis are “not fit for purpose”. Earlier she released a statement saying: A number of recent heart breaking cases have highlighted a failure of government policy. Children have been put at risk and experienced extraordinary suffering because this government drags its heels and refuses to grant cannabis oil licences. This must not continue. Labour in government will allow the legal prescription of cannabis oil for medical purposes. We will also review drugs policy to address all issues of public health. The government should stop being so heavy-handed and bureaucratic and put the welfare of children first. In response Hurd said that when Labour was in office it did “the square root of very little” on this issue. Chris Leslie said he had “not given up on the Labour party” as he spoke at the lunchtime launch of his pamphlet Common Ground at a Social Market Foundation event also attended by Chuka Umunna and Liz Kendall. The former shadow chancellor and Corbyn critic said that he was spelling out the “values that the Labour party needs to adopt if it wants to get back into government” in a 25,000 word document that was clearly ranged against the party’s leadership. But Leslie denied that he was prepared to quit Labour or start organising for a new party. “There is no point pretending that things are not difficult in the Labour party at the moment,” the Nottingham East MP said, but added: “This is not a manifesto for a new group.” The MP highlighted six centrist values that he said were “characteristic of British mainstream opinion”. They ranged from fair play, including a crack down on “anti-social corporate behaviour”; an emphasis on acting with responsibility both within the UK and internationally; plus a call to act on “evidence not ideology” because “experts matter”. Others on his list of pledges included an emphasis on representative democracy in which MPs act as “deliberative representatives” who use their judgement to take decisions rather than act as mere delegates in a response to the Brexit debate, coupled with a related attack on populism in which he suggested that anonymity in social media should be banned. Leslie concluded with a plea to focus “on 21st century challenges” by, for example, offering every working person a six month mid-career sabbatical to retrain as needed. In the Commons the Home Office minister Nick Hurd is answering an urgent question about medical cannabis and the Billy Caldwell case. He has just announced the establishment of an expert panel to advise ministers on when medicinal cannabis products should be allowed. Home Office setting up expert panel to advise when medicinal cannabis products should be allowed, MPs told. In the Commons Janet Daby, the new Labour MP for Lewisham East, has just taken her seat. Peers have just started their debate on the EU withdrawal bill. They are debating the Commons amendments to the bill passed last week. You can read all the latest amendments here (pdf). And the last-minute meaningful vote one tabled by Viscount Hailsham (see 11.17am), known as “Grieve II”, is here (pdf). Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, opened the debate by urging peers to accept all the government amendments passed in the Commons. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, is speaking now. She says the Lords should not embark on “ping pong” (sending a bill back to the Commons with changes, after the Commons has already rejected those changes) lightly. But it should be willing to send a bill back where the position in the Commons is unresolved (ie, on the “meaningful vote” issue). The first debate is on amendment A (which relates to the customs union). Smith says she does not think peers should send their version of this back to the Commons. The key vote will come when we get to amendment F, which is where the Hailsham amendment has been listed. Stephen Pound, the shadow Northern Ireland minister, filmed a message at the weekend backing a “people’s vote” Brexit. This is taken as referring to a second referendum, which is what the People’s Vote campaign is calling for. But Labour does not favour a second referendum and, as PoliticsHome reports, Pound has now issued a clarification, saying what he actually wants is a “meaningful vote” in parliament. Last month Preet Gill, a shadow international development minister, experienced a similar rethink after speaking out in favour of a second referendum. And this is from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, The money announced today by the prime minister is not enough to save our NHS after eight years of Conservative austerity. Although she confirmed the current situation is not sustainable, today’s figures represent little more than a standstill in funding, according to experts. People are waiting longer and in pain because of Tory cuts to the NHS. The prime minister couldn’t say today when this will improve and waiting lists will come down. She also confirmed that social care, capital spending and public health will not see any increase as a result of today’s announcement. If the Conservatives do manage to publish the detail of their insufficient 3.4% increase, then Labour’s fully costed plans to raise taxes for the top 5% and big business will top up NHS spending growth to around the 5% which is needed. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who was in the audience where Theresa May was delivering her speech. In the comments Stanley Caleb asked about how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could benefit from Theresa May’s NHS announcement. May was talking about plans for NHS England. She addressed this in her speech. She said: I have focused today on the NHS in England because that is the responsibility of the UK government. It is the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales – and when sitting again, Northern Ireland – which have responsibility for the NHS in their parts of the UK. But because the UK government is increasing NHS spending in England, extra money will go to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula, which ensures every part of the UK gets a fair share of public spending. While it is up to the devolved administrations to spend the money as they see fit, I believe everyone in the UK should benefit from this extra funding for the NHS. So I urge the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales to use this money to improve the NHS – and to develop their own long-term plans for NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. Here are the main points from Theresa May’s Q&amp;A. Theresa May defended the current restrictions on the use of medicinal cannabis and played down suggestions that a wide-ranging review of legislation in this area is underway. Asked if she favoured changing the law, she replied: It is possible for medicinal cannabis to be used. But what we need to ensure is that we’re listening to clinicians, we are listening to people as we do that. Do we need to look at these cases and consider what we’ve got in place? Yes. But I think what needs to drive us in all of these cases is actually what clinicians are saying about these issues. Of course, there’s a very good reason why we’ve got a set of rules around drugs, and around cannabis and other drugs - because of the impact of that they have on people’s lives. And we must never forget that. But we already have an ability for licences to be granted in relation to medicinal cannabis. Do we need to make sure that’s right and able to be dealing with cases when we need to? Yes we do. And, when pressed as to whether a review was actually underway, she replied: We are looking at whether we have the right process for ensuring that we can licence these drugs when clinicians feel that they should be licensed. May’s comments put her at odds with Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, who told the Today programme this morning that the current restrictions could not be justified. (See 10.26am.) Hunt said: I don’t think anyone who followed that story [the Billy Caldwell story] could sensibly say that we are getting the law on this kind of thing right. May was arguing that the current laws are acceptable and implying that any fresh look at how they work (she would not use the term “review”) would lead to little or no change. May rejected claims that the “Brexit dividend” does not exist. When asked about this, she said: On the “Brexit dividend”, look, it’s very simple. We are not going to be sending the vast amount of money every year to the EU that we spend at the moment on the EU as a member of the European Union. That money will be coming back, and we will be spending it on our priorities, and the NHS is our number one priority. She confirmed that people would have to pay more tax to fund the extra money for the NHS. But the government wanted go “listen” to people about what form the tax rise might take, she said. I said as a country we will need to contribute a bit more. Taxpayers will need to contribute a bit more. But we will do that in a fair and balanced way. And we want to listen to people about who we do that. Q: When can patients expect to see an improvement as a result of this new money? May says A&amp;E was under significant pressure this winter. The government wants to see improvements here, and in other areas too. She says this plan will be led by the NHS, not just by politicians. And that’s it. The speech and Q&amp;A are over. I will post a summary soon. According to the Spectator’s James Forsyth, Theresa May blocked a discussion on changing the rules on medicinal cannabis at this morning’s cabinet meeting. Q: [From the Daily Mail] Will you scrap NHS car parking charges? May says guidance has been issued to hospitals relating to car parking charges. Q: You believe in politicians keeping their promises. Should John Bercow keep the promise he made when elected as speaker to stand down this summer? May says what Bercow does is a matter for Bercow. Q: Is there a review into the law on medicinal cannabis? And do you back changing the law? May says it is currently possible for medicinal cannabis to be used. Do we need to look at these cases? Yes. But what should drive government is what clinicians are saying, she says. She says there are good reasons why there are laws around drugs, because of the impact they have on people’s lives. May says the chancellor will set out all the details of how the increase will be funded in due course. On the EU withdrawal bill, she says she hopes “everybody” will see that, as the government keeps faith with people who voted to leave the EU, it is important to ensure parliament cannot tie the hands of the government in negotiation and overturn the referendum. Q: Are you telling people to pay more tax? And do you accept it is misleading to speak of a Brexit dividend when experts say there will be less money around? May says taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more. She said that in the speech, she says. On the Brexit dividend, she says it is simple: the UK will not be sending vast amounts to the EU every year, so it can be spend on UK priorities, and those priorities are the NHS. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart. And this is from the Times’ Sam Coates. May is still speaking. She says the long-term plan for the NHS must include plans for mental health, which she says is a personal priority for her. In her speech May repeated a claim she made yesterday, about how much of the Labour extra spending on health allegedly did not benefit patients. (See 12.57pm.) Tony Blair has responded with a lengthy statement saying that May’s claim shows she does not know who the NHS works. He said: The prime minister said today that nearly half of Labour’s record increase in investment in the NHS during the last Labour government was not spent on patients. I simply don’t know what she means by that. But if the implication is that, because significant investment went on increased numbers of staff, including nurses and doctors, better pay and a huge uplift in hospital building and NHS facilities, this is not money spent on patients, it shows how little this government understands the NHS and its challenges. This investment was absolutely necessary to deliver the significant cuts we saw in waiting lists and waiting times and the dramatically improved results in cancer and cardiac care the new Labour government oversaw, resulting in some of the highest patient satisfaction levels ever seen. All of which, of course, have slid into reverse under this Conservative government. This programme of investment and reform was supported by a clear and specific increase in national insurance – unlike the plans announced today which appear to be dependent on mystery tax increases and a mythical Brexit dividend the IFS confirms cannot fund the extra spending. May says she wants to the UK to be at the forefront of the revolution on how AI (artificial intelligence) can transform healthcare. She has set a target for increasing the number of people diagnosed with cancer by AI. May says the 10-year plan for the NHS must involve a comprehensive plan for the workforce. The workforce needs to be more flexible, she says. She says the government will increase the number of staff in areas where there are most pressures. It will see what can be done to encourage people back into frontline jobs. And the tier 2 rules restricting the hiring of foreign doctors are being abandoned with immediate effect. But she says the NHS also has to reduce its reliance on doctors from countries where medical staff are in short supply. May says up to one third of people in hospital stay longer than necessary because the right care is not available for them at home. But, for someone aged 80, 10 days of bed rest in hospital has the same affect as 10 years of ageing, she says. May says at its best the NHS is world class. But it has been a challenge to spread that best practice, he says. She says NHS leaders told her that was because, if they innovated, they felt as if they were going against the grain. She says, an Aneurin Bevan said at the second reading of the NHS bill, the intention was to “universalise the best”. She says she wants to reward those who deliver the best, and hold people to account when they don’t. May says the NHS must produce a plan to improve efficiency. This must be a plan that ensures every penny is well spent. It must be a plan that tackles waste, reduces bureaucracy and eliminates unacceptable variation, with all these efficiency savings reinvested back into patient care. It must be a plan that makes better use of capital investment to modernise its buildings and invest in technology to drive productivity improvements. It must be a plan that enjoys the support of NHS staff across the country – not something dreamt up in Whitehall and centrally imposed. But NHS leaders at national and local level must then be held to account for their role in delivering this plan. May says the government must get more efficiency from the NHS in return for the extra funding. She says that, when Labour put more money into the NHS after raising national insurance in 2002, too much of that money did not go on patient care. May accuses Labour of increasing NHS spending without patients getting all the benefit. May says the government will also come forward with plans to put social care on a sustainable footing. May says some of the money will come from no longer having to pay the annual subscription payment to the EU. That is the Brexit dividend, she says. But she says that taxpayers will also have to pay more. The government will keep to its fiscal responsibility rules, she says. May turns to funding. It is clear more money is needed, she says. She says the NHS needs to be able to plan for the future. In the past increases have been inconsistent, changing from one year to the next. She says the government will do more than give the NHS a one-off increase. And she reads out the figures briefed overnight. See 12.40pm. May says care has improved. The number of staff recommending their service for their own family has never been higher. And it has been described as the best in the world. But the demands facing the NHS are growing. People are living longer, she says. More treatments are available. And problems like malnutrition, and loneliness, which is bad for health, are growing. She says patients can be confronted by a hard-to-navigate system. Some hospitals are world-leading, she says. But others aren’t. May says she wants to talk about how the NHS preserves the values of fairness embedded in it. It was the crowning achievement of the post-war Attlee government, she says. But she says it does not belong to one party. It was proposed by the wartime coalition government, she says. She says it has been under the stewardship of Tory government for 43 years and Labour ones for 27 years. May says she has also seen what the NHS has done for others, and she talks about visiting a hospital in Manchester after the bombing at the Manchester Arena last year. I will never forget visiting the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack. There, in the face of the very worst that humanity can do, I witnessed first-hand, the very best. Doctors and nurses working 24 hour shifts to treat the injured. Surgeons who were off-shift, dropping everything to come in and perform life-saving operations. Paramedics who had risked their own lives to get others to safety. In every instance, I was struck not only by the medical expertise of the staff, but the compassion with which people were treated. This is our National Health Service. Theresa May is speaking now. She says people know the NHS is there for them when they need it. From life-saving treatment to managing a life-changing condition - whoever we are, whatever our means, we know the NHS is there for us when we need it. It was there for me when I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I will never forget the support - not just of my GP and consultants - but also the clinical nurse specialists attached to my local hospital. Their advice was critical: enabling me to adjust to the new treatment regime, to manage my condition, and minimise the impact it has on my life. I would not be doing the job I am doing today without that support. Theresa May is about to start her speech. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Downing Street released some excerpts from Theresa May’s speech overnight. Here is an extract from their news release. On funding, the prime minister will say that the government’s investment is about making sure the NHS can plan for the future with ambition and confidence, setting out that funding will grow on average by 3.4% in real terms each year from 2019/20 to 2023/24. The government’s commitment to making sure this money goes to the frontline and to improve patient care is illustrated by the fact the PM has set aside an additional £1.25bn each year to cover specific pensions pressure on top of the settlement. She will say: By 2023/24 the NHS budget will increase by over £20bn in real terms compared with today. That means it will be £394m a week higher in real terms. So the NHS will be growing significantly faster than the economy as a whole, reflecting the fact that the NHS is this government’s number one spending priority. This money will be provided specifically for the NHS. And it will be funded in a responsible way. The Press Association has snapped this. Legislation to ban upskirting is to be adopted as a government bill, with a second reading in the Commons before the summer break in July, Downing Street said. The government will introduce its own bill to ban upskirting, Downing Street said today. This is from the Conservative MP Neil O’Brien, a former Treasury special adviser. There is speculation that freezing tax allowances will be the tax increase (it amounts to a tax increase, because people pay more as a result) that funds the extra money for the NHS. Theresa May is about to deliver her NHS speech. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. There will be a statement from Jeremy Hunt in the Commons today after 3.30pm about health spending. The Green MP Caroline Lucas has tweeted a pictures of the knickers outside Sir Christopher Chope’s door. (See 11.51am.) My colleague Peter Walker says the Conservative MP Sir Chrisopher Chope has a surprise waiting for him when he arrives at his Commons office today. The family of a politician found dead following groping allegations are considering a High Court challenge to the independent inquiry into his sacking, the Press Association reports. Welsh Assembly member Carl Sargeant, 49, was found dead at his home in Connah’s Quay, North Wales, on November 7 last year. His death came four days after he was removed from his role as cabinet secretary for communities and children by Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones. The father-of-two was suspended from the Labour Party over allegations of “unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping”. He was not told the details of what he was accused of and was unable to properly defend himself, his family said. An independent inquiry into the handling of Mr Sargeant’s sacking is still to be held by the Welsh Government in Cardiff. But today’s Sargeant’s family said they have been excluded and will challenge the process in court if they have to, the Press Association reports. The family say the procedures and rules, or operational protocol, set by civil servants in the Welsh Government with inquiry chairman Paul Bowen QC, are “deeply unsatisfactory”. Neil Hudgell, representing the Sargeant family, said: The grieving Sargeant family are losing patience and faith in the inquiry and are hurt and upset that everything they have asked for has been ignored. While the family take at face value Mr Bowen’s assurances that he will carry out a fair and independent investigation, they do not believe the protocol allows for it. The permanent secretary, acting on behalf of the first minister, has refused to allow the family to have their own legal representation at the inquiry, meaning they will be unable to have a barrister cross-examine any of the witnesses. I have written to both Paul Bowen and the permanent secretary to advise them that we believe the decision-making in relation to the protocol to be unreasonable and we will challenge it by way of a judicial review in the High Court if we have to. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem deputy prime minister, criticised Theresa May for refusing to relax the law on the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes when she was home secretary and they were in government together in the coalition. He told the programme: It is pathetic - and I saw it for myself in government - this bone-headed triumph of prejudice over evidence. The active substance in these cannabis-derived medicines is less harmful than stuff you can get across the counter from a chemist. When I was in government, I certainly couldn’t get Theresa May and the Home Office and indeed other parts of the government to just address the evidence. That poor mother is finding herself in this heartbreaking situation because politicians can’t separate off the issue of medicinal cannabis to help her child from their wider prejudice about drugs generally. In the comments BTL some people have been asking for more information about the supposed “Brexit dividend”. Here are three articles explaining some of the context. A Fullfact blog explaining why the claim leaving the EU would save £350m a week was misleading. Toby Helm’s article in the Observer saying why Theresa May’s Brexit dividend claim is so contentious. A post about how the Office for Budget Responsibility says that, even by 2022-23, there will be no “Brexit bonus” for the NHS because the government has already committed to spending the money it will save when the UK leaves the EU compensating those who will lose out (eg, farmers). The action in the Lords tonight is likely to squeak in just before the England game - with the key motion on the “meaningful vote” voted on around 6.30pm. There has been another last-minute amendment - one based on the compromise Tory rebels believed they had secured with the prime minister - before they say they were double-crossed. Viscount Hailsham, the former Conservative cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, had already tabled Dominic Grieve’s original compromise amendment which he attempted, but failed, to get debated in the Commons last week. That Grieve amendment had the controversial “clause C” which Brexiters and ministers objected to; it said that if there is no prospect of a Brexit deal by February 15, then within five days the government must consult parliament “and must follow any direction in relation to negotiations.” Ministers and many MPs were nervous about the idea of parliament being able to “direct” the government and May bought off the rebels last week with a promise that Clause C would be discussed to find an agreeable wording. Grieve and his supporters believed they have reached a compromise over the wording late on Thursday, but the government amendment then tabled in the Lords promised an unamendable vote on a neutral motion, which would not stop a “no deal” Brexit. Grieve said the wording had been changed at the last minute and called the government amendment “unacceptable.” Now Hailsham will table yet another amendment. This new wording, which Lords sources are calling “Grieve II” will be based on the compromise the rebels thought they had on Thursday night. Hailsham is expected to withdraw his other amendment so this will be the crucial vote, and is expected to comfortably pass through the Lords. That will mean it will be back on the table for the Commons on Wednesday. The government amendment is highly likely to be defeated, and may be withdrawn. There are two other interesting matters for debate in the Lords today. Lord Pannick is expected to push again for the EU charter of fundamental rights to form part of the EU Withdrawal bill. And Labour Lords Brexit spokeswoman Dianne Hayter will push for more guarantees on workers rights and equality. Both will be looking to get some firmer commitments from Lords ministers at the despatch box. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is in Geneva today. As the most prominent figure in the Vote Leave campaign, he has always been one of the main champions of the Vote Leave bus claim that leaving the EU could free up £350m per week for spending on the NHS and this morning he welcomed Theresa May’s claim about the existence of this “Brexit dividend”. As reported on Sky, he said: Yes, I think it is, as the prime minister has rightly said, a downpayment on future receipts that will come to this country as a result of discontinuing payments to Brussels. This is the same formula that Johnson used in a tweet yesterday. Johnson is insisting that there will be a “Brexit dividend” in the future. But, by using the word “downpayment”, he seems to be conceding that the money announced at the weekend will not come from a “Brexit dividend” (because even those who believe such a thing exists accept it will not come onstream until 2021, after the transition, at the very earliest.) Downpayment implies money from a difference source, in expectation of payment later. This means that we’ve reached the odd position where what Number 10 and Theresa May are saying about the “Brexit dividend” (see 9.26am) is arguably even more misleading than what Boris Johnson is now saying about it. As a reminder, this is what May said yesterday on the Andrew Marr Show. She said: Some people may remember seeing a figure on the side of a bus a while back of £350million a week in cash. I can tell you that what I’m announcing will mean that in 2023-24 there will be about £600million a week, more in cash, going into the NHS. Of course we’ve got to fund that. That will be through the Brexit dividend, the fact that we’re no longer sending vast amounts of money every year to the EU once we leave the EU. And we as a country will be contributing a bit more. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, gave various interviews this morning. Here are the main points he made. Hunt admitted that the “Brexit dividend” would not be “anything like enough” to fund the £20bn extra for the NHS promised by the prime minister. (See 9.26am.) He said that the experts who have challenged the existence of the “Brexit dividend” had been wrong in the past in their forecasts about the economy. The experts say the dividend does not exist because the negative impact of Brexit on growth will more than compensate, in lost tax revenue to the exchequer, for the savings from money not having to be paid into the EU budget. But Hunt suggested growth after Brexit could be much better than expected. He said: There is debate between the thinktanks and the forecasters over what is going to happen with economic growth over the next five to 10 years. And one thing we should be clear about is those forecasts have often proved to be wrong ... In fact the British economy has been much more resilient over the last few years. Last week we had record employment figures. But Hunt also said the money promised for the NHS was not conditional on growth outperforming expectations. This commitment that we’re making is not conditional on this or that outcome on economic growth. We are making a firm commitment to the NHS for the next five years. He said taxes would rise to fund the extra NHS investment. He refused to give details, but he said: A lot of thinking has gone on at the Treasury to make absolutely sure this can be afforded. We are clear that there will be an increased burden of taxation. But he also claimed that the Conservatives were still committed to the promise in their 2017 manifesto to lower taxes. The manifesto said: “It is our firm intention to reduce taxes on Britain’s businesses and working families ... We want to reduce taxes on British businesses and working families.” Asked about this, Hunt said: We will honour manifesto commitments. But we also recognise our number one priority as far as public services is concerned is the NHS. Hunt said details of where the money would come from would be set out in the budget in the autumn. We will be able to explain exactly where every penny is coming from but we will do that in the Budget. Why are we not doing it now? We do know - the Treasury has done its sums, it hasn’t made its final decisions but it is very clear this can be affordable. The reason why we are not spelling it out now is because we want to give the NHS six months to come up with a really good 10-year plan. When we have that plan in November, we will say ‘This is a great plan, we accept that it is going to lead to improvements in cancer care and mental health and so on’. He said the government would also announce plans to improve the funding of social care. This could involve people being incentivised to save for their own care, he said: We all need to make better provision for our own social care ... than we do at the moment. We are going to have to find a way of making it easy for people to do the right thing and to save for the long term, to make additional contributions so we have that security we need in the social care system. There are numerous different ways we could do that, but we will put those choices to the British people and have that debate. This sounded a bit like a plan to revive the Dilnot commission proposal from 2011 to impose a cap on the maximum amount that people might have to pay for their own care, with a view to encouraging insurers to start providing policies so that people can insure themselves against the cost of needing care in their old age. He said the law banning the medicinal use of cannabis could not be justified. Asked about the case of Billy Caldwell, who was only allowed the cannabis oil he needs for his epilepsy after a Home Office U-turn, Hunt said: I don’t think anyone who followed that story could sensibly say that we are getting the law on this kind of thing right. I think everyone feels for the lady concerned, and of course there are many, many other people in that situation. Hunt said the Home Office was reviewing the law on this. We have to do something, we have to do it quickly. I think it is unfair to say Sajid [Javid, the home secretary] didn’t act quickly in the situation. He has released that oil for that child. We are going to go through this process as quickly as we possibly can, because, like everyone, we think these stories are totally heartbreaking. The Home Office are not dragging their feet on this. The home secretary has said he will review this issue. It does take time, because we’ve got to not only look at the law, we’ve got to look at the clinical evidence and make sure there are no unintended consequences. But I think we all know that we need to find a different way. Here is my colleague Peter Walker’s morning story from Jeremy Hunt’s morning interviews. As he reports, Hunt conceded that having a Brexit dividend to partly finance an increase in NHS spending will depend on the economy outstripping forecasts, as he pledged the £20bn in extra annual funding would be provided even if this did not happen. After Theresa May announced her £20bn spending increase for the NHS yesterday, Downing Street posted a series of infographics about it on Twitter, including this one. For those who believe that the “Brexit dividend” is about as real as the Loch Ness Monster (that’s most experts, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the leading public spending thinktank, and the Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasting body that provides the numbers that underpin government policy), this one was particularly provocative, implying, as it does that the “Brexit dividend” will cover most of the cost, and that any tax increases also needed will just be marginal. This morning Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has been giving interviews. He stuck to the Number 10 line about the “Brexit dividend” actually existing, but he was much more candid than the prime minister has been about how tax increases will have to fund the bulk of the increase. He told the BBC: One [of the sources of extra money for the NHS] ... is the fact that we won’t be paying subscriptions to Brussels by the end of this period. But that alone won’t be anything like enough, so there will also be more resourcing through the taxation system, and also through economic growth. (Hunt’s claim that “economic growth” would help raise the money also sounded optimistic. UK growth at the moment is, by historical standards and by comparison with competitor economies, dismal. At the spring statement the OBR did not forecast growth getting above 1.5% in any year for the next five years. In the past, 2% growth was just average.) I will post more from Hunt’s various interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. (Cabinet is normally on a Tuesday, but this week it’s been brought forward a day.” 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. Lunchtime: Theresa May delivers her NHS speech. 1pm: The Labour MP Chris Leslie gives a speech on the future of the political centre to the Social Market Foundation. 3pm: Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the NHS contract with Capita After 3.30pm: Peers debate the Commons amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. They are expected to defeat the government by inserting a new “meaningful vote” amendment into the bill. After 3.30pm: MPs hold an emergency debate on the Sewel convention. 4.45pm: Rail bosses give evidence to the Commons transport committee about the chaos caused by the recent timetable changes. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day.

Against a backdrop of Trump’s open baiting of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, over immigration and her domestic difficulties, Jens Stoltenberg has called for all Nato members to work to avoid a disastrous breakdown in western unity. Writing in the Guardian, Nato’s secretary general admits that “political storm clouds” are putting a strain on the ties that bind the Nato allies. But, in an appeal to leaders before the military alliance’s summit in July, the former prime minister of Norway says that “where differences persist, we must limit any negative impact on our security cooperation”. Stoltenberg – who is meeting Theresa May in Downing Street on Thursday as he prepares for the summit in Brussels – writes: “Since the alliance was created almost 70 years ago, the people of Europe and North America have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. But, at the political level, the ties which bind us are under strain. “There are real differences between the United States and other allies over issues such as trade, climate change and the Iran nuclear agreement. “These disagreements are real and they won’t disappear overnight. In fact, nowhere is it written in stone that the transatlantic bond will always thrive. That doesn’t, however, mean that its breakdown is inevitable. We can maintain it, and all the mutual benefits we derive from it.” Stoltenberg’s intervention comes at a point of extreme tension among the leadership of the western powers. In seeking to defend his administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the country’s border, Trump launched an extraordinary attack on Merkel and the EU on Tuesday, likening Europe to a “migrant camp” while claiming that “the people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition”. Merkel is embroiled in a tense standoff with her interior minister over immigration. She faces a two-week deadline to find a European solution or risk the collapse of her governing coalition. Trump has already caused a fracture in relations with traditional US allies by reneging on his country’s commitments in both the Paris climate change agreement and the nuclear deal with Iran. He is also threatening a transatlantic trade war with the EU, and has criticised Germany and others for not spending enough on defence and freeloading off the US. Of the 29 Nato members, only eight, including the US and the UK, spend more than 2% of their GDP on defence, a threshold that the alliance agreed should be met by all the countries by 2024. Germany spent €37bn (£32.5bn), or 1.2% of GDP, on defence last year. Asked for his position last month on those countries underspending, Trump warned: “They’ll be dealt with.” Greater “burden sharing” is set to be a theme of the Nato summit in Brussels, along with Stoltenberg’s desire to improve the readiness of Nato forces to deploy in quick order, and to build on the alliance’s counter-terrorism efforts, including through the training of the Iraqi military and an extension of financing for Afghan forces until 2024. However, as with the last summit, it is likely that it will be Trump’s determination to highlight the heavy burden on the US taxpayer that will dominate. Stoltenberg praises the US under Trump for its renewed commitment to Nato, an organisation that the US president once described as obsolete. But he points out that cuts in defence spending among the Nato allies have been reversed across the board. An extra $18bn (£13.6bn) has been spent by non-US Nato allies on military equipment alone since 2014. Stoltenberg writes: “The United States and Canada are stepping up their commitment to Europe’s security. In fact, since coming to office, the Trump administration has increased funding for the US presence in Europe by 40%. The last US battle tank left Europe in 2013 but now they’re back in the form of a whole new US armoured brigade. “This isn’t a one-way street. European allies, with the UK in the vanguard, are stepping up too – spending billions more on defence and taking responsibility for Euro-Atlantic security alongside their North American allies.” Stoltenberg, who will meet the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday before meeting the prime minister and giving a speech at Lancaster House on Thursday, says the US and its allies need to raise their heads from the current divisions and recognise the need for unity at a dangerous point in world history. He writes: “It is – and has always been – in our fundamental interest to stand together on defence. And that is as true now as ever. Because we face the most unpredictable security environment in a generation: international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyber-attacks – and, of course, a Russia which has used force against its neighbours, which tries to meddle in our domestic affairs, and which seems to have no qualms about using military-grade nerve agents on our streets. “Our achievements side-by-side are unprecedented. So as long as we stand together, even if the road does indeed get rough, it will always lead in the right direction: peace and security for our nations and our nearly 1 billion citizens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/18/thomas-markle-prince-harry-donald-trump-chance-meghan","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T08:25:11Z","webTitle":"Thomas Markle says Prince Harry told him 'give Trump a chance’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/thomas-markle-prince-harry-donald-trump-chance-meghan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/thomas-markle-prince-harry-donald-trump-chance-meghan","fields":{"headline":"Thomas Markle says Prince Harry told him 'give Trump a chance’","bodyText":"Prince Harry called for Donald Trump to be “given a chance” his father-in-law has revealed in his first broadcast interview. Thomas Markle told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he was angry about something Trump had done when he spoke by phone to Harry for the first time last year. “I’ve always have a bad attitude about Donald Trump and that’s never going to change,” he said. “My God, I’ve got to apologise to the rest of the world for my president. All Harry actually did was say because Trump was new, he said: ‘Give him a chance.’” Markle speculated that his son-in-law may have since changed his attitude to the president. “I think Harry has probably changed his mind by now – I certainly hope he has,” he said. Markle’s remarks underline the controversy of Trump’s visit to the UK next month. The prospect of an awkward meeting between Trump and the Queen was delayed after an invitation for an official state visit was postponed. Asked what Harry thought about Brexit, Markle said: “He said he was open to it. He didn’t know one way or another, he was just saying he had to be open to it, and see how it went. That’s pretty much what’s his attitude. This is just conversation between two guys about politics nothing cast in stone, just the way you talk.” He added: “It was just a loose conversation about something we have to try. There was no real commitment to it … I think he was open to the experiment.” Markle also spoke of his disappointment at missing his daughter Meghan’s wedding last month while he was recovering from heart surgery. He said he planned to mention his phonecall with Harry in a speech he had prepared for the wedding. “The speech actually had the phone calls that I talked about … And how Meghan introduced him as this nice guy from England, this prince. And then I went on to thank the royal family for opening up to my child. That would have been the speech.“Watching it was difficult for me because I wasn’t there, but at the same time I’m watching my daughter being watched by the entire world and I couldn’t have been more proud. “And, like I said, Charles – how could I asked for a better replacement? I was thrilled to tears that he was doing that for me. I just wish it had been my hand holding my daughter, not his.” He said he accepted “full responsibility” for his behaviour in the run-up to the wedding when speculation about his attendance threatened to overshadow the event. He said: “I can say I’m sorry for those things for the rest of my life. I’m paying for those things for the rest of my life. Like I say, I’m a footnote rather than the dad that walked his girl down the aisle. I have to live with that for the rest of my life.” Markle said it was “long overdue” that someone mixed-race had joined the royal family: “I think there shouldn’t be any colour barriers anywhere any more. I think it is an improvement on the royal family. It’s an improvement for England.” And he defended Meghan for only inviting her mother from her family to the wedding. He said: “Some 40,50, 60 Markles came out of the woodwork all asking for invitations to the wedding. Meghan probably had the good sense to invite none because she would have offended the others … I applauded her for it.” Markle said he was looking forward to meeting his new relations in London soon. “I would love to meet the Queen. I’ve had respect for that woman since I was a child,” he said. “I think she is one of the most incredible women in the world and I would love to meet her.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jun/18/uk-economy-weak-growth-brexit-trade-wars-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T16:33:44Z","webTitle":"UK facing weakest growth since 2009; Audi CEO arrested over dieselgate scandal - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/18/uk-economy-weak-growth-brexit-trade-wars-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jun/18/uk-economy-weak-growth-brexit-trade-wars-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK facing weakest growth since 2009; Audi CEO arrested over dieselgate scandal - as it happened","bodyText":"Investors have been rattled by the escalation of the trade dispute between the US and China, pushing stock markets lower once more. On top of that come concerns about the political situation in Germany, with the issue of immigration putting pressure on the country’s coalition government. But signs of optimism over the issue has seen markets come off their worst levels. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down just 0.03% or 2.58 points at 7631.33 Germany’s Dax dropped 1.36% to 12,834.11 France’s Cac closed down 0.93% at 5450.48 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.41% to 22,099.27 Spain’s Ibex ended 0.83% lower at 9769.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 168 points or 0.67%. Elsewhere, on a quiet day for corporate and economic news, Britain’s bosses warned the UK economy was facing its weakest growth since 2009, a bigger UK challenger bank emerged as Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group took over Virgin Money, and the boss of VW’s Audi division was arrested following the Dieselgate scandal. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global markets have started the week on a weak footing, as trade fears continue to play the primary role in determining market sentiment. With both the US and China set to impose a raft of tariffs on 6 July, there is likely to be an increasingly unstable and anxious market environment as we progress towards that deadline.... However, equally as important is the huge uncertainty we are seeing build in Germany, with Angela Merkel clashing with the leader of their coalition partner (CSU) over her stance on immigration. It is no doubt that immigration remains Merkel’s Achilles heel, and with the chancellor desperate to maintain a coalition to maintain her dominance over German politics, markets are understandably jittery at the thought of any political upheaval in the biggest economy in Europe. Markets are still in the red, amid US-China trade fears and worries about the political situation in Germany. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Things got pretty ugly after the US open, the Dow Jones following in the footsteps of its Eurozone peers by posting some heavy losses. The Dow plunged 240 points as the session got underway, a sharp decline that took it back below 24850 and to its worst price in 12 days. The index is struggling under the weight of the escalating US-China trade war, with Trump’s decision to push forward with tariffs on Beijing last Friday causing another nasty flare-up of international posturing. The Eurozone indices, softened up by the trade war stuff, found themselves incredibly susceptible to the political problems in Germany, with the clash between the CDU and CSU bloodying the region’s trading rooms. The DAX dropped 1.8%, wiping out the post-ECB growth seen last week, and leaving it struggling to hold above 12800; the CAC was in-step with its German sibling, falling 1.6%, with the IBEX down 1.1% and the FTSE MIB slipping 0.6%. Though still at its worst intraday price since the end of May, shedding half a percent to return to 7600, the FTSE managed to avoid the pain seen elsewhere. That’s likely because Brent Crude rebounded by 1.3%, lifting BP and Shell alongside it, while the pound fell 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro as it speculates about Thursday’s Bank of England meeting. The pound has come under pressure amid the latest Brexit developments - peers are currently debating the EU withdrawal bill which can be followed in our politics live blog - and ahead of the latest Bank of England meeting on Thursday. With the Bank widely expected to leave interest rates on hold, the pound has slipped 0.32% against the dollar to $1.3240 having earlier fallen as low as $1.3227. Dan Smith, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, said: The Bank of England (BoE) holds a monetary policy meeting this Thursday (21 June) and is widely expected to make no change to interest rates. Incoming data continues to show that the UK economy is not firing on all cylinders. Consumer spending, employment and business confidence surveys have been fairly solid and supportive of growth, whilst industrial production and manufacturing have been exceptionally weak. The minutes of the meeting will be closely scrutinised to see whether policy members sit on the optimistic or pessimistic side of the fence in regards to recent data, with the tone of the minutes likely to set expectations over the possibility of an interest rate rise in August. The increased trade tensions between the US and China continue to unnerve investors, with Wall Street falling sharply at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 238 points or 0.95% while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both opened almost 0.7% lower. Elsewhere the oil price is heading higher ahead of a key meeting of Opec later this week. Brent crude is currently up 1% at $74.18 a barrel, recovering some of its recent losses. Saudi Arabia and Russia had been widely expected to agree to increase production, boosting supplies and lowering prices. But talk that this may not happen after all - or perhaps not by as much as previously expected - has halted the slide in crude. On top of that, the escalation of the trade dispute between the US and China has also helped lift prices by raising new concerns about its effect on global growth, and thus demand for oil. The arrest of Audi’s chief executive does not mean the truth about Dieselgate is any closer, says consumer rights law firm Your Lawyers, which is leading the steering committe for a group litigation order against Volkswagen. The firm’s director Aman Johal said: Audi CEO Rupert Stadler’s arrest and investigation over fraud and false advertising indicates that we may still be no closer to the full extent of the truth behind the Volkswagen Group’s Dieselgate scandal. Stadler is one of 20 suspects being investigated at Audi for false claims about its diesel vehicles. Perhaps the widening probes will lead to greater clarity on how the automotive giant was able to cheat customers around the world, and which individuals within the VW Group are personally responsible. There are around 60,000 people in the UK that are calling for justice against Volkswagen as part of a class action claim that our firm is on the Steering Committee for, but owners only have until 26 October 2018 to make their case. Unless Volkswagen chooses to do the right thing by its customers and pay compensation, we will pursue them for justice in the High Court. We will be closely monitoring Stadler’s case and will continue to fight for justice for Volkswagen’s victims. German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that Audi’s board will soon appoint an interim chief executive, following Rupert Stadler’s arrest this morning. The appointment will be made at a supervisory board meeting convened at short notice on Monday. Audi insists that “the presumption of innocence remains in place for Mr. Stadler”, but the company also recognises that an interim replacement is now needed. More here The Volkswagen emissions scandal centred on the use of “defeat devices,” which allowed VW cars to recognise when they were being tested in the lab and enter a low-emissions mode. Otherwise, they would generate more pollution than permitted under EU and US rules, but also provide higher performance. Volkswagen tied to pin the blame on a couple of rogue software engineers, but prosecutors believe the scandal runs deeper. Last summer, VW engineer James Liang was jailed for 40 months in America, and fined $200,000, after admitting helping to design software to cheat US emission tests. Liang had led VW’s Diesel Competence unit in the US. Associated Press reports that 20 people are under suspicion in the Audi probe, adding: Volkswagen has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States and nine managers, including former CEO Martin Winterkorn, were charged there. Two are serving prison terms; Winterkorn and the others remained in Germany and are unlikely to be extradited. German news agency DPA is reporting that German prosecutors arrested Rupert Stadler on fears that he might undermine the ongoing investigation into the VW diesel emissions scandal. The investigation is focused on claims that Audi sold at least 210,000 diesel-engine cars fitted with cheat software in the United States and Europe over several years. Last summer, Audi diesel engine engineer Giovanni Pamio was arrested by Munich’s prosecutors, and then charged by US authorities over the scandal. Shares in Volkswagen have fallen 2% in Frankfurt, following Stadler’s arrest (Audi is one of VW’s biggest divisions) More details of Audi CEO Rupert Stadler’s arrest are coming in. He was detained at his home in Ingolstadt, the Bavarian city, in the early hours of this morning, prosecutors say. This makes Stadler the most senior Volkswagen executives arrested since the German carmaker was caught rigging diesel emission tests. The Munich prosecutor’s office says: “As part of an investigation into diesel affairs and Audi engines, the Munich prosecutor’s office executed an arrest warrant against Mr Professor Rupert Stadler on June 18, 2018,” Newsflash: Over in Germany, the boss of automaker Audi has been arrested by police investigating the emissions scandal. Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler was detained this morning, according to parent company Volkswagen. A VW spokesman told Reuters: “We confirm that Mr Stadler was arrested this morning. The hearing to determine whether he will be remanded is ongoing.” The arrest comes a week after prosecutors raided Stadler’s apartment, as they widened the investigation into how Volkswagen used ‘cheat software’ in its cars to trick emissions tests. Last month, Audi admitted that another 60,000 A6 and A7 models with diesel engines have emission software issues -- further deepening a scandal that began in 2015. David Madden, CMC Markets analyst, says investors are “caught in the middle” between the US and China. Stock markets are broadly lower today as traders are increasingly worried about the prospect of a trade war. Tensions between the US and China are escalating, and we are not any closer to an agreement being reached. We are expecting the Dow Jones to open down 115 points at 24,975 and we are calling the S&amp;P 500 down 9 points at 2,770. Back in the UK, the takeover battle for Virgin Money is over -- putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) has sealed a £1.7bn deal to merge with Virgin, turning two small challenger banks into one larger one. The move could be a blow to the North East economy, where Virgin owns many of Northern Rock’s assets. My colleague Julia Kollowe explains: Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) and Virgin Money have agreed to create the UK’s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million personal and small business customers and total lending of £70bn. The banks expect to make £120m of annual savings by by 2021 by reducing overlap between their operations. This will result in a 16% reduction in the combined group’s 9,500-strong workforce that CYBG hopes to achieve by attrition – that is, when people leave they will not be replaced. It declined to say how many of the combined group’s 250 branches will be closed. However, the plan is to retain Virgin Money’s head office in Gosforth, Newcastle, for at least three years. More here: European stock markets have started the week on the back foot, as fears of a global trade war intensify. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, has dropped by 0.5% after America and China imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on Friday. Chinese media have launched a stinging attack on Trump, calling his government “selfish” and “rude” for imposing new charges on imports from China China’s Global Times said Beijing had no choice but to retaliate: “It reinforces the difference in images of the two countries: one challenges the foundation of global trade through sudden attacks; and one that is prepared to defend itself in a trade war that it cannot avoid.” Rebecca O’Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says markets are finally beginning to wake up to the risks of a global trade war. The negotiating style of President Trump had allowed investors to assume that his threats were hyperbole and part of his unique diplomatic style, and that he would step away from the brink rather than risk undermining the positive impact his previous policies have had on the stock market. However, the US decision to press forward and take on China makes the risks far more pronounced and the real danger is that the Chinese retaliation may start a chain reaction that is difficult to stop – especially as Trump likes to have the last word. The current position on tariffs is unlikely to cause a full-blown rout for markets, but the prospect of further escalation and reprisals could cause considerable damage to the global economy, increasing the risks and anxiety. In another sign of economic weakness, London house prices have fallen for the 10th month in a row. Rightmove reports that asking prices in the capital are down 0.9% compared with May, and are 1.0% lower than a year ago. That’s the 10th monthly fall in a row, as the once-hot London property market continues to cool. London is particularly vulnerable to the threat of a ‘hard Brexit’, as tens of thousands of financial jobs could be lost. Prices have dropped particularly sharply in the centre over the last 12 months (although the average property is still priced north of £1.3m). Property prices in the north are still rising, though, helping to push the national asking price up by 0.4% this month. Lack of supply in Northern areas is helping to keep prices up, says Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst: “The reduction in property choice for buyers in the north compared to a year ago is a result of property for sale being snapped up, meaning it’s more of a sellers’ market there. In marked contrast the jump in buyer choice in southern regions shows there are signs of a sellers’ market in some areas.” Here are all the key points from the British Chamber of Commerce’s new economic forecasts: UK GDP growth forecast for 2018 is downgraded from 1.4% to 1.3%, down from 1.5% to 1.4% in 2019, rising to 1.6% in 2020 (unchanged) Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth is forecast to rise by 0.4% in Q2 2018, from 0.1% growth in Q1. Growth in household consumption for 2018 is expected to slow to 1.0%, before rising to 1.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020 Inflation will continue to ease, but will not fall below the 2% target until 2020. The next interest rate rise, by 0.25%, is forecast to occur in Q4 2018, followed by a further increase to 1.0% in Q2 2019, with no further rises expected over the remainder of the forecast period Unemployment will remain at 4.4% in 2018, rising to 4.5% in 2019 and 2010 Average earnings growth will continue to slightly outpace inflation over the forecast period, with growth of 2.7%, 2.9%, and 3.0%, compared with inflation of 2.5%, 2.3%, and 1.9% Export growth of 2.8% in 2018, 2.9% in 2019, and 2.9% in 2020 is expected. This compares with import growth of 1.7% in 2018, 2.5% in 2019, and 3.0% in 2020 Growth in the construction sector is expected to slow significantly in 2018, with 0.7% growth, compared to 5.7% in 2017. The sector picks up slightly in the remainder of the forecast period, with 1.3% and 1.5% in 2019 and 2020 respectively Services sector growth is expected to slow to 1.2% in 2018, before picking up to 1.5% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020 Business investment is expected to remain weak, with growth across the forecast period of 0.9% in 2018, 1.2% in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020 The BCC’s gloomy forecasts could actually be too optimistic, if the Brexit process ends messily or if Donald Trump manages to create a full-blown trade war. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, explains that the UK is vulnerable to external shocks: “While Brexit uncertainty and the weakness in sterling have weighed on overall UK growth, it is the failure to deal with the longstanding structural issues from weak productivity to the deep imbalances in the UK economy that continue to undermine the UK’s growth potential. “The risks to the outlook are on the downside. A messy departure from the EU would likely slow UK GDP growth further over the medium term. The prospect of an escalating trade war is now a key downside risk to our forecast as it could mean much weaker export and business investment growth than implied by the current forecast. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain is facing its weakest growth since the financial crisis, as uncertainty over Brexit and fears of a global trade war hit confidence. So warns the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which has just downgraded its growth forecast for the UK. It fears that consumer spending, business investment and trade are all weakening, leading to weak wage growth and stretched households. In short, Britain is trapped in a ‘torpor’, it warns, with growth expect to fall to just 1.3% this year. That would be the weakest performance since 2009 (down from a previous forecast of 1.4%). The service sector is expected to struggle, with growth slowing to 1.2% in 2018 (that would be the weakest outturn since 2010.) The BCC has also cut its forecast for 2019 from 1.5% to 1.4%. It predicts that Britain’s net trade position will weaken in the next few years, as exporters struggle but imports pick up. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, says the government must act to help businesses through the ‘testing times’ ahead: “A decade on from the start of the financial crisis, the UK now faces another extended period of weak growth amidst a backdrop of both domestic and global uncertainty. “Our forecast should serve as a wake-up call to government - as it demonstrates that ‘business as usual’ is not an option when it comes to the economy. “With firms facing ongoing Brexit uncertainty, increasing global protectionism and instability in some parts of the world that will impact on costs and profits, now is the time for more robust action to support business confidence and investment. Marshall also warns that MPs can’t simply fixate on Brexit, given the other problems in the country: Businesses across the country want to see far more urgency around fixing the fundamentals here at home and a concerted effort to lower the high costs of doing business. Also coming up today... Tensions between the US and China are rising, after president Trump approved tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods last Friday. China swiftly hit back by imposing its own tariffs on US products. These geopolitical tensions are weighing on the markets; Europe’s Stoxx 500 index has dropped by 0.3% in early trading after losses in Asia. European investors should also keep an eye on Germany, where a deepening row over migration could bring down the government. Angela Merkel is refusing to bow to pressure from her own interior minister to turn away asylum-seekers who have registered in other European countries. Merkel hopes to find a Europe-wide solution, but pressure is building on the chancellor. Otherwise it looks like a quiet day, leaving the City free to anticipate England’s opening World Cup game (KO: 7pm BST)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
