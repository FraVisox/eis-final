The Everton chief executive is seen by the 12 clubs as the standout candidate after they were impressed by his experience in rugby league and other sports. No deal has yet been signed but it is thought the clubs are confident of tempting Elstone away from Goodison Park and back to a sport in which he has significant experience. Elstone has been involved in Everton’s plans to relocate to a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock and his departure would come at a delicate time with financing and planning for the stadium yet to be secured. The club declined to comment on his possible move. The 54-year-old has been at Everton since 2005, having held a position on the board of the Super League side Castleford. He was also employed by the Rugby Football League and is regarded as one of the key figures in the creation of Super League in the mid-1990s. Elstone would rejoin rugby league at an interesting time. The 12 clubs were successful in a quest for more power over the winter, having formed their own board which left them in sole control of their destiny – effectively breaking away from the RFL. With the sport’s lucrative broadcast deal with Sky expiring at the end of 2021, Elstone would play a key role in talks for a new deal, which are likely to begin as early as this year. His experience in the sport resulted in him being almost immediately linked to the chief executive’s role at the RFL, which is still vacant following the departure of Nigel Wood at the beginning of the year. Elstone could still potentially do both roles. Wood was also on the Super League board before he stepped down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/13/spy-poisoning-why-putin-may-have-engineered-gruesome-calling-card","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T19:18:40Z","webTitle":"Spy poisoning: why Putin may have engineered gruesome calling card","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/spy-poisoning-why-putin-may-have-engineered-gruesome-calling-card","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/spy-poisoning-why-putin-may-have-engineered-gruesome-calling-card","fields":{"headline":"Spy poisoning: why Putin may have engineered gruesome calling card","bodyText":"The response from the Kremlin has been uncompromising. The foreign ministry described Theresa May’s accusation against Moscow as a “circus show”. Its boss Sergei Lavrov said there was no proof the poison used against Sergei Skripal came from Russia. And the embassy in London promised an “equal and opposite reaction” to any UK measures. Beneath this bluster, however, is cool calculation. Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury with a Moscow-made military nerve agent, developed during the 1970s and 1980s during the cold war. Whoever wanted to murder him might have used a subtler weapon. Instead, his assassins picked novichok. How it was deployed remains unclear. One former employee of the Russian special services said nerve agents were used only if the goal was to draw attention. “This is a very dirty method. There’s a risk of contaminating other people, which creates additional difficulties,” he told the Kommersant newspaper, adding: “There are far more delicate methods that professionals use.” In other words, novichok was a gruesome calling card. As those who organised the hit must have known, the trail goes directly back to Moscow. The incident even took place down the road from Porton Down, the government’s military research base, which swiftly tested and identified the toxin. All of which means Vladimir Putin and his FSB spy agency have probably sought to engineer a confrontation with the UK. Why now? There are many theories. The most obvious answer is Sunday’s presidential election. True, Putin is guaranteed to win. He has scarcely bothered campaigning. But the Kremlin remains worried about turnout, amid widespread voter apathy and calls from Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition politician, to boycott the vote. The authorities want to the poll to look authentic, even if it isn’t. Over the next few days, state TV channels will pump out this message: Moscow is again the victim of a western conspiracy. Russia under siege is a favourite Kremlin theme. Conflicts with the west can bear some fruit: Putin has maintained the bump in his nominal popularity rating after his annexation of Crimea, despite western condemnation and sanctions. The wave of patriotism that followed also split the Russian opposition. So a row with London can do Putin no harm, especially among voters who share his uncompromising nationalist worldview and his smouldering sense of victimhood. One former senior Foreign Office adviser said it was a mistake to assume that Skripal’s spy work for MI6 triggered the decision to poison him in Salisbury. Skripal was merely the “instrument”. The real target was the UK, he said. “I don’t think it was about Skripal. It was a geo-political intervention.” The adviser added: “Moscow’s goal is to demonstrate the UK’s weakness and isolation and to drive a wedge between us and other countries. The Kremlin understands how to make these sorts of interventions at just below the level that will trigger a serious collective reaction against them.” If May fails to react adequately, she would appear weak. If she tries to fight back against Russia, she would discover the limits of collective solidarity, the adviser suggested. There are other theories. Grigol Chkhartishvili, best known for writing detective novels under the pen name Boris Akunin, suggested Putin was betting on a British retaliation that would drive wealthy and prominent Russians out of London. The community of Russian émigrés (and families of wealthy businessmen and officials) was “one of the weak points of the regime”, he wrote, and forcing them out would be “useful and beneficial” for Putin. There has been some outrage from EU capitals. Belgium’s former premier Guy Verhofstadt called for a common European response and said EU leaders should discuss the incident at a summit next week. But given Brexit, Europe’s response is likely to be limited when it comes to practical retaliation. Until Tuesday evening, Donald Trump had remained silent over the Kremlin’s probable role. He has since told Theresa May in a phone call that his support is conditional on the facts supporting her case. Downing Street said Trump had agreed that “the Russian government must provide unambiguous answers as to how this nerve agent came to be used”. Until then, only one senior member of his administration had acknowledged that Russia could be responsible: Rex Tillerson. On Tuesday Trump fired Tillerson as secretary of state, underlining that May is likely to receive little or no help from the US, once the UK’s closest ally. The Skripal attack also appears to have been calculated for its domestic impact. It sends a chilling message to anyone from inside Russia’s spy agencies and bureaucracy thinking of cooperating with western intelligence. The message: that the state can mete out punishment at its own pleasure and in the most barbaric way. Oh, and your family might suffer too. Moscow’s covert operation to support Trump during the 2016 US election was a large enterprise. It involved career intelligence officers, cyber-criminals and professional trolls. Only Putin and a few top officials know its full scope. But a wider group of individuals understand parts. Anyone thinking of cooperating with Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating collusion, will think twice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/14/austerity-will-have-cast-an-extra-15m-children-into-poverty-by-2021","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T00:01:37Z","webTitle":"Austerity will have cast an extra 1.5m children into poverty by 2021","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/14/austerity-will-have-cast-an-extra-15m-children-into-poverty-by-2021","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/14/austerity-will-have-cast-an-extra-15m-children-into-poverty-by-2021","fields":{"headline":"Austerity will have cast an extra 1.5m children into poverty by 2021","bodyText":"An extra 1.5 million children will have been pitched into poverty by 2021 as a consequence of the government’s austerity programme, according to a study of the impact of tax and benefit policy by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The EHRC study forecasts dramatic increases in poverty rates among children in lone parent and minority ethnic households, families with disabled children and households with three or more children. There are clear winners and losers from austerity tax and benefits changes since 2010, the study says. The regressive nature of the policies means that low-income families have been hit hardest: the poorest fifth will lose 10% of income by 2021, while the wealthiest fifth will see little or no change. David Isaac, chair of the EHRC, said: “It’s disappointing to discover that the reforms we have examined negatively affect the most disadvantaged in our society. It’s even more shocking that children – the future generation – will be the hardest hit and that so many will be condemned to start life in poverty.” The commission called on the government to reconsider existing policies that hit the most disadvantaged groups hardest, and to review social security benefit levels to ensure they provide an adequate standard of living. The study says the negative financial impacts are largely driven by the four-year freeze on working-age benefits from April 2016, cuts to disability benefits and reductions to work allowances in universal credit. The findings include: Children in 62% of lone parent households will be in poverty in 2021, compared to 37% in 2010. Lone parent households will lose an average of £5,250 – a fifth of their income. The largest increases in child poverty measured by ethnic group will be in Pakistani families (up almost a fifth), while Bangladeshi households will lose £4,400 on average. Households with a disabled adult and a disabled child will shoulder annual cash losses of just over £6,500, equivalent to 13% of their net income. Disabled lone parents with a disabled child stand to lose £10,000 a year. The study, which was carried out by the economists Jonathan Portes and Howard Reed, examined the cumulative impact on different groups of changes to income tax, VAT, national insurance, social security benefits, tax credits, universal credit and the national living wage. It concludes that although changes to taxes and benefits were a clear consequence of the government’s commitment since 2010 to reduce the deficit, it was not inevitable that the most vulnerable groups would bear the heaviest burden, and that the precise mix of changes was a political choice. A government spokesperson said the report did not take into account many changes made since 2010. “Automatic enrolment pension saving and near record employment are just two issues which contribute enormously to people’s lives but are not reflected in the analysis,” they said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/14/sophie-review-heaven-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T14:35:09Z","webTitle":"Sophie review – hideous and heart-rending BDSM-friendly pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/14/sophie-review-heaven-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/14/sophie-review-heaven-london","fields":{"headline":"Sophie review – hideous and heart-rending BDSM-friendly pop","bodyText":"As reinventions go, you’d be hard-pressed to find one as dramatic as Sophie’s. While shaking up electronic music in the early 2010s with her arrestingly saccharine sound, the LA-based producer remained carefully concealed from view: publicity pictures were nonexistent, while YouTube videos consisted solely of cutesy CGI objects and live shows in which she was silently sequestered behind the decks. This evening, however, she is pretending to wrestle a giant white inflatable, clad head to toe in skin-tight PVC. Later, she will ride sidesaddle on one of her dancers before performing her own stilted routine. Camp doesn’t begin to cover it. Sophie’s new hyper-flamboyant stage presence is more than a pose. Having spent the last few years in the studio with artists including Madonna and Charli XCX, in October she stepped out of the shadows with material that seemed more personal than her previous work. First came It’s Okay to Cry, a misty-eyed power ballad about an identity-based struggle for which she performed her own vocals for the first time. Then Faceshopping, whose lyrics read: “Artificial bloom / hydroponic skin / chemical release / synthesise the real.” Until recently, Sophie’s collaborators have referred to her as male – now, the PR literature uses “she”. Although the producer has declined to explain her gender identity in interviews, this new phase feels connected to some kind of transformation. Proceedings kick off with a chant about a “whole new world”, lyrics projected Disney singalong-style on a screen behind the stage. There are few outings for Sophie’s old material, a notable exception being 2014’s Hard, whose metal-on-metal percussive sound is heard in many of the new songs. Elsewhere, the music more closely resembles the aggro electro of Peaches than Sophie’s old PC Music compatriots – especially in the case of Ponyboy, which couples BDSM allusions with filthy bass and a nightmarish house vocal. Despite looking like a pop star, there is something endearingly amateurish about Sophie on stage: words are stumbled over and dance moves are executed with a certain limpness. She leaves much of the heavy lifting to others (literally, in the case of her two dancers), with backing singer Cecile Believe crooning her way through most of the vocal parts. Yet there are moments when Sophie is less willing to share the limelight, stepping out solo in a red taffeta outfit to perform It’s Okay to Cry, which layers platitudes such as “your inside is your best side” over shimmering synths before erupting into a storm of hammy countermelodies and abrasively euphoric instrumentation. It’s hideous yet heart-rending, an overacted meditation on self-acceptance that could easily prompt real tears. In retrospect, Sophie’s music has always been camp, even before she remodelled her live show into an uncanny cabaret. Her previous work juxtaposed the hyper-feminine with the frightening and the foul (helium vocals sharing banalities about love over the sound of clanging metal pipes and monstrous bass). What’s more, she has spent her entire career dancing on the line between the real and artificial, taking the most synthetic elements of pop music – sound-effect synths, chipmunk vocals, consumerist spiel – and fashioning music from them that feels wild and alive. It’s a mode made bracingly contemporary by Sophie and her apparently inexhaustible sonic arsenal, and results in a mesmerising, meaningful show."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/14/angela-merkel-sworn-in-for-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T15:26:10Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel faces multiple challenges in her fourth term","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/angela-merkel-sworn-in-for-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/14/angela-merkel-sworn-in-for-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel faces multiple challenges in her fourth term","bodyText":"Angela Merkel has returned to the German parliament’s governing benches to get to work on an in-tray overflowing with domestic and geopolitical problems after six months of fraught coalition building following September’s federal elections. Having brought to an end the longest power hiatus in Germany’s postwar history, Merkel has to work with a diminished majority in her fourth term as chancellor to find solutions to immediate challenges, such as the threats from import tariffs from an unpredictable US president and calls for structural reforms to the eurozone’s financial system from France’s president, Emanuel Macron. In addition, Merkel has to find long-term answers to the rise of the nationalist right, and a debate about growing social inequality in Germany’s booming economy. Merkel was sworn into office on Wednesday afternoon after receiving 364 out of 709 votes in the first round of voting in parliament – nine more than required to gain an absolute majority, but also 35 fewer than if all the members of her next governing coalition had cast their ballot in her favour. As the chancellor received standing ovations, handshakes and bouquets of flowers from delegates across the political spectrum, she was watched by her 89-year-old mother, Herlind Kasner, seated on the Bundestag’s gallery next to Merkel’s husband, Joachim Sauer, and long-term adviser Beate Baumann. “A clear vote and a smooth start. Now full steam ahead,” tweeted Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new general secretary of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, which has formed another grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). Others were less impressed. Wolfgang Kubicki, the deputy leader of the FDP, said of the result of Wednesday’s vote: “That was closer than we expected. It shows that this grand coalition is actually going to be a small coalition.” Merkel received supporting votes from 91% of delegates in her three-party coalition, compared with 92% in 2013 and 89% at the start of her first term in 2005. Over the coming years, Merkel will have to find a way to win over unenthusiastic delegates not just among the Social Democrats, many of whom believe the party should have sought to reinvent itself in opposition, but also among the CDU, where there is disappointment over the loss of the finance ministry to the centre-left junior coalition partner. One CDU politician described the result as a “bad omen” for the coming term. “This coalition has had a bad start, not just because of the unfortunate coalition deal, and won’t last for three and a half years”, said MP Alexander Mitsch. After the vote, the chancellor travelled to Schloss Bellevue to receive a letter of appointment from the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, before heading back to the Bundestag in order to take the oath of office. The new cabinet meets for the first time this afternoon. The pressure will be on the new government to immediately get down to business, after months of horse-trading and delayed decision-making. Merkel said on Monday her government’s focus would be on integrating refugees as well as increasing state powers to extradite people who had no right of residence. She has also stressed the necessity of securing Germany’s borders and developing policies to mitigate the causes of migration. The grand coalition was initially seen as an unlikely constellation after the election on 24 September, when Merkel’s conservative alliance, the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens tried to create a so-called “Jamaica” coalition. But after those talks collapsed, both the conservatives and the Social Democrats came under pressure to revive the grand coalition, which has governed Germany for the majority of Merkel’s time in office. The reformation of the grand coalition means the far-right Alternative für Deutschland becomes the large opposition party in the Bundestag – a non-official role that nonetheless equips the rightwing populists with a number of formal privileges, such as chairing influential parliamentary committees. On Wednesday, the party already gave a taster of the tactics it may employ to disrupt Merkel and her government over the coming years. One lawmaker, Petr Bystron, was fined €1,000 for tweeting a picture of his secret ballot with the caption “Not my chancellor”, while another was expelled from the visitors’ gallery for holding up a “Merkel has to go” banner. Even without a noisy nationalist right, the new Bundestag is likely to hear a more robust tone from its members. The coalition deal between the CDU and SPD commits the government to a number of new debating formats, including a triannual Westminster-style “chancellor’s question time”, in which the head of the government has to field questions from the opposition. When Steinmeier swore in Merkel as chancellor, he appeared to nod to the fact that her fourth term in power could yet prove to be her most challenging: “Let me give you my best wishes on your difficult path,” the former foreign minister said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/14/morrisons-delivers-17-rise-in-profits-on-back-of-surge-in-local-food-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T09:39:33Z","webTitle":"Morrisons delivers 17% rise in profits on back of surge in local food sales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/14/morrisons-delivers-17-rise-in-profits-on-back-of-surge-in-local-food-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/14/morrisons-delivers-17-rise-in-profits-on-back-of-surge-in-local-food-sales","fields":{"headline":"Morrisons delivers 17% rise in profits on back of surge in local food sales","bodyText":"A surge in sales of local foods such as Plumgarth sausages and Voakes pies helped Morrisons fight off competition from the discounters and deliver a 17% rise in profits. The UK’s fourth largest supermarket chain said it was paying a 4p a share special dividend on top of its 4.43p final dividend as underlying pretax profits rose 11% to £374m in the year to 4 February. Morrisons said sales of local suppliers’ foods had risen 50% in the past two years after signing deals with more than 200 farmers and other local food producers and tailoring stores to regional tastes. Wholesale deals with Amazon and the McColl’s convenience store chain as well as the development of small late-opening shops on its own supermarket petrol forecourts, and expanding its premium own label The Best also helped drive a 5.8% rise in total sales in the year to £17.3bn. Sales at established stores, excluding fuel, rose 2.8%. Chief executive David Potts said the company was making “good progress” with a “colleague-led turnaround and becoming more competitive for customers.” He said Morrisons had new avenues for growth as it extended its wholesale business and looked to open three new stores in the year ahead, the first in two years. Morrisons is already supplying goods to some McColl’s stores as well as 40 petrol forecourts run by Rontec. It is now adding 25 McColl’s stores a week and will be supplying about 40 stores in the Channel Islands run by Sandpiper CI. Morrisons has revived its Safeway brand for wholesale and Potts said it was now “open for business” looking for new retail partners. The group expects to achieve £700m of wholesale sales by the end of this year as it extends its partnership with Amazon and McColl’s, aiming for sales of more than £1bn. Morrisons has cut management roles, closed stores and been forced to keep prices low amid aggressive competition from Aldi and Lidl as well as a switch to shopping online and in small local stores."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/14/rodrigo-duterte-to-pull-philippines-out-of-international-criminal-court-icc","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T13:17:04Z","webTitle":"Rodrigo Duterte to pull Philippines out of international criminal court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/rodrigo-duterte-to-pull-philippines-out-of-international-criminal-court-icc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/14/rodrigo-duterte-to-pull-philippines-out-of-international-criminal-court-icc","fields":{"headline":"Rodrigo Duterte to pull Philippines out of international criminal court","bodyText":"Rodrigo Duterte is to withdraw the Philippines from the international criminal court after it opened a crimes against humanity investigation into his brutal war on drugs. In a lengthy statement, the Philippines president accused the ICC and the UN of a crusade against him, denouncing what he described as “baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks on my person”. “I therefore declare and forthwith give notice, as president of the republic of the Philippines, that the Philippines is withdrawing its ratification of the Rome statute [the treaty that established the ICC] effective immediately,” said Duterte. The ICC announced last month it was investigating allegations that Duterte had committed crimes against humanity in his war on drugs, which has killed an estimated 8,000 people since he took office in May 2016. Duterte initially said he welcomed the chance to defend his name. But on Wednesday he said the ICC had shown a “brazen ignorance of the law” and claimed that the Rome statute was fraudulently implemented in the Philippines to begin with and therefore not “effective or enforceable”. Philippine politicians met the announcement with scorn and anger. Congressman Antonio Tino said the move was “utterly self-serving and driven by sheer panic at the prospect of a trial before the ICC for crimes against humanity related to his murderous war on drugs”. Tino added: “Saving his own skin has taken precedence over the long-term commitment made by the Philippines state to human rights.” Kabataan party representative Sarah Elago said it showed that “Duterte intends to impose his fascist and tyrannical tendencies even against international critics”. “Only the guilty become too eager to run away from prosecution,” Elago added. “If indeed he wants to prove his innocence, what better platform than a court?” Relations between the Philippines and the international community have become increasingly antagonistic in recent weeks. Last week, the department of justice included a UN special rapporteur on a list of people declared to be communist terrorists. In response, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, said Duterte “needs to submit himself to some sort of psychiatric examination”. In his statement on Monday, Duterte said Hussein’s comments were clear evidence of “international bias” and that the ICC was “being utilised as a political tool against the Philippines”. He also described the ICC’s inquiry – which involves looking into a 77-page report submitted to it last year that allegedly documents Duterte’s crimes against humanity going back to 1988 when he was mayor of Davao – as “unduly and maliciously created”. When the Philippines ratified the Rome statute in 2011 – nine years after it came into force – it was seen as a big step forward for human rights in Asia. The country’s withdrawal will be seen as a blow for international accountability in the region. The ICC, based in The Hague, is the world’s only permanent international tribunal that looks into war crimes and crimes against humanity. Duterte has made his contempt for the ICC well-known in the past, calling it “bullshit”, “hypocritical” and “useless”, but in his statement on Wednesday, he went further, accusing the court of violating its own due process and depriving him of the right of innocence until proven guilty. Should the ICC’s preliminary inquiries find evidence of crimes against humanity, the Philippines’ sudden withdrawal from the statute would not protect Duterte from being put on trial. A country’s withdrawal from the ICC takes effect a year after the UN has received the application and article 127 of the Rome statute specifies that “withdrawal shall not affect any cooperation with the court in connection with criminal investigations”. James Gomez, Amnesty International’s south-east Asia director, described Duterte’s move as misguided and deeply regrettable. “Powerful individuals in the Philippines are more interested in covering up their own potential accountability for killings than they are in ensuring justice for the many victims of the country’s brutal war on drugs’,” Gomez said. There are 139 countries signed up to the Rome statute, but with some powerful exceptions. The US signed the treaty in 2000 but never ratified it, citing concerns over sovereignty, similarly with Russia. Israel signed it for a short period but also never ratified it into law. Should the UN accept Duterte’s withdrawal, it would make the Philippines only the second country to withdraw from the Rome statute, following Burundi in 2017. South Africa attempted to leave in 2016, but its withdrawal was revoked by the UN."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/14/george-pells-barrister-accuses-witness-of-trying-to-big-note-himself","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T06:53:53Z","webTitle":"George Pell's barrister accuses witness of trying to 'big-note' himself","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/14/george-pells-barrister-accuses-witness-of-trying-to-big-note-himself","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/14/george-pells-barrister-accuses-witness-of-trying-to-big-note-himself","fields":{"headline":"George Pell's barrister accuses witness of trying to 'big-note' himself","bodyText":"A retired academic linked to an abuse research organisation has been accused of trying to “big-note” himself by offering to go to police on behalf of an alleged victim making historical sexual offence allegations against Cardinal George Pell. The committal hearing for Pell, who is Australia’s most senior Catholic, was reopened to the public and media on Wednesday afternoon in Melbourne’s magistrate’s court after almost eight days of closed evidence from complainants. Bernard Barrett assists the abuse research organisation Broken Rites, which documents historical cases of child sexual abuse and advises victims of their options, and he was first to give evidence once the court reopened. The barrister representing Pell, Robert Richter QC, said when a complainant came to Barrett with an allegation against Pell, Barrett suggested he be the one go to police in his capacity with Broken Rites. Richter told Barrett: “You wanted to big-note yourself with police didn’t you, because you suggested to him [the alleged victim] it might be better if you were to get the attention of the [police] taskforce.” Barrett responded that Richter was “wrong, wrong, wrong” and that he offered to call police on the alleged victim’s behalf in order to ensure he got through to the right officer. Magistrate Belinda Wallington intervened, saying that whether Barrett was trying to big-note himself or not was irrelevant to the hearing. In a heated exchange, Barrett was pressed by Richter about notes he kept about abuse cases in his role with Broken Rites. Barrett said he did not always take notes when alleged victims came to him. “I suggest you keep notes and you suppressed them,” Richter said, which Barrett denied. He also asked Barrett: “Would you have considered it a considerable victory if you could pin something on Cardinal Pell as doing something wrong?” Barrett responded: “Not really.” Richter asked Barrett whether he and Broken Rites believed the high authorities of the Catholic church were covering up abuse. “That’s what the church admits,” Barrett said. “That’s our research. We weren’t making accusations. We just state the facts.” Richter asked: “Has it been your position for many years?” When Barrett responded: “That’s what the church admits,” Richter retorted: “Are you capable of listening to a question and answering it?” He also accused Barrett of evading questions. The committal hearing began on 5 March but was closed to the media and the public while the complainants gave evidence and were cross-examined, which is not unusual in cases involving historical sexual offence allegations. The rest of the hearing is expected to remain open and continue for another two and a half weeks. Pell, 76, has repeatedly and vehemently denied the offences he is charged with. He does not need to enter a formal plea unless committed by Wallington to stand trial. He has taken leave from his position as financial controller of the Vatican in Rome while the hearing takes place. The committal hearing continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/14/share-your-tributes-and-memories-of-stephen-hawking","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T09:33:53Z","webTitle":"Share your tributes and memories of Stephen Hawking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/share-your-tributes-and-memories-of-stephen-hawking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/14/share-your-tributes-and-memories-of-stephen-hawking","fields":{"headline":"Share your tributes and memories of Stephen Hawking","bodyText":"Stephen Hawking, the brightest star in the firmament of science, whose insights shaped modern cosmology and inspired global audiences in the millions, has died aged 76.

His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. “He once said: ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ We will miss him for ever.” For fellow scientists and loved ones, it was Hawking’s intuition and wicked sense of humour that marked him out as much as the fierce intellect which, coupled with his illness, came to symbolise the unbounded possibilities of the human mind.

Thanks so much for joining us and for all the comments below the line. Here’s the full story on May’s Commons statement announcing retaliation against Russia after the Russian spy attack: In a tongue-in-cheek display of unconcern about May’s actions today, the Russian embassy in London tweeted: “The temperature of Russia-UK relations drops to minus-23, but we are not afraid of cold weather.” In response to the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, the prime minister today said: “We will continue to bring all the capabilities of UK law enforcement to bear against serious criminals and corrupt elites. There is no place for these people or their money in our country.” The anti-corruption group Transparency International is calling for the government to take “serious action” to combat this. Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: We share the prime minister’s view that there should be no place in the UK for dirty money from overseas, but we are now calling for serious action to make this a reality. Until now corrupt individuals and regimes may well have concluded they can act with impunity in the UK given the ease with which their money has been welcomed into our financial system, property market, luxury goods and other high-end services. We’ve seen the UK become a safe haven for corrupt wealth in which money stolen from people often in the poorest parts of the world is freely spent. More than a fifth of the £4.4bn worth of UK properties we identified as having been acquired with suspicious wealth was bought by Russians. It is clear that London has routinely been the choice destination for Russians with suspicious wealth to move and they have had little trouble doing so, taking advantage of lax regulation and offshore secrecy. To help combat this the UK needs to accelerate the much delayed plans for a public register of the real owners of overseas companies owning UK property. Rules around tier 1 investments have tightened since 2015, but we still don’t know who was granted residency before then and it’s imperative that the UK now investigates which individuals, and with what money, were able to gain UK residency under such poor scrutiny. Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, has told Russia Today that he suspects “President Putin has better things to do” than order assassinations in Britain. On Twitter, it was pointed out that Livingstone made similar comments following the death of Alexander Litvinenko. There has been speculation that the England football team could boycott this summer’s World Cup in Russia, but the FA has insisted preparations are continuing as normal. In a series of tweets, a spokesperson for the FA said they were taking travel guidance from the Foreign Office and would work closely with the government regarding England’s participation in both the World Cup and a women’s World Cup qualifier. The location where the nerve agent novichok was developed and produced is a closed town in central Russia, Shikhany, according to a chemical weapons expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon. Shikhany is the Russian equivalent of Porton Down, home to various research facilities that deal with radiation and chemical weapons. He said the information was disclosed in a report sent by the Russians to the international body responsible for monitoring chemical weapons, the Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The UK is to expel 23 Russian diplomats, consider new laws to combat spying and look at sanctions as part of a sweeping response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, Theresa May has told parliament. Jeremy Corbyn came under sustained attack, including from MPs on his own side, over his response to the prime minister’s statement on Russia in which he failed to condemn the Kremlin directly for carrying out the Salisbury attack. Philip Hammond will need to impose tax rises worth at least £30bn to reach his target of balancing the public finances by 2025, undermining hopes that the chancellor will go into his autumn budget with plenty of spare cash to ease austerity, according to a leading economic thinktank. The government is not planning to axe 1p and 2p coins, Downing Street has said, after a brief if vehement media campaign against the idea, which had been floated in a Treasury paper released with the spring statement. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has failed to reach an agreement with Theresa May over what the EU withdrawal bill should say about devolution. But after a meeting in Downing Street she implied a deal was closer than before. These are from the BBC’s Nick Eardley and ITV Border’s Peter MacMahon. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Nicola Slawson is now taking over. Here is Lawrence Freedman, the historian who was a member of the panel that carried out the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, on WMD comparisons between Salisbury and Iraq. (See 2.04pm and 2.44pm.) In the Commons during Theresa May’s statement, Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, said the government should expose President Putin’s wealth. Tugendhat said: Could I also ask her if she will use the tools at her disposal to expose the wealth of the Putin family. Three billion dollars (£2.15bn) or more has been stolen from the Russian people by that man. We should expose him for what he is and not be a useful idiot hiding behind legalism of his crimes. May thanked him for his suggestion. The Russian foreign ministry has tweeted this response to Theresa May. France has said it wants firm proof of Russian involvement in the nerve-toxin poisoning of a Russian double agent in Britain before it takes any action in solidarity with the British government, Reuters reports. The report goes on: In contrast to German chancellor Angela Merkel and US president Donald Trump who assured British prime minister Theresa May they were taking her government’s views on possible Russian involvement extremely seriously, President Emmanuel Macron and other French officials have declined to mention Russia. After France initialled condemned the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter and expressed solidarity with Britain on Tuesday, French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux on Wednesday said it was too early for Paris to decide whether action should be taken. “We don’t do fantasy politics. Once the elements are proven, then the time will come for decisions to be made,” Griveaux told a news conference shortly after May said she was expelling Russian diplomats and suspending bilateral talks. While he called the attack a “very serious act” on a strategic ally, Griveaux said France was waiting for “definitive conclusions” and evidence that the “facts were completely true” before taking a position. France’s muted reaction is in contrast with its closest allies, but is in line with Macron’s efforts since coming into office to build a new relationship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Rather than directly confronting Putin through threats and megaphone diplomacy, he has emphasised private dialogue, while pushing for a restoration of business and cultural ties despite existing European Union sanctions on Moscow. Diplomats say Macron believes ostracising Moscow will not yield results given its importance on the world stage and role in world crises. Despite obvious differences, he believes it is vital to keep a working relationship going with Russia. Standing alongside Putin last May at the Chateau de Versailles, Macron heralded the start to a new page in relations after tensions under the previous administration. He said at the time that he wouldn’t let differences over Syria, Ukraine and human rights strain their relationship. Nearly a year on, there is little evidence to suggest he has gained anything tangible from the alternative approach in terms of foreign policy successes. However, he is due to be the guest of honour at an investor forum in St Petersburg at the end of May where a large French business delegation will also be present. “France has a policy on Russia that it’s going to stick to. There’s no reason for this to knock that off target,” a French official said. “You’ve got to remember there are pretty close ties between France and Russia, whether around literature, culture and business, and they are important.” Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to the UK, has confirmed that British diplomats will be expelled from Moscow. Asked in an interview with Sky News about what would happen after May’s statement, he said: There will be expulsions. As you understand in diplomatic practice, there will be answers from the Russian side. When he was asked to clarify if this meant British diplomats being expelled from Moscow, he replied. In diplomacy, there is always reciprocity. He also said that what the UK government was doing was “absolutely unacceptable” and that it should refer the matter to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. He said: We consider these measures made by the British government absolutely unacceptable, and I’ll tell you why. We believe Britain should follow international law. Under obligations under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, if they have any suspicions on nerve gas or something like that, they have to make an application to the organisation and make a request. And, so far, we did not get any samples. The UK government’s response has been that, while it has the option of taking the case to the OPCW, it is under no obligation to do so. The Labour MP Chuka Umunna has criticised Seumas Milne, Jeremy Corbyn’s strategy and communications director, for what he said in his briefing earlier (see 2.04pm and 2.44pm) about the case against Russia being unproven. The Labour MP Mike Gates has also taken a swipe at him on Twitter. Turning away from Russia for a moment, Downing Street has signalled that 1p and 2p coins will not be abolished after all, the BBC’s Alex Forsyth reports. The Treasury floated the idea of getting rid of them in yesterday’s spring statement. But generally it went down badly with today’s newspapers. This must be one of the quickest “budget” U-turns in history. Even the pasty tax lasted longer than this ... According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, some Labour MPs have signed a draft early day motion saying they “unequivocally” accept that Russia was to blame for the nerve agent poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. Sixteen MPs seem to have signed it already. Kuenssberg also says some Labour frontbenchers could resign in protest at Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to accept Russia was to blame. (See 3.35pm.) The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn has heard the same thing. The Foreign Office has now updated its travel advice for Russia. It includes a passage saying: Due to heightened political tensions between the UK and Russia, you should be aware of the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment at this time. If you’re currently in Russia or due to travel in the coming weeks, you’re advised to remain vigilant, avoid any protests or demonstrations and avoid commenting publicly on political developments. While the British embassy in Moscow is not aware of any increased difficulties for British people travelling in Russia at this time, you should follow the security and political situation closely and keep up to date with this travel advice. You may wish to sign up for our email alerts to be notified of any updates. The full text of Jeremy Corbyn’s response to May’s statement is now available on the Hansard online report. The Labour leader was careful about what he did and did not say. Here are the key points. Corbyn condemned the use of nerve agents and criticised the “abuse of human rights by the Putin government” in general terms, but did not blame the Russian state for what happened in Salisbury. He said: The attack in Salisbury was an appalling act of violence. Nerve agents are abominable if used in any war. It is utterly reckless to use them in a civilian environment. This attack in Britain has concerned our allies in the European Union, Nato and the UN, and their words of solidarity have strengthened our position diplomatically. Our response as a country must be guided by the rule of law, support for international agreements and respect for human rights. In terms of direct criticism of the Russian government, the strongest passage in his statement was this one. He said: We have a duty to speak out against the abuse of human rights by the Putin government and their supporters, both at home and abroad, and I join many others in this house in paying tribute to the many campaigners in Russia for human rights, justice and democracy in that country. He asked May whether she still thought it possible that the Russian government could have lost control of some or all of its stock of nerve agent. On Monday May floated this as the only alternative possibility to the Russian state being responsible for the attack. In her statement (see 1.16pm) May said that because Russia was not offering this explanation and because it had responded instead with “sarcasm, contempt and defiance”, the UK had ruled this out and concluded the Russian state was to blame. He suggested that any investigation into who was to blame for the Salisbury attack should be conducted under the auspices of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. He asked May: Has the prime minister taken the necessary steps under the chemical weapons convention to make a formal request for evidence from the Russian government under article IX(2)? How has she responded to the Russian government’s request for a sample of the agent used in the Salisbury attack to run their own tests? Has high-resolution trace analysis been run on a sample of the nerve agent, and has that revealed any evidence as to the location of its production or the identity of its perpetrators? He said the UK should “retain a robust dialogue with Russia”. This is what some journalists and commentators are saying about Jeremy Corbyn’s response to May’s statement. From HuffPost’s Paul Waugh From the Financial Times’ Jim Pickard From the Observer’s Nick Cohen (a persistent and severe critic of Corbyn’s) From the Mail on Sunday’s Dan Hodges (another diehard Corbyn critic) From the broadcaster Steve Richards From Alex Nunns, author of a sympathetic (and very good) book about Corbyn Nunns was commenting on this tweet from the Sunday Times’ Tim Shipman From the author James Bloodworth Bloodworth was referring to Seumas Milne, the former Guardian journalist who is now Corbyn’s director of strategy and communications, and Andrew Murray, the Unite official and former communist now working in Corbyn’s office part-time. This is from the Labour MP Gavin Shuker. He is commenting on a tweet summarising the Corbyn spokesman’s comments. (See 2.44pm.) Here is a fuller account of what Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman told reporters in the briefing about the May statement. It’s from the Times’ Sam Coates. Jeremy Corbyn is getting a lot of criticism from Conservative MPs on Twitter for the way he responded to Theresa May’s statement. Here is a selection. From the former minister Nick Boles From Peter Heaton-Jones From Michael Fabricant From Damian Green, the former first secretary Green was commenting on this tweet from Tony McNulty, a former Labour minister no longer in the Commons From Sir Nicholas Soames From George Freeman Labour’s Chris Matheson said there were now 15 suspicious Russian deaths in the UK (the 14 identified by BuzzFeed, and the one made public yesterday). He asked if this was higher than the figure for other countries, and why that might be. May said she would caution against the suggestion that all these cases were suspicious. She said the family of one alleged potential victim named in the BuzzFeed report (the Times journalist Daniel McGrory) said there was no evidence he was murdered. The May statement is now over. I will post a summary shortly. Caroline Johnson, a Conservative, says Corbyn’s spokesman made a comparison between this incident and Iraq. (See 2.04pm.) But in Iraq no weapons of mass destruction were found, she says. By contrast, she says, in Salisbury nerve agent has been found and three people are in hospital. May agrees. She says: It is quite wrong and outrageous that the leader of the opposition’s spokesman has made the comments in relation to this that he has. Nato has expressed concern at “the first offensive use of a nerve agent on alliance territory since Nato’s foundation”. But it is not proposing further action, and certainly not invoking article 5, the provision that says an attack on one Nato member counts as an attack on all of them (an option the UK government has specifically ruled out.) In a statement, Nato said: The UK confirmed the use of a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia and briefed allies that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible. The UK also confirmed that this was an indiscriminate and reckless attack against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk. Allies expressed deep concern at the first offensive use of a nerve agent on alliance territory since Nato’s foundation. Allies expressed solidarity with the UK, offered their support in the conduct of the ongoing investigation, and called on Russia to address the UK’s questions including providing full and complete disclosure of the novichok programme to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Allies agreed that the attack was a clear breach of international norms and agreements. Since its entry into force in 1997, the chemical weapons convention has become one of the pillars of the global non-proliferation regime. The convention prohibits the development, transfer and use of chemical weapons. States parties to the convention take on a duty to uphold and enforce its fundamental tenets. States parties commit not to develop, produce or otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, nor to transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to anyone. States parties also undertake not to engage in any military preparations to use chemical weapons, nor to commit to assist, encourage or induce anyone to engage in prohibited activity. Nato has repeatedly condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria and called on those responsible to be held to account. Nato regards any use of chemical weapons as a threat to international peace and security. Alex Shelbrooke, a Conservative, asks May about the tweet from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn I posted a moment ago. (See 2.04pm.) May says she is “surprised and shocked” by what Corbyn’s spokesman has said. Labour MPs will be equally shocked, she says. She says they stand foursquare behind what she has said about Russia being to blame. Corbyn’s spokesman has been briefing journalists. According to lobby correspondents at the briefing, the spokesman made it clear that Corbyn does not accept the government’s claim that the Russian government was definitely to blame for the Salisbury attack, arguing that this has not yet been proved beyond doubt. Carwyn Jones, the Labour Welsh first minister, has tweeted his support for what May said. Jones seems to be distancing himself from Corbyn’s response to the May statement. This is from Peter Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office and the government’s former national security adviser. Christopher Chope, a Conservative, says what Russia did is incompatible with its membership of the Council of Europe. Will the UK get it expelled? May says it is not just up to the UK. But Chope has a good point. MPs who are members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly should make that argument, she says. May says she will return to the Commons to make a further statement if it decides to take further retaliatory measures. Mark Francois, a Conservative, says May’s statement “in some ways had flashes of the iron lady” about it. He describes Corbyn as “a CND-wearing apologist for the Russian state”. May points out that many Labour MPs have backed what she said. John Baron, a Conservative, says now is the time for a fundamental reassessment of defence spending. May says the UK is one of the few countries spending 2% of GDP on defence. Defence spending is under review, she says. But she says the government will respond to threats in ways that don’t always involve conventional defence activity. Labour’s Luciana Berger asks May if she thinks senior FA officials should stay away from the World Cup. May says that is a matter for them. But they will have heard her statement, and they will want to consider their position, she says. Maggie Throup, a Conservative, asks if the government will regularly update its travel advice for people travelling to Russia. May says the government will do that. She says that at the moment the travel advice has not changed. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader who is generally more sympathetic to Putin (a fellow nationalist) than most British politicians, has backed May’s actions. Pat McFadden, the Labour MP, says it is important for the opposition to show strength and resolve when the country is under threat. There is a tradition in the Labour party that understands that, he says – clearly implying that Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t. May agrees. She says she accepts there is a strong tradition in the Labour party that recognises the importance of acting in the national interest. Here is Mark Urban, Newsnight’s diplomatic editor, on May’s statement. And this is from my colleague Luke Harding, a former Guardian Moscow correspondent and author of books about Putin’s Russia and the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. Crispin Blunt, the Conservative former chair of the foreign affairs committee, says it will be important to see whose side China takes on this matter. Will the government do what it can to ensure that China sides with the UK on this? May says she did raise Russia’s conduct on her recent visit to China. This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour. Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts asks if the UK is still exporting nuclear material to Russia. May says today she has been talking about chemical weapons. Labour’s Chris Bryant says the Russian ambassador to the UK has lied to the Commons, tried to stop Russia being debated, and tried to interfere in Commons elections (to select committees, presumably). Shouldn’t he be kicked out? May says interfering with the Commons would be unacceptable. But anyone who tried to tell the Speaker what to do would not get very far, she says. And here is the BBC’s diplomatic correspondent James Landale on the diplomat expulsions. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says “most of us on these benches” (ie, Labour MPs) fully support what she has announced. The measures could have come sooner, he says. Here is the BBC’s security correspondent Gordon Corera on the expulsions. Here is my colleague Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, on May’s statement. The Russian embassy in London has issued its response to May. In a statement it said: On 14 of March Russian Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko was summoned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office where he was informed that 23 diplomats were declared personae non gratae. We consider this hostile action as totally unacceptable, unjustified and shortsighted. All the responsibility for the deterioration of the Russia-UK relationship lies with the current political leadership of Britain. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson praises May for her statement, saying it contrasts with the “appeasement” offered by the Labour front bench. Here is a very lightly abridged version of Theresa May’s statement, with headlines inserted to make it easier to read. On Russia’s response to what she said on Monday Mr Speaker, it was right to offer Russia the opportunity to provide an explanation. But their response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events. They have provided no credible explanation that could suggest they lost control of their nerve agent. No explanation as to how this agent came to be used in the United Kingdom; no explanation as to why Russia has an undeclared chemical weapons programme in contravention of international law. Instead they have treated the use of a military grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm, contempt and defiance. So Mr Speaker, there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian State was culpable for the attempted murder of Mr Skripal and his daughter - and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury, including Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom. And as I set out on Monday it has taken place against the backdrop of a well-established pattern of Russian state aggression across Europe and beyond. It must therefore be met with a full and robust response – beyond the actions we have already taken since the murder of Mr Litvinenko and to counter this pattern of Russian aggression elsewhere. On what the national security council decided This morning I chaired a further meeting of the national security council, where we agreed: • Immediate actions to dismantle the Russian espionage network in the UK. • Urgent work to develop new powers to tackle all forms of hostile state activity and to ensure that those seeking to carry out such activity cannot enter the UK. • Additional steps to suspend all planned high-level contacts between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. On the expulsion of Russian diplomats Mr Speaker, the house will recall that following the murder of Mr Litvinenko, the UK expelled four diplomats. Under the Vienna convention, the United Kingdom will now expel 23 Russian diplomats who have been identified as undeclared intelligence officers. They have just one week to leave. This will be the single biggest expulsion for over 30 years and it reflects the fact that this is not the first time that the Russian state has acted against our country. Through these expulsions we will fundamentally degrade Russian intelligence capability in the UK for years to come. And if they seek to rebuild it, we will prevent them from doing so. On new anti-Russian legislation Second, we will urgently develop proposals for new legislative powers to harden our defences against all forms of hostile state activity. This will include the addition of a targeted power to detain those suspected of hostile state activity at the UK border. This power is currently only permitted in relation to those suspected of terrorism. And I have asked the home secretary to consider whether there is a need for new counter-espionage powers to clamp down on the full spectrum of hostile activities of foreign agents in our country. Mr Speaker, as I set out on Monday we will also table a government amendment to the sanctions bill to strengthen our powers to impose sanctions in response to the violation of human rights. In doing so, we will play our part in an international effort to punish those responsible for the sorts of abuses suffered by Sergey Magnitsky. And I hope – as with all the measures I am setting out today – that this will command cross-party support. On new travel controls and asset freezes Mr Speaker, we will also make full use of existing powers to enhance our efforts to monitor and track the intentions of those travelling to the UK who could be engaged in activity that threatens the security of the UK and of our allies. So we will increase checks on private flights, customs and freight. We will freeze Russian state assets wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents. And led by the National Crime Agency, we will continue to bring all the capabilities of UK law enforcement to bear against serious criminals and corrupt elites. There is no place for these people – or their money – in our country. On diplomatic relations As I said on Monday, we have had a very simple approach to Russia: engage but beware. And I continue to believe it is not in our national interest to break off all dialogue between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. But in the aftermath of this appalling act against our country, this relationship cannot be the same. So we will suspend all planned high-level bilateral contacts between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. This includes revoking the invitation to Foreign Minister Lavrov to pay a reciprocal visit to the United Kingdom … and confirming there will be no attendance by ministers – or indeed members of the royal family – at this summer’s World Cup in Russia. On secret measures being taken against Russia Finally, Mr Speaker, we will deploy a range of tools from across the full breadth of our national security apparatus in order to counter the threats of hostile state activity. While I have set out some of those measures today, Members on all sides will understand that there are some that cannot be shared publicly for reasons of national security. And, of course, there are other measures we stand ready to deploy at any time, should we face further Russian provocation. On the UK and the Russian people We have no disagreement with the people of Russia who have been responsible for so many great achievements throughout their history. Many of us looked at a post-Soviet Russia with hope. We wanted a better relationship and it is tragic that President Putin has chosen to act in this way. But we will not tolerate the threat to life of British people and others on British soil from the Russian government. Nor will we tolerate such a flagrant breach of Russia’s international obligations. On international support for the UK In the last 24 hours I have spoken to President Trump, Chancellor Merkel and President Macron. We have agreed to cooperate closely in responding to this barbaric act and to coordinate our efforts to stand up for the rules based international order which Russia seeks to undermine. I will also speak to other allies and partners in the coming days. And I welcome the strong expressions of support from Nato and from partners across the European Union and beyond. Later today in New York, the UN security council will hold open consultations where we will be pushing for a robust international response. We have also notified the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons about Russia’s use of this nerve agent. And we are working with the police to enable the OPCW to independently verify our analysis. Peroration Mr Speaker, this was not just an act of attempted murder in Salisbury – nor just an act against UK. It is an affront to the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. And it is an affront to the rules based system on which we and our international partners depend. We will work with our allies and partners to confront such actions wherever they threaten our security, at home and abroad. Labour’s Yvette Cooper says that what Russia did must be met with “unequivocal condemnation”. That generates loud cheering from MPs, who take it is a dig at Corbyn. May welcomes Cooper’s comment and says she knows that Cooper’s views are shared by many Labour MPs. May is responding to Corbyn. She says she is glad there is consensus in the Commons. But that consensus does not extend to Corbyn, she says. She says he could have taken the opportunity to condemn the Russian state, but did not. It is clear from the conversations I have had with allies that we have a consensus with our allies, it was clear from the remarks that were made by backbenchers across the whole of this House on Monday that there is a consensus across the backbenches of this House. I am only sorry that the consensus does not go as far as the right honourable gentleman who could have taken the opportunity - as the UK government has done - to condemn the culpability of the Russian state. May criticises Corbyn for his decision not to condemn the Russian state. Jeremy Corbyn is now responding. He says the use of nerve agents is abominable. The government should work with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, he says. He asks what is being done through the OPCW if the government still believes this material could have been obtained by Russian government negligence. How has the government responded to Russian demands for a sample? There are cries of “shame” from some MPs. Corbyn goes on: what information is there about where the nerve agent came from? He asks if May agrees with him it is necessary to maintain a robust dialogue with Russia. He says the UK and its allies should urge Russia to reveal full details of its chemical weapons programme to the OPCW. It is a matter of huge regret that diplomatic capacity has been cut, he says. This also generates a lot of jeering. Corbyn says he could not understand a word of what Boris Johnson said to him just now, “but his behaviour demeans his office”. Corbyn says the measures taken have to be effective. What discussions have been had with Nato partners? What willingness was there to take multilateral action? He asks about the death of Nikolai Glushkov. What assurance can be given to Russians living in the UK? May is now turning to diplomatic relations. May says high-level contacts with Russia will be cancelled. An invitation to Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, to visit the UK has been withdrawn. And UK ministers and dignitaries will not be attending the World Cup in Russia. May says other measures may be taken which will not be publicised. She says the UK wanted a better relationship with Russia. It is “tragic” that President Putin has acted like this, she says. She says the UK does not stand alone. She has spoken to allies who are backing the UK. The UK is pushing for a debate at the UN, she says. She says the government is also trying to ensure the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons can verify what the UK claims. May sets out the government’s retaliatory measures. May says 23 Russian diplomats will be expelled. They have been identified as undeclared intelligence officers. It will be the largest explusion for 30 years. They will have a week to leave, she says. May says the government will draw up legislation to protect the UK from hostile state activity. The government will consider new anti-espionage legislation, she says. May says the government will attach Magnitsky-type amendments to the sanctions bill. She says the government will increase checks on Russians coming into the country. She says there is no place for the corrupt elites in the UK. May says she told MPs on Monday about how Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with novichok, a Russian nerve agent. She says it was right to offer Russia the chance to resond. But they responded with “complete disdain”. They offered no explanation, including no explanation as to why they have an undeclared chemical weapons programme in defiance of international law. May says the government has concluded that the Russian government was responsible. It was an unlawful use of state force. May says Russia was responsible for attempted murder. It was an “unlawful use of state force”. Theresa May starts her Russia statement by paying tribute to the emergency services and the work they have done in Salisbury. And she praises the fortitude of the people of Salisbury. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, used his questions to ask about devolution and the EU withdrawal bill. He started by asking: Can the prime minister tell the house why these amendments [new ones tabled by the government] have been forced on the devolved administrations. May responded by saying Blackford used to complain about the government not publishing its amendments to the EU withdrawal bill addressing devolution. She said: In one sentence he says he was ‘waiting for this amendment’ and then we do publish he complains we’ve published it – he really needs to get his story straight. Blackford then said the Tories were “happy to destroy” the devolution settlement. It was about agreement – and I’m afraid that answer simply wasn’t good enough. The prime minister famously claimed the UK was made up of equal partners. What an irony now she’s overseeing the demolition of the devolution settlement. They’re happy to systematically destroy the settlement. I call upon the prime minister once again: stop this attack on devolution and redouble your efforts in working with the devolved administrations in finding agreement. May said the government had given more powers to Scotland. The SNP government was using those powers to raise tax, she said. We have given more powers, including of course, the tax-raising powers, it’s just a pity the SNP have chosen to use the tax-raising powers to increase taxes on people earning £26,000 or more. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Labour’s Catherine West says there have been five high-profile gun crimes in Haringey since Christmas. Will May have a meeting to discuss this? May says West should meet Amber Rudd, the home secretary, who is due to publish a new strategy on this. Labour’s Jo Platt says a recent IFS report said more than 30% of children will be in poverty by 2022. What went wrong? May says there are more than 200,000 fewer children in absolute poverty. Lucy Allan, a Conservative, says there have been shocking cases of child exploitation in Telford. Will May congratulate those who brought this to public attention? May says the Telford revelations have been shocking. This is not the first example across the country. Allan will be meeting a Home Office minister to discuss this. Labour’s Vernon Coaker says 2,120 children have been identified as possible victims of child slavery. We do not know what happens to them. That is not good enough. May says this is an important issue. She says sometimes vulnerable children are taken away by traffickers. She says unaccompanied children who do not qualify for asylum are not returned to their countries unless they will be safe. PMQs – snap verdict: Job well done for Corbyn. The NHS is the government’s biggest vulnerability (among many), there is a growing consensus (including much of the cabinet, reportedly) that it needs extra funding, and it’s a Labour issue. Corbyn should be able to win easily here, and he did. His first question was very, very effective, and May’s briefing team let her down badly by not giving her anything to say about the case of Albert Thompson. (They should read the Guardian more often, as, in fact, should everyone.) And Corbyn’s final question, quoting Stephen Hawking was a classic PMQs zinger, because May could not answer it at all (which is why she did not really try). In the middle he was a bit more scattergun and unfocused, but that didn’t really matter. May was resilient, but she relied almost entirely on her stock NHS answers (Wales, and the threat of Labour crashing the economy), which today came over as even more hackneyed than usual. And she also sounded too much as if she did not care (an impression heightened by her decision to make a pedantic procedure point about Corbyn’s letter writing.) But the main problem, as always at PMQs, was substance: she needs a message on the NHS that is solid, new and attractive, and she hasn’t got one. Corbyn says May should not be scaremongering about Wales when the targets have been abandoned in England. People’s lives are at stake. Is May saying doctors and health unions are wrong, and only she knows best? May says she was pointing out the facts about Wales. That is why Welsh people try to get treatment in England. She says the government is putting more money into the NHS. You need a strong economy for that. Labour would crash the economy. Corbyn says May should ensure the NHS has the money it needs now to meet patient demands. Staff deserve proper leave and proper funding. When there are 100,000 unfilled posts, there is a problem. He quotes Stephen Hawking saying the number of NHS staff was inadequate and getting worse. Does she agree? May says there are more staff working in the NHS. Why did the government do that? Because of what happened under Labour in Mid-Staffordshire. Labour would increase the debt, and that would lead to higher taxes. Ordinary people would pay the price. Corbyn says Georgina’s case was resolved after he raised it in the Commons, so he did not need to write to May. February was the worst month for A&amp;E performance, he says. He quotes a doctor saying the NHS needs the right long-term settlement. So why didn’t it get extra money yesterday? May says she did not wait until yesterday to announce more money; more was announced in the autumn. Corbyn says under Labour the 18-week target for non-urgent operations was in place. That has been abandoned. When will it be reinstated? May says Corbyn should look at what Labour will do in Wales. In Wales 3.4% of patients waited more than 12 hours, which was higher than in England. Corbyn says he is talking about someone who has been in this country 44 years. His case may not be the only one like this. He mentions a letter from someone facing a long wait for cancer treatment. May goes back to the case of Albert Thompson. She says Corbyn raised a case with him last October, promised to write to him about it, but never did. On cancer treatment, she says there are more diagnostic tests taking place, and more people receiving treatment. She says patients should get the right treatment. Jeremy Corbyn starts by condemning the vile messages sent to Muslim MPs, and the rise in Islamophobia. It has to be condemned by everyone, he says. He backs what May said about Stephen Hawking. He helped us understand the universe. He was also a passionate compaigner for the NHS. He backed universal healthcare. If we believe in it, how can it be possible that someone who lives and works in the country is denied access to healthcare. That is reference to this story. May says the government wants to ensure treatments are as good as they can be. She is not aware of this case, she says. There are questions about what drugs are available. May says the government stands by the commitments it made in December on Northern Ireland in the joint report. Vicky Foxcroft, the Labour MP, asks about the youth violence commission. This is a a complex issue. But some measures could be taken now, like ensuring knives in shops have to be locked away. May says the government has reached a voluntary agreement with retailers on this. But it is an area of concern. Theresa May starts by offering condolences to the family and friends of Stephen Hawking. His contributions to science speak for themselves. He inspired people across the world. And she condemns the sending of suspicious packages to some Muslim MPs. An investigation is under way, she says. PMQs is about to start. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. Sky’s Alistair Bunkall says Theresa May will announce the expulsion of a “significant” number of diplomats - but not as many as in 1971, when 90 Russians were expelled and another 15 were told they could not return to the UK. Here is the Guardian report from 1971 about the expulsion of the 90 Russians. The Foreign Office says the UK has called for an urgent meeting of the UN security council to discuss the Salisbury nerve agent attack. It has also posted this, making the case that the Salisbury attack was part of “a well-established pattern of Russian state aggression”. The BBC’s Steve Rosenberg has a good guide to what the Russian papers are saying about Theresa May’s threat to take retaliatory measures against Moscow. They sound as gung-ho as some of our papers ... The Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, has been tweeting this morning – but about Stephen Hawking, not Sergei Skripal. Donald Tusk, the European council president, has expressed his support for the UK in its stance against Russia. He said EU leaders may discuss the issue at their summit next week. The government has now published its integrated communities strategy green paper (pdf). My colleague Anushka Asthana previewed this in a story overnight. But, as we report this morning, the government’s former integration tsar Louise Casey told the Today programme that the £50m set aside for the strategy was nowhere near enough. She said: There has been a cut to the funding of English-language classes over the last decade, I don’t think that was necessarily always going to the right people in communities but it has taken a hit. It’s really, really important as a nation we are all able to speak a common language, and that language is English. One of the big difficulties the strategy will have to overcome is that you can do an awful lot of unifying … however, overall it will take more than £50m over two years and is something the whole country will have to embrace. The differences in the country at the moment are too great and we need something that heals the nation. UK in a Changing Europe, an academic project studying Brexit, has published a paper today (pdf) about the impact that Brexit will have on the NHS. In a word, it’s negative. Here is an excerpt from the conclusion to the 21-page report. The impact of Brexit on the NHS and public policy will hinge on a number of factors. Clearly, the state of the UK government’s finances will be crucial in determining future health provision. In common with the broad consensus among independent economists, and the official forecasts produced by the OBR, our analysis does not foresee any dividend for the NHS from the UK leaving the EU. On the contrary, there are likely to be further pressures on public-service funding more broadly from a hit to economic growth caused by Brexit. This will mean tough choices for the government. It could decide to increase healthcare funding, but this will have to come from raising taxes, borrowing or diverting funds from other priorities. The UK’s decision to leave the EU has not created the funding pressures on the NHS, but it is likely to exacerbate them. Similarly, should funding pressures become more acute after Brexit, there will be direct knock-on effects on waiting times, and thus recovery rates, as well as the quality of care that can be delivered. Brexit is also likely to worsen existing staff shortages, potentially reducing service quality. There has already been a fall in the number of EU-origin nurses, attributed at least in part to uncertainty about their future status. Longer term, the NHS and the social care sector are dependent on immigration policy for fulfilling staffing needs, and it is as yet unclear what this policy will be. The risks, however, are evident ... For patients, there are likely to be disadvantages from leaving the EU, mainly by virtue of losing access to healthcare in their country of residence (especially for pensioners) or to the EHIC [European health insurance card]. Although the EHIC itself is by no means comprehensive, it does offer security to UK citizens travelling to the EU, who make up the vast majority of UK visitors abroad. This is not to say that some form of reciprocal healthcare agreement cannot be reached, but it would probably only cover current EHIC holders, and for future patients probably be more limited in scope than it is now. Although agreeing this individual measure may seem eminently achievable in isolation, dozens if not hundreds of such agreements will be required to maintain current benefits in the health policy area alone. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has released its analysis of the spring statement. Paul Johnson, the IFS’s director, was scathing, telling journalists that “dismal” growth has become the new normal. He said: We have had the worst decade of growth since at least the last War. The economy is at least £300 billion smaller than we might have expected based on 2008 forecasts. Yet we are now supposed to be at capacity, with no potential to make up for any of that loss. What’s more, growth projections remain very subdued. At no point in the next five years does the OBR believe that annual growth will exceed 1.5%. To put an even less positive gloss on the numbers, growth in GDP per capita is forecast to be less than 1% in each of the next five years, half the pre-crisis trend. Dismal productivity growth, dismal earnings growth and dismal economic growth are not just part of the history of the last decade, they appear to be the new normal. My colleague Graeme Wearden has much more on his business live blog. And here is the Associated Press report on what the Kremlin is saying about Theresa May’s ultimatum this morning. The Kremlin says Russia rejects the deadline that Britain gave it to explain any involvement in the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy. Sergei Skripal and his daughter remain in critical condition in hospital after being exposed to a military-grade nerve agent in the city of Salisbury last week. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, told reporters on Wednesday that Russia “rejects the language of ultimatums” after British Prime Minister Theresa May gave Russia until the end of Tuesday to explain how the Soviet-made nerve agent came to be used to target the ex-spy. Peskov said Britain has so far only offered “baseless accusations which are not backed up by any evidence” and said Russia would cooperate with the investigation but does not see Britain’s willingness to reciprocate. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said this morning that no progress had been made towards resolving a standoff with Britain over the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, Reuters reports. The Reuters story goes on: Britain’s accusations that Russia was likely to blame for poisoning Skripal were neither robust nor serious, Lavrov said, describing them instead as a political performance intended to mislead the international community, something which he said Russia will not permit. Britain has not sent an official request for information about the nerve agent involved in the attack, the minister said. Moscow had insisted London submit such a request. He added that Russia had no motive to attack Skripal, and pointed instead to actors with an interest in spreading anti-Russian sentiment. Sky’s Beth Rigby has a fuller write-up here. Julian Braithwaite, the UK’s ambassador to the human rights council in Geneva, has posted video of his statement this morning to the council condemning Russia. (See 10.14am.) On the Today programme Robert Hannigan, the former director of GCHQ, said the UK should retaliate against Russia but it should not launch a cyberwar. That would be counter-productive, he argued in his interview. Here are the main points. Hannigan said using cyberwarfare as retaliation against Russia would be a mistake. He told the programme: Everybody is looking around for something dramatic to do. But starting a cyber conflict – which of course we could do, we could do destructive things in cyberspace, we have great capabilities – would then put us in the wrong place. We are part of the family of civilised nations ... At the very destructive end of course you could do great damage to anything that is networked. But I don’t think we should be going there, because that would play to the Russian narrative. We are not outside the international rules of civilised nations and we don’t want to be. We play by the rules that most countries do. The covert work is going to be targeted against individuals and organisations who are responsible for this terrible crime but the idea of launching some large-scale cyber conflict against Russia makes no more sense than launching a military conflict against Russia, it’s not the sort of response that is needed and would play to Putin’s narrative and probably wouldn’t achieve much except damage all around. He said Russia had put itself outside the family of civilised nations. This is part of a pattern where a modern nation has chosen to step outside the rules that govern behaviour of civilised countries. And we’ve seen that in cyberspace, we’ve seen that on the ground, in Ukraine, and now we are seeing it in an incredible way with banned nerve agents being used on the streets of a European city. So it is part of a pattern. He said UK retaliation should focus on economic measures. The response should be to contain and to show Russia what the consequences of choosing to be a rogue nation outside of those civilised rules are. And I think there are obvious things, like the expulsion of diplomats on a scale we probably haven’t seen since the cold war that will inevitably happen, because there will be a further freezing out of Russia. But more importantly, I think, will be hitting the economic targets, particularly those individuals and their assets that are reliant on London and like to do business in London. There is a lot of unexplained wealth and I think there’s a huge amount of mileage in the unexplained wealth orders that Tom Tugendhat [the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee] and others have suggested. I think that’s the way to show Russia that there are consequences. He said Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, was engaged in measures like the Salisbury attack as a way of “distracting his own population from economic decline”. Putin had “failed to reform the Russian economy”, Hannigan said. He went on: These overseas adventures are his way of wrapping himself in a nationalist flag. We shouldn’t play to that narrative. Britain told the UN human rights council in Geneva that the use of a military-grade nerve agent used in an attempt to kill a former Russian spy was a flagrant breach of international law and should serve as a warning to the international community, Reuters reports. Julian Braithwaite, the UK’s ambassador to the body, told the forum: The council and the United Nations general assembly have decried Russia’s violations of international law with alarming regularity. Its reckless behaviour is an affront to all this body stands for. Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, the Scottish and Welsh first ministers, will table proposals to end months of deadlock over Brexit when they meet the prime minister this afternoon. Theresa May is hosting a summit at Downing Street with the two devolved governments and officials from Northern Ireland, to discuss a complex and controversial deal on redistributing powers around the UK after it leaves the EU. The joint ministerial meeting will include discussion of the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, Brexit issues such as the Irish border, and wider economic and trade considerations. In a further sign of the pressure to reach agreement, May will also hold separate private bilateral meetings with Sturgeon and Jones. They are at odds over the power-sharing in at least 24 areas including GM crops, organic farming, fishing quotas, food labelling and food safety, and pesticides, which will be needed at UK level. Neither side is expecting a breakthrough at the event, but Sturgeon said: At today’s meeting we and our Welsh colleagues will take the opportunity to set out what changes are required to secure our consent. While we remain determined to continue discussions on this issue, it is time for the UK government to show respect for devolution and accept that no changes can be made to Scotland’s devolved powers without the consent of the Scottish parliament. This is from the BBC’s Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The Kremlin spokesman seemed to referring specifically to suggestions that the UK might ban RT (formerly known as Russia Today.) Moscow has already threatened to retaliate, if this were to happen, by removing British journalists from Russia. Any decision about the future of RT in the UK would primarily be a matter for Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator. On Monday, after May’s Commons statement, it issued a non-committal statement about RT, saying: Ofcom has an ongoing duty to be satisfied that all broadcast licensees are fit and proper to hold a licence. We have heard the Prime Minister’s statement in the House of Commons this afternoon and we await her further statement on Wednesday. We will then consider the implications for RT’s broadcast licences. But yesterday it followed this up with a much stronger one implying RT could lose the right to broadcast in the UK. It said: As the independent UK broadcasting regulator, Ofcom has an ongoing duty to be satisfied that broadcast licensees remain fit and proper to hold their licences. We have today written to ANO TV Novosti, holder of RT’s UK broadcast licences, which is financed from the budget of the Russian Federation. This letter explained that, should the UK investigating authorities determine that there was an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the UK, we would consider this relevant to our ongoing duty to be satisfied that RT is fit and proper. The letter to RT said that we would carry out our independent fit and proper assessment on an expedited basis, and we would write to RT again shortly setting out details of our process. On Monday Theresa May said that it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury and that, if Moscow did not provide an explanation, she would announce how the UK would retaliate. The Kremlin has ignored the ultimatum and responded with scorn, and so today May will tell MPs what will happen next. Here is our overnight preview story. And here are tweets posted by the Russian embassy in London yesterday afternoon saying that, if May imposes punitive measures on Moscow, she will provoke “an equal and opposite reaction”. (Russia, like President Trump, seems fond of conducting diplomacy via belligerent tweeting; the embassy even shares his liking for the word “crooked”.) The Russia story will be my main focus today, although, as usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. But, by and large, I won’t be covering reaction to the spring statement here (including the Resolution Foundation analysis, already out, and the Institute for Fiscal Studies briefing due at 10am.) My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering all this on his business live blog. You can read it here. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Theresa May chairs a national security council meeting to discuss retaliation against Russia for its role in the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. 10am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies holds its briefing on the spring statement. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 12.45pm: May gives her Commons statement about the retaliatory measures being taken against Russia. 2.30pm: Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee on fake news. 3.30pm: May meets Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, to discuss the deadlock over the EU withdrawal bill and its proposals for Brexit and devolution. 4.30pm: Robert Hannigan, the former director of GCHQ, takes part in an LBC phone-in.

Despite the possible diplomatic benefits, Australia has been warned against “dancing with dictators” at this weekend’s summit, and urged by rights groups to raise the issue of human rights abuses across the region, not just focus on trade and counter-terrorism. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is a group of 10 mainland and archipelago nations across the region: Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Laos. Headquartered in Jakarta, Asean’s mission is to promote and accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development across the region, particularly through liberalising trade and working towards the distant goal of a common regional currency. The organisation is also seen as a counterweight to the growing economic, military and strategic influence of China. Tensions are especially acute at present over Beijing’s unilateral claim to the South China Sea. While not a member of Asean, Australia is part of the larger East Asia Summit (which also includes China), and has sought in recent years to bind itself more closely to regional intergovernmental architecture. Australia’s 2017 foreign policy white paper committed it to pursuing shared interests in the region, and to demonstrating “our elevated commitment to Asean and our enduring ties with the countries of south-east Asia”. Unlike the European Union, to which a democratic system of government is a requisite for membership, Asean has the harder job of pulling together a disparate group of countries, ranging from quasi-military regimes, dictatorships and communist countries, to one of the world’s few remaining absolute monarchies. It is known for its “Asean Way” (the organisation even has a song about this) of negotiation emphasising consensus and conciliation, and the avoidance of direct conflict. But this consultative approach, alongside a policy of “non-intervention” in the affairs of member states, is often criticised as being toothless in addressing human rights abuses and egregious legal breaches by members. These are, despite public pressure, often left entirely unaddressed by the organisation. Every Asean leader, with the exception of the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, will be in Sydney for the Australia-led summit. The focus of this weekend’s summit is geared heavily towards increasing trade and business links, as well as combating the regional threat of terrorism. But much of the action will be away from the carefully-staged photo opportunities, set-pieces speeches, and heavily-managed press conferences. Protests are planned against the presence of the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, whose abuses of power – including violent crackdowns on protestors, jailing political opponents, widespread corruption and media crackdowns – have escalated in recent months. Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge cadre who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years, promised personal retribution should he be insulted by demonstrators in Australia: “I will follow you all the way to your doorstep and beat you right there … I can use violence against you.” There will also be protests held condemning Myanmar’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, for her perceived silence over the continued persecution of the Rohingya ethnic and religious minority in that country. Special rapporteur Yanghee Lee told the UN human rights council this week the atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority “bear the hallmarks of genocide”. The council heard evidence that the elderly, people with disabilities and young children had been burned alive in their homes; that the military were perpetrating brutal gang rapes; and there had been targeted killing of children and babies. In response, council members in the US said it was “appalled by the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya” while the UK told the council the “human rights violations, including murder, torture and sexual violence, are appalling”. The Australian government, however, was far more circumspect, saying only it “recognised” the “complex challenges” faced by Myanmar “as it seeks to consolidate democratic reforms and to achieve peace and reconciliation”. Daniel Webb from the Human Rights Law Centre said: “Time and time again we see our government getting all mealy-mouthed about global humanitarian emergencies. “Victims of cruelty and injustice all over the world desperately need governments like ours to be part of the UN’s principled spine, not a corrosive influence gnawing away at the very foundations of human rights with hollow words and unprincipled actions.” Elaine Pearson, Australian director of Human Rights Watch, said Australia had the chance this weekend to make human rights a central and public focus of the Asean gathering. “Australia’s failure to publicly raise human rights concerns at the summit would not only provide a propaganda coup to Asean’s most abusive leaders, it will embolden all the region’s leaders contemplating major crackdowns, jailing journalists or dismantling democratic institutions.” An HRW briefing paper raises human rights concerns in eight Asean countries, including Cambodia and Myanmar, and the crimes against humanity committed by the Philippines government in its “war on drugs”. “Shutting one’s eyes and hoping that closer trade and security ties will somehow magically transform abusive governments into rights-respecting ones doesn’t work,” Pearson said. “The Asean summit shouldn’t just be an opportunity to dance with dictators, but a chance to publicly press them over horrific human rights abuses across the region.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/mar/15/david-squires-on-graham-arnolds-appointment-as-future-socceroos-coach","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T17:00:18Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ...

Leo Varadkar also sought to reassure unionists, who fear that his government is using the moment to push for a united Ireland, that he does not have “a hidden agenda”. The taoiseach was joined on Tuesday by the former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams and the British ambassador, Kim Darroch, at an event in Washington to mark the 20th anniversary of the peace deal. Reflections on the scale of that “historic achievement” fell under the shadow of Britain’s planned exit from the EU. Brexit had “undoubtedly changed the political weather”, Varadkar told an audience including US politicians at the Library of Congress. “To me, Brexit is a threat to the Good Friday agreement simply because it threatens to drive a wedge between Britain and Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and potentially between the two communities in Northern Ireland. And that’s why we must do all that we can to make sure that those wedges, that that risk, does not become reality.” Varadkar continued: “I think for unionists – and I take no pleasure in this – it also creates risks for the union itself because it asks Scotland and Northern Ireland to leave the European Union even though the majority of people in both those countries voted not to do so.” Brexit has raised fears of a return to a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland reminiscent of the Troubles. Last month it emerged that officials from the UK and the EU are devising a plan to, in effect, keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market to avoid this outcome. But that led to calls from Scotland for a similar arrangement. Meanwhile the Irish government’s efforts to maintain a soft border, in particular its demand that Northern Ireland continues to align with many EU regulations, has spooked unionists. Last year the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said he would like to see a united Ireland in his “political lifetime”. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) described the remark as “aggressive” and condemned “the megaphone diplomacy” of Dublin. On Tuesday, in a message aimed at unionists, Varadkar said: “I know many are concerned, perhaps worried, perhaps even angry at some recent political developments and I want to recognise that recent statements and recent actions by Irish nationalists, including the Irish government, about Brexit have been seen by some as disrespectful and by others as intrusive or interfering. “And if that was the case, I want to make very clear that that was certainly not our intention, and I want to repeat that we have no hidden agenda. We do not desire a border in the Irish sea any more than we want to see a border between Newry and Dundalk, or between Holyhead and Dublin.” Britain has insisted it opposed a hard border. Darroch told the audience: “The prime minister said in December last year that the UK remained committed to protecting north-south cooperation and to its guarantee of avoiding a hard border. Any future arrangements must be compatible with these overarching requirements.” But he was challenged by Colum Eastwood, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Sinn Féin’s main nationalist rival, who said: “We are facing an enormous threat, one that we haven’t faced in a long, long time. It’s called Brexit. There are people who are using the Good Friday agreement, who are threatening to rip up the Good Friday agreement, just to make their negotiation with the European Union that little bit easier.” In recent weeks some pro-Brexit MPs have questioned whether the Good Friday agreement has run its course, pointing out that Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing government since January last year. Sinn Féin pulled out, arguing that it was not being treated as an equal partner by the DUP. Each side has blamed the other for repeated failures to strike a deal. But Eastwood said: “We have to understand what has happened. The instability that in our institutions in Northern Ireland is exactly the same instability that’s been created by Brexit. The two things are not separate and I’m glad to hear the British ambassador saying that he doesn’t support a hard border in Ireland. “But I want to hear from the British government what they’re actually going to do about that because their current position does not stand. It does not add up. It does not work. We cannot achieve frictionless trade and movement on the island of Ireland if we continue down the road the British government wants to continue down.” Adams also raised the alarm, noting that the majority of people in Northern Ireland opposed Brexit, yet the DUP is propping the minority Conservative government and supporting its Brexit legislation in Westminster. “This threatens the Good Friday agreement,” he said. “It’s a direct assault on the Good Friday agreement.” In a throwback to fiery rhetoric of old, Adams declared: “I believe the British government has no right to be in Ireland, never had any right to be in Ireland and never will have any right to be in Ireland.” Adams reiterated the Sinn Féin stance that there cannot be a return to British direct rule and added the best option was for the return of the political institutions. “It might well be that the power-sharing institutions and all-Ireland political architecture may not be restored in the medium term.” Adams described the Good Friday agreement as a defining moment in Ireland’s recent history but not a settlement. “It never pretended to be. It is an agreement on a journey. Not the destination.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/14/banking-royal-commission-document-shows-nab-bosses-well-aware-of","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T05:39:54Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission: document shows NAB bosses well aware of fraud","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/14/banking-royal-commission-document-shows-nab-bosses-well-aware-of","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/14/banking-royal-commission-document-shows-nab-bosses-well-aware-of","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission: document shows NAB bosses well aware of fraud","bodyText":"National Australia Bank has been chastised for withholding a document from the banking royal commission that showed bosses knew about widespread fraud in its controversial “introducer program” months before telling the regulator. The commission’s second day of hearings also heard evidence on Wednesday of NAB’s desire to begin a compensation program for customers who had been affected by an alleged bribery ring involving NAB staff in 2015, chiefly to protect the bank’s reputation. With Anthony Waldron, NAB’s head of broker partnerships, giving evidence for the second consecutive day, senior counsel assisting, Rowena Orr QC, began by announcing that NAB’s counsel had handed her a crucial document on Wednesday morning, despite being required to provide all relevant documents to the commission by 13 February. The document was minutes of NAB’s principal board risk committee meeting from 4 November 2015. “Have you seen this document before?” Orr asked Waldron. “No, I have not,” Waldron replied. Orr said the document showed that NAB’s group chief risk officer had made a report to the principal board risk committee on 4 November 2015 about potentially fraudulent payments being made as part of NAB’s introducer program. This included non-financial experts, such as gym instructors and real estate agents, referring strangers to NAB for home loans in return for a commission. NAB revealed last year that 20 staff had either been fired or resigned over the introducer scandal, but fresh details emerged in the hearing on Wednesday. Orr wanted to know why the fresh document had not been handed to the commission until Wednesday morning. Waldron said he had no idea. Orr said the document showed the risk committee was aware of a serious problem with the scheme by 4 November 2015. But NAB had not made a statutory breach report to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) until February 2016, three months later. She noted NAB had engaged an external consultant, KPMG, on 11 December 2015 to identify the issues surrounding the potential fraud, and that NSW police were first told about the potential fraud on 16 December 2015. She also noted that on 21 December 2015, NAB wrote to Asic for the first time about the potential fraud, saying the bank had started an investigation into some bankers in western Sydney, but that NAB had not provided a formal statutory breach report to Asic until February 2016. Waldron was then also asked about minutes of a different NAB meeting – this one from October 2016 – where NAB executives discussed making compensation payments to customers who had been affected by alleged fraud under the introducer program. Orr read from the minutes: “It was noted that despite the investigations and file reviews being active for 12 months, no customer remediation of compensation has been actioned, and at some point the trigger will need to be pulled to minimise any potential reputation impacts.” Orr then asked if the concern was only about limiting damage to the bank’s reputation. Waldron replied: “I don’t agree that was the intent of the meeting, [but] absolutely that is what’s minuted.” Waldron said NAB had so far identified 1,360 customers who may have been affected by misconduct by up to 60 bankers, but it was still working through its file review process. He said NAB had contacted 71% of the customers on its files who may have been affected, up from 50% a couple of weeks ago. Orr asked him if NAB had paid any remediation to any customers yet, and Waldron said NAB hadn’t. “As at last Friday, we had identified that there would be about 26 of those [customers] that we would be making offers to over the next little while,” he said. Orr asked: “When did NAB start talking to these customers?” Waldron replied: “We would have started talking to them, or trying to contact them, in November last year.” Orr said: “But in March [2018], no one yet has received an offer for remediation?” Waldron replied: “No not yet ... [but some will] in the next week or two.” Orr suggested that the work NAB had been putting into its file review process had “gone into over-drive” since December last year, and wondered if that was because of the looming royal commission hearing. Waldron replied: “We certainly haven’t added additional people to do it, we’ve absolutely kept to our team of experts there to do it. It’s certainly top of mind, but it’s not sped up the process per se.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/14/married-couple-discover-photo-of-them-both-from-11-years-before-they-met","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T03:21:17Z","webTitle":"Married couple discover photo of them both from 11 years before they met","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/married-couple-discover-photo-of-them-both-from-11-years-before-they-met","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/14/married-couple-discover-photo-of-them-both-from-11-years-before-they-met","fields":{"headline":"Married couple discover photo of them both from 11 years before they met","bodyText":"Two strangers pose for a photo at the exact same spot, in front of a towering red sculpture in a town square in China.

This means that for every 10,000 Australians, 50 are homeless. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which released the data on Wednesday, estimates that more than 43,500 homeless people are under 25. The Mission Australia chief executive, James Toomey, said the figures were an “international embarrassment” caused by a lack of serious political commitment nationally to building more social housing and affordable homes. “We cannot afford to ignore this situation any longer,” he said. “Safe and secure housing provides the platform for children to attend school, adults to work, people to be healthy and communities to thrive.” Migrants were disproportionately affected. While 28.2% of Australians were born overseas, they comprise 46% of the homeless. The elderly too are vulnerable. People aged between 65 and 74 experiencing homelessness increased to 27 people per 10,000 people in 2016, up from 25 per 10,000 people in 2011. Guy Johnson, a professor of urban housing and homelessness at RMIT University, said rising housing costs combined with a decline in public and community housing were exacerbating homelessness among the chronically disadvantaged. “In a country as prosperous as Australia, this is a disturbing and worrying trend,” Johnson said. “Public housing is particularly effective because it’s affordable and has traditionally offered long-term security for precariously housed people.” The ABS defines someone as homeless if their current living arrangement is in a dwelling that is inadequate, has no tenure, and does not allow control of and access to space for social relations. Paul Jelfs, the general manager of population and social statistics at the ABS, said people living in “severely” crowded dwellings – defined as requiring four or more extra bedrooms to accommodate the people who usually live there – was the greatest contributor to the national increase in homelessness. “In 2016, this group accounted for 51,088 people, up from 41,370 in 2011,” he said. While 2.8% of Australians are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, the latest data shows they comprise 20% of the homeless, although this number is continuing to decline. Overcrowding had driven a 37% increase in the number of homeless people in NSW, according to the chief executive of Homelessness NSW, Katherine McKernan. “We still have around 60,000 people on the public housing waiting list and less than 1% of private rental properties in greater Sydney and surrounds are affordable for people on low incomes,” she said. But the NSW social housing minister, Pru Goward, said homelessness was a priority for the NSW government. In the past year, the state government introduced more proactive outreach programs, resulting in 200 people from the inner city being placed in permanent and stable social housing, she said. In Victoria there had been an 11% increase in homelessness between the two census surveys. Jenny Smith, the chief executive of the Council to Homeless Persons in Victoria, said the crisis was no surprise. “As a country we’ve failed to tackle the housing affordability crisis, and our homelessness services continue to be chronically underfunded,” Smith said. “Homelessness is not a lifestyle choice, it reflects systems failure, and most critically, a shortage of affordable housing. In our state budget we’ve called for 14,500 more social housing properties, tripling the commitment already made by the Victorian government. However, without federal government investment in social housing and homelessness support, we’re just bucketing water on the Titanic.” The Council to Homeless Persons calls for reform of the housing taxation system, an increase to Centrelink incomes, especially the Newstart income, and increased funding of homelessness services. John Falzon, the chief executive of St Vincent de Paul, said “charities can only do so much”. “It is now time for the federal government to show real leadership and make some brave decisions to end homelessness in our rich country,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/14/thats-not-my-dog-review-shane-jacobson-awful-true-blue-joke-compilation","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T03:10:07Z","webTitle":"That's Not My Dog! review – Shane Jacobson's awful true-blue joke compilation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/14/thats-not-my-dog-review-shane-jacobson-awful-true-blue-joke-compilation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/14/thats-not-my-dog-review-shane-jacobson-awful-true-blue-joke-compilation","fields":{"headline":"That's Not My Dog! review – Shane Jacobson's awful true-blue joke compilation","bodyText":"A bunch of people coming around for dinner and cracking jokes over a few beers and wines ... is that a compelling idea for a feature film? The director Dean Murphy and his ubiquitous star/producer, Shane Jacobson – who is increasingly giving the impression of being a person happy not just to attend the opening of an envelope but to star in a feature film about such an event – believe the answer is a firm yes. The twist is that the guests of the true-blue soirée held in That’s Not My Dog! are well-known Australian comedians, instructed to bring with them their three funniest jokes of all time. The guest list is impressive – including Jacobson, Paul Hogan, Jimeoin, Paul Fenech, Michala Banas, Steve Vizard, Fiona O’Loughlin, Tim Ferguson, Lehmo, Ed Kavalee, Rob Carlton, Christie Whelan Browne, Hung Le and Lulu McClatchy. The resulting film is almost entirely comprised of the rendition of their jokes, unaccompanied by visualisations or aesthetic embellishments. By “almost entirely” I do not mean lots of jokes are interspersed throughout the inevitable dialogue, character motivation and plot. I mean there is, with the exception of two very short scenes – maybe three minutes of running time – no dialogue, character motivation and plot. Nothing but jokes. Jokes, jokes and jokes. This premise is pretty bloody ’strayan, and pretty bloody lazy; literally a matter of getting people to tell jokes and filming them. Every cast member deserves to be credited as a co-director, and perhaps as a writer (assuming the material is original – and this is a big assumption given the campfire-yarn nature of much of it). It is unlikely anybody will be crying out for acknowledgement, however, given the final result, which is clearly ill-fitted to the cinematic medium. A web series, perhaps, would have been a better format. That’s Not My Dog!’s marketing materials inform us that “The greatest jokes ever told ... get told.” Rest assured these are not the greatest jokes ever told. Unless “greatest” includes puns such as “you have to hand it to blind prostitutes” and “why can’t Stevie Wonder see his friends? Because he’s married.” There are longer, rantier ones, including one I quite liked but which sounds lame as soon as you write it down – an anecdote about a murderous boy who lives in a world populated by inflatable people, and “lets everybody down”. There are precisely 86 jokes in total. Jacobson, mistaking quantity for quality, boasted of this number during his introduction at a recent screening, explaining that smartphones are killing the ancient craft of joke-telling, and this film constitutes an attempt to save it. The actor has now completed a hat trick of duds, following the dunderheaded cooking comedy The BBQ and hammy schlock fest Guardians of the Tomb. His next film, Brother’s Nest, which premieres in Australia in April, will mark four new Jacobson movies in three months. Something resembling an actual, scripted scene (the horror!) is squeezed into That’s Not My Dog! about three quarters of the way through. It is a tender moment between Jacobson and his real-life father, Ronald, who is the very definition of a natural screen presence – perfect (as he was in Kenny) as the lovable, cranky coot. Apropos of nothing, Ronald asks Shane: “What’s the guts of this party? What’s it really all about?” Shane explains the whole shindig was for him, to say thanks for raising the family with a great appreciation of comedy. It is a sweet moment but boy is it cloying, pushing its lovey-doveyness into the viewer’s face like a custard pie. It also feels like emotional blackmail. This film was made for good ol’ dad, the message reads. What sort of monster can’t appreciate a film for good ol’ dad? The director also intermittently cuts to extreme close-ups of brands including Tyrrells chips and Dick Smith sauces, in moments that feel not so much like blatant product placement as short commercial breaks. Shooting the film on a cold and dark night (an unusual choice: why not a bright summer’s day?) Murphy slathers almost every scene with live music from The Black Sorrows, Russell Morris, Adam Brand, Dan Kelly and The Meltdown. I think I saw a shot of the same keyboardist recycled a dozen times. The use of music is so extensive there is a compelling case to be made that That’s Not My Dog! is a concert documentary first and – what do we even call this? – a joke compilation second. If you like the music, the volume is constantly reduced to allow us to hear the supposed “greatest jokes ever told”. If you’re there for the jokes, you’ll discover the film constantly reverting back to the music. It is a cruel, vicious, dyspeptic cycle. Towards the end one naturally contemplates their own mortality, longing for the moment when the screen dissolves into dust and a voice beckons to walk towards the light – the green one that says “EXIT”. • That’s Not My Dog! is in cinemas 15–18 March only"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/13/jose-mourinho-plays-down-manchester-united-champions-league-exit","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T23:58:41Z","webTitle":"'This has happened at United before': José Mourinho plays down limp exit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/13/jose-mourinho-plays-down-manchester-united-champions-league-exit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/13/jose-mourinho-plays-down-manchester-united-champions-league-exit","fields":{"headline":"'This has happened at United before': José Mourinho plays down limp exit","bodyText":"José Mourinho attempted to play down the significance of Manchester United’s exit from the Champions League as former players turned television pundits savaged his side’s limp display against Sevilla. Rio Ferdinand described the performance as lethargic and added that Alexis Sánchez looked a shadow of his former self while Paul Scholes called for the Chilean to be dropped. Clutching desperately at the thinnest of straws, Mourinho suggested United had no time for self-recrimination because they had an FA Cup quarter-final tie against Brighton coming up at the weekend. “I don’t want to make a drama out of this defeat. It’s not the end of the world. It’s football and we have another match on Saturday,” the United manager said. “I know this has happened at Manchester United before because I have sat in this chair as manager of Porto and of Real Madrid. I don’t think it is something new for this club.” Unsurprisingly Mourinho did not share the critics’ view that United had been poor. “We did our best, we tried, we lost, that’s football,” he said. “I don’t think the performance was bad, the way we started was really positive. We were in control for the first 10 or 15 minutes, then after that Sevilla started to hide the ball. They have good players, they can do that. They played well in the first half without creating many dangerous situations. We had chances to score in the second half but didn’t take them. After that it was clear that the first goal was going to change the shape of the game and they were the ones who scored it.” Mourinho said three weeks ago that until a team reached the quarter-finals they could not be regarded as genuine Champions League contenders, so by his own admission United have failed after spending so much money on players like Romelu Lukaku and Paul Pogba, the latter of whom did not even start this game and was unimpressive when he came on. Was that acceptable for a club of United’s stature? “Yes,” came the terse reply. Was he happy that United managed only four shots on target over the two legs. “That’s just a statistic.” What needs to change to bring the team up to the desired Champions League level? “Everything.” Would that cost even more money? “Everyone else spends money too. We are not the only team that invests money in players.” Mourinho refused to answer a question from a Spanish journalist about whether going out of the Carabao Cup, Champions League and being so far behind in the league amounted to failure, on the grounds that he doubted it would interest a Spanish readership. It was never going to be difficult for Vincenzo Montella to appear a ray of sunshine by comparison and Sevilla’s Italian coach managed it easily. “I am very happy and I have a dressing room full of happy players,” Montella said. “It is amazing to come to a stadium like this and make it to the last eight of the Champions League. We put in a very effective performance and deserved the victory. “Ben Yedder took his chances fantastically well but the whole team did well to control possession and restrict an attacking side like Manchester United to very few opportunities.” Invited to join in the chorus of criticism of United’s performance Montella came up with a classy response. “I don’t think it was about them,” he said. “We were just very good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/15/alan-opie-baritone-50-years-english-national-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T10:17:03Z","webTitle":"My life in pieces: Alan Opie's 50 years on stage with English National Opera","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/15/alan-opie-baritone-50-years-english-national-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/15/alan-opie-baritone-50-years-english-national-opera","fields":{"headline":"My life in pieces: Alan Opie's 50 years on stage with English National Opera","bodyText":"I started singing with English National Opera (Sadler’s Wells Opera as it was then) quite out of breath. I was still a student at the London Opera Centre, and had been brought in to do three weeks of a 10-week tour singing the role of Papageno in The Magic Flute. I found myself on the first night in 1969 under the baton of the great Charles Mackerras, the maestro who made ENO what it is today. He arrived in my dressing room in the cavernous Liverpool Empire at five past seven with the curtain due to go up at quarter past. It was our first meeting. “This tempo for the first aria alright?” he asked, tapping out a speed on the table that was about half of that which I’d spent the previous three weeks rehearsing. I was too frightened and in awe to protest that it was not. Papageno has about 30 seconds of introductory music to wander about the stage, firing arrows, miming bird-catching and so forth. On my first entrance on stage, those seconds turned terrifyingly into what felt like two long minutes, as I was forced to improvise yet more firing, miming and running around, until by the time I got to sing the first verse I was so exhausted I was hardly able to sing a line without taking extra breaths. For anyone who longs for a bygone age when opera audiences weren’t scarce and declining, I should point out there were about 35 people in the audience. Fifteen of them were probably principals from the other shows on the ENO tour. And one of them was occasionally Mackerras himself, who had the unnerving habit of exiting the pit during the dialogue scenes sitting in a very empty front row and whispering loudly, “Can’t hear!” It didn’t feel like the most auspicious beginning to a life in opera. Yet here I am, in my 50th year of performing with ENO, about to sing Germont père in Verdi’s La Traviata. I first sang the role in 1974 as a distinctly unfatherly cover, the makeup girl despairing that whatever she did I still looked like I was about to take the 11-plus. (These days I might be more convincing as Germont grandpère). What could this stiff provincial patriarch, desperate for the wellbeing of his wayward son, have possibly meant to me in my 20s? I wasn’t to sing that role again for 14 years – Lord Harewood, managing director of ENO, decided I wasn’t ready to do it, and I didn’t get another chance until aged 43, when I was old enough to be plausible as a young man’s father. And, most crucially, my voice was more mature by then, and I was better able to tackle the role. I might have felt a little put out by Harewood’s decision, but perhaps I wouldn’t be still singing now if my voice hadn’t been so well protected. Some roles can damage your voice if you sing them too young, or incorrectly; Verdi, especially. I specialised in the lighter younger baritone roles – Figaro in Rossini’s Barber of Seville; Guglielmo in Mozart’s Così Fan Tutte; Papageno. But Beckmesser was a turning point. The Meistersinger’s comic antihero changed my career. I went to Bayreuth to sing the role, and by 1996 I found I was being offered so many international jobs that I decided to leave the safety of the ENO company and the protection of a principal contract to go freelance. These contracts don’t exist today - there’s the young artists’ scheme of course, but when I joined the company there were 45 principals paid a monthly salary, with a pension and National Insurance contributions – the works. We did six or seven different roles a season; in fact we were able to put on huge operas such as Die Meistersinger and The Ring Cycle with just the company principals. It’s incredible to imagine such a situation now. ENO always seems to have lurched from one crisis to another. Government cuts led to a pay freeze in the 70s; in the 80s, the so-called powerhouse era, it enjoyed acclaim and success, but then we did a “Mozart and the 20th-century” season that was not a box-office success. Likewise, a US tour left us financially strained. Then in the 90s there was a rough patch when an overzealous Labour culture minister suggested we be amalgamated with Covent Garden – I made post-curtain call speeches after Falstaff, pleading for support. The removal of Arts Council funding more recently was another crisis, but the company seems to have pulled through that, too, and today feels a happy and even optimistic place. Even in the supposed glory days, there was little sense we were creating surefire successes. I sang Figaro in the first production of Jonathan Miller’s Barber of Seville in 1987, and we all doubted it would make it past these few performances. One director who came to see it remarked, “Ah. A laugh an hour.” But it was revived, and, recast with wonderful comic actors such as Andrew Shore and Richard van Allen, it started to grow and become tighter, and turned into the much-loved production it is now. I sang Figaro for a decade and then, earlier this season, returned to the production after a 20-year gap to sing Dr Bartolo. I remember, as we rehearsed that first ever production, being struck by the sight of a set builder drilling tiny holes into one of the chairs. The designer’s vision was that the furniture would have had woodworm, despite the fact that no one in the audience would have been able to see it! I looked for the holes but they’re not there now – someone must have filled them in. Favourite ENO productions are too many to mention, but I did enjoy being Sancho Panza in Massenet’s Don Quichotte; our horses were huge tricycles with animatronic heads that we would feed carrots. Matthew Warchus’s Falstaff was a highlight, and Miller’s Rigoletto is a masterpiece. His production solves virtually every problem of the opera – and gives the lie to those who say that modernising operas is a fool’s errand. Tom Morris’s great production of John Adams’s controversial Death of Klinghoffer – in which I sang the title role went to New York’s Metropolitan Opera, to great controversy. On opening night in London we had had one single protester outside the Coliseum. In New York the whole plaza was barricaded off: there were 50 people in wheelchairs wearing signs saying “I am Leon Klinghoffer”, and police were stationed inside the theatre. No singer was allowed visitors backstage for the entire run, and we were given a separate exit to leave the theatre. I was on the front page of the New York Daily Post and found myself in a cartoon in the New Yorker. It was staggering, and yet we completed the entire run and it was a huge success. I’ve missed cues (just the once) and been hoist on wires (not the most comfortable experience) and you do have to worry about trapdoors at times, but luckily I’ve never fallen down one. Opera has changed profoundly these last 50 years. Directors now investigate the psychology of their protagonists in ways that may work and sometimes may not, but is recognisably different to when I started out. Updates similarly have worked and have not. And ENO throughout it all has remained committed to singing in English, to be the opera of the vernacular for all audiences. To have an audience understand you immediately and be able to feel that reaction, and play around with it from the stage is something so important to the musical life of the country. This has lasted from the Edwardian days of Lilian Baylis past the invention of the surtitle and will into the future. Some things are worth persisting with. The role of the elder Germont might have taught me something about the passage of time, but I’m not going to lecture anyone else on a career in opera apart from to say: “Take your time.” If you find a good tempo, you may even be lucky enough to be in full breath when you sing your first line. • La Traviata is at the London Coliseum from 16 March to 13 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/mar/13/james-cameron-terminator-plots-franchise-director","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T15:40:48Z","webTitle":"Search and destroy: can James Cameron revive the Terminator by killing its past?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/13/james-cameron-terminator-plots-franchise-director","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/13/james-cameron-terminator-plots-franchise-director","fields":{"headline":"Search and destroy: can James Cameron revive the Terminator by killing its past?","bodyText":"If only we had a time machine like the one used by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s menacing T-800 in 1984’s thrillingly bleak and minimalistic Terminator, the first and arguably best instalment in James Cameron’s sci-fi saga.

The new film is also being pitched as the first in a new trilogy of Terminator movies, all of which will thankfully ignore everything that happened since 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day. That is the last episode with which Cameron had any involvement, beyond his ill-judged hype-man role for Genisys. If you were a massive fan of Kristanna Loken’s feminatrix, or Christian Bale’s super-shouty take on John Connor, you are bang out of luck. Perhaps aware that he hasn’t made good on his promise to bring us a new Avatar film, eight years after announcing the expansion of the 2009 3D space fantasy into a triptych, the Canadian film-maker has recruited Deadpool’s Tim Miller to stand in for him as director while he plans multiple new adventures for the denizens of Pandora and their swishy, USB-compatible tails. News on the first of the new Terminator episodes has been thin on the ground over the past year, but some interesting snippets have now leaked out. The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Mackenzie Davis, of Blade Runner 2049 and the head-spinning San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, will play a soldier-assassin type on a mission in the new episode. T6 will be set partly in Mexico City, and producers are said to be looking for a Latino actor for a big role. Relocating the saga from its California base sounds promising, not least because it might signal an end to the constant obsession with Judgment Day that has arguably ruined each episode since T2. Every screenwriter since 1991 has seemed to think that a set date for the machine apocalypse is an essential part of the Terminator mythos, leaving us with a conveyor belt of cyborgs and mad dashes to avert the end of days. (Unless one counts the post-apocalyptic Terminator Salvation, which managed to be even more hideous by showing us what happens after the machines destroy civilisation.) Yet the last time we saw them, in 1991, John and Sarah Connor appeared to have destroyed Cyberdyne’s big laboratory and therefore averted the likelihood of Skynet achieving self-awareness. Surely their next step would have been to warn the world about the dangers of putting nuclear weapons in the hands of artificial intelligence, thereby averting Judgment Day for ever? The three failed Terminator movies since T2 have taught us that the truly fascinating period to be explored is the one just before the machines take over. It is no coincidence that shows such as Westworld and Humans, as well as movies such as Ex Machina, all take place in a future that still looks remarkably like the present. By removing Judgment Day from the equation, and replacing it with a slow-burning march towards the machine apocalypse, Terminator can remain within this fascinating purple patch for as long as possible, rather than smacking us round the chops with an irreversible big bang that requires a narrative reset with each new movie. Where this would leave Schwarzenegger, without the need for him to turn up as yet another friendly version of the T-800, is open to question. But if Cameron really is insisting on trotting out his old pal one last time, it would be thrilling to see him restored to the role of merciless robot menace that made the original Terminator such a frozen-hearted, steely joy. Imagine emerging naked from our time machine a few years hence to discover that the film-maker and his team had produced a trilogy of grim and minimalistic entries, packed with fresh ideas and as terrifyingly stark and grounded as the saga once was. One wonders, in an era in which cerebral sci-fi such as Alex Garland’s excellent Annihilation cannot even get a theatrical release outside the US, whether such an outcome is possible. The odds are probably against it, but they were also against Sarah Connor back in 1984. And she still managed to crush that evil Arnie-shaped metal abomination in a hydraulic press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/mar/13/tracy-beaker-please-never-grow-up-jacqueline-wilson-raymond-briggs","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T11:19:24Z","webTitle":"Tracy Beaker, please never grow up | Claire Armitstead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/13/tracy-beaker-please-never-grow-up-jacqueline-wilson-raymond-briggs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/13/tracy-beaker-please-never-grow-up-jacqueline-wilson-raymond-briggs","fields":{"headline":"Tracy Beaker, please never grow up","bodyText":"Stop the world, I want to get off. On 10 March, it was announced that Tracy Beaker has grown up and become a single mum, in a sequel to Jacqueline Wilson’s beloved trilogy aimed at adults and teenagers as well as preteens. And now it’s been revealed that Raymond Briggs’s Snowman is flying towards a similar fate with a retelling by the (admittedly admirable) Michael Morpurgo that will transport the chubby, satsuma-nosed heart-melter to a “chapter book” for “a new and older audience”. A chapter book! I ask you! The whole point of The Snowman is that there are no words. He exists in the magical space that enfolds parents and the smallest children, who are just beginning to find a vocabulary to harness their chaotic, ardent emotions to the communal world of storytelling. When the Snowman tucks Arthur under his arm (obviously it’s Arthur, that’s my son’s name) and carries him high above the rooftops, it is to show him the world so he can describe it for himself. All these years on, my eyes well up thinking about it (though a friend who’s still in the pre-school zone thinks the odd word might be nice: “I know interraction’s the point, but sometimes you just want to zone out while you read...”) Then there’s Tracy Beaker. Different child, different age group, but as the mother of a one-time uber-fan, I spent years hanging out by proxy with this witty, scratchy care-home kid, along with Bed and Breakfast Star, the Suitcase Kid and Dolphin, the girl with the excessively illustrated mum. Wilson’s stories of brave children surviving against the longest of odds brought debate to the tea table and – sometimes – tears before bed. The new book, Wilson revealed, will be narrated from the perspective of Jess, daughter of Tracy, who is now a single mum living on a housing estate. The novel will be aimed at her traditional seven-to-11-year-old fanbase and at the grownups many of them have become in the 27 years since Tracy’s first appearance. “A knowing teenager or an adult will read something and understand it, while it will go straight over Jess’s head,” she said. I am appalled. I know JK Rowling and Philip Pullman have managed this transition successfully, ageing their child heroes into adulthood to highly lucrative effect. But Harry Potter just grew that way, and His Dark Materials was never purely literature for children, while the whole point of Wilson’s novels is that they, defiantly, gloriously are. “It’s certainly a chunky, meaty book,” Wilson said of her new project. But consider the economy of this, from the opening pages of the first Beaker book: Things I like My lucky number is seven. So why didn’t I get fostered by a fantastic rich family when I was seven then? My favourite colour is blood red, so watch out, ha-ha. My best friend is Well, I’ve had heaps and heaps, but Louise has gone off with Justine and now I haven’t got anyone just at the moment. It fits the whole world of a seven-to-11-year-old on to the head of a pin, sharply and apparently effortlessly encapsulating what Freud called the latency stage – the passionate friendships, the devastating betrayals, the growing disillusion with mum and dad. (That “now I haven’t got anyone just at the moment” is almost Beckettian in its use of syntax to convey pathos.) How can I quote it? Because I still have the book – alongside Peter Pan, The Little White Horse and The Snowman – as a memento of a precious period of family life. My children passed through it without looking back, but I like to return every now and then, as I’m sure they will too, one day, if they have children of their own. When they do, they will see it differently. So please, Tracy Beaker, never grow up. You’re perfect just the way you are."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/14/brexiteers-bleating-offering-no-solutions-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T14:53:06Z","webTitle":"'Brexiteers bleating, offering no solutions': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/14/brexiteers-bleating-offering-no-solutions-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/14/brexiteers-bleating-offering-no-solutions-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'Brexiteers bleating, offering no solutions': your best comments today","bodyText":"Warnings of post-Brexit holiday disruption, political reaction to the Salisbury spy poisonings, and George Monbiot’s piece on feeling happy despite his prostrate cancer diagnosis have dominated discussion among our readers today.

We’ll no longer be in the EU after 29 March 2019. All EU negotiated international agreements will no longer apply to the UK from that point, as the UK will then be a non-EU state. So even if we agree a deal to fly into the EU27 (which will almost certainly be worse than the deal we have now), we still won’t have any international treaties. That’s why airlines are relocating to the EU. The UK tried to renegotiate Open Skies with the USA, but they offered us a worse deal, so we walked away from the talks in January. Just one of many, many issues that Brexit will deliver to the UK.

SanPaolo UK expels 23 Russian diplomats over spy poisoning Some reaction to our rolling coverage of political developments, including Theresa May’s Commons statement announcing retaliation against Russia after the Russian spy attack: ‘May’s ultimatum may well have been impossible for them to answer’ Theresa May is correct that it seems ‘highly likely’ that the Russian state is behind this nerve agent attack, but ‘highly likely’ is not evidential proof, and it is reasonable for the Russian government to want to see the evidence and for this evidence to be independently verified. This nerve agent is said to have been developed many decades ago. During the 1990s the Russian state descended into dysfunctional, crime ridden anarchy. It is quite possible that some of this nerve agent ‘went missing’ during this period, which would have been facilitated by its binary nature of existing in the form of two harmless separate powders that only become deadly when mixed together. Should this have happened during that chaotic period when many major crimes were being committed in Russia that remain unresolved, it is quite possible that the current government and its leaders do not know what happened to all of its nerve agent stocks. This being the case May’s ultimatum may well have been impossible for them to answer. To issue threats in such circumstances is provocative and unreasonable. justapleb ‘May was put in a difficult situation’ If her action was dramatic, such as expelling the ambassador or a broad seizure of assets, commenters and pundits would be screaming that she’s overreacting. May was put in a difficult situation. As it is, she went for a more moderate approach and the accusations are that she’s too “soft” and beholden to Russian donors (putting aside the fact that many of those Russians in the UK who donate to the Conservative Party are themselves not loved by Putin). In both cases Russia and the NRA have him by the balls. elti97 I have prostate cancer. But I am happy “The principles that define a good life protect me from despair”, writes George Monbiot, despite his diagnosis and the grisly operation he now faces. ‘I remember only feeling completely confident that I was getting excellent care’ Best wishes for the difficult time ahead George. I had the operation 6 years ago and felt only some discomfort, no pain. I was only in hospital overnight and recovered quickly. My PSA levels indicate no spread of the cancer. Looking back I remember only feeling completely confident that I was getting excellent care, before, during and since the operation at St. James’s hospital, Leeds.

I decided that I would have a prostatectomy, rather than radiotherapy, for much the same reasons as George, only less well expressed. I had my prostate removed a week ago in a robotic-assisted laparoscopic operation. I have now recovered fully from the operation, even though there was a small bit of post-operative bleeding. I have the catheter inserted during the operation removed today. Throughout the whole process I have had the most amazing support from my wife, my family, friends, doctors, and people I never met before, with help and advice on some of the most intimate issues. I am sure that the support will continue as the weeks and months pass by and things return to something approaching normal; I have accepted that they will never be the same again, but the sun came up this morning, and I expect it to do the same tomorrow, so all is not lost. walking1 ‘It’d be interesting to determine if the high prostate cancer numbers have been stable throughout antiquity’ As a point of interest, a study published in European Urology found that ejaculating 21 times or more per month significantly reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Something to think about, fellas. It’d be interesting to determine if the high prostate cancer numbers have been stable throughout antiquity, or have risen in the past century or so from some as yet undetermined environmental factor such as heavy metals.

The name, meaning “newcomer”, refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons. Like other nerve agents, they are organophosphate compounds, but the chemicals used to make novichoks, and their final structures, are considered classified in the UK, the US and other countries. By making the novichoks in secret, from benign chemicals normally used for insecticides and the like, the Soviet Union aimed to manufacture them without interference. “Much less is known about the novichoks than the other nerve agents,” said Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at the University of Leeds who investigated the use of chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds in Halabja in 1988. “They are not widely used at all.” The most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than VX, the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents, which also include sarin, tabun and soman. And while the novichoks work in a similar way to these, by massively overstimulating muscles and glands, one chemical weapons expert told the Guardian that novichoks do not degrade fast in the environment and have “an additional toxicity”. “That extra toxicity is not well understood, so I understand why people were asked to wash their clothes, even if it was present only in traces,” he said. Treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents, with atropine, diazepam and drugs called oximes. The chemical structures of the main weaponised novichok agents were made public in 2008 by Vil Mirzayanov, a former Russian scientist living in the US, but the structures have never been publicly confirmed. It is thought that they can be made in different forms, including a dust aerosol that would be easy to disperse. The novichoks are known as binary agents because they become lethal only after two relatively harmless components are mixed together. This means that labs do not have to build stockpiles of ready-made nerve agents but can mix them up from unrestricted chemicals as and when needed. According to Mirzayanov, the most potent of the agents are 10 to 100 times more toxic than the conventional nerve agents. The fact that so little is known about the novichoks may explain why Porton Down scientists took several days to identify the compound used in the attack against the Skripals. And while the agents were invented in the Soviet Union, other labs with access to the chemical structures would be able to manufacture them too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/13/kitty-hawk-autonomous-drone-flying-taxi-service-regulatory-approval-google-larry-page","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T11:42:17Z","webTitle":"Larry Page's Kitty Hawk unveils autonomous flying taxis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/13/kitty-hawk-autonomous-drone-flying-taxi-service-regulatory-approval-google-larry-page","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/13/kitty-hawk-autonomous-drone-flying-taxi-service-regulatory-approval-google-larry-page","fields":{"headline":"Larry Page's Kitty Hawk unveils autonomous flying taxis","bodyText":"Autonomous flying taxis just took one big step forward to leaping off the pages of science fiction and into the real world, thanks to Google co-founder Larry Page’s Kitty Hawk. The billionaire-backed firm has announced that it will begin the regulatory approval process required for launching its autonomous passenger-drone system in New Zealand, after conducting secret testing under the cover of another company called Zephyr Airworks. The firm’s two-person craft, called Cora, is a 12-rotor plane-drone hybrid that can take off vertically like a drone, but then uses a propeller at the back to fly at up to 110 miles an hour for around 62 miles at a time. The all-electric Cora flies autonomously up to 914 metres (3,000ft) above ground, has a wingspan of 11 metres, and has been eight years in the making. “Designing an air taxi for everyday life means bringing the airport to you. That’s why Cora can take off and land like a helicopter, eliminating the need for runways,” says Kitty Hawk. “Cora has the potential to transform spaces like rooftops and parking lots into places to take off right from your neighbourhood.” Kitty Hawk is personally financed by Page and is being run by former Google autonomous car director Sebastian Thrun. The company is trying to beat Uber and others to launching an autonomous flying taxi service. The company hopes to have official certification and to have launched a commercial service within three years, which will make it the first to do so. But its achievement will also propel New Zealand to the front of the pack as the first country to devise a certification process. The country’s aviation authority is well respected in the industry, and is seen as pioneering. Kitty Hawk is already working on an app and technology to allow customers to hail flying taxis as they would an Uber, but whether Page, Thrun and their team will actually be able to deliver within three years remains to be seen. Many companies have promised great leaps but failed to deliver meaningful progress towards a Jetsons-like future, from Uber’s Elevate to China’s Ehang. Even if Kitty Hawk hits all its projected milestones and launches commercially, there’s then the matter of persuading people to actually use it. “Cora will combine self-flying software with expert human supervision, so you can enjoy the ride,” says the company, which has fitted three independent flight systems, made the rotors operate independently and given Cora a parachute in case things go wrong.

In its latest interim forecasts, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it expected the world economy to expand by 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019 – a 0.3 percentage point upgrade in each year from its last set of predictions last November. The OECD said investment, trade and employment were all playing a part in a broad-based expansion that has prompted growth upgrades for six of the seven G7 countries. US tax cuts, announced by Trump since the OECD’s November forecasts, were one reason why the growth outlook was stronger than it was four months ago, the thinktank said. “Growth is steady or improving in most G20 countries and the expansion is continuing,” said OECD acting chief economist Alvaro Pereira. Pereira added that Trump’s recently announced tariffs – 25% on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminium – had left the global economy vulnerable to a tit-for-tat trade war. “This could obviously threaten the recovery. Certainly we believe this is a significant risk, so we hope that it doesn’t materialise because it would be fairly damaging,” Pereira said. Pereira said the imposition of tariffs by the White House was the wrong way of dealing with the global problem of excess steel production and called for Trump to seek a collective solution through the OECD. “Safeguarding the rules-based international trading system is key,” he added. The boost to demand provided by Trump’s tax cuts has meant that the OECD has revised up its forecast for US growth by 0.4 points to 2.9% in 2018 and by 0.7 points to 2.8% in 2019. However, it believes faster growth in the world’s biggest economy will result in four increases in interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, this year. The OECD also revised up its forecasts for Germany and France, but remained gloomy about the prospects for Britain as it approaches the date for Brexit in March 2019. Tax cuts included in the deal that has pieced together a coalition government in Germany were seen as lifting growth in the eurozone’s biggest economy to 2.4% this year, up 0.1 points on November, and to 2.2% in 2019 (up by 0.3 points). Emmanuel Macron’s social welfare, tax and labour market reforms would help France narrow the gap with Germany, the thinktank said, with growth forecast at an 11-year high of 2.2% before easing to 1.9% in 2019. French growth has been revised up by 0.4 points in 2018 and by 0.2 points in 2019. For the eurozone as a whole, growth is put at 2.3% this year and 2.1% in 2019, a 0.2 point upgrade in each year. The thinktank believes the UK economy will expand by 1.3% this year, up from 1.2% in November, and by an unchanged 1.1% in 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/mar/13/black-panther-gringo-wonder-wheel-uk-box-office","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T12:32:56Z","webTitle":"Black Panther still purring at UK box office as it passes $1bn worldwide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/13/black-panther-gringo-wonder-wheel-uk-box-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/13/black-panther-gringo-wonder-wheel-uk-box-office","fields":{"headline":"Black Panther still purring at UK box office as it passes $1bn worldwide","bodyText":"The winner: Black Panther A commercially impotent set of new releases last Friday ensured that Black Panther remained unchallenged at the top of the UK box office for a fourth week, with weekend box office of £2.93m. After 27 days, the title’s cumulative box office has reached £39.8m – ahead of the lifetime total of every Marvel film accept Avengers Assemble (£51.9m) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (£48.3m). Globally, Black Panther passed the $1bn barrier at the weekend, boosted by a solid opening in China ($66m). In the US, it’s reached a mighty $562m, making it the seventh biggest film of all time for the territory, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avatar, Titanic, Jurassic World, Marvel’s The Avengers (as it was called there) and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The runner-up: The Greatest Showman Going back up to second place in its 11th week of release, The Greatest Showman saw box office rise by 26% from the previous session, boosted by singalong screenings on Mother’s Day (Sunday 11 March). The Hugh Jackman musical has now delivered 11 consecutive weekends with box office above £1m – an extremely rare feat. Total is £37.3m, which is an impressive 14.5 times the opening weekend number. Also going back up the chart: The Shape of Water, with box office up 31% from the previous weekend, on the back of its Oscar wins; and Mother’s Day-friendly grey-pound romance Finding Your Feet, up 22%. The new challenger: Gringo Remarkably, only one new film was released wider than 300 cinemas at the weekend – Gringo – and it landed in a rather dismal 13th place. This means that there are no new films in the UK Top 10 for the first time since mid-December 2015, when essentially nothing opened the week prior to the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This coming session sees the arrival of both Tomb Raider and Peter Rabbit, but neither are titles that would blow all existing films out of the water, so it’s not clear why so many UK distributors gave the 9 March release date a wide berth. Gringo opened with £215,000 from 423 cinemas, yielding an anaemic site average of £508. British wrestling-themed comedy Walk Like a Panther did even worse: £91,000 from 222 venues, for a £411 average. The arthouse alternative: You Were Never Really Here Grossing almost as much at the weekend as Gringo, but in less than a fifth of its cinemas is Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, with £211,000 from 77 sites. Previews push the Joaquin Phoenix starrer to £288,000, and thus above Gringo in the chart. Ramsay’s last film was all the way back in October 2011: We Need to Talk About Kevin. The dark family drama debuted with £492,000 from 111 cinemas, including £33,000 in previews, eventually reaching a total of £2.22m. Distributor StudioCanal will presumably expand You Were Never Really Here this weekend, but the film has a long way to go to catch Kevin. The flop: Wonder Wheel In August 1992, Woody Allen was accused of sexual assault by his daughter Dylan Farrow, then aged seven, but the investigating state attorney did not press charges. In the intervening years, Allen has enjoyed significant hits including Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Blue Jasmine, also earning nine Oscar nominations in this period. However, the #MeToo movement and the repeated claim by Farrow had the potential to cast the case in a different light, and the release of Allen’s latest film, Wonder Wheel, was always going to be a vital litmus test of public opinion. Confusing the matter somewhat is the fact that reviews have been soft (45/100 at MetaCritic), and distributor Warner Bros’ marketing campaign less than muscular. Wonder Wheel has opened in the UK with a very poor £43,000 from 134 cinemas, yielding a £321 site average. This compares with a debut of £494,000 from 186 venues for his previous feature Café Society in September 2016. The difference between those two numbers must give concern to financiers and distribution partners on Allen’s next film A Rainy Day in New York, which is set to premiere this year. The market Thanks to the lack of commercially appealing new releases, overall box office is down 17% on the previous session, and is also down 27% on the equivalent weekend from 2017, when Kong: Skull Island topped the chart on its debut. Cinemas are crying out for fresh product, and will have hopes pinned on the Tomb Raider reboot, Beatrix Potter adaptation Peter Rabbit and Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix in Mary Magdalene. Arthouse cinemas will be betting big on Cannes Palme d’Or winner The Square. Top 10 films March 9-11 1. Black Panther, £2,931,682 from 585 sites. Total: £39,830,023 (four weeks) 2.

Cover with water, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat straight away. Simmer gently for three to four hours, until the meat is tender enough to pull out the bone. Make the parsley sauce: in a small pan, boil the milk with the parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns and shallot. Leave to rest for 10 minutes. Melt the butter and mix with the flour gently for five minutes over a gentle heat. Add this to the milk, mix with the mustard and the double cream, and stir until smooth. Continue stirring for 10 minutes, until thick and not lumpy. Season and set aside again. For the cabbage, melt the butter in the pan, add the onion and cook until softened but not coloured. Add a splash of water and the cabbage, cover and steam until slightly wilted. Remove from the heat, set aside until cool, then seperate the leaves and shred. To serve, lift the ham from its liquid, drain then slice finely. Serve on a bed of shredded cabbage with a dollop of parsley sauce. Buttered crab and mushrooms on toast Prep 15 min Cook 15 min Serves 2-4 100g wild mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed and sliced Olive oil 1 small bunch samphire 2 tbsp white wine 2 tbsp white wine vinegar 100g butter, diced and softened (for 30 minutes at room temperature) 200g fresh crab meat Salt and black pepper 4 slices soda bread Cook the mushrooms in a little olive oil. If they release a lot of moisture, let it evaporate so the flavour becomes concentrated. When tender, add the samphire and cook for another minute or two. Set aside and keep warm. Put the wine and vinegar into a non-reactive saucepan over a high heat, and reduce the mixture quickly by half. Lower the heat and whisk in the butter, one cube at a time, until you have a nicely emulsified sauce, then take off the heat and add the crab, salt and pepper. Meanwhile, put the soda bread under a hot grill to toast. Spoon the mushrooms on to the slices of toasted soda bread, top with the crab mix and serve at once. Irish stew Prep 20 min Cook About 3 hr Serves 4 2-3 medium necks of lamb, filleted and boned (reserve the bones for the stock) For the stew 550g floury potatoes, such as King Edward, peeled and chopped 550g waxy potatoes, such as Maris Piper or Pentland Javelin, peeled and chopped to a similar size as above 500g carrots, peeled and chopped to a slightly smaller size than the potatoes 500g swede, peeled and chopped to the same size as the carrots ½ tsp fresh thyme leaves Salt and black pepper Fresh chives, thyme or parsley, chopped, to garnish For the stock Lamb bones 1 carrot ½ onion 1 celery stick 1 handful parsley stalks 10 black peppercorns 1 sprig rosemary 1 bay leaf 1 sprig thyme For the stock, put everything into a deep saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover, then bring to a boil and simmer on a medium heat for at least two hours. Sieve the stock to remove the bones and vegetables, then return to the pan, boil and reduce to obtain one litre of liquid. Cut the lamb into large chunks and put in a large saucepan. Add the stock and bring to a boil, skimming any impurities that rise to the top, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Keep the two types of potatoes separate. Add the floury potatoes first, along with the carrots and swede, to the lamb pot and continue simmering for 10 minutes. Stir, then add the waxy potatoes. Season, add thyme and simmer for a further 15 minutes, until the lamb is soft. Take off the heat and leave to rest for 10 minutes before serving, garnished with your choice of fresh herbs. Garlic baked oysters Prep 10 min Cook 5 min Serves 1-2 6 rock oysters 100g unsalted butter 2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 1 tsp parsley leaves, chopped Zest of 1 lemon 50g fine breadcrumbs Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Open the oysters and discard any excess liquid. Mix the butter with the chopped garlic, parsley and lemon zest until well combined. Put a knob of the garlic butter on each oyster and cover in breadcrumbs, then bake until golden brown for five minutes. Serve at once. Soda bread Prep 10 min Cook 45 min Makes 1 large loaf 250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tsp salt 2 ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda 250g wholemeal flour 150g jumbo oat flakes 1 tbsp clear honey 1 tbsp black treacle 500ml buttermilk (or milk) Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Make a well in the centre, then pour in the honey, treacle and buttermilk, working the mix together lightly to obtain a loose, wet dough. With floured hands, shape into a round and lift on to the baking sheet. Mark a cross in the top with a knife and bake for around 45 minutes, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on its base. Transfer to a wire rack, drape with a slightly damp cloth and leave to cool. Colcannon soup Prep 10 min Cook 40 min Serves 4 2 tbsp butter 1 large onion, peeled and chopped 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 250g potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced Ham or chicken stock, enough to cover the vegetables 1 bouquet garni 1 head kale or cabbage, shredded 300ml double cream, plus extra to drizzle Salt and black pepper To serve (optional) Grilled dry-cured bacon Toasted soda bread Heat the butter in a large saucepan, add the onion, garlic and potatoes and cook gently for five minutes without colouring. Pour over enough stock to cover the vegetables, add the bouquet garni and season. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the kale or cabbage to the soup bring back to a boil, then take off the heat. Whizz everything up in a blender. Put back on the hob, add the cream and check the seasoning.

The head of the International Monetary Fund said authorities around the world could harness the potential of cryptocurrencies to help bring them under control, warning that failure to do so would allow the unfettered development of a “potentially major new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism”. Writing in an IMF blogpost, Lagarde said the same innovations that powered cryptocurrencies could be used to help regulate them. “We can harness the potential of crypto-assets while ensuring that they never become a haven for illegal activity or a source of financial vulnerability.” Distributed ledger technology, which enables the authentication of transactions without them needing to be administered or guaranteed by a central authority, could be used to speed up information sharing between regulators to improve their monitoring of the financial system. She said the developments driving cryptocurrencies, including blockchain, were exciting advances which could help revolutionise financial services by providing low-cost payment methods for those who did not have bank accounts. However, she said, there was “peril that comes along with the promise”. Lagarde is the latest senior financial figure to issue a warning over the potential dangers of bitcoin, as well as to hail the potential of the technology behind it. Backers of bitcoin have said the technology has the potential to make everyday payments easier and cheaper. However, economists have said the digital currency represents a dangerous speculative bubble. Lagarde said cryptocurrencies could cause new vulnerabilities to develop in the world’s financial system, illustrated by its rapid growth and volatile price swings. Bitcoin, the best known of thousands of digital currencies developed in recent years, gained in value by more than 900% last year to hit almost $20,000 (£14,400) a unit before Christmas, but has since crashed to less than half that. It was worth almost $9,300 in early trading on Tuesday. Swings in value of anywhere up to 30% are common, raising the prospect of massive gains or losses for investors. “It would not be wise to dismiss crypto-assets; we must welcome their potential but also recognise their risks,” Lagarde said. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said earlier this month that bitcoin faces a regulatory crackdown, but praised the technology’s potential. He said anarchy could not reign in cryptocurrency trading, and that the currencies had so far failed to fulfil their most basic function: as money. The Bank will present a report to the G20 in Argentina this month, with Carney hinting at greater controls and detailing how the central bank has tested ways to use the technology in the British payments system. Carney has said, however, that it is unlikely at this stage that international action will be taken to regulate digital currencies, meaning the task will fall to individual countries. So far countries including China, Russia and South Korea have moved to introduce greater controls over the trading of digital currencies, often triggering sharp falls in their value. However, the G20 has put cryptocurrencies on the agenda for a November summit, which Lagarde suggested could lead to greater international collaboration. She said cooperation between countries would be vital for staging an effective crackdown in future because cryptocurrencies have no borders. She cited as an example of international coordination, the closure of the online criminal marketplace AlphaBay, which accepted cryptocurrency payments. Before the site was taken offline, more than $1bn had been exchanged through digital currencies, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/13/civil-service-fast-stream-favours-private-school-applicants-says-mp","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T11:02:12Z","webTitle":"Civil service fast stream favours private school applicants, says MP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/13/civil-service-fast-stream-favours-private-school-applicants-says-mp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/13/civil-service-fast-stream-favours-private-school-applicants-says-mp","fields":{"headline":"Civil service fast stream favours private school applicants, says MP","bodyText":"The civil service’s elite fast-stream recruitment system disproportionately attracts and favours applicants from private school backgrounds, and has done so increasingly in recent years, the Labour MP Dan Jarvis has said. Cabinet Office figures sent to Jarvis in response to parliamentary questions show that over the last four years of data, the proportion of private school applicants to the fast stream – the traditional route to top civil service jobs – was roughly a fifth, about three times the proportion who attend such schools in the UK. The figures also show that even as the proportion of applicants from fee-paying schools fell slightly between 2013 and 2016 – from 20.5% to 18.9% – the percentage of successful applicants rose from 23.5% to 28.6%. The civil service has attempted in recent years to become more inclusive in its fast-stream application process, which begins with online tests and generally takes months of assessments to complete. Jarvis, the Barnsley Central MP, said the figures showed there was much more work to be done. “Despite claiming that the fast stream uses ‘targeted outreach’ methods to attract applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds, young people from fee-paying schools are four times more overrepresented than those from state schools,” he said. “Not only is this morally wrong, but recruitment bias in favour of the privately educated reduces the pool of talent that the civil service fast stream recruits from; reduces the diversity of experience and opinion in its leadership; and reduces the effectiveness of government decision-making. “These figures show that the Conservative government is failing in its promise to deliver a more effective and representative civil service, and is instead accelerating the careers of the privileged few.” The Cabinet Office figures showed that in 2013, 20.5% of fast-stream applicants were from private school backgrounds, compared with 23.5% of successful candidates. The equivalent figures for the following years were 19% applicants and 23% successful in 2014; 19.1% applicants and 25.2% successful in 2015; and 18.9% of the applicants and 28.6% of the successful entrants in 2016. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the fast-stream programme had won official commendation for its contribution to social mobility. “We are working hard to continually improve the diversity of our recruitment processes and our summer diversity internship programme is just one example giving young people from diverse backgrounds an insight into the huge range of opportunities a career in the civil service offers,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/mar/13/david-squires-on-west-hams-chaotic-cauldron-of-infighting","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T10:45:37Z","webTitle":"David Squires on … West Ham's chaotic cauldron of infighting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/mar/13/david-squires-on-west-hams-chaotic-cauldron-of-infighting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/mar/13/david-squires-on-west-hams-chaotic-cauldron-of-infighting","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on … West Ham's chaotic cauldron of infighting","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/13/no-footfall-salisbury-shops-feel-effects-spy-attack-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T10:40:56Z","webTitle":"‘People are scared’: Salisbury’s shops feel effects of spy attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/no-footfall-salisbury-shops-feel-effects-spy-attack-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/no-footfall-salisbury-shops-feel-effects-spy-attack-skripal","fields":{"headline":"‘People are scared’: Salisbury’s shops feel effects of spy attack","bodyText":"Salisbury’s historic charter market is usually bustling on Tuesdays. Asked how trade was this week, Colin Hinton summed it up in one word: “Crap.” The butcher has braved the weather for half a century to serve customers at the open-air market but, despite the warm March sunshine, Hinton said it was the quietest it had ever been. “I’ve never seen it like this. I can only conclude that people are staying away because they are scared,” he said. On the hat stall, Dave Alexander had arranged some panama hats in neat rows, believing the warm weather would turn shoppers’ thoughts to long summer days when such headwear is needed. “It’s been a dreadful day, exceptionally quiet,” said Alexander, who has been working on the market since he was a boy. “I imagine people are scared. I think we need more reassurance. The fact that they told people almost a week later to wash their clothes has made people think that perhaps there is something to worry about.” Some stores around the Maltings shopping centre remain closed as police investigate the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, and businesses that have remained open say shoppers are staying away. Danny Styles, who has a fruit and veg stall in the Maltings, was in a grim mood. “The day after it happened all was normal,” he said. “But as soon as they mentioned nerve agent, business has completely dropped off. People don’t think it’s worth the risk to come in. I lost £180 on Thursday and £140 on Friday.” Styles’s stall would normally be within the area the police have cordoned off, so he has moved around the corner into a slightly quieter spot. “First we had the snow here, then the Russian spy. Hopefully the sun will come out soon and the spies will clear off and we can get on with our lives.” Annette Mansfield, who works at Stonehenge Tailoring in the Maltings, said the message that Salisbury was still operating needed to be communicated more clearly. “It’s been dreadful. People don’t know which bits are open and which are closed,” she said. Judy Bristowe, who was to be found on the Swan Rescue Sanctuary stall in the Maltings, had brought along a spotted eagle owl called Dill to try to cheer people up and generate interest. “It’s so bad. There’s no footfall,” she said. “I thought I’d bring Dill down here, which always gets a bit of attention, just to let people know we’re still here. I think it’s going to take us quite a while before people realise it’s safe to come back in.” The problem prompted the Salisbury Journal and Salisbury Business Improvement District to launch a “Salisbury is open” campaign. The Zizzi restaurant, where the Skripals ate before the attack, remains cordoned off. The mother of one Zizzi worker said on Facebook that staff had not suffered any ill effects. The company issued a statement expressing shock and sadness. “Our thoughts are with the victims, their friends and family, and everyone in the Salisbury community who has been affected by this attack, as well as the police and emergency services who have been working tirelessly across the last seven days,” it said. “Zizzi Salisbury remains closed as part of the ongoing police investigation. Our priority is to ensure the wellbeing of our team and support our Zizzi Salisbury customers, as well as continuing to do everything we can to help the police. “We are fully supporting our Zizzi team members, and our team will continue to receive full payment while the Salisbury restaurant is closed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/13/quiche-in-pork-pies-out-uk-inflation-goods-basket-changes2018","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T12:56:11Z","webTitle":"Quiche in, pork pies out!

UK inflation goods basket changes for 2018","bodyText":"Women’s activewear leggings, quiche and raspberries are in vogue while pork pies and bottles of lager drunk in nightclubs are out, in the annual shakeup of the UK’s official shopping basket. Gym leggings, made popular by athleisure brands such as Beyoncé’s Ivy Park, have been added to the basket used by the Office for National Statistics to measure inflation. “Action cameras” such as GoPros are now also included, as people film themselves during extreme sports and other activities. With more soft play areas opening across the country, children’s soft play sessions have made it into the basket for the first time. Sit and ride toys such as ride-on cars and Wheely Bugs have replaced traditional tricycles, which are being sold in fewer shops. Phil Gooding, an ONS senior statistician, said: “Over a period of time there has been a trend towards healthier living. Last year we added men’s base layers which you wear under sports clothes.” Last year also saw the inclusion of cycling helmets, gin and non-dairy milk, as hipster culture became more mainstream. This year, after the closure of a number of nightclubs across the UK in recent years, the “bottle of lager in a nightclub” has been dropped. Other items added to the 2018 basket include girls’ leggings and body moisturising lotion – complementing facial cream, which is already included. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at consultancy KPMG, said: “Health and wellbeing is a key macro theme – the whole topic around athleisure, and yoga bottoms drive into that. “Health and beauty is one of the fastest-growing categories [in retail sales]. Generally in times of reduced consumer spend and pressure on disposable consumer incomes people want to treat themselves to look good, and spend more on facial creams and makeup.” This is known as the lipstick effect – consumers opting for affordable treats rather than splashing out on big-ticket items such as furniture. Quiche and raspberries have been added to the basket for the first time, while pork pies and edam cheese are out, reflecting Britons’ changing eating habits. Waitrose said its quiche and raspberry sales were up 15% in the past week, year on year, after it expanded its range to include gluten-free quiche. Michelle Slade, the delicatessen buyer at the supermarket, said: “Quiche Lorraine was the epitome of food sophistication in the 70s. It is now seeing a revival.” Gooding said the trend for ready-made meals also continued. Chilled mashed potato has made it into the inflation basket, about 30 years after dried mashed potato such as Smash was dropped. Waitrose said its prepared mash sales were up 14% in the past week. The pasty and pie category has given way to the more broadly defined cooked pastry-based savoury snack, reflecting the wider range available at takeaway outlets such as Greggs. Peaches and nectarines, which are available for only eight months of the year, have been removed, leaving avocados and plums to represent stone fruit. Leg waxing and ATM charges have also been dropped. High chairs have been added to represent nursery furniture, nearly two decades after cots exited the shopping basket. The basket also reflects the rapid pace of technological change. The rise of the smartphone means digital camcorders have been ousted, while digital media players such as Chromecast and Apple TV have replaced digital TV recorders and receivers such as Sky and Freeview boxes. Smaller televisions have made way for larger, 39- or 40-in-plus screens. Martin said the status symbols of old, such as expensive cameras and camcorders, had been replaced by smartphones. “It’s your life bundle, with so many functionalities,” he added. Gooding said 36 items were changed this year out of a total basket of 714. The ONS updates the basket of goods and services once a year to reflect changes in shopping habits, and uses it to calculate inflation. The headline inflation rate was 3% in January compared with 1.8% a year ago, indicating the increasing squeeze on living costs.

Levine was suspended in December 2017 when the allegations were first made public. The 74-year-old conductor, who made his Met debut in 1971, denies the claims. Levine was appointed the company’s music director in 1976, and stepped down two years ago due to ill health, taking the title music director emeritus and heading up the young artists’ programme. Between 1986 and 2004, he was the Met’s artistic director. The Met said that more than 70 people were interviewed in their investigation. “The investigation uncovered credible evidence that Mr Levine had engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct both before and during the period when he worked at the Met,” the company said in a statement. “The investigation also uncovered credible evidence that Mr Levine engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct towards vulnerable artists in the early stages of their careers, over whom Mr Levine had authority. In light of these findings, the Met concludes that it would be inappropriate and impossible for Mr Levine to continue to work at the Met.” Levine has not been charged with any criminal offence. The Lake County state’s attorney’s office in Illinois said in December it investigated a sexual abuse allegation of misconduct dating to the 1980s but concluded “no criminal charges can be brought”, citing multiple factors, including “the relevant age of consent in Illinois at the time of the alleged incidents.” The Met said in its statement: “The investigation also found that any claims or rumours that members of the Met’s management or its board of directors engaged in a cover-up of information relating to these issues are completely unsubstantiated.” A representative of Levine’s did not respond to Associated Press’s request for comment. Levine previously said in a statement: “As anyone who truly knows me will attest, I have not lived my life as an oppressor or an aggressor.” Following the death of Leonard Bernstein in 1990, Levine was regarded as the leading American conductor and was given a starring role in the film Fantasia 2000. Many of his performances were televised by PBS, and singers would rearrange their schedules to appear in his performances or to audition for him. In addition to roles at the Met, he was music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s Ravinia festival from 1973-93 and the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 2004-11, and chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic from 1999-2004. He frequently conducted at the Vienna Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, Bayreuth festival and Salzburg festival. The appointment of Yannick Nézet-Séguin as music director was announced two years ago; last month the Met announced that his tenure had been brought forward and was to begin next season. “While this termination of the Met’s relationship with Levine obviously brings a certain degree of closure, it is our hope that the Met’s early introduction of Yannick Nézet-Séguin portends a willingness to invest more robustly both in talent and creating a healthy workplace culture,” clarinetist Jessica Phillips, chair of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra Committee, said in a statement. “The artists of the Metropolitan Opera, like workers in every industry, deserve a safe place of work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/mar/13/tillerson-firmly-backs-uk-over-salisbury-spy-poisoning-as-white-house-refuses-to-blame-russia-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T16:58:20Z","webTitle":"Trump says US will condemn Russia if it is found to be behind Skripal poisoning - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/13/tillerson-firmly-backs-uk-over-salisbury-spy-poisoning-as-white-house-refuses-to-blame-russia-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/13/tillerson-firmly-backs-uk-over-salisbury-spy-poisoning-as-white-house-refuses-to-blame-russia-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Trump says US will condemn Russia if it is found to be behind Skripal poisoning - Politics live","bodyText":"Afternoon summary Donald Trump has said the US will condemn Russia if it is found to be behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal. The US president, who said he would be talking to Theresa May today to discuss the case, said: “It sounds to me like it would be Russia based on all of the evidence they have.” Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical but stable condition. the Met’s counterterrorism chief said. Neil Basu said DS Nick Bailey remains in a serious but stable condition. In all, 38 people have been seen by medics in relation to the incident, of whom 34 have been discharged with another being monitored as an outpatient, Basu said. Ofcom has written to Towner of RT, formerly Russia Today, to inform it that if Moscow is implicated in the poisoning of Skripal, it will look into whether the broadcaster is “fit and proper”. In response, RT accused Ofcom of “linking RT to unrelated matters”. Another Russian exile, Nikolai Glushkov, who was close friends with the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky has been found dead, aged 68, in his London home. The Met police said counter terrorism officers are leading the inquiry into his death, which was described as “unexplained”. They added that there was no evidence to link it to events in Salisbury. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, called for EU leaders to agree “countermeasures” against Russia at a summit next week, in light of the poisoning of Skripal. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) called the use of the nerve agent novichok “extremely worrying” but stopped short of ordering an investigation. But, claiming that Theresa May’s ultimatum to Moscow breached OPCW protocol, which he said allows nations 10 days to respond, Russia’s ambassador to the OPCW, Alexander Shulgin, accused the UK government of making “unfounded accusations” and “pumping hysteria”. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, called for an EU-wide boycott of this summer’s World Cup in Russia. He said a boycott by just England would be “futile” and said England could host the tournament should a boycott mean holding it in Russia would be unfeasible. The Lib Dems’ leader, Vince Cable, has said there should be an EU-wide boycott of this summer’s World Cup in Russia. He said: Do it collectively. That would really hurt them. The World Cup would not be viable. It would make it pointless. Urging the nine other EU countries who qualified for the tournament to show solidarity with England, he added: I am not advocating Britain acting unilaterally. That would be a futile gesture. It would cause a lot of annoyance in the UK and have minimal impact on the tournament. Cable said the UK could offer to host the World Cup if an EU walkout meant the tournament in Russia could not go ahead. John Woodcock, chairman of Labour’s backbench foreign affairs committee, said England should consider not sending a team to Russia. Speaking to BBC 5 live’s Anna Foster, he said: It gives me no pleasure to say this, but I’m afraid that the World Cup should now be in question. I think England’s participation in the World Cup ought to be in question, but certainly there should be no question of government officials, dignitaries, of senior members of the FA going over there. He said he had not personally decided if it would be right for England to play in the World Cup, adding: I recognise this is the pinnacle of a player’s career, and they may only get one shot at it, so it’s not a step that should be taken lightly. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who said last week last week, that it would be “very difficult to imagine that UK representation” at the World Cup could “go ahead in the normal way, would only say on Tuesday: You will find that our response is commensurate but robust. The Met have released a statement on the death of the Russian exile, Nikolai Glushkov (see 3.17pm update), describing it as “unexplained”. It also says that counter terrorism command is leading the investigation. The full statement reads: An investigation is underway following the death of a man in his 60s in Kingston borough. Police were called by the London Ambulance Service at 10.46am on Monday, 12 March to reports of a man found deceased at a residential address in Clarence Avenue, New Malden. Officers attended and next of kin have been informed. Whilst we believe we know the identity of the deceased, formal identification is yet to take place. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course. The death is currently being treated as an unexplained. If there is a change in the status of the investigation, an update will be provided. At this stage the Met police counter terrorism command is leading the investigation as a precaution because of associations that the man is believed to have had. There is no evidence to suggest a link to the incident in Salisbury. RT, formerly Russia Today, has hit back at the broadcasting regulator, after Ofcom warned that if Moscow was implicated in the poisoning of Skripal, it would look into whether the broadcaster is “fit and proper”. RT said in a statement: We disagree with the position taken by Ofcom; our broadcasting has in no way changed this week, from any other week and continues to adhere to all standards. By linking RT to unrelated matters, Ofcom is conflating its role as a broadcasting regulator with matters of state. RT remains a valuable voice in the UK news landscape, covering vital yet neglected stories and voices, including those of the many MPs and other UK public figures who have been shut out of public discourse by the mainstream media. The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Simon Coveney, has expressed his country’s solidarity with the UK in identifying the perpetrator(s) of the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. He said: Ireland condemns this cowardly attack which has taken place on our neighbour’s soil. The use of chemical weapons, including the use of any toxic weapons, is unacceptable and abhorrent. The incident in Salisbury represents a disturbing violation of international law and goes against norms which have long been established. We join many states in supporting the UK’s efforts to ensure a thorough investigation so that the perpetrators of this crime can be held accountable. We offer our full support and solidarity to the UK and to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in their efforts to seek answers and take appropriate action for this indiscriminate and reckless act. Russia’s ambassador to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), has accused the UK government of making “unfounded accusations” and “pumping hysteria” over the Salisbury poisoning. In a letter to the OPCW following Theresa May’s statement that Russia has until midnight to explain how the Skripals were poisoned, Alexander Shulgin said: We remind our English colleagues that Russia and the United Kingdom are members of the OPCW ... We call upon them to abandon the language of ultimatums and threats and return to the legal field of the chemical convention, which allows us to resolve this kind of situation. Shulgin claimed May’s ultimatum breached OPCW protocol. He added: We would also like to emphasise that such explanations under the chemical weapons convention are provided to the requesting state party as soon as possible, but in any case no later than ten days after the request is received. In this regard, the ultimatum demands to provide information immediately are absolutely unacceptable. We urge our British colleagues to save propaganda fervour and slogans for an unenlightened domestic audience. There they may work, within the walls of the specialised international organisation, such as the OPCW, one must operate with facts and only with facts. Stop pumping hysteria, officially formalise your request to us to begin consultations in order to clarify the situation. Another Russian exile, Nikolai Glushkov, who was close friends with the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky has been found dead, aged 68, in his London home, his lawyer has said. It is not yet clear what was the cause of death. Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Russian upper house, has branded the UK’s allegations against the Kremlin as fake news and “a provocation”. In quotes carried by Russian news agency Tass, she said: This is another fake [item of news] aimed at whipping up another round of the Russophobic campaign… What is being done in the UK harms our bilateral relations ... It is obvious that it is a provocation against Russia and an attempt to groundlessly accuse Russia and exert influence and pressures… I believe that Britain’s investigative agencies will not follow this political trend, although such statements, made at a high level, are tantamount to pressure on the investigation. It’s an attempt to dictate a certain viewpoint, which is impermissible in a civilised legal system. The UK broadcasting regulator says it has written to the owner of RT, formerly Russia Today, to inform it that if Moscow is implicated in the poisoning of Skripal, it will look into whether the broadcaster is “fit and proper”. In a statement, Ofcom says: We have today written to ANO TV Novosti, holder of RT’s UK broadcast licences, which is financed from the budget of the Russian Federation. This letter explained that, should the UK investigating authorities determine that there was an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the UK, we would consider this relevant to our ongoing duty to be satisfied that RT is fit and proper. The letter to RT said that we would carry out our independent fit and proper assessment on an expedited basis, and we would write to RT again shortly setting out details of our process. Here are the key quotes from the statement given by Neil Basu, the new head of UK counter terror policing. Speaking outside Scotland Yard he said: I can confirm the following: Yulia arrived into Heathrow airport on a flight from Russia at approximately 2.40pm on Saturday 3 March. At about 1.40pm on Sunday 4 March, Sergei and Yulia arrived at the Sainsbury’s upper level car park in the Maltings in Salisbury town centre. They went to the Bishop’s Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at approximately 2.20pm and they were there until 3.35pm. Emergency services first received a report from a member of the public at 4.15pm and police officers who arrived in the town’s centre found Sergei and Yulia in an extremely serious condition on a park bench outside Zizzi restaurant. I can confirm we have identified the nerve agent and that has enabled the authorities to assess and help mitigate risks attached to it. The latest assessments reveal that 38 people have been seen in relation to this incident. Of those, 34 have been assessed and discharged from hospital. Three remain in hospital and that is Sergei, Yulia and [DS] Nick [Bailey], and one person continues to be monitored as an outpatient but is not showing signs at this time. We are exploring all investigative avenues. This includes extensive CCTV footage from across the city and over 380 exhibits so far. In particularly I’m appealing for anyone who saw Sergei and Yulia in Sergei’s car which is a red BMW with a registration plate: HD09 WAO, in the Salisbury area between approximately 1pm and 1.45pm on Sunday 4 March. The police are going to continue to see a great deal of police activity in and around city, including potentially more cordons being erected. But please don’t be alarmed. It is necessary as part of this major investigation. In truth it may last many weeks. It is a painstaking operation to identify anyone of interest and eliminate them or include them, but at this stage we are not declaring person of interest or a suspect at this time. Basu outlined a detailed timeline of events. He appealed for anyone who had seek Skripal’s red BMW on Sunday 4 March or has dash cam footage. The counterterrorism chief says the investigation “will understandably take a considerable period of time.” At this stage we are not declaring a person of interest. In response to a question, he also says it is too early to say where the poison was administered. Basu says 38 people have been seen in relation to the incident, 34 have been discharged and another continues to be monitored as an outpatient (the other three are Skripal, his daughter and Bailey). He stresses that the person being monitored as an outpatient is showing no ill effects at present. Neil Basu, the Met police’s new counter-terrorism chief, has begun a statement on Salisbury describing it as a “reckless” and “despicable attack”. He said Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical but stable condition. Wiltshire police officer DS Nick Bailey remains in a serious but stable condition. Here are the full quotes from the US president: Well it sounds to me, I’m speaking to Theresa May today. It sounds to me like it would be Russia based on all of the evidence they have. I don’t know if they’ve come to a conclusion, but she’s calling me today. Trump added: Theresa May is going to be speaking to me today. It sounds to me like they believe it was Russia and I would certainly take that finding as fact ... As soon as we get the facts straight and we are going to be speaking with the British today, we’re speaking with Theresa May today, and as soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be. But I have not spoken to her, I’ll speak to her sometime today. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, called for EU leaders to agree “countermeasures” against Russia at a summit next week. The former Belgian prime minister, who has been a vocal critic of the British government over Brexit, said the attack had taken place on what was “still European soil”. He said: Mrs May has said this is an attack against Britain as a country and I think that a common reaction in the next European Council (summit) is absolutely needed and countermeasures are (should) be decided by the EU. We need a common European response to this outrage. The international body responsible for policing chemical weapons abuses today/Tuesday expressed extreme worry about deployment of the nerve agent novichok in Salisbury, saying those found responsible must be held accountable. The director-general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Ahmet Üzümcü, made the statement on the opening day of a meeting of the executive council. He said: The recent report that two people became seriously ill in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of exposure to a nerve agent is of serious concern. It is extremely worrying that chemical agents are still being used to harm people. Those found responsible for this use must be held accountable for their actions. With the UK unable to secure support at the United Nations security council or, so far from the White House, and neither Nato or the European Union seemingly interested in taking action, the 192-member OPCW offers at least one route to international action. Üzümcü stopped short of ordering an investigation. A member state can request the OPCW to intervene. This would involve verifying the use of a nerve agent and then investigating whether Russia was in compliance with international treaty rules on chemical weapons. Involving the OPCW could be among the raft of measures to be announced by Theresa May on Wednesday if she concludes Russia has failed to provide a credible response to the nerve attack. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson spoke to Üzümcü on Monday night, informing him about the outcome of the Porton Down conclusion that novichok, a rare nerve agent developed by Russia, had been employed. All 192 members have signed the convention on chemical weapons. An investigation by the OPCW would be potentially awkward - or at least embarrassing - for Russia. Donald Trump has said he will speaking to Theresa May today. He added: It seems to me they think like it’s Russia [behind the attack on Skripal] and I would certainly take that finding as fact. If we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be. Speaking after a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee this morning, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the investigation was going well. She added: The Russians have started responding. The prime minister has been very clear that they have until midnight tonight to satisfy her requests. Until then we will wait and see what they have put forward. I know that international allies have begun to rally their support and make comments publicly but at the moment what we are doing is awaiting the Russian response before stepping up and responding as the prime minister has said we will. She did not answer a question about whether a boycott of this year’s World Cup in Russia is a possibility. Asked why the advice telling people who visited a pub and restaurant where the Skripal may have been poisoned to wash their clothes and possessions took so long to be issued, she said: The public health advice came with the information that we were able to collect. I want to be absolutely clear that the chief medical officer has said any risk to the public is low. The FA are not aware of any crisis talks around a possible boycott of the World Cup in Russia, as reported in this morning’s Daily Mail. It is understood that discussions are happening with both the world governing body Fifa and security services on a regular basis around the safety the England squad, support staff and fans travelling to Russia. The Skripal poisoning has almost certainly been raised in these talks as a matter of concern but, as it stands, England will travel to Russia for the tournament pending any further developments. England attended Euro 2016 in France despite concerns around safety following the terrorist attacks on the offices of Charlie Hebdo and in Paris, including at the Stade de France. The prime minister’s spokesman has been asked about whether Theresa May is satisfied with the level of international support for the UK over the Salisbury attack. He pointed to a positive conversation with Emmanuel Macron, and said there had been public statements from “senior EU figures” expressing support. On the US, he highlighted a conversation with Rex Tillerson, just minutes before news broke that Donald Trump had removed his secretary of state. Asked if she was disappointed about the lack of a tweet from the US president himself, the spokesman added: “It is not something I’ve asked the PM but the foreign secretary has spoken about a very good, positive conversation with Rex Tillerson.” Hi, this is Haroon Siddique. I’m taking over the blog for a while, as we’re expecting a Met police statement on Salisbury in about 15 minutes. An official inquiry by the police and security services into alleged Russian state involvement in a number of deaths in Britain has been ordered by the home secretary, Amber Rudd. Russia has summoned the UK’s ambassador to the foreign ministry in Moscow, as its foreign minister denied the country was behind last week’s nerve agent attack in Salisbury and said it would only cooperate in an investigation if it received samples of the agent. The UK is encouraged by the “strength of support” from allies to take action against Russia after the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Boris Johnson has said. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has warned Theresa May that Brussels urgently needs her “broad suggestions” on the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU to be turned into workable solutions. That’s all from me here for now, although it is possible we may re-activate this blog later if there are important new developments on the Russia story. I will now be transferring to the business blog where Graeme Wearden and I will be covering Philip Hammond’s spring statement. You can follow it here. Thanks for the comments. The British ambassador in Moscow has been summoned to the Russian foreign ministry, my colleague Andrew Roth reports. David Frum, a Republican former speechwriter to George W Bush but a fierce critic of Donald Trump’s, has written a strong column for the Atlantic about the White House’s refusal to blame Russia for the Salisbury attack. (See 8.46am.) Here’s an excerpt. For now, though, we are presented with the most astounding yet Trump default from traditional U.S. alliances and leadership. At Monday’s White House press conference, Sarah Huckabee Sanders rebuffed repeated questions about whether the U.S. even supported the U.K. finding of fact about Russian responsibility. As the default continues and expands, the evidence accumulates: Trump simply will not act to protect the U.S. and its allies against even Russian aggression, even on their own territory, even in the form of attempted murder. Trump’s inaction speaks louder than any words. It is a confession for all to hear. William Hague, the Conservative former foreign secretary, has written a punchy and incisive column on Russia in today’s Telegraph (paywall). He says people on all sides of the political spectrum will have to admit that they have misjudged Moscow. Here’s an extract. Admitting that Russia is a serious, long-term threat to our security is an awful, excruciatingly painful exercise for a great many people. For military planners, it means nearly 30 years of downgrading the need for large and strong conventional forces has been a mistake. For neo-conservatives, it means the assumption that democracy will prosper even in areas where it has few foundations was hopelessly wrong. For the likes of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump, it means fawning admiration of Putin was naïve. For people like former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who has been happy to be paid to advance Russia’s energy interests, it means their actions were gravely ill-judged. For those like John McDonnell, who have spent years appearing on Russia Today and now make a virtue of desisting, or Alex Salmond who hosts his own show on the channel, it means recognition of deep gullibility ... Can it really be true that Russia is equipping itself to snap the undersea cables on which all our communications and finances depend? Afraid it is. Are they actually positioning themselves to hack into our vital national infrastructure and disrupt it? Looks like it. Can they possibly maintain Soviet levels of espionage and covert activity in our free European societies? You bet they can. Are they flying aggressive sorties to test our air defences? Yup. And surely they’re not developing new chemicals and deadly poisons as well? Of course they are. A new piece of research looks at the way that female and male leaders are treated on social media. The research, by the social enterprise Atalanta (which is focused on female representation in government) compared Theresa May to Jeremy Corbyn alongside pairs of female and male political leaders in South Africa and Chile. They found that May had three times the share of comments about her appearance than Corbyn, and messages about May were often gendered. Across all three pairs women were 3.4 times more likely than men to experience gender-related derogatory comments. Meanwhile, 74.1% of comments related to a leaders’ appearance were aimed at women, and 71.8% of those related to marital status. They were also more likely to be negative when aimed at women. And it is male authors who dominated gendered conversations. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, also spoke in the European parliament debate on its Brexit resolution. He said it was “rather surprising” that the UK thought the EU would accept convergence in some areas “and at the same time open up the possibility for divergence when there is a comparative advantage to be had” for the UK. Barnier told MEPs: I listened attentively to Theresa May’s Mansion House speech which confirms the door is closing itself by confirming the red lines - leaving the single market, leaving the customs union ... It’s time to face up to the hard facts. The UK is choosing to leave the union, the single market and the customs union, we have noted that. Do they also want to distance themselves from our regulatory model, the one that we have constructed together with you - and you with us - for 44 years? In an interview in the Evening Standard on Monday Amber Rudd, the home secretary, indicated that she remained highly sceptical that all 14 deaths flagged up as potentially suspicious (see 11.09am) could be linked to the Russians. Referring to Lord Blair, the former Met commissioner who has also called for the deaths to be reviews, she said: You know I’m not dismissing it at all and after we’ve got beyond this incident it may be right to look at them all again. Well, not all of them — I expect even Lord Blair would probably say one or two or three or four. Lord Blair last week said investigators should “see whether there is some pattern here of people who go out jogging and fall dead, and who are found dead in their house in Surrey and so on”. Last week Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, wrote to Amber Rudd, the home secretary, asking for an investigation into the 14 deaths not being treated as suspicious by the police but which, according to a BuzzFeed investigation, are thought by US intelligence to be potentially linked to Russia. Today the committee has published Rudd’s reply (pdf). Rudd said she would take this up with the police and MI5, and told Cooper: In the weeks to come, I will want to satisfy myself that the allegations are nothing more than that. The police and MI5 agree and will assist in that endeavour. I will write to you again with my conclusions. In response, Cooper said: I welcome the Home Secretary’s decision to look again at other cases where questions have been raised. Rightly, the government is focused on the current investigation into the attack in Salisbury and supporting the efforts of the police, as well as responding to the incredibly serious conclusion the Prime Minister announced in the Commons yesterday. But given the gravity of these issues, it is also right that the authorities should reassure us that they have looked at any further allegations or relevant evidence put forward in any other cases. As the home secretary has said in her letter, the government must satisfy itself that the correct finding was reached in each case and the public need to know that relevant questions about wider Russia links have been investigated and answered. Russia is demanding access to the nerve agent identified by British investigators that was used to poison Sergei Skripal, the Press Association is reporting. In a separate interview for international broadcasters, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, also stressed that the British government’s dispute was with the Russian government, not the Russian people. He said: We don’t want to demonise either Russia or the Russian people for whom obviously we have a very high regard. Russia is a great country. It is a great pity therefore that the Russian regime seems to be moving in this dangerous and disruptive direction. Russia’s foreign ministry has mocked Theresa May over her conclusion that it was “highly likely” Moscow was responsible for the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. As the Press Association reports, in a post on Twitter, the ministry’s official account used the hashtag HighlyLikelyRussia - which has been used on social media as the basis of jokes for things to blame Moscow for. The ministry of foreign affairs’ message said “sincere thanks to May for HighlyLikelyRussia” along with a video suggesting the country was to blame for the recent snow to fall in the UK. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said this morning that he has been “very encouraged” by the support the UK has been getting internationally since Theresa May’s statement about Russia’s involvement in the Salisbury attack yesterday. He also confirmed that the government would announce what action it will take in response tomorrow. He said: What we’re doing today is giving Russia until midnight tonight to explain how it came to be that novichok was used on the streets of Wiltshire. If they can come up with a convincing explanation then obviously we will want to see full disclosure of that to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague. If not, then clearly we will want to be announcing the UK response and that will come tomorrow. In the meantime what we’ve been doing is talking to friends and partners, explaining what we see as the high likelihood of Russian state agency. And I’ve been very encouraged so far by the strength of the support that we are getting. I think in particular from President Macron of France, I talked to Sigmar Gabriel my German counterpart, and from Washington where Rex Tillerson last night made it absolutely clear that he sees this as part of a pattern of disruptive behaviour, increasingly disruptive behaviour, malign behaviour by Russia, the reckless use of chemical weapons, the support for the reckless use of chemical weapons which stretches from Syria now to the streets of Salisbury. I’ve been encouraged by the willingness of our friends to show support and solidarity. He also stressed the seriousness of what happened. The first thing is to get over to our friends and partners exactly what has happened and that’s what we’ve been doing today. And as the prime minister explained yesterday, this is a brazen attempt to murder innocent people on UK soil. A policeman still in hospital. Overwhelmingly likely, or highly likely that the Russian state was involved. And the use of this nerve agent would represent the first use of nerve agents on the continent of Europe since the Second World War. In the Commons yesterday two MPs asked Theresa May to consider banning the pro-Kremlin news channel RT (formerly Russia Today). May said she knew that this was an issue of concern to MPs, but she did not make any firm proposals. She said she would be making a further statement later setting out her proposals for retaliatory action. On the Today programme Dominic Raab, the housing minister, said that there might be a case for taking action against RT if it was involved in the Salisbury attack (no one has suggested it was), but that he would not favour banning it just because it is a propaganda channel. He said: I’m generally in favour of free speech and I think people can judge [Russia Today] on its own terms. Last night Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, put out a non-committal statement about RT. It said: Ofcom has an ongoing duty to be satisfied that all broadcast licensees are fit and proper to hold a licence. We have heard the pime minister’s statement in the House of Commons this afternoon and we await her further statement on Wednesday. We will then consider the implications for RT’s broadcast licences. A separate issue is whether RT continues to be shown in parliament. Currently it is one of the many channels shown on TVs within the parliamentary estate (on channel 206, between Euronews and CNN.) Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has said she will ask for this to be reviewed. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, told MEPs this morning that the UK would come to regret its decision to leave the EU. As the Press Association reports, Juncker said things “cannot remain as they are” for the UK in its relationship with the EU after leaving the bloc. Addressing the European parliament, Juncker was cheered by Eurosceptic MEPs as he noted the UK’s departure was due on March 29 2019. Responding to their applause, Juncker said the time would come “when you will regret your decision”. Juncker also said the EU was ready to work with the UK on its preferred option of the border issue being resolved in the future trade deal, or by other specific measures. But he added “we need to receive concrete proposals from the UK first”. But David Miliband, the former Labour foreign secretary, told the same programme that it was “very worrying” that the White House was not able to blame Russia. He told Today: The biggest thing [Theresa May] has to do in the next two days is to rally her allies. It is very significant and very worrying, frankly, that the White House has not felt able to point the finger at Russia in the last seven or eight days. And, I think that rallying the European allies, and, if possible, significant strands of American opinion, is absolutely key. On the Today programme Kurt Volker, an American diplomat who currently serves as the US special representative for Ukraine, said the UK should not be worried about the White House’s failure to accept Russia was to blame for the Salisbury attack. Asked about this, he said: I wouldn’t be worried at all. I think the secretary of state came out last night with a very robust statement. Dominic Raab, the housing minister, has been giving two interviews this morning. On the Today programme he was asked about the spring statement and the Salisbury attack, neither of which are subjects relevant to his portfolio, but he is clearly trusted to speak on the government on these issues, otherwise he would not have been put up. Here are the key points he made. Raab said the government would offer a “robust” response to Russia if it could not provide a credible explanation for the Salisbury attack by tonight and gave some clues as to what ministers are planning. He said: If, as is widely feared it turns out that there is no credible explanation for this [and] that the Russian authorities were responsible for it directly, then it would be an unlawful use of force on UK soil. And that opens up the whole panoply of counter measures from economic, financial, diplomatic measures. And there is obviously, as you know, a lot of talk about the Magnitsky sanctions ... I think in the absence of a credible explanation, you can expect to see a robust approach from the government. My colleague Patrick Wintour has a good article looking in detail at what action the UK could take against Russia. Raab denied suggestions that the government was asking Nato allies to join retaliatory action against Russia by invoking article 5, which says an attack on one Nato country should be considered an attack on all of them. Today’s Telegraph says in its splash (paywall): “President Donald Trump and other key Nato allies including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are being sounded out about support for invoking Nato’s Article 5 principle of common defence, which states that an attack on one member of the organisation is an attack on all 29 members.” But, when asked about this, Raab dismissed the report. He said: The prime minister chose her words very carefully. The words ‘unlawful use of force’ have a different meaning in international law from an armed attack. The range [of measures] would I believe extend to and include: diplomatic measures, financial measures, economic measures and issues around visa bans and things like that. He criticised Jeremy Corbyn’s response to May’s statement yesterday. He said: Frankly the leader of the Labour party needs to grow a backbone and show some mettle. People will expect both as a matter of principle, but also the issue of protecting the public at large, that we take a resolute responsible approach but a resolute and robust one. Theresa May’s announcement yesterday about Russia’s involvement in the Salisbury nerve agent attack has prompted reaction around the world, although mixed messages have been coming out of Washington. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, has strongly backed May, and the British government’s assessment about it being “highly likely” that Russia ordered the attack. Tillerson spoke to Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, yesterday and afterwards he put out a statement saying he was “outraged” by what happened. It said: We have full confidence in the UK’s investigation and its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury last week. There is never a justification for this type of attack – the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation – and we are outraged that Russia appears to have again engaged in such behavior. From Ukraine to Syria – and now the UK – Russia continues to be an irresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens. We agree that those responsible – both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it – must face appropriately serious consequences. We stand in solidarity with our Allies in the United Kingdom and will continue to coordinate closely our responses. But at the regular White House press briefing the president’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, refused repeatedly to assign blame to Russia. She just said the US condemned the attack and was standing by its ally. Here’s an excerpt from the official transcript. Q: So you’re not saying that Russia was behind this act? MS. SANDERS: Right now, we are standing with our UK ally. I think they’re still working through even some of the details of that. And we’re going to continue to work with the UK, and we certainly stand with them throughout this process. Q: Theresa May said it was either Russia using it themselves or that it had given its chemical weapons to a third party to murder a British citizen, the latter being highly unlikely, given the nature of this weapon. So — MS. SANDERS: Like I just said, Zeke, we stand with our ally. And we certainly fully support them, and are ready if we can be of any assistance to them. I will be covering more on this story, and other political developments, this morning. Then, at around 12pm, I will be joining up with my colleague Graeme Wearden to cover the spring statement. Graeme has already started a blog devoted to this, which you can read here. ou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads.

Like many traders in Pakistan’s northernmost region of Gilgit-Baltistan, Ahmed fell in love with a Chinese woman on a work trip across the border. And like dozens of others, he has now been forcibly separated from the woman he married – and the child they had together – for months. Last week lawmakers in Gilgit-Baltistan demanded that authorities in China’s Xinjiang province immediately release from detention at least 50 Chinese women married to Pakistani men, some of whom have been held for a year on vague charges of extremism. “It is absurd. We are well-off people and my wife is a housewife,” Ahmed told the Guardian, on condition of not publishing his real name. “Now our life is destroyed.” He last heard from his spouse, who belongs to China’s Uighur Muslim minority, on 22 December. He worries she is not receiving the medicine she needs to treat her epilepsy. The last words she said to him were “I miss you. We need your care now.” The Chinese government often professes a bond “deeper than the deepest ocean, sweeter than honey” with its old ally Pakistan, and construction is under way on the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), a £44bn, 1,990-mile trade route from Xinjiang through Gilgit-Baltistan to Pakistan’s southern coast. But Beijing is wary of unrest in its Muslim population. After the 2014 murder of 29 people by knife-wielding terrorists in a train station, Uighur men in Xinjiang are no longer allowed to have long beards and parents cannot call their children Muhammad. According to a report by Radio Free Asia, a US-funded news group, at least 120,000 Uighurs have been placed in squalid “re-education” camps in the province. The men from Gilgit-Baltistan say their wives are being held in these centres. “Officials say my wife is at school, that she is learning Chinese and Chinese law,” Ahmed told the Guardian. “But school is morning you go, evening you come home. You cannot call school where a person is detained and not coming home for many months.” That, he said, was prison. Xinjiang authorities are not renewing the visas of Pakistani husbands, forcing them to leave their children behind in the province. One told local media that, despite having secured a visa from the Chinese embassy in Islamabad permitting him to re-enter the country, he was blocked at the border. “I begged them to let me enter,” he said. “My wife, my two-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter were there.” Separated from both her parents, Ahmed’s daughter, who is in the care of her Chinese grandparents, has started to act “psychotically”, throwing tantrums and crying all the time, he said. Once every 15 days his wife is permitted a five-minute call with their daughter – something not all the families in his situation are lucky enough to receive. According to Adrian Zenz, of the European School of Culture and Theology, the roundup has little to do with a genuine analysis of the threat posed by the women. Under the control of Chen Quanguo, a hardline leader appointed in 2016, the Xinjiang government has started to detain “anybody travelling internationally who is a Muslim”, with particular focus on a list of 26 countries, including Pakistan. Whether the women would be released depended on the “guts of the Pakistan government”, he said. Other countries with economic ties to China have kept quiet. A member of the Gilgit-Baltistan assembly, Javed Hussain, told the Guardian that the protracted detentions were generating anger in the community. “We have heard nothing from the federal government since we passed a resolution demanding they take action,” he said, pushing for “concrete steps” to follow quickly. Yet silence could also come at a cost. If the government does not soon secure the release of their spouses, Ahmed said, the affected husbands would call for widespread protests, even shutting down the border and threatening CPEC, which is considered vital for Pakistan’s future prosperity. The religious community would then “consider it a matter of honour” to get their wives back, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/16/the-wit-and-wisdom-of-stephen-hawking","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T16:36:24Z","webTitle":"The wit and wisdom of Stephen Hawking | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/16/the-wit-and-wisdom-of-stephen-hawking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/16/the-wit-and-wisdom-of-stephen-hawking","fields":{"headline":"The wit and wisdom of Stephen Hawking","bodyText":"Roger Penrose’s reference to the difficulty of organising events for Professor Stephen Hawking (Obituary, 15 March) evoked memories of when, as PR for Dillons Bookstore, my colleagues and I organised one of his first public lectures in London, at the Institute of Education, as part of the promotion for A Brief History of Time. After the (pre-recorded) lecture, accompanied by slides on an overhead projector, Prof Hawking agreed to take questions, which naturally entailed long pauses while he composed his replies one letter at a time. One particularly extended hiatus after a detailed question was followed by what we can now recognise as a typically witty Hawking response: “Could you repeat the question please?” I will remember the glint in his eye, demonstrating his satisfaction at wrong-footing us all. RIP Stephen Hawking, in whatever universe you now inhabit. Andrea Morgale London • Shortly after starting teaching (early 1980s), I wrote to Stephen Hawking to ask him if he could send me some of his work that I could share with A-level physics students. Shortly after, I received a parcel from his PA at DAMTP (Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics) at Cambridge, which contained documents on “n =8 Supergravity” and “Gauge Symmetry”. Of course I had no idea what it meant, but I copied some of it on to a blackboard under the heading “Year 7 science” before a year 7 parents’ evening.

I was choked up'","bodyText":"By and large, you come across two kinds of radio broadcasters. There are those who see the medium as a means to an end, to discuss what’s important to them: electronic music, world politics, the discs you would take to a desert island. Then there are people such as Greg James, the host of the Radio 1 drivetime show for the past six years, who have a passion for radio itself. Once upon a time they were called anoraks; he prefers the term “radio nerd”. He is highly invested in the production of the show. His heroes are Terry Wogan, Alan Partridge and Ricky Gervais – he can still recite links from the latter’s Xfm show 13 years after it was last broadcast. Even when he started to do endurance challenges for Sport Relief – in 2013 he was part of the group of celebrities who faced the rapids and crocodiles of the Zambezi river; in 2016 he completed five triathlons in five days – what attracted him was not, he says, thrill-seeking but bringing excitement back to his show. “I just want to make great event radio. I hate the idea of getting to the end of a show and there’s nothing to remember.” For his most recent effort, the #Gregathlon, James, 32, was going to climb the three tallest peaks in England, Wales and Scotland, and cycle the 500 miles between them in five days. Even by the standards of these kinds of big TV challenges, it sounded extremely tough. Still, you got the feeling that the preamble about James being not sure if he would be able to manage it and Olympic champion cyclist Chris Hoy saying there was “no way” that he would try a challenge so “mad” was probably just producers ratcheting up the tension before an emotional but inevitable triumph. What they couldn’t have predicted was the worst week of British weather for years. The “beast from the east” and storm Emma brought perilous conditions and deep snow just as he was setting off. “I started with Mount Snowdon. It was like an episode of 999 with Michael Buerk. My foot would go into the snow and it was going up to my knee,” he says. The cycling, which was supposed to be done on a road bike, had to be done on a mountain bike in flurries of falling snow. All the while, James was trying to host his show from a microphone strapped to his helmet. After the second mountain, Scafell Pike, James was told that conditions were too treacherous and he wouldn’t be allowed to continue. He seemed distraught. “It just felt like a real balloon being popped. You obviously know you’re on the radio so you want to get the emotion across, but I became genuinely choked up.” Two weeks after Greg’s return, we are sitting in his manager’s office in London. In his jeans, T-shirt and jacket, he looks a bit like how a child might draw “a man”. Soon he’s going to head to Radio 1 to do his show, then up to Scotland to tackle the challenge again (listeners heard him complete it live on air Friday afternoon – as he finished he learned that he had raised more than £900,000). He was determined to finish what he started but says the disappointment of not being able to do it in one go struck a chord with the purpose of the stunt, to raise money and awareness for mental health issues. “It was the perfect metaphor for the whole week because we were going: ‘Don’t ever feel frightened to say that you’re feeling like shit because there will be somebody you know that has gone through it.’” He says he’s been overwhelmed by the honesty and emotion from listeners that has come from opening up the conversation about depression and anxiety, which I am sure is true. But I say I’m cynical about how much brands have been “raising awareness” about mental health during the past couple of years, often suggesting people find someone to talk to. While that is an important first step, it doesn’t necessarily help the millions of people who are suffering from serious mental health problems, for whom NHS services are getting worse. “Yeah, that’s the downfall of everything that gets in the news cycle; people jump on bandwagons. But I’m very, very careful to not do those sorts of things for the sake of it. Most people sliding into the DMs [direct messaging on social media] were just kind of going: ‘I’m a bloke, I’m 24, I feel like I’ve got to pretend to be a lad, and I don’t know how to talk about these things, but hearing you talk about them helped.’ Also, we raised a load of money to fund those sorts of projects. But my next step is do something with mental health groups that is a bit more sustainable, maybe with an organisation that needs someone to chat to young blokes, for example. I would like to do that.” It is true that James has a unique skill, even among Radio 1 DJs, for connecting with ordinary young people. He feels, I say, like the torchbearer on the station for a certain kind of normal university lad: someone who goes to the gym, doesn’t take themselves too seriously, wouldn’t mind dressing up in a tutu and goes to clubs where they play cheesy music. Other hosts on the station are hired because they are from the in-crowd and can tell the listeners what’s cool. He seems to have been hired because, like the listeners, he doesn’t really care. “I wouldn’t say I was a lad, I’m not the beer pong guy. But I think you’re right, I really do feel like I know the listeners. I don’t want anyone to feel excluded. I’m phobic of the celebrity world. I’m a big music fan, but I’m not the music impresario. So yeah, I take that as a huge compliment because I feel like, once you join the circus, you can’t take the piss out of the circus.” James’s devotion to his audience comes at a time when young people are increasingly turning away from radio. Radio 1’s total listenership has fallen from 11.8 million in September of 2011 to 10.5 million in September 2017. When the last round of figures were announced, Radio 4 went to ask a bunch of schoolchildren whether they listen to Radio 1 or had heard of its breakfast presenter Nick Grimshaw. None of them had. “Well, these things can be quite cyclical,” says James. “It doesn’t mean just because one generation of kids are like, ‘what the fuck’s that?’ that you can’t reinvent it again.” He says the station went through a confused period when it wasn’t sure which audience to aim at and there was a feeling that it had to shed older listeners at any cost. “I think things have stabilised a bit more since then, which is to say Radio 1 appreciates that if you get the mums and dads, then you have people like my niece and nephew who are eight years old, and I think it can start again like that. When we were going through the Lake District [for the Gregathlon] and there was a dad on the front doorstep with his two sons and he was like, ‘Go on Greg!’ and the kids were like, ‘Yeahhh’. I am literally cycling past the listeners of Radio 1: ‘Good morning, good evening, make sure you’re listening tomorrow from 4pm.’ It’s campaigning.” I also wonder what he thinks about how Radio 1 is responding to increased pressures at the BBC for greater diversity. He is part of a daytime lineup of three white men, along with Scott Mills and Nick Grimshaw, and one black woman – Clara Amfo. But Radio 1 also has a sister station, 1Xtra, with black daytime hosts playing music by predominantly black artists. Does it make sense in 2018 that there is basically a white Radio 1 and a black Radio 1? “Enormous question … Yeah, it does. There are lots of examples of the stations working more closely together and they do help each other out, but they should help each other out more. I totally see your point about having this station for this kind of person, and this station for that kind of person, but shows such as Charlie Sloth’s are on both networks and it’s not an issue. There should be more cross-pollination. I was on Dotty’s [rapper Amplify Dot] breakfast show talking about the challenge and actually, we had that conversation. I was like, ‘Why haven’t we done this more?’” One area in which the station has had major success is on YouTube where viral videos, such as James singing with Taylor Swift, have views in the tens of millions. But in that space, Radio 1 is competing for young eyeballs with a huge number of vloggers, a medium that for many in that age group is the new radio. The station has made attempts to bring these internet stars into the fold by giving them shows or other segments. But Greg is distrustful of the way they flog products in their videos to make a living. “Influencers are absolutely in my crosshairs in the minute. The disdain some of them have for their own fanbase is mindblowing, just selling crap to them the whole time.” So he never wants a free weekend at Babington House in return for a few tweets? “Ha! It would be a hollow weekend, that’s the thing. I like paying for things. I like paying tax. I think there are quite a few people in the public eye who don’t like paying tax and don’t like paying for things. It’s nice to pay tax because that’s a nurse or a teacher. I’m quite righteous about that.” It’s not just their rapaciousness that he finds offensive. As a radio perfectionist himself, he seems stunned by the content itself. “It’s terrifying, watching some moron bake a cake and it gets 5m views. But shit stuff has always been popular. Lots of people on YouTube need a boss to tell them when they’re being bad. I’ve had producers and amazing writers saying: ‘Woah you need to refine those ideas.’ But they have not got that. No wonder it’s awful.” So he’s not worried they might rise up and steal his show? “Hopefully, it works itself out, maybe people will grow out of it and go: ‘Oh why did I watch that person make a rainbow unicorn cake, that was embarrassing.’ Fingers crossed. Either that, or I’ll be doing infomercials with Zoella.” James was born in south London in 1985, his parents both teachers. Growing up, his two loves were cricket and radio. He played for Hertfordshire under-18s, and, after hearing that his future colleague Mills started out on hospital radio, found the local station and tried out a show there. He followed up on university radio at the University of East Anglia, obsessing over editing and creating his own jingles. He was soon discovered by Radio 1, hosting his first show for the station the day after he graduated. It was the early breakfast slot, starting at 4am. “I loved that show so much because I was completely fearless. It was the happiest I’ve ever been. Then I moved to afternoons and I was really miserable because I didn’t know what I was doing. I was young and just moved to London and [was] just getting drunk all the time and a little bit famous. I used to panic a lot about it all. I used to worry about someone else getting a job, thinking: ‘Argh, why haven’t I got that show?’ or ‘Why is he doing so well?’” He moved to drivetime where he says he found his groove and, in the last four years has felt comfortable enough to try other projects. He hosts a cricket podcast for 5 Live with Jimmy Anderson and is writing a series of children’s books, Kid Normal, with Chris Smith, who hosts the news on his show. “We worked really hard on them because we didn’t want it to be: ‘Those two twats from the radio think they can just do a book now.’” It’s paid off – the first book was the bestselling children’s debut of last year. He is also co-hosting Sounds Like Friday Night, the BBC’s sort-of Top of the Pops replacement. Ratings for the initial run were solid, but there was something a little off about it. The sketches were flat and James and co-host Dotty seemed to feign naivety about the music they were introducing in a way that felt at odds with their radio personas. “It wasn’t a disaster and it’s coming back for another series. But it’s hard, it’s really hard to land a music show where you’ve got Stefflon Don in the slot where A Question of Sport was the week before. I think we’ll make the show feel looser and not overthink it too much. The reason I wanted to do it is because I could show off, do interviews, run around, interview the audience and have a laugh. It didn’t quite happen in the first series, so I want to do that for the second.” We have been talking for more than an hour and there is something strangely unflappable about James. While he might have had struggles in the past, he now seems content in every part of his life. I tell him that I’m not sure I’ve ever met anyone who seems to be so sorted. “Yeah, it’s probably boring for you, but I do feel quite content. It’s only happened in the last year or so that things have slotted into place. I have found peace with my love life, feel happy with my friends and I am looking after my family. It’s made me funnier on air and better at my job. The moment I stopped overthinking it, when I realised that I don’t have to go to that party, or get to that place, I realised there was nowhere I wanted to get to. Radio is my skill, it’s like plumbing, and now I’ve learned that I get to try other things and enjoy that.” Two days later, I am at home listening to James power through a 120-mile cycle in relentless rain. He sounds in pieces, saying it’s harder than even the first part of the challenge. Still, he finds time to guess the age of some local children, have a conversation about teen mental health and do an extended link about farts. You’ve got to say, it’s pretty good radio.

The latest came last Saturday when E.ON and RWE announced a huge shakeup of the German energy industry, following meetings that ran into the early hours. Under a complex asset and shares swap, E.ON will be reshaped to focus on supplying energy to customers and managing energy grids. The company will leave renewables. RWE will focus on power generation and energy trading, complementing its existing coal and gas power stations with a new portfolio of windfarms that will make it Europe’s third-biggest renewable energy producer. The major change comes two years after both groups split their green and fossil-fuel energy businesses, a result of the plan by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to phase out nuclear by 2022, and also the Energiewende, Germany’s speeded-up transition to renewables after Fukushima. Coming so soon after 2016’s drastic overhaul, last week’s shakeup raises the question of what a successful energy utility looks like in Europe today. How do companies adapt to a world where the rapid growth of renewables pushes down wholesale prices, and the electrification of cars begins to be felt on power grids? Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said the deal showed that E.ON and RWE did not get their reorganisation right two years ago. It marks a decisive break with the old, traditional model of a vertically integrated energy company that generates energy, transports it and sells it. In the noughties, the conglomerate model was seen as a way for energy firms to succeed, leading to a wave of mergers. Some, such as Italy’s Enel and Spain’s Iberdrola (ScottishPower’s owner) are still pursuing this “do everything” model. But by and large, companies are being broken up and becoming more specialised. “What you’re certainly seeing is companies taking bets about where the value will be,” said Atherton. RWE argues that today the only way to compete in European government auctions for renewable energy subsidies is to go big. Rolf Martin Schmitz, the group’s chief executive, said: “Critical mass is the key in renewable energy. Before this transaction, neither RWE nor E.ON was in this position.” After the deal, RWE will have around 8GW of renewable capacity and another 5GW in the pipeline, which will together account for 60% of its earnings by 2020. Schmitz also said that a new type of company was needed to thrive in a world where windfarms and other green energy projects would soon have to succeed on market prices, not government subsidies. “Renewables will evolve from a regulated business to market competition,” he said. E.ON, meanwhile, is majoring on supplying people with energy and services, and will grow from 31 million customers to roughly 50 million after the deal. It will also have a much greater proportion of its earnings – 80%, up from 65% – coming from the regulated, lower-return but lower-risk business of energy networks. John Feddersen, chief executive of Aurora Energy Research, said the two firms were going in very different directions, but the path E.ON had taken was less well trodden. “This is to some extent a question of try it and see what works. [For E.ON], owning grids and lobbying government for good regulatory outcomes is a well-understood business. However, the [customer] services side is untried,” he said. The changing nature of power generation in Europe has been felt most keenly in Germany because of the Energiewende, but industry-watchers say the same pattern is driving companies to transform themselves across the continent. In the UK, British Gas owner Centrica is halfway through a sometimes painful reinvention of itself as a customer-centric energy company, divesting its old, large power stations to focus on selling services such as smart heating systems, as well as gas and electricity. The UK’s second-biggest energy firm, SSE, is moving in the opposite direction. It is getting out of domestic energy supply, banking instead on regulated networks and renewable power generation, where prices are guaranteed. The picture is further complicated by the entrance of big oil, which is taking serious steps to diversify out of oil and gas and into the world of energy utilities. Norway’s Statoil last week rebranded itself as Equinor to reflect its transformation into a “broad energy” company that deploys windfarms as well as oil rigs. Shell recently bought the UK’s biggest independent household energy supplier, First Utility, and has also acquired firms in electric car infrastructure. That puts it in direct competition with E.ON, which promised to roll out charging points faster as a result of the asset swap. Investors seem to like the paths E.ON and RWE have taken, with big bumps in the share prices of both after the deal. But no one knows if we will be back here in two years’ time. “I would view this very much as a test of the right structure for an energy company,” said Feddersen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/17/talking-horses-saturday-tv-horse-racing-tips-guide-uttoxeter-kempton","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T00:01:07Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Saturday TV tipping guide at Uttoxeter and Kempton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/17/talking-horses-saturday-tv-horse-racing-tips-guide-uttoxeter-kempton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/17/talking-horses-saturday-tv-horse-racing-tips-guide-uttoxeter-kempton","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Saturday TV tipping guide at Uttoxeter and Kempton","bodyText":"Heavy going and a planned morning inspection of Uttoxeter suggest this Midlands Grand National will be just as much of a slog as in previous years.

These people do not seem terribly interested in the future, even though it poses grave threats to them and what remains of their power. Indeed, as the economy is endlessly disrupted and transformed, it appears their instinctive response is to bury their heads in the sand. Though it does not bring me any great joy to say so, these are among the basic facts of 21st-century British trade unionism. Serially weakened by deindustrialisation and kicked around for the best part of 40 years, it is perhaps a miracle that the unions still have 6.2 million members. The work of representation, education and occasional mobilisation that their members continue to do is vital. For all that even leftwing people now seem to be questioning unions’ role within the Labour party, it is entirely right that some of the biggest unions have an organised means of political representation as a counterbalance to the infinite clout of capital. But that is not the whole story, and it is time some glaring failures were talked about in the open. Survey the general secretaries of Unite, the GMB, the giant public sector union Unison, the Communication Workers Union and the shopworkers’ union Usdaw – who collectively dominate Labour’s union-based structures – and you will see not a single female or non-white face. The same goes for the transport workers’ union the RMT and the public servants’ union the PCS. Frances O’Grady brilliantly does the difficult job of speaking for the entire union movement as general secretary of the TUC; Mary Bousted is a formidable joint general secretary of the newly formed National Education Union; and the University and College Union’s noble fight to protect its members’ pensions is led by Sally Hunt. About 55% of union members are women. But it surely says something that in living memory the only female trade union leader to have got close to being a presence in the wider culture was the late Brenda Dean, the general secretary of the print union Sogat and key voice in a seismic battle with Rupert Murdoch back in the mid-1980s. She died last week, and her passing has a very topical poignancy. Last week, I spoke to a female staff member at a big union who sees at first hand how unions too often stifle potential. “If you make a request for flexible working, it almost feels as if you’re asking for a favour; you start to feel like you’re doing something wrong,” she said. I have also recently heard the story of a female union official who was granted flexible arrangements to look after children – but only on the condition that she was demoted. Meanwhile, the men who can put the hours in continue to rise to climb the ladder: a journey that will usually end with a comfortable salary and a long spell at the top. Three-quarters of Unison members are women. But insiders talk about an already bad situation that is getting worse. “Women are being replaced by men: the heads of regions are a good example,” one insider says. She goes on: “If you visit Unison’s HQ, you’ll have no idea most of our members are women. Women are tacked on to what the union does. They’re not at the heart of it.” In the wider union movement, needless to say, such grim imbalances are not just manifested in matters of gender: in 1992, when Bill Morris began a 11-year stretch as general secretary of the then Transport and General Workers’ Union (since folded into Unite), he became the first person of colour to lead a major UK trade union. As things stand, he remains the last. The unions’ systems of membership still tend to revolve around a two-tier model split between “full time” and “part time”, and their basic unit of organisation is a workplace with a union rep. How this is meant to fit with working lives that can flip across such categories on a daily basis, and through offices and factories at speed, remains a mystery. I have spoken endlessly to trade unionists who want to give serious thought to how to do things differently: one idea that often comes up is of a lifetime individual membership that could be instantly reconfigured as people move into work, then out, and then in again, allowing them to make the most of different kinds of collective representation and personal benefits. But such things are still more the subject of tentative conversations after office hours than anything more meaningful. Is this perhaps because the women, young workers and people of colour who tend to work in the more precarious parts of the economy are too often locked out of many of the big unions’ upper tiers? Occasionally, you see signs of improvement. There are people within the big unions who do the hard work of taking trade unionism to people and places from which it is too often shut out: the GMB organisers who make it their business to recruit people working for supermarkets, courier companies, and outsourced hospital cleaning operators; the Unite activists who have talked to me about setting up credit unions and unionising call centres. A bit further down the union hierarchy, there are the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers’ Union officials who worked with McDonald’s workers on a historic strike at two outlets that was followed by a nationwide pay rise, and the people from the media and entertainment Bectu who have devoted their energy to a long, grinding fight with the Picturehouse cinemas chain over pay and basic rights. However, across the unions as whole, unfortunately, far too little effort is going into developing these examples into anything that might capture the public imagination and begin to change some of the most iniquitous features of modern work. Some radically different ideas are taking shape, thanks to a new breed of small, nitty-gritty organisations that work at the frontiers of precarious employment, and often have backstories involving frustration with the big unions’ lumbering ways. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain not only did immense work winning improved rights to pensions and holiday and sick pay for cleaners at the University of London – a fight that goes on – it also miraculously secured a pay rise averaging 25% for bike couriers in five workplaces across London. The ambitiously named United Voices of the World has been central to a successful battle to bring cleaning jobs at the London School of Economics back in house. And the Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers Union recently won a guarantee of the London living wage for outsourced cleaners at the Nike Town store at Oxford Circus in London. They may collectively have no more than a couple of thousand members, but these unions’ operations are fast, loud, and agile, and the faces of the people who keep everything together are admirably diverse. By contrast, the big unions can appear to be just waiting for a Labour government to come along and somehow make things alright. Is the work simply beyond them of reinventing their movement for new times so as to renew its liberating purpose? Are they holding back for fear of threats to their power? These questions require attention, before an iron rule kicks in: that complacency usually invites the slow sunset of irrelevance. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Then there were the funny animal videos. Now, a third wave of Instagram accounts has arisen; that of the high/low-culture hybrid, a beast that sees Hogwarts wizards decked out in Dior, and the lovers of Call Me By Your Name transplanted into the landscapes of Monet. This phenomenon arguably began in January 2015, with the account Art-lexa Chung. Begun by Spanish sisters María and Beatriz Valdovín, its premise is simple: take a photo of Alexa Chung and place it next to a painting that resembles it. The results are uncanny. A post from January 2016 shows Chung in a bow-tied navy blue dress coat. Alongside, the 1895 Portrait of Baronne Madeleine Deslandes by Edward Burne-Jones depicts said Madeleine in almost the same dress. It’s downright eerie. The account proves that ageless beauty can be found in the transient and frivolous. Placed beside John William Goddard’s 1902 When The Heart Is Young, a photograph of Chung lying across a sofa in a tulle gown for the Evening Standard gains art-historical significance. How many of Chung’s fans would have heard of Goddard without this account? I know I wouldn’t. Comprising 75,000 followers – including Chung herself – the account’s fanbase is a diligent and vocal one. The way that the Valdovíns pair this thoroughly modern It-girl with the work of master painters such as Egon Schiele, Amedeo Modigliani and Lucien Freud, without derision or preference, is one of the loveliest gifts the internet has given us – and I’m counting Deliveroo in that equation. One fan, 22-year-old Mika Labrague, from the Philippines, saw Art-lexa Chung and thought “that actually feels like life is really imitating art”. Now Labrague is the founder of one of the most-hyped of the hybrid accounts, Call Me By Monet. This places scenes from the Oscar-winning film Call Me By Your Name inside the sun-blazed evergreen of Monet’s finest works, imbuing a cultural moment with artistic permanence. “It’s like art complements art,” Labrague says. “People are into the fact that high-brow art can be compared to what’s happening in pop culture.” Here, there’s no division between the masterpieces in their differing mediums. Gryffindior, meanwhile, spawned from 25-year-old art director Rachel Bernstein’s belief that “for me, Harry Potter and Dior both live in this world of fantasy”. Harry Potter has never been the most fashion-conscious of books or films – nor has Dior been sold alongside toads – yet Bernstein’s vision works. “I grew up with the Harry Potter franchise,” said Bernstein. “The artistry and history of the Dior house is incredible, so it only seemed fitting to place strong characters like Hermione, Harry and Ron in the clothes.” The results are magical – Dumbledore in a Galliano-era robe is a stroke of visual genius. Bernstein notes that “mashup accounts are great – especially when they’re not taken too seriously”. All of these accounts grew out of a sense of fun, creativity and a love of art. Long live the highbrow hybrid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/14/golden-boot-standings-top-scorers-for-russia-2018-world-cup","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-16T10:40:42Z","webTitle":"England's Harry Kane wins World Cup 2018 Golden Boot after scoring six goals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/14/golden-boot-standings-top-scorers-for-russia-2018-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/14/golden-boot-standings-top-scorers-for-russia-2018-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"England's Harry Kane wins World Cup 2018 Golden Boot after scoring six goals","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/17/johnson-joy-naved-jafry-housing-department-religious-charity","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"Secretive religious charity run by top US housing officials raises questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/johnson-joy-naved-jafry-housing-department-religious-charity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/johnson-joy-naved-jafry-housing-department-religious-charity","fields":{"headline":"Secretive religious charity run by top US housing officials raises questions","bodyText":"One of the top officials in Donald Trump’s housing department runs an opaque religious charity with a colleague who resigned from the administration when the Guardian found he was accused of fraud and exaggerated his biography. Johnson Joy, the chief information officer at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), is part of a Christian not-for-profit in Texas with Naved Jafry, who quit as a Hud adviser after inquiries about his professional history. Until this week the group, GJH Global Ministries, invited donations on its website. But it was not clear what work the group did and its mission statements and other information appeared to be copied from those of major churches. GJH was formed in 2014 but Stephen Austin, one of its directors, said in a brief interview: “We literally did nothing.” Following inquiries by the Guardian, GJH’s website was locked from public view. Other directors declined to be interviewed. The group last filed a tax return with the Internal Revenue Service for 2014. Churches and affiliated groups are not required to file annual returns. Before being locked to visitors, one page of GJH’s site showed a photograph of Joy addressing a crowd of people holding Trump campaign placards and wearing red “Make America great again” hats. Another showed Joy posing with Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas. Not-for-profit organisations are barred under federal law from endorsing political candidates. Hud did not respond to requests for comment. Jafry declined to discuss GJH and said: “That was a long time ago.” According to a filing to state regulators, Jafry became the registered agent for GJH in January this year. A one-bedroom apartment in Houston is listed as the group’s headquarters. Joy did not respond to questions about his involvement, including whether he had cited his leadership of GJH when successfully applying to work at Hud. Joy and Jafry both lived in the Houston area recently and attended Lakewood, the megachurch there run by the television preacher Joel Osteen. Joy worked as project manager on Osteen’s cellphone app before overseeing IT at Hud – a position with a $161,900 salary that entails managing dozens of people and a $46m budget. A former business partner of Jafry, Garson Silvers, said Jafry was given his job at Hud after being recommended by Osteen’s mother, Dodie. Jafry disputed this. Don Iloff, a Lakewood spokesman, said: “We don’t comment on employees or ex-employees and whether we did recommendations or not.” Joy founded GJH and said on an ethics disclosure to a government watchdog he was its president. He and his wife remain registered with Texas authorities as two of the group’s seven directors. Until recently, the “about us” page of GJH’s website featured a lengthy text identical to the corporate governance statement of the Hillsong megachurch in Australia. Adrienne Brown of Demoss, a public relations agency that represents the church, said: “Hillsong is not affiliated with GJH Ministries.” A recruitment section directed visitors to a jobs portal for Gateway Church of Southlake, Texas. Lawrence Swicegood, a Gateway spokesman, said: “There is no formal business connection between Gateway Church and GJH Global Ministries.” A page purporting to list GJH’s missions used branding and text from initiatives run by New York’s Times Square Church, which did not respond to several inquiries about whether GJH was affiliated with its initiatives. Jafry was contracted to work as a senior adviser in Joy’s office at Hud last year. He quit after being asked about inaccuracies in his publicly stated biography and lawsuits against him for alleged frauds in Texas. Prior to joining Hud, Joy also ran J3 Global, which was advertised as a staffing agency and consultancy. The company operated out of Joy’s home in Deer Park, Texas. J3’s website was also taken down while this article was being reported. It had featured eccentrically phrased texts relating to technology and business innovation. One page asked visitors: “Does Your business need that ‘it’ factor? Something to push you to the next level of performance – goal achievement you desire – success you envision place where you see your business being, in your head?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/16/stormy-daniels-trump-affair-allegations-physical-harm-lawyer-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T19:54:43Z","webTitle":"Stormy Daniels was threatened with physical harm, lawyer claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/16/stormy-daniels-trump-affair-allegations-physical-harm-lawyer-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/16/stormy-daniels-trump-affair-allegations-physical-harm-lawyer-interview","fields":{"headline":"Stormy Daniels was threatened with physical harm, lawyer claims","bodyText":"The attorney for Stormy Daniels, the pornographic actor who claims to have had an affair with Donald Trump, said Daniels had been threatened with physical harm. Attorney Michael Avenatti declined to say whether or not the threats had come from the president, in an interview on Friday about the alleged affair. Towards the end of a 12-minute interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski asked if Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, “had been threatened in any way”. Avenatti said: “Yes.” Brzezinski then asked: “Was she threatened with physical harm?” Avenatti replied: “Yes.” He declined to answer ensuing questions about whether Clifford’s life had been threatened or if the president had issued any of the threats. “I’m not at liberty to discuss it,” Avenatti said. “You can ask it 17 different ways. I’ll give you the same answer.” Avenatti said details of the threat, and the alleged affair that Clifford has said took place in 2006 and 2007, would be made public in an interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes on 25 March. Earlier this month, Clifford sued Trump and his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, claiming they sought to silence her from speaking about her relationship with Trump. The lawsuit seeks to void a non-disclosure agreement Clifford signed before the presidential election in 2016. A court hearing is set for 12 July in Los Angeles. Cohen said he had used a line of credit based on the value of his own home to gather $130,000 to pay Clifford in a personal capacity. There is no proof that Trump knew about or approved the payment. Trump has not spoken about the controversy and, through aides, has denied the relationship. The first question at Friday’s White House press briefing was about the claim that Daniels had been physically threatened to stay silent and whether Trump was concerned. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said: “Obviously we take the safety and security of any person seriously, certainly would condemn anyone threatening any individual, but I have no knowledge of that situation and would refer you to the president’s outside personal attorneys.” Asked if Trump had anything to say about the claim, Sanders replied: “I haven’t spoke with him about that specifically.” Cohen has denied that Clifford was paid to keep quiet about the alleged affair. On Monday, Cliffored offered to return the money if she could speak freely. The payment to Clifford was known about before the election, but it was not until January 2018 that a celebrity magazine released the transcript of a previously unpublished 2011 interview in which Clifford described an encounter with Trump."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/02/john-duncan-best-photograph-belfast-sectarian-divide-wall-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T15:21:13Z","webTitle":"John Duncan's best photograph: a front-row seat on Belfast's sectarian divide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/02/john-duncan-best-photograph-belfast-sectarian-divide-wall-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/02/john-duncan-best-photograph-belfast-sectarian-divide-wall-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"John Duncan's best photograph: a front-row seat on Belfast's sectarian divide","bodyText":"I’ve lived in Belfast almost all my life. When I took this, I had recently moved to the north of the city, to Limestone Road, in search of cheaper rent. I didn’t know until after I moved in, but it was at the border between a Catholic and a Protestant area. For the first time in my life, I witnessed sectarian violence right on my doorstep: regular riots, brick and bottle throwing.I took it just off Limestone Road, a few minutes from where I lived and still close to where I am now. As a photographer, you get a sort of sixth sense for places that might prove interesting and that’s what drew me here. The place was abandoned, ruined. I’ve no idea who put the chairs there, or whether they were the same people who sprayed the graffiti and smashed the wall. At first glance, the hole looks like it’s been broken through, but if you look closer you can see intact bricks jutting out, almost as if it was taken apart brick by brick. The chairs look out on to the green space, but then there’s a pair of eyes on the wall looking back. I’m interested in the tension between those views. I’m not sure if it’s hopeful or not. Then there’s the evidence of activity, perhaps by different people at different times who’ve long since disappeared. It’s an aftermath, but an aftermath of small, local events – not of a major battle or anything like that. It was taken some time ago, in 2002, but I’ve been making photographs of Belfast since the late 1980s. I’ve traversed it back and forth on foot. That’s the thing about living in a relatively small city for decades: you can observe small changes as they happen, while keeping a sense of the place as a whole. It all adds up to a portrait of Belfast through the decades. After the ceasefire, things started to change and I wanted to capture the new cityscape that was being put in place, which was at times reminiscent of a theatre set. One day, I saw giant trees being carted around the city on lorries. It was all part of the wave of redevelopment surrounding the peace process, with murals of new buildings against blue skies – in lieu of murals of gunmen. The developments were called things like Meridian Plaza or Horizon Building. It was a kind of anodyne future being plotted out for Belfast. But the reality of the city was always different. I’ve been back to this spot since. The building has been knocked down and replaced with an old people’s home. The residents probably have that same view out over Alexandra Park. It’s the only park in Belfast with a wall running through it — one of the so-called peace lines. There are miles of these walls criss-crossing the city. It’s still a very divided place. There’s a long way to go. I once showed this in a gallery in London and it was stolen. Somebody must’ve liked it enough to take it – and it was quite a posh gallery, too.

Appearance: Purple. Origin: A wartime vitamin C supplement for children, named after the blackcurrant plant Ribes nigrum. Taste: Here, try some. Mmm, thanks. I love Ri … Yeurgh! What’s that? Ribena. But Ribena combines the natural sharpness of blackcurrants with the natural sweetness of a lorryful of sugar. This stuff’s just weird. Well, it has been quietly reformulated recently. Some people did notice a new flavour profile. It tastes like a robot’s armpit. Yes, not everyone likes it at first. Suntory, the Japanese megacorporation that owns Ribena, has replaced a lot of the sugar with the sweeteners acesulfame K and sucralose. And it has added polydextrose, a soluble fibre, to keep it gloopy. Why would they do a crazy thing like that? It’s called the soft drinks industry levy, and it comes into force on 6 April. It makes drinks companies pay a tax for adding sugar. Hey! I like sugar. I know, I know. We all like sugar. That’s the problem. We consume too much of it, particularly in drinks, which don’t have to be sugary at all. But sugary drinks are nice! And obesity isn’t. So you take your choice. The British Medical Association thinks the levy is the way to go. Oh, them. They’re always like, “Let’s cure you of this … avoid dying of that … Ribena is worse than anthrax.” I’m not sure they would go that far. Drinks companies had to decide whether to pay the tax – which means less profit or higher prices – or to reformulate, which is what Ribena did, along with Lucozade, Irn-Bru and others. Yeah, but acesulfame K? Sucralose? Those sound like chemicals. Don’t chemicals give you cancer? Those don’t, according to all the evidence. But being obese increases your risk. And it gives you a lot of other nasty things as well. How about polydextrose? The internet says it can cause bloating, farting and soggy poos. Well, it’s fibre, so … yeah, maybe. But I doubt there’s enough in a glass of Ribena. I think you’re missing the point. Ribena used to be yummy. It also used to be 29% sugar. Now it’s 13%. Still, they could have warned us. How? With a big advertising campaign saying they were about to make their product taste worse. Ribena must have decided against that. I didn’t notice any other companies doing it either. In that case, I’m going to boycott all sweet drinks. I’ll just drink tap water when I’m thirsty. That’s kind of the idea … Do say: “It’s all been downhill since they took the cocaine out of Coca-Cola.” Don’t say: “We’ll always have coffee.” • This article was amended on 27 March 2018.

This season the Chinese side Meixian Techand reportedly gave their players a £3m bonus each, just for winning promotion. The payoff that Claudio Ranieri received after being sacked by Leicester was also £3m. These days £3m does not get you much. Unless you are Brighton that is. For their £3m they got Pascal Gross, the player who has registered the most assists of anyone playing for a club outside the top six this season. When Gross’s transfer from Ingolstadt was announced last May the German club’s then sporting director, Thomas Linke, spoke of him like a son leaving home for university, with sadness but acceptance the time had come for him to spread his wings. “Pascal will certainly be remembered as one of the defining players of the club,” Linke said. “It is only a logical consequence that he has attracted attention ... we also appreciate Pascal’s desire to take the next step after five years.” Which is no surprise considering Gross created the most chances in the Bundesliga for two seasons in a row, not bad in a team that were relegated. And he has brought that form to the Premier League, adapting instantly to a new team, division and country. He is not alone in this. Davy Pröpper has formed a terrific midfield trio with Gross and Dale Stephens. Mat Ryan took a while to settle but has established himself as one of the more reliable goalkeepers in the Premier League. José Izquierdo and Ezequiel Schelotto were eased in and are valuable members of the first team. Brighton, in their first Premier League season, seem to have mastered one of the most difficult and random elements of modern football: the transfer market. That there is barely a dud among their recruits is remarkable when you consider the millions spent/wasted by clubs which are supposed to be more practised at this sort of thing. Even more remarkably, they have done this on a budget. Transfer-fee inflation seemed as if it had killed the concept of the bargain but in the summer Brighton spent roughly £40m on eight players, signing two more on loan. For a newly promoted team to build a competitive top-flight squad for that sort of money in today’s market looks almost like witchcraft. In the summer a couple of players – the midfielder Renato Neto and striker Raphael Dwamena – failed medicals. A couple have not settled and the loanee Izzy Brown injured a cruciate ligament; but probably the only new arrival who has not worked out is Markus Suttner. When your biggest transfer mistake is a £2m left-back who might not have been first-choice anyway, you are probably doing all right. There will always be an element of luck and serendipity involved. Had Neto arrived they probably would not have signed Pröpper, and who knows whether the Brazilian would have settled in to the side quite as well. But it is the latter point that is crucial. Finding players is only half the challenge; making them part of the team is even tougher. Chris Hughton believes their success this season is a consequence of good work in previous years. Sound purchases when Brighton were in the Championship – Anthony Knockaert, Shane Duffy, Stephens – helped the new class fit in nicely. “My first full season started well, which meant the ones that arrived after that came into a good group,” the manager said this week. “Then the ones that came in the next summer were joining a team who’d got into the play-offs. It’s certainly easier if you’re bringing players into a team that’s already got a bit of momentum. This season was the unknown but the way they’ve integrated – I’ve been delighted.” Perhaps that is the key: it is not so much that Brighton have signed good players but the right players. Knowing which players are right is in theory very difficult but when there is a plan and some consistency behind the scenes it becomes easier. Brighton are understandably reluctant to crow too much. Their head of recruitment, Paul Winstanley, who presides over a department that combines scouting and analysis, presumably does not want to tempt fate. They will be wary of cautionary tales such as Steve Walsh, lauded at Leicester for unearthing Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kanté, only to move to Everton and find himself handing over £45m for Gylfi Sigurdsson. Unless something calamitous happens in the coming weeks Brighton will avoid relegation, and you can throw in progression to the FA Cup quarter-finals, where they play Manchester United on Saturday, as a bonus. A job (nearly) well done, on the pitch and off it. Who knows for how much longer Brighton will be able to find bargain gems such as Gross. But for now they can be satisfied that they are probably the shrewdest side in the Premier League."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/21/cairo-artisan-district-al-darb-al-ahmar-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T06:30:03Z","webTitle":"Alive with artisans: Cairo’s al-Darb al-Ahmar district – a photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/21/cairo-artisan-district-al-darb-al-ahmar-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/21/cairo-artisan-district-al-darb-al-ahmar-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"Alive with artisans: Cairo’s al-Darb al-Ahmar district – a photo essay","bodyText":"“Whatever manufactured items there are in the world,” wrote the Ottoman traveller Evliya Çelebi in 1671, “the poor of Cairo get hold of them, set them out and trade in them.” Nearly 350 years later, this tradition lives on in al-Darb al-Ahmar. This neighbourhood of 100,000 people, south-east of central Cairo, is said to be home to a thousand workshops. The place teems with artisans crafting everything from tents, books, boxes and brass lanterns to glass bowls and silk carpets. The view from the minaret of the Amir Khyarbek Mausoleum across al-Darb al-Ahmar toward the citadel and the Muhammed Ali mosque (above) The Street of the Tentmakers captures this commercial spirit. Built in 1650 as an arcade, this covered street is a succession of workrooms whose interiors are lined with decorative textiles. From his cubic cavity in the Ottoman-era wall, a weaver called Hasan says that al-khayyamiya, the craft of tentmaking, goes back to the time of the pharaohs. Some of today’s weavers are descended from the families who would produce the kiswa, the fabric that covered the great stone at Mecca, as well as tents, cloths and saddles for those setting out on pilgrimage to Islam’s holiest site. An artisan stitching a new design. For centuries Khayamiya artisans produced tents, cloths and saddles for those embarking on the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca The area, covering just under a square mile, contains more than 40 monuments built during successive Fatimid, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman eras. In collaboration with the government, many of these, such as the Aqsunqur mosque and Amir Khayrbak complex, have been restored by the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) – a non-denominational organisation that works to improve the welfare and prospects of people in the developing world. Sundial on the roof of the Khayrbak mosque; the glass used in the windows was produced by Hasan ‘Hodhod’s’ glassblowing workshop In al-Darb al-Ahmar, the only foreign faces I see are young Muslims from Indonesia. They are attending the nearby al-Azhar University. Most western tourists currently avoid Cairo due to security concerns; there have been attacks on Egypt’s Christian minority in recent years. Walking around the neighbourhood, however, I feel safe. Countless old men, seated at the qahwa where they drink glasses of coffee or tea, welcome me with the words “Ahlan wa Sahlan”. Next to the 14th-century Aslam al-Silahdar mosque, I enter a thread-dyeing house. I meet Salama, who has been a dyer for 73 years. Figures are hauling skeins of cotton out of a stone bath of black dye. Dark steaming liquid streams across the floor. Salama Mahmoud’s dye workshop, where the cotton skeins are dunked in black ink Salama tells me how, under the revolutionary regime of Nasser, business was good: “The Russians would give us weapons and we would give them cloth.” But in 1967 things changed after the disastrous six-day war against Israel. After Nasser came Sadat, who liberalised the economy, opening it up to domestic and foreign investment. Cheaper goods entered the local market. Small producers were hit. Many lost their jobs. Cotton skeins are dried in an industrial dryer, and then transported to the roof of the workshop to be dried further in the sun Most craftsmen and women are immersed in their history, reviving elements of their culture each day. Inside the workshop of two bookbinders near Cairo’s al-Azhar mosque, Aslam and his colleague bind 150 books a day. They are currently binding a tafsir, a commentary on the Qur’an, written in 630 hijri (AD1232). As I leave, Aslam describes one of their “special” books, about Alexander the Great, first produced on papyrus in 330BC. The books are hand produced and stamped When Evliya Çelebi visited Cairo in the 17th century, he recorded 20 workshops employing 300 carpet-makers. “They weave silk carpets and prayer-rugs, in praise of which the tongue falls short,” he wrote. In a small room in the backstreets of the nearby Manshiyat Naser slum that skill is alive today. It takes two people six months to produce a two-by-three-metre silk carpet. It takes two people working eight hours a day, six days a week, six months to produce a carpet this size They sit on a low bench, facing the vertical loom with a cartoon of the finished design above them. Hasan reveals the part of the carpet that has been produced so far, and a finished carpet (right) Near al-Darb al-Ahmar is Cairo’s sprawling City of the Dead, where locals have been buried since the Muslim conquest of Egypt more than 1,300 years ago. Today, because of rapid urban growth, 250,000 Cairenes live among the shrines and tombs. I meet an ex-boxer-turned-glassblower, Hasan “Hodhod”. A former boxer, Hasan Hodhod is perhaps Cairo’s most famous glassblower, and, below, one of Hodhod’s sons at work Hodhod says his work has been associated with ghosts and myths that go back to King Solomon deceiving the Queen of Sheba. In an attempt to dissuade him from taking up such arduous work, his father tried to spook him, describing glassblowing as “the craft of the spirits”. An aish baladi (Egyptian flat bread) seller At dusk a bread-delivery boy cycles by, balancing a five-foot-long tray of freshly baked aish baladi (Egyptian flatbread) on his head. Moments later I meet Mohamed, a third-generation lantern-maker. Inside his workshop, half-finished brass and iron lanterns rest on shelves and tables. To make the ornate metal pieces, he draws on Cairo’s heritage, using Mamluk, Coptic, Andalucían and Moroccan designs. Mohammed Hani at work, and (below) one of his sons working on a lantern, pieces of metal and tools of the trade in the workshop Mohamed says that “Now is the most difficult time,” as the prices of raw materials have risen yet there are fewer tourists – who were his main buyers. He finds an unexpected positive: Syrians have come, because of the war. They started forming workshops, for upholstering beds and producing clothes. Through their enterprise, he reflects, they have contributed to the local economy. Towards the end of my time in al-Darb al-Ahmar, I garner another perspective, which suggests that craftsmen possess a degree of resilience against historical events. I ask an 81-year-old cloth dyer what impact the 2011 Arab spring and subsequent counter-revolution have had on artisans. “For us, nothing has changed,” he says, “except the president. Our lives, the food we eat, the money we earn – it is the same.” It seems history laps over this place in layers, like the lines of a tide. The imprint is felt, but only lightly. Amid so much creation and renewal, the sense of flow is palpable. I believe these artisans are at the heart of this. Despite the tumult in their country and the wider region, they get by. • The Artisans of al-Darb al-Ahmar: Life and Work in Historic Cairo, supported by the Aga Khan Foundation, is on at the Royal Geographical Society, London, 23 March-24 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/18/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-irs-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T11:59:21Z","webTitle":"Investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies face hefty tax bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/18/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-irs-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/18/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-irs-tax","fields":{"headline":"Investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies face hefty tax bills","bodyText":"The rollercoaster ride for some cryptocurrency investors could be about to take another tax-time lurch, according to experts, as the taxman looks for his share of transactions made using bitcoin and its like. Wild fluctuations in the value of digital currencies – bitcoin surged from less than one dollar in 2010 to $997 at the start of the 2017 to nearly $20,000 before settling back to around $8,500 on Friday – have exposed investors to tax bills the value of their coins may no longer meet. On Reddit earlier this week, one contributor, under the heading “I just discovered that I owe the IRS $50k that I don’t have, because I traded in cryptos. Am I fucked?”, wrote they had ended up with a $50,000 tax liability on trades after they sold $120,000 worth of bitcoin to buy different coins. The current value of those coins is about $30,000. “I feel like I might have accidentally ruined my life because I didn’t know about the taxes,” the poster wrote. One complication for crypto investors is that digital currencies that were, in part, devised to operate outside of government and banking industry oversight, are still of interest to the US tax authorities, who look at cryptocurrency as property and not currency. According to the Internal Revenue Service, anything purchased using a digital currency is liable to be taxed as a capital gain. So anyone who has cashed out or paid for anything using cryptocurrency may have capital gains to report to the IRS. Another source of confusion is that crypto-brokers are not required to issue 1099 disclosure forms – the forms used by the IRS to report income other than wages, bonuses and tips – on digital currencies, but individuals are still responsible for reporting gains. In November, a US district court judge in California ordered Coinbase, a popular platform for trading bitcoin, to turn over identifying information on accounts worth at least $20,000 during 2013 to 2015. The IRS case came about after the agency discovered that only about 800 taxpayers claimed bitcoin gains in each year from 2013 to 2015. But the Coinbase agreement only affects about 10,000 accounts, not the 480,000 accounts the IRS first requested. Not reporting gains, it should be said, could amount to tax evasion. And the capital gains ruling is not the only crypto-complication. If an investor sells a cryptocurrency after holding it longer than a year, then the profits are typically long-term capital gains. Nor are losses deductible against future tax years. William Perez, a tax accountant at the online tax filing and advisory service Visor, has noticed that accountants are often unwilling to familiarize themselves with crypto-accounting rulings. “Among crypto-investors, I see resistance to reporting it,” he says. “Then there’s another group who’ve got a 1099 from Coinbase but they don’t know what it means.” Investors are getting caught out in basic ways. For instance, crypto-to-crypto transactions are taxable – if, for example, you use your bitcoin to buy rival ethereum. “That often catches people off guard, but once you break it out you’ve sold one coin and invested in another. That’s one bear trap,” said Perez. The second bear trap, Perez explains, is when crypto is used for purchasing. But crypto is not like PayPal or a gift card, and not merely a conduit of exchange. “Under accounting rules, you have property that you exchanged for something else. “People think because they’ve paid a sales tax so that’s the end of the story. But it’s not. We’re talking about a property denominated in dollars. If you exchange that then there’s a tax liability.” The IRS rules on crypto, Perez says, are straightforward. He anticipates the agency will leave the preliminary guidelines (issued in 2014) in place for a few years to see how they work out. “The US government is getting some hands-on experience with how crypto works,” Perez says. The action against Coinbase, he points out, was about trying get visibility on trades and whose trading. The way tax law is currently written, the government has no way to force crypto-brokers to issue trading information the way stock brokers are required to do. “Once they get through the technological issues, they’re going to want to look at larger patterns, and they had to sue Coinbase because there’s nothing in law that requires crypto-brokers to do any information reporting. IRS wanted information so they could enforce tax law on individuals.” Placing responsibility on the individual to report taxable income is, of course, in keeping with the libertarian perspective of crypto-world. “So on one side, yeah, it’s been easy to avoid tax, but on the other it’s part of the crypto ethos of personal responsibility to own up to it,” Perez says. But shifting responsibility back from the individual back to institutions like Coinbase naturally presumes that information held by crypto-brokers is accurate to begin with. Tax accountant Doug Sipe anticipates problems may arise when tax authorities attempt enforcement on scofflaw crypto-investors. “Even they are getting notifications on transactions over $20,000 what does that actually mean? Do they have a social number? They may know of a transaction, and they may have a name, but can they enact any kind of enforcement? The question is what kind of information have investors given – besides an email address when they registered for an account?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/mar/20/six-reasons-to-celebrate-world-social-work-day","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T05:35:32Z","webTitle":"Six reasons to celebrate World Social Work Day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/20/six-reasons-to-celebrate-world-social-work-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/20/six-reasons-to-celebrate-world-social-work-day","fields":{"headline":"Six reasons to celebrate World Social Work Day","bodyText":"Social workers play an integral role in supporting many of the most vulnerable people, but the annual day chosen to celebrate these professionals is far less well known than the likes of World Book Day. Children’s social workers change lives. Yet the profession can be so misunderstood, and we rarely hear the positive stories of their work. So on World Social Work Day 2018, here are just some of the reasons why we should be celebrating their important contribution to society: 1 They help the half a million children who don’t have a safe home More than 500,000 children in England are growing up in vulnerable or high risk environments. These are the children social workers have been given the responsibility to help and support, leading change for some of the most marginalised families. When called upon, social workers build relationships with families. They ask the right questions to assess risk, bring different agencies together, offer help and interventions to change what’s happening in the family or community. They work with parents to bring greater safety and stability to family life or – if necessary – help find another home for the child. Their work often results in a brighter future for the children who rely upon them. 2 Most people don’t understand what social workers do Unlike professions such as teaching, most people haven’t had a social worker involved in their life. Many people simply do not know what social workers do and there are many misconceptions. What’s the difference between social work and social care or care in the community? Do social workers do more than simply coordinate services? The misunderstanding and misconceptions surrounding the role of a social worker affect those who might consider it as a career. According to the High Fliers 2018 UK Graduate Careers Survey, 73% of final year university students haven’t ever considered being a social worker. With social work programmes such as Frontline rapidly climbing the rankings of desirable graduate careers, this is beginning to change. But more must be done – by organisations such as Frontline, social work employers and the Department for Education – to demonstrate to graduates that the profession is a fantastic career choice. 3 It’s one of this country’s most important professions There are more than 28,000 children and family social workers in England, yet all too often their work goes unnoticed. They are advocates of social justice and enablers of familial change. They tackle serious social issues on a daily basis to help find solutions for children and families most in need. Social workers are responsible for giving evidence in court, and have a vital influence over some of the most significant decisions in a family’s life. The importance of a social worker’s role is immeasurable. Ultimately, what could be more important than ensuring that every child has a safe and stable start to life? 4 It’s one of the toughest but most rewarding jobs Social work is one of the most rewarding jobs. There are few other roles where you can really change the lives of those most in need. No wonder then, that the Guardian Social Lives survey found that 84% are proud of what they do – and 77% enjoy their job. 5 It has the potential to heal society’s deep divisions Empathy is the business of social work. We could all benefit from listening more and seeking to understand in our daily lives. It’s fitting then, that among the themes of this year’s World Social Work Day is “promoting community”, which reflects the important role social workers have to play in bringing people, families and communities together. Our public life would be better for more listening, and great leadership has empathy at its core. All of us have something to learn from social workers. 6 Social workers are responsible for countless unsung positive outcomes Not enough is made of the positive relationships and outcomes social workers are part of every day. It’s hard to share the positive stories because they are not ours to share. They are often incredibly private and should remain so. Even so, we can and should do more to highlight those stories that can be told, and World Social Work Day is a great opportunity to do so.

The remarks come amid rising tensions between London and Moscow. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov have said repeatedly that Moscow would retaliate soon for the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats by Theresa May. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Peskov repeated denials that Russia had ordered the attack on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. “Any references to our president is nothing other than shocking and unforgivable from the point of view of diplomatic behaviour,” he said. The Kremlin had not previously responded to accusations that Putin could have been involved. Peskov’s remarks follow a broad effort by Russian diplomats to reject complicity in the use of a military-grade nerve agent that British authorities believe was developed in the Soviet Union and only available to Moscow. Russia’s powerful Investigative Committee, which handles high-profile cases, announced on Friday it had opened a criminal investigation into the attempted murder by poisoning of Yulia Skripal, the daughter of the former double agent targeted in the Salisbury nerve agent attack. The law enforcement agency also opened an investigation into the murder of Nikolai Glushkov, an associate of the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky who was found dead, probably as a result of strangulation, in his home in London on Wednesday. British police have not said he was murdered. The Investigative Committee said it would manage the investigation “in accordance with the requirements of Russian law” and that investigators were ready to cooperate with British law enforcement. Russia has previously complained that Britain has not shared facts in the case, including samples of the nerve agent that London says was developed in the former Soviet Union. It may choose to demand those samples as part of the investigation. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said on Friday that it was overwhelmingly likely that Putin himself made the decision to use a military-grade nerve agent to strike down a former Russian agent on English soil. “We have nothing against the Russians themselves. There is to be no Russophobia as a result of what is happening,” Johnson said. “Our quarrel is with Putin’s Kremlin and with his decision and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe for the first time since the second world war.” Speaking on Russian television on Friday, the Russian ambassador to Britain, Alexander Yakovenko, said that British government had behaved “in colonial style” in a standoff that has resulted in relations between the two countries falling to their worst in decades. Britain “hasn’t provided a single fact” to back accusations that Russia ordered the attack, Yakovenko said on the state-run Russia 24 channel. The Kremlin said Britain had violated international law. “Very serious accusations are made using the words ‘highly likely’, ‘most likely’,” Peskov told reporters on Friday. “This contradicts not only international law, but common sense in general.” May had heavily criticised the Russian government for responding with “caustic, sarcastic” remarks and announced a series of retaliatory measures, headlined by the expulsion of the 23 Russian “undeclared intelligence agents” posing as diplomats. It is the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats from Britain since 1985, when relations collapsed over the defection of Oleg Gordievksy, a senior KGB agent, from Russia. Russia promised to react swiftly, but so far has not announced its retaliation. On Friday, Lavrov repeated threats that the Russian government would expel British diplomats, but he gave no indication of how many would be sent home or when the expulsions would take place. Peskov told reporters that Moscow’s response “will be coming shortly”. Russia has sought to undercut the British argument that the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack was only available to Moscow. Its envoy to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons claimed on Friday that the novichok nerve agent used in the attack could have come from the US or UK. The two countries are not known to have produced the nerve agent, but international chemical weapons experts did help dismantle Soviet chemical weapons factories after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Jeremy Corbyn has also said the government should not rush to blame Moscow. Politicians must not “rush way ahead of the evidence being gathered by police,” the Labour leader wrote in a column in the Guardian on Friday. He said that Russian “mafia-like groups” could be responsible, rather than the Kremlin. Downing Street said the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, joined May in condemning the nerve agent attack on Friday. Turnbull “expressed his complete solidarity with the UK and its response to the attack” during a telephone call, according to No 10. Also on Friday, Moscow announced it would add more Americans to a “blacklist” in a tit-for-tat exchange over new US sanctions tied to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told state news organisations that Moscow would target the same number of individuals as put under sanctions by the US, which was 19. The US also put sanctions on five companies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/16/why-we-need-to-talk-about-prostate-cancer","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T16:37:03Z","webTitle":"Why we need to talk about prostate cancer | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/16/why-we-need-to-talk-about-prostate-cancer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/16/why-we-need-to-talk-about-prostate-cancer","fields":{"headline":"Why we need to talk about prostate cancer","bodyText":"Both George Monbiot (I have been diagnosed with prostate cancer, but I am happy, 14 March) and Bill Turnbull (Former BBC breakfast host Bill Turnbull has prostate cancer, 6 March) have performed a service to men by sharing their shock at discovering they have prostate cancer. Bill wishes he had had PSA testing more often than every five years; George says that this standard assessment is of limited use. I agree with Bill and take issue with George. My prostate cancer was discovered by two private PSA tests taken 11 months apart. My Gleason score was nine out of 10. I was finally clear of cancer last year after 14 years of treatment. I suggest things could have been a lot worse if I had not had these two tests within a year. George should have mentioned the Prostate cancer risk management programme whose aim is: “… to ensure that men receive information about prostate cancer and the associated risks, and clear and balanced information about the advantages and disadvantages of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. This will help men to decide whether they want to have the test.” It would appear that in both George’s and Bill’s cases, they did not receive clear and balanced information about the test. The implication is that surgeries need to have a notice on the wall that draws men’s attention to their rights under the risk management programme. And, if their GP does not inform them, they should make the first move. Robert Redpath Jordans, Buckinghamshire • It is commendable that George Monbiot shares with us his experience of prostate cancer diagnosis. Also his happiness in where it puts him in his life. It is so important to inform and educate men about this disease, to broadcast the news far and wide. Anecdotally, following 15 years of PSA monitoring due to family history, then two biopsies that make your eyes water a bit, I too was diagnosed with this disease. Like George, I am overwhelmed by the love and support from friends, family and the teams of NHS radiologists who irradiate me daily with their linear accelerators. There is almost a social group in the waiting room, where we prepare for our treatment. A dry camaradie exists and humour too, as we fill our bladders to bursting point with water and insert our microenemas, so the radiologists can see what they’re aiming at. (Big shout out for the radiotherapy teams at the Churchill hospital, Oxford.) Cancer is the great leveller. But there is room for happiness when you do realise, by comparison, how lucky you are. Good luck with your treatment, George. Gordon Cooper Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire • I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, with a Gleason score slightly higher than George’s. I opted for radiotherapy rather than surgery, and the seven weeks I spent travelling five days a week to the Churchill hospital in Oxford were an eye-opener for me, since I have never had any contact with the NHS beyond my (very good) general practice and the odd minor operation. At every stage I was dealt with courteously, informatively and sympathetically, often by staff who were not English. There were six radiotherapy machines, each costing about £2m, to which I had free access, along with the ancillary hormone treatment. The true cost of my treatment came home to me when I read in the Guardian last week of the man who has lived in the UK for over 40 years who was asked to pay £54,000 for a course of radiotherapy for his prostate cancer. Unless there is a change of government soon, this unique healthcare organisation will be irreparably damaged by politicians who despise anyone who is not rich, who use private medicine, and who advocate the discredited use of PFI companies that make profits from selling inferior and overpriced services to the NHS. Karl Sabbagh Bloxham, Oxfordshire • George Monbiot’s response to his diagnosis and forthcoming radical surgery for prostate cancer is impressive and inspiring for others in similar position. But there is a third choice of treatment other than the rather dismal choice between surgery or radiation – namely high-frequency ultrasound, which has fewer side effects and – as with a friend of mine – can be very effective. For some reason it has a lower profile, but is available - and would appear a far less daunting prospect. Andrew Broadbent London • Thank you, George, for that courageous and necessary writing. We admire your brave and clear-sighted approach to your private crisis. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, so that we can emulate your attitude. And we all wish you well in your surgery and aftercare. May the force be with you. Frances Middleton Norwich • George is fit and healthy and his prostatectomy should be very successful. I had the same operation nine years ago and I have no doubt that my life was saved by my excellent GP who insisted that I had regular annual PSA tests. Although my Gleason Score was only 4.5, my doctor was concerned by the sudden increase since my previous test and “for peace of mind” (his and mine), he suggested a biopsy. Like George, my cancer was aggressive and the operation was carried out in under a month. Fortunately, the lymph glands were unaffected and apart from the expected debilitation following major surgery, I was soon fitter than before the operation. Erectile dysfunction is an expected side-effect, but don’t worry, George, medication will help that. All men should have regular PSA tests from age 50 and, if there is a family history of prostate cancer, tests should begin earlier. Delay does kill. I am looking forward to reading George’s next article following his discharge from hospital. Joe Haynes Reading, Berkshire • Thank you, George. I have just been diagnosed too and, at 77, I like the idea of being part of this season’s smart young men. And I like the reasons you give for being happy. They make a lot of sense. My hormone treatment started yesterday and every member of staff was wonderful, kind, thoughtful, skilful and reassuring. Like you, I am happy, but I am also very angry. The idea that the government is determined to sell this national service off to US private business is unbearable. John Airs Liverpool • George Monbiot has covered everything accurately.

Yet many Americans have never even heard of him, and the community feels its fears over safety have been ignored. No terrorism charges were brought against Doggart. No national news outlets covered his arrest. One month after he was taken into custody, a judge released him on bail. As Doggart’s case went before an all-white jury, the Guardian’s new documentary, White Fright, dissects the US’s segregated system of national security, the media’s role in exacerbating terrorist threats, and the failure of society to protect vulnerable communities from racist attacks. Read more on this story from our data editor, Mona Chalabi: Terror attacks by Muslims receive 357% more press attention, study finds. White Fright was commissioned as part of the Guardian Bertha documentary partnership, which aims to tell international stories with global impact. The film’s maker, David Felix Sutcliffe, is an Emmy award-winning documentary film-maker and national security journalist whose work is rooted in racial justice and countering Islamophobia. His feature-length debut film (T)Error, co-directed with Lyric Cabral, premiered at the 2015 Sundance film festival and received a 2017 Emmy award for outstanding investigative documentary. (T)Error was the first documentary to place film-makers on the ground during an active FBI counter-terrorism sting operation. Variety magazine praised the film as “a vital exposé” and Newsweek said it was “astounding”, declaring it one of the best documentaries of the year. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was profiled on NPR’s This American Life, CNN and in the New York Times magazine. Coming up: Cops and Robbers Growing up in Queens in the 1970s and 1980s, Corey Pegues played cops and robbers like all the other kids on the block but he never expected to become both. Released 27 July Our documentary recommendations At the cinema: Although she hasn’t only made documentaries, Agnès Varda has become regarded as a legendary figure in the genre in recent years. There are retrospectives of her work running at both BFI Southbank and Bertha Dochouse in London, and also Home in Manchester. The Gleaners and I and The Beaches of Agnes are unmissable examples from a unique director who is both playful and profound. Her newest film, Faces Places, was a deserved Oscar nominee, and I was disappointed it didn’t win. Looking ahead, I’m excited about this season at the Barbican of 1980s documentaries from the early days of Channel 4, when the doors of TV were thrown open to film-makers from diverse and regional backgrounds. It’s worth trying anything in the season, but the work of the Black Audio Film Collective is probably the top must-attend event. On demand: A festival hit, Over The Limit, is available on iPlayer. It offers unprecedented access to the hidden world of elite gymnasts and the unrelentingly brutal training demanded by the Russian system. Often sad, and with a cast of eccentric and even tyrannical trainers and gymnasts, it’s not easy to watch, but it’s great access.

That match at Anfield in January highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the two sides. At the time it was a game between the team with the best home defensive record in the league and the side with the best away defensive record, and yet nobody was surprised when it finished 4-3. Liverpool, although they eventually lost 5-0, had also troubled City at the Etihad earlier in the season when Sadio Mané was sent off for a high foot on Ederson with the score at 1-0. Both teams press high up the pitch, are heavily focused on attack and, while they can overwhelm sides, the sense is that if you can get beyond the press to attack them they can be vulnerable. Jürgen Klopp has said that to sit deep against a team such as City is to hope to win the lottery, and the effectiveness of his proactive approach is perhaps seen in the fact that no manager has a better record against Pep Guardiola than him: 12 previous meetings have brought him six wins and a draw. Verdict Manchester City Barcelona v Roma This Barcelona are not the side of 2009-11, nor even the team of 2015, but they do have a knack of not losing. Since being roundly outplayed across two games of the Spanish Super Cup by Real Madrid, they have lost once in all competitions and that was to Espanyol in the first leg of a Copa del Rey quarter-final they ended up winning. The last-16 tie against Chelsea, though, suggested a surprising vulnerability, one that makes it hard to understand how they have conceded only six goals at home in the league this season. Sergio Busquets, who is doubtful anyway with a broken toe, may remain a fine distributor and reader of the game but what little pace he had has deserted him and the installation of Ivan Rakitic as a central midfield partner in a 4-4-2 has not offered him protection he perhaps needs. The sight of Willian tearing through open space in the first leg should encourage any opponent. Set against that is the ongoing ruthlessness of Lionel Messi. The suggestion is that Roma are better playing on the break than when they have to take the game to an opponent – they have let in only eight goals away from home in the league this season – but this will be a huge ask of Eusebio Di Francesco’s side. Verdict Barcelona Sevilla v Bayern Munich Jupp Heynckes has won a record 11 successive Champions League games. In three previous seasons managing in the competition he has always reached at least the final. In Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels he has probably the best central defensive pairing in the last eight, a duo who are complementary and have played together for years. The question, as ever with Bayern, is how hardened they are for the fight when they stand 20 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga but the 3-1 victory at home to PSG (admittedly a PSG side who had already qualified) at the end of the group stage suggested the capacity to play a more balanced game than they have to week-to-week. That said, their approach against Sevilla should probably be tilted to attack. In 12 games under Vincenzo Montella, Sevilla have conceded five on three occasions. There is vulnerability, even if the games against Manchester United showed how dangerous they can be, particularly if Wissam Ben Yedder, who has scored more goals in the competition this term than anybody other than Cristiano Ronaldo, is back in form, and if Éver Banega is given space to create the play. Verdict Bayern Munich Juventus v Real Madrid This is a repeat of last season’s Champions League final (and the 1998 final) but neither team feel quite the same as they did in Cardiff. Although Juve eventually had the wherewithal and ruthlessness to beat Tottenham, there were long spells of that last-16 tie in which the Premier League side looked quicker, sharper and stronger. Perhaps that is less of an issue here given Madrid will not press Juve in anything like the same way, not least because the restricted movement of Ronaldo means they cannot. Ronaldo’s sphere of on-pitch influence gets smaller by the season; his continued capacity to score goals is not in doubt but the question is always at what cost to team structure. Madrid have had an indifferent season, lying third in la Liga and finishing second in their group after taking a single point from Tottenham but the abandonment of the familiar 4-3-1-2 for a 4-4-2, with Casemiro and Mateo Kovacic in the centre with Lucas Vázquez and Marco Asensio wide hinted at a possible future. Leaving out Luka Modric and Toni Kroos makes it harder to control possession but the width should mean a steadier supply of crosses for Ronaldo. Verdict Real Madrid"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/957","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T00:00:04Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 957","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/957","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/957","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 957","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/16/kitchen-roll-among-things-britons-wrongly-think-they-can-recycle","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T06:01:01Z","webTitle":"Dirty kitchen roll among things Britons wrongly think they can recycle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/16/kitchen-roll-among-things-britons-wrongly-think-they-can-recycle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/16/kitchen-roll-among-things-britons-wrongly-think-they-can-recycle","fields":{"headline":"Dirty kitchen roll among things Britons wrongly think they can recycle","bodyText":"British consumers are in the dark about exactly what household waste they can recycle, a new poll has revealed, with plastic soap dispenser tops, dirty kitchen roll and wrapping paper topping the list of things they wrongly consider recyclable. Research shows that Britons are more aware than ever of how recycling can help the environment. However, the majority are putting out contaminated recycling due to common misunderstandings, thereby doing more harm than good. Eight out of 10 Britons believe recycling makes a difference, the research for the British Science Association (BSA) shows, yet when quizzed on exactly what items can go into their recycling bins, none of the 2,000 adult Britons surveyed got full marks. The results of the poll also show that millennials, often portrayed as environmentally conscious, are less inclined to recycle than older generations. Among the most common blunders made at home and work, 44% are putting hand soap pump dispenser tops in their recycling bins (they should be removed from the hand soap bottle), 34% incorrectly think dirty kitchen roll is recyclable and more than 20% are recycling coffee cups, greasy pizza boxes, and plastic bags. A fifth of 25- to 34-year-olds said they find recycling too time-consuming and are not in the habit of recycling, while only 6% of over-55s said the same. “It’s encouraging to see lots of people are concerned about plastic waste, but what you can and can’t put in the recycle bin can often be confusing,” said Ivvet Modinou, head of engagement at the BSA. “The industry as a whole needs to address this issue if we are to collectively improve recycling performance. Manufacturers of plastic products could provide clearer information on packaging and local councils should be actively working to improve guidance for local residents.” Craig Stephens, campaign manager for Recycle Now, added: “79% of plastic waste ever created is still in our environment. While more and more of us are recycling, it’s clear that it’s as important as ever for everyone to go the extra mile to protect our planet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/15/telford-get-serious-child-grooming-sexual-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T14:46:10Z","webTitle":"How many Telfords before we get serious about child grooming? | Jess Phillips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/telford-get-serious-child-grooming-sexual-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/telford-get-serious-child-grooming-sexual-abuse","fields":{"headline":"How many Telfords before we get serious about child grooming?","bodyText":"Some time ago I was sitting in the Sunday school room of a local church, with posters made by kids depicting the teachings of Jesus curling at the corners on the walls. I was there to do my advice surgery in my role as a local councillor. A man came in to ask for help getting his family moved to a bigger house. His daughter had two children who had been removed from her care but were allowed to live with her on condition that she live with her parents and they acted as guardians. I diligently took down the names and ages of the children to assess the size of house they needed. He told me his daughter was 20, her children were six and two. It didn’t take a maths genius to work out she had been 14 when her first child was born. He explained that his daughter had struggled with mental health problems, and had “mild learning difficulties”. I asked where the father of her children was. One was “a Pakistani fella with a wife and kids”, and they weren’t sure who the father of the littlest was. I am trained in the issue of sexual exploitation, so instead of seeing the father of a wayward woman who had made bad choices, I looked up from my notepad and said: “I think I need to see your daughter, I’m worried that she has been exploited.” I explained what I thought and he told me his daughter said the men she had slept with were her boyfriends. My heart sank, not because it was so awful – I’d heard lots of similar stories in my time working at rape crisis centres. My heart hurt because I thought of all the social workers she had seen: she had after all had her children removed from her. She had given birth twice, seen many medics, no doubt been at school, seen her GP. No one spoke up. I asked if they had ever contacted the police? He told me the only interaction was when she had been in trouble herself. No one had ever seen her as a vulnerable child, she was just a naughty girl, a bad mum, a fallen woman. This week’s revelations that in Telford, a small industrial town, sexual exploitation could have been occurring on a mass scale with hundreds of vulnerable girls potentially affected is utterly maddening in its familiarity. This is Groundhog Day. Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Telford, they trip off the tongue like a nursery rhyme about a plague. Give it six months and we will have another town to add to our grooming ring of roses. I’m with Lucy Allan, Telford’s MP, who is pressing the government for an independent investigation into grooming in the town. Hitching these incidents to the child sex abuse inquiry does nothing to understand the specifics that lead to exploitation on this scale. Time was that the government funded 15 areas in the UK to set up support services for sexual exploitation. It was linked to the gang violence agenda that sprang from the riots of 2011. That’s gone now, and even so, linking those three things was always naive. Yes sexual exploitation happens in gangs, yes sexual exploitation is most commonly committed by peers. But generalising about the problem is a political shrug and it changes nothing. We need to understand. We need to create a vehicle to tackle the specific nature of grooming gangs. Every police force and every children’s service in the country needs a specialist team that only works on this subject, and the government has to pay for it. It must also fund specialist victims and youth services that can win trust among the difficult to reach groups – who in my experience are not difficult to reach if only people didn’t find them so difficult to look at. These teams need to work on prevention as much as on prosecution, offering intensive work with vulnerable groups of girls – those in care, with special needs, mental health problems and other difficulties. Police teams should be doing outreach work with the communities identified in every case. I live in one of these communities and I know they want things done. We must find a way to talk about this stuff, break a culture of silence and change the story. Telford is not the end, it’s barely even the middle. How many more scandals will it take that are so large we name the town,not the victims? My guess is that it will take more than it should. And then we all fall down. • Jess Phillips has been the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley since 2015"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/21/ill-be-gone-dark-michelle-mcnamara-golden-state-killer-quest","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T07:29:04Z","webTitle":"I’ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara review – in search of a serial killer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/21/ill-be-gone-dark-michelle-mcnamara-golden-state-killer-quest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/21/ill-be-gone-dark-michelle-mcnamara-golden-state-killer-quest","fields":{"headline":"I’ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara review – in search of a serial killer","bodyText":"For at least a decade between 1976 and 1986, a psychopath stalked California. He targeted bungalows in middle-class neighbourhoods stretching from Sacramento in the north to Dana Point, nearly 450 miles to the south. He wore a mask. He was white, probably in his late teens or 20s, wore size nine shoes and had type A blood. He sometimes stuttered, and sometimes cried after attacking his victims. He had a small penis. This is almost all that is known about the prolific rapist and murderer who has been variously dubbed the Original Night Stalker, the East Area Rapist and, perhaps most evocatively, the Golden State Killer. This last epithet was coined by the late Michelle McNamara, whose posthumous book chronicles her decade-long quest to identify this mysterious bogeyman. Like the Zodiac Killer, who terrorised California in the late 60s, the Golden State Killer was never apprehended, and his case continues to intrigue amateur sleuths. A lifelong devotee of true crime, McNamara blogged about her DIY cold-case investigations on the website truecrimediary.com. In 2007, she learned of the East Area Rapist, and her life seems to have changed. “There’s a scream lodged permanently in my throat now,” she writes in her New York Times bestselling, unforgettable I’ll Be Gone in the Dark. When she died at the age of 46 in 2016, leaving the book unfinished, she had amassed 3,500 files related to the case, plus dozens of notebooks, legal pads, digitised police reports and 37 boxes from an Orange County prosecutor (the book was finished by her lead researcher and a colleague). Some of this material went into the blockbuster story she wrote about the case for Los Angeles magazine in 2013, but this book is the real testament to how all-consuming and dogged McNamara’s search was. Like other recent true-crime books – Claudia Rowe’s The Spider and the Fly, Carolyn Murnick’s The Hot One – McNamara’s is as much a memoir as it is a procedural. Early chapters describe the unsolved murder of 24-year-old Kathleen Lombardo in 1984, which occurred just steps from McNamara’s childhood home in Oak Park, Illinois. The case fascinated the teenage McNamara and whetted her appetite for the dark side. “I was a hoarder of ominous and puzzling details,” she writes. “I developed a Pavlovian response to the word ‘mystery’. My library record was a bibliography of the macabre and true. When I meet people and hear where they’re from I orient them in my mind by the nearest unsolved crime.” As a record of obsession, I’ll Be Gone in the Dark delivers a nearly fluorescent portrait of the fanatic’s life: the sleepless nights and shut-in days, the rabbit holes of online message boards, the underground economies of samizdat information. In one vivid passage, McNamara recounts holing up in a Sacramento hotel room to review 4,000 pages of police reports on a flash drive she’d just acquired. A raucous wedding reception was being held 10 floors below. “I was jittery from sugar, hunger, and spending too much time alone in the dark absorbing a 50-chapter horror story narrated in the kind of dead voice used by desk clerks at the DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles],” McNamara writes. “My eyes were stripped by computer glare and as devoid of moisture as if they’d been vacuumed clean by an airplane toilet. Kool &amp; the Gang’s ‘Celebration’ wasn’t the soundtrack for my frame of mind.” This excerpt indicates what’s so unique and convivial about the book: no matter how grisly things get – and there’s no shortage of horror with more than 50 sexual assaults, at least 10 murders, and tableaux of psychological torture – McNamara retains a sense of humour. But it’s a humour tempered by moral exigency. To identify a killer is to take away his power and render him banal, McNamara argues. In one of the book’s many sharp insights, she likens herself and all amateur detectives to the killers they seek. Both perpetrator and sleuth share an uncommon and singular compulsion. One seeks to destroy, while the other seeks to create, however haphazardly, some kind of explanation. Explanations are hard to come by in the case of the Golden State Killer. His first crime was probably a rape in Rancho Cordova, a suburb of Sacramento, in June 1976. His first murder occurred two years later. All the evidence and eyewitness accounts add up to a mere fragment, a faceless cipher who taunted the police and his victims with crank phone calls, kept houses under surveillance before his attacks and seemed to relish playing mind games. He bound some of his female victims, raped them, and then went silent. Just when they believed the terror was over, he’d whisper in their ears or scrape a knife along their backs. He told one victim that he’d been in the army; others described how he cried or hyperventilated after attacking them. According to one, he took a break from his assault to eat crackers in the kitchen. One couple told detectives he “seemed like someone straining to appear tough”. Whatever the extent of his instability, his crimes were real, and they spread panic in California. By 1977, he averaged two rapes a month. McNamara describes how entire towns in northern California were transformed into de facto garrisons patrolled by vigilante squads. “In one house, tambourines were tied to every door and window,” she writes. “Hammers went under pillows. Nearly 3,000 guns were sold in Sacramento County between January and May. Many people refused to sleep between 1 and 4am. Some couples slept in shifts, one of them always stationed on the living room couch, a rifle pointed at the window.” McNamara resurrects two Californian offenders from the 1970s who have largely faded into obscurity – the Early Bird Rapist and the Ransacker. Nothing connects these men. As McNamara points out, crime rates were high all across the country in the 70s. It was a decade adrift from violence and the nihilism of seeing the counterculture erode into drugs, anomie and post-Vietnam malaise. California metabolised 60s idealism and 70s cynicism into a kind of toxic slag. Some of McNamara’s most arresting passages detail the copycat strip malls and subdivisions that replaced orange groves and lush farmland. This hangover feeling is part of the larger tragedy that the book documents. More than 8,000 suspects were investigated as part of the Golden State Killer case. Detectives crisscrossed the country to retrieve DNA samples and follow leads. Yet the killer was never caught or even identified. Even decades after retirement, some detectives are unable to shake the case. “The Golden State Killer haunts their dreams,” McNamara writes. “He’s ruined their marriages. He’s burrowed so deeply inside their heads that they want to, or have to, believe that if they locked eyes with him, they’d know.” You come away from I’ll Be Gone in the Dark suspecting much the same of McNamara. In the book’s lyrical epilogue, she addresses the killer, who she imagines is now an old man somewhere in the dregs of America. (She may be right. In 2001, a man presumed to be him called a woman he’d assaulted 24 years earlier: “Remember when we played?” he whispered.) McNamara sketches a hypothetical but hopeful scene in which a car pulls up to the kerb and detectives emerge to finally arrest the monster who has eluded them for more than 40 years. You can’t help but believe that had McNamara lived, that outcome might have been a little more likely. • I’ll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman’s Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer is published by Faber.

The comedian and actor has launched a new National Theatre initiative to encourage better drama and theatre-making in primary schools. Henry, who recalled on Thursday his secondary school drama lessons as “basically, running round the school hall pretending to be the Avengers”, said good arts and drama education was crucial. “I’m learning there have been massive cuts in teaching the arts in schools and it is cutting off your nose to spite your face. If you are not teaching children how to be creative and curious, what are you preparing them for? You are not preparing them for the outside world,” said Henry. Andrew Lloyd Webber has condemned as a “national scandal” cuts to music lessons in UK schools. “It is the same thing for drama,” said Henry. “We have an issue in this country in terms of working class people having access to activities like writing and plays and music. Working class people are under-resourced when it comes to the arts and we need to rebalance that.” He said there was one rule for private schools, which often have extensive, well-resourced arts lessons, and another rule for all other schools. Henry launched the National Theatre programme, called Let’s Play, at Hill Mead primary school in Brixton, London. “The more you see kids like this having structured play and structured activity in the theatrical arts the more you get a sense of them stretching out. You wonder whether that’s a thing: ‘You don’t need to do that, you’re only going to work in a factory any way!’ If there were factories to work in.” Lisa Burger, executive director of the National Theatre, said theatre should be available to all children across the UK, but budget cuts and an increasing focus on testing and assessment around literacy and numeracy was squeezing out drama. “Let’s Play comes from our general concern about the state of drama education in the school curriculum,” she said. The new initiative is based on an idea from the theatre director Katie Mitchell. It involves the National Theatre commissioning new plays with songs and music for primary aged children to perform. It hopes to recruit at least 700 schools to the programme over the next three years and train 1,000 teachers. The aspiration is that by 2020, 50,000 pupils will have taken part in Let’s Play. Many arts leaders have spoken about what they see as a decline of arts education in UK schools. One issue is the lack of a compulsory arts subject in the English baccalaureate. Last month Arts Council England (ACE) announced more details of the Durham commission on creativity and education, which will explore the best ways of nurturing creativity in young people. It will be chaired by the ACE chairman, Sir Nicholas Serota, who said the commission was an opportunity to “step back, review the evidence, see what has worked, and come up with some proposals” that could be considered by his organisation and the government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/15/winter-paralympics-usa-and-canada-to-meet-ice-hockey-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T14:59:14Z","webTitle":"Winter Paralympics: USA and Canada to meet in men's ice hockey final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/15/winter-paralympics-usa-and-canada-to-meet-ice-hockey-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/15/winter-paralympics-usa-and-canada-to-meet-ice-hockey-final","fields":{"headline":"Winter Paralympics: USA and Canada to meet in men's ice hockey final","bodyText":"A light programme in Pyeongchang meant the focus moved from the slopes to indoor arenas on Thursday, with para ice hockey and wheelchair curling the two main events. The final of the para ice hockey will be between Canada and the USA. Canada, the 2006 gold medallists, thrashed the hosts, South Korea, 7-0 in the first semi-final, before the USA secured an impressive 10-1 victory against Italy. Canada’s Liam Hickey, who also represented his country at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in wheelchair basketball, said: “To have one more game to focus on is a special feeling and we want to win it for everybody back home as well as for ourselves. Right now we are excited we have a chance to play for gold. The nerves will probably start to kick in for me on game day.” Given their progress so far, Canada do not have much to be nervous about in Sunday’s final. They have won every match in South Korea and are yet to concede a goal. Three members of the team will be bidding to make it their second gold, having taken part in the victory in Turin 12 years ago. The Canadians will also be competing in the wheelchair curling semi-finals. They join China, South Korea and Norway in the last four. Britain finished seventh in the table, winning five and losing six of their matches. Norway secured the final spot in the semi-finals after two tense victories on the last day of round-robin matches – defeating the USA 5-4 and then coming back from 6-3 down to edge out Slovakia 7-6 in a final end in which the stones had to be measured to determine the winner. The Norwegians go on to play South Korea in Friday’s semi-finals, while Canada meet China. Meanwhile there seems little prospect of Russia returning to the Paralympian fold any time soon. Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee, said Russia “had progressed a lot” but the IPC would not change its stance on the Russian Paralympic Committee, which was banned in 2016 following revelations of a mass doping programme. “The situation is very clear because we have agreed reinstatement criteria with the Russian Paralympic Committee,” Parsons said. “We cannot right after these Games, for example, lift the suspension – they have to meet these criteria.” Thirty Russian athletes are competing in South Korea under the team banner of Neutral Paralympic Athletes. Collectively they are second in the medal table. South Korea’s skiing federation has banned for life two male mogul skiers who competed at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after two female team-mates complained of being sexually harassed at a World Cup event. A federation official said interviews with athletes and coaches confirmed that Choi Jae-woo and Kim Ji-hyun harassed and assaulted the women for refusing to have drinks with them on 3 March, while they were at the Lake Tazawa resort in Japan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/15/briton-daniel-jones-apologises-for-pornographic-images-in-cambodian-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T13:55:02Z","webTitle":"Briton in Cambodia 'pornographic' images case apologises in court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/briton-daniel-jones-apologises-for-pornographic-images-in-cambodian-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/15/briton-daniel-jones-apologises-for-pornographic-images-in-cambodian-court","fields":{"headline":"Briton in Cambodia 'pornographic' images case apologises in court","bodyText":"A British man facing up to a year in prison in Cambodia for allegedly posting “pornographic” images on social media to promote a pool party has apologised during a court hearing, saying he was unaware the advertisements breached an indecency law. Daniel Jones was one of 10 arrested, including four others from the UK, in Siem Reap in January as part of a crackdown on what local authorities called “immoral behaviour” in the town. Siem Reap is a popular destination with travellers and backpackers but is also adjacent to Cambodia’s most sacred site, Angkor Wat. They were arrested after the police raided a pool party in a private villa in Siem Reap, where they found dozens of travellers dancing and drinking in bikinis. The other foreigners arrested were all released on bail and deported, but Jones, 31, from Essex, was kept in Cambodia to face trial as he was deemed to be the organiser of the event. Jones, who has already spent two months in prison, faces charges of producing pornography in relation to images that were put on social media to advertise the Let’s Get Wet party. Police say they had told Jones not to host the party, but that he had hired a private villa and gone ahead with it anyway. They allege that when they raided the event they found people “dancing pornographically”. Jones apologised in court for any offence he had caused to Cambodian culture but insisted there was no nudity or sex involved in the party. Speaking about the pictures that had been used to promote his event, Jones said he had not taken them but “now I understand in Cambodia that these pictures are not good. I did not understand Cambodian law. I am very sorry for that.” The police had previously cracked down on the popular pub crawl events in Siem Reap after they found images of participants in sexually compromising positions which were posted publicly on social media. These pictures were shown in court, where Jones clarified they were not from an event he had organised. Jones’s lawyer, Ouch Sopheaktra, said: “My client thinks that the pictures that were posted on social media were not unlawful, as he thought those photos were used only as advertisements. I also don’t see those photographs as basis for the court to use as the main evidence to accuse and convict him.” No date has been set for a verdict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/15/pep-guardiola-sam-allardyce-jose-mourinho-bar-managers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T12:30:36Z","webTitle":"Winning is no longer enough for managers – they must do it with style | Liam Rosenior","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/15/pep-guardiola-sam-allardyce-jose-mourinho-bar-managers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/15/pep-guardiola-sam-allardyce-jose-mourinho-bar-managers","fields":{"headline":"Winning is no longer enough for managers – they must do it with style","bodyText":"After five minutes of Brighton’s game at Goodison Park on Saturday with the score at 0-0, a passionate and extremely vocal Evertonian took the opportunity to run to within five yards of the dugout I was sitting in and vent his anger and frustration by screaming “Get out of my fucking club” directly at Sam Allardyce – the man who, in my opinion, has successfully done the job required and expected of him. The Everton manager has stabilised a huge club that had lost its way to the point where relegation was a distinct possibility based on the performances and results before his arrival in November. He has utilised his extensive experience and steadied a rocky ship by winning home games with his organised, methodical and pragmatic style of play. Everton are in a mid-table position where only a catastrophe would drag them into a relegation dogfight. Surely from his perspective he has done a successful job from the position they were in and, in turn, he has convinced the board and the fans, who passionately support this fine club, he is the right man for the job in the long term? Judging from that Everton fan and reports in the press it seems not. Gaining better results than your predecessor and winning matches regardless of style no longer seems to be enough, and the debate over the future of a manager who has achieved success in his own distinct fashion is not only about the results Allardyce consistently seems to gain but more about the manner in which he gets them. So are we entering an age when style and footballing philosophy are becoming just as important as substance and result when it comes to appraising a manager’s ability? Look at the analysis of José Mourinho and Manchester United’s win over their rivals Liverpool. In the buildup and aftermath of the game pundits and supporters were not only discussing and dissecting the result but the tactically pragmatic way in which Mourinho sets up his sides to win. Some United fans and former players have stated on numerous occasions during his tenure that winning by the odd goal at a club with United’s attacking philosophy isn’t enough and they demand he sets up his teams to mirror that famous tradition. We are approaching and reaching a time when managers are not judged solely on results but also when their process, philosophy and style of play have a huge influence on how they are perceived. I think we can all agree Manchester City are raising the bar in terms of not only results but also the style of offensive, high-intensity, expressive football they produce. Within 18 months of taking charge at City, Pep Guardiola is not only raising the level teams need to perform at in order to compete with them but increasing the expectation we have of managers, to win and play in a way that entertains and justifies the hard-earned money supporters pay for season tickets, TV subscriptions, club merchandise and expensive travel costs. The fact Guardiola is winning with style is increasing the demands on Mourinho, Allardyce and many other managers in the Premier League. Mourinho and Allardyce have been hugely successful in their careers and I have huge admiration for them, especially in being pragmatic enough to win games by any means necessary. But what Guardiola along with Mauricio Pochettino are showing is that having a clear, defined and, most importantly, offensive playing style makes it possible to win consistently while improving the technical level of the players and entertaining fans at the same time. I understand the argument that the aim of managing a club is to secure as many victories as possible, with philosophy and method of play a distant second, but with the vast amounts of money Premier League clubs earn, the wage budgets and the cash supporters are forking out, a new question has been posed: is it unreasonable for fans to ask to be entertained and to watch football that places them on the edge of their seats every game? This is the balance many managers, already under pressure to keep their jobs by just winning games, are having to strike. They are being asked to play in a way that suits the demands of supporters and the ever-increasing media exposure that comes with the Premier League. I believe these added pressures can only raise the technical level. There is more discernment from fans wanting technical, exciting football rather than defence-oriented football focusing on long balls and set pieces. Fairly or unfairly we are now appraising coaches not only on results but the manner, process and style used to get there, and style is more than ever becoming as important as substance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/15/austin-police-flooded-with-hundreds-of-calls-about-packages-after-bombings","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T11:59:21Z","webTitle":"Austin police flooded with hundreds of calls about packages after bombings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/austin-police-flooded-with-hundreds-of-calls-about-packages-after-bombings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/austin-police-flooded-with-hundreds-of-calls-about-packages-after-bombings","fields":{"headline":"Austin police flooded with hundreds of calls about packages after bombings","bodyText":"Police in Austin have received hundreds of calls about suspicious packages as they seek to solve a series of bombings that have killed two people. Packages made of cardboard have exploded at three homes in the Texas city this month, putting residents on edge. The first, on 2 March, killed 39-year-old Anthony House. Draylen Mason, 17, died when a box was opened inside his home on Monday morning. His mother was injured. About five hours later, a 75-year-old woman was seriously hurt as she picked up a package outside her house. “From everything I’ve heard about Draylen he was an outstanding young man who was going places with his life and it’s an absolute tragedy that he is no longer with us,” Brian Manley, the Austin interim police chief, told reporters on Tuesday. Police are asking residents to call 911 if they see a suspicious package, such as an unexpected delivery left on their doorstep overnight that was not delivered by a service such as the USPS, FedEx or UPS. As of Wednesday morning they said they had taken 370 calls, none resulting in the discovery of another device. The attacks happened miles apart from each other in neighborhoods in the east and north-east of the city. The two who died were black and the 75-year-old woman is Hispanic. Authorities have not ruled out a racial motive. “That is something we have to pay attention to. That does not indicate that it’s a hate crime. But we’re not going to rule that out because we don’t want to limit anything that we’re considering,” Manley said in the media briefing. Police initially believed the first bombing was an isolated act of retaliation for a drugs raid they had carried out nearby, but now think the attacks are linked and are searching for connections between the victims. The two who died reportedly knew each other. The city is currently hosting thousands of visitors to the annual South by Southwest festival. Rewards from state and local authorities worth $65,000 have been offered for information leading to an arrest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/18/space-stations-iss-decommissioned-next-generation-orbital-base","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T06:59:00Z","webTitle":"Space stations: our future among the stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/18/space-stations-iss-decommissioned-next-generation-orbital-base","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/18/space-stations-iss-decommissioned-next-generation-orbital-base","fields":{"headline":"Space stations: our future among the stars","bodyText":"Chinese Large Modular China’s Tiangong-1 space station is likely to crash back to Earth next month. However, the People’s Republic is planning a larger manned facility of about 80-100 tonnes.

Deep Space Gateway Nasa and its international partners are planning a replacement for when the ISS is decommissioned in 2028. Although smaller, the replacement may travel further than the Apollo missions and will orbit near the moon. It is hoped the gateway could serve as a hub for missions to Mars by the 2030s. B330 This is an inflatable space habitat being developed by Bigelow Aerospace. The skin will be about a foot thick and it is claimed it will offer superior radiation and ballistic protection to that of the ISS – its mass to habitable space ratio is far superior than a rigid module. Bigelow has signed a deal with United Launch Alliance to launch a B330 in 2024. Axiom This private company’s plan is to launch modules that will link with the current ISS, but remain in a low Earth orbit once the original space station is shut down. Axiom plans to generate revenue from space tourism and by using its craft as a manufacturing base for items such as small satellites. Some of its products could return to Earth – for example, fibre optics made under low-gravity conditions are free of imperfections.

The battle has pitted Hallyday’s widow Laeticia, to whom he left his entire estate, against the singer’s two elder children, who were disinherited. On Thursday, the tribunal at Nanterre outside Paris was asked to determine who holds the “moral right” to Hallyday’s body of work and particularly an album he was working on when he died. At the heart of what is set to be a long-drawn out dispute, is whether Hallyday’s last will, drawn up in America, is valid or whether his estate falls under much stricter French inheritance laws; is he French, for tax purposes, or American. When Hallyday, known as the French Elvis, died aged 74 in December after being treated for lung cancer, there was little doubt France was honouring one of its own. The country was engulfed by a wave of grief for a man who sang in French to an overwhelmingly French audience, and who died in France before being buried on the French West Indian island of Saint Barthélemy. That Hallyday’s father was Belgian and that he chose to bring up his youngest children in Los Angeles was not mentioned at the funeral, an occasion of national pomp and ceremony attended by French politicians, pop stars and President Emmanuel Macron. An estimated million fans turned out in the streets to pay tribute to the star. The public show of family unity lasted as long as it took to open and read his will. The document, written in English, made Laeticia his executor, and left everything to her and their two adopted children. He put the management of his global estate into a trust. Hallyday’s elder children David Hallyday, from his marriage to the singer Sylvie Vartan, and Laura Smet, whose mother is the actor Nathalie Baye, were left nothing. The star reportedly declared he had made full and adequate provision for them while he was alive. On Thursday, lawyers for the two plaintiffs said the two elder children were seeking to be involved in their father’s posthumous album to participate in its production and be kept informed of track titles, the album cover and work being done on it. They were “exercising their rights as heirs” and requested a legal order giving the singer’s widow 48 hours to allow them access to the album or pay €10,000 for every day she failed to do so. They also sought a freeze on selling property or titles that are part of their father’s estate. However, French judges said they had no details of the trust or where it is registered. The court has also been asked to examine the question of whether the Frenchman had the right to escape France’s inheritance laws, which do not allow children to be disinherited, by claiming to be resident in Los Angeles. Under French law, the star’s widow is entitled to 25% of his estate and each of his children an equal 18.75% part. His widow’s lawyers say the final will was drawn up under American laws allowing him to distribute his fortune entirely as he wished. The case is being closely followed by the French tax authorities which stand to lose their part in the inheritance if the US will is deemed valid and binding. Laeticia Hallyday, 42, became the fourth and final wife of Hallyday, who was 32 years her senior, in 1996 when she was 21. The couple adopted two children from Vietnam; Jade, 13, and Joy, nine. Hallyday, who sold more than 110m records in a long career, owned a large home on the outskirts of Paris, where he died, a villa on the Caribbean island of St Barthélemy, and two properties in Los Angeles, where Jade and Joy attend school. Hallyday’s estate also includes the rights to more than 1,000 songs, and a collection of prestige cars and motorbikes. Laeticia Hallyday has issued a statement threatening to sue anyone who insinuates the rocker was manipulated into changing his will and has warned she will not be cowed by “intimidation or insults”. None of the protagonists attended the hearing on Thursday afternoon. Judges adjourned the case until 30 March for documents to be translated and examined."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/15/mother-son-kneecapped-northern-ireland-brexit-border","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T12:25:34Z","webTitle":"I found out what happened when a mother took her son to be kneecapped in Northern Ireland | Sinéad O’Shea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/mother-son-kneecapped-northern-ireland-brexit-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/mother-son-kneecapped-northern-ireland-brexit-border","fields":{"headline":"I found out what happened when a mother took her son to be kneecapped in Northern Ireland","bodyText":"A report this week by the Guardian revealed police figures showing that paramilitary punishment shootings and beatings have risen in Northern Ireland by 60% in the last four years. One shocking detail of the report that was barely remarked upon was that some parents, turning to paramilitaries for policing, have been voluntarily taking their own children to the gunmen to be punished, drugging them up with alcohol or painkillers first. This is a horrifying development, and yet, in common with much else to do with Northern Ireland, it has barely registered as an issue within the rest of the UK. Punishment shootings facilitated by family members is a phenomenon with which I, as a documentary film-maker, am very familiar. In 2012 I began talking to the O’Donnell family in Derry. Earlier that year Majella O’Donnell had taken her teenage son, Philly, to be shot by local gunmen. Majella, her son and his shooters are all part of a community that considers itself to be still at war. They are Republican dissidents and do not feel represented by the Republicans who signed up to the Good Friday agreement on their behalf. I have made films all over the world but on my doorstep found a story that was more compelling than anything I’d ever previously encountered. Majella’s community does not believe in the police or the government. Previous decades of what they see as state oppression have not been undone as far as they are concerned. This means that when there is a problem, they seek to resolve it internally. Philly O’Donnell had been accused of drug dealing, and so that situation was “looked after” from within. Unsurprisingly, the shooting (Philly was “kneecapped” or shot in the back of both legs to avoid an even harsher murder “sentence”) had many unintended consequences and I filmed with the family over the next five years exploring those effects. I also got to know Hugh Brady, a former paramilitary-turned-community worker in the Rosemount Resource Centre, who mediated between the O’Donnells and the shooters. He and his team carry out hundreds of these mediations on behalf of families and individuals who are under threat of shooting, banishment or death for behaviour that undermines community life. This shadow justice system all happens within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. Making the film was an exceptionally difficult project. It took months of visits before I could begin, as this community is defined by its distrust of outsiders. Many felt isolated. Paradoxically they also felt very controlled. I was repeatedly told that their phones and computers were under surveillance and that I, too, was being watched. It was almost impossible to plan anything. Appointments were rarely kept. Eventually I realised this was significant. This is a community that considers itself still at war, and these were people so used to conflict that it was a struggle to live without it. And so arrangements were forever in flux, problems were exaggerated. I never knew who was telling the truth. I saw tiny misunderstandings escalate into shootings and feuds. Yet every person I met was idealistic and aspired to do the “right thing”. Life is tough in this part of Northern Ireland. Unemployment levels are among the highest in the UK, alcohol and drug abuse are rife, but people still lived compassionately. In difficult times of my own, they offered me advice, and made me laugh. The resulting film, A Mother Brings Her Son to Be Shot, will receive its international premiere this weekend in Copenhagen, at CPH:DOX, one of the most prestigious documentary festivals in the world, where it has been nominated for an award. The Oscar-winning director Joshua Oppenheimer is now executive producer. The international interest is in disappointing contrast with the UK. The documentary premiered at the London film festival last year but as yet, no UK broadcaster has committed to screening it, despite mounting concerns that Brexit could reawaken old divisions. I can’t help thinking this apathy is part of the same general lack of engagement in the UK regarding Northern Ireland. And it was this disengagement that led to a vote for Brexit that could restore the Irish border, with serious consequences. Some of the people I met during the making of my film are just waiting for an excuse to return to the Troubles. They have not yet recovered from the conflict, nor accepted that the political process requires them to “move on”. They continue to nurse grievances, they plot, they openly carry arms, indeed they yearn for bigger and better weapons. They miss the drama of war, and the identity it gave them. Their children have grown up with this. None of this suits the narrative that the Good Friday agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland. The agreement was a vital achievement for all involved, and should be protected, but some sections of the community still feel that they lack support and believe the peace process has not provided for them. This state of mind is widespread within Northern Ireland. More people have taken their own lives there in the last 20 years than were killed during the Troubles. Yet even in this psychologically fraught context, British politicians recklessly toy with the idea of reinstating a border and dismiss concerns with talk of technology that will ensure “frictionless” trade. The UK bears grave responsibility for what is happening in Northern Ireland. It must govern all the people there, even those who remain unreconstructed and inconvenient. • Sinéad O’Shea is a film-maker and journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/15/trump-presidency-unravelling-administration-enemies","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T16:38:26Z","webTitle":"Trump’s presidency is unravelling.

But he won’t fall without a push","bodyText":"Even by Donald Trump’s standards, Tuesday was extraordinary. First came the tweet that he had fired his secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Then a state department spokesman issued a statement claiming Tillerson was “unaware of the reason” for his dismissal, and had heard about it on Twitter. A few hours later the spokesman had been fired too. Meanwhile the lawyer of porn actor Stephanie Clifford (stage name: Stormy Daniels), who allegedly had an affair with Trump, warned the country to “buckle up” as Clifford sought to extract herself from her non-disclosure agreement so she could “publish any materials, such as text messages, photos and/or videos relating to the president that she may have in her possession”. Back in Washington, the Trump team announced it would be hiring John McEntee, Trump’s former personal assistant, as a senior adviser for campaign operations. The day before, McEntee had been escorted from the White House because he is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security for serious financial crimes. While all this was going on, voters in south-west Pennsylvania’s 18th district went to the polls in a byelection, in a district Republicans have held for the past 15 years. It was so safe that Democrats didn’t even bother contesting the last two elections. Trump trounced Hillary Clinton there by about 20 points. It should have been a shoo-in for the Republicans. By the end of the night Democrats were celebrating a wafer-thin victory, though this may yet be challenged. Witnessing Trump’s presidency unravel so spectacularly provokes a perverse joy. The venality is so baroque, the vulgarity so ostentatious, the inconsistencies so stark, the incompetence so epic and the lies so brazen, it leaves you speechless. His vanity is without guile and the scandals that embroil him without end. Almost everything he says and does has been publicly contradicted, by himself, usually on Twitter. On Tuesday he said of Tillerson’s departure: “Rex and I have been talking about this a long time … We were not really thinking the same”. On 1 December he tweeted: “The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon – FAKE NEWS! He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!” It’s amazing to think he ever imagined he could get away with it. And with each test at the ballot box it seems he can’t. Republicans have been crushed in elections around the country. Some defeats, like that of the alleged paedophile Roy Moore in Alabama, are unlikely to be repeated; others, like the gains across Virginia in November, indicate more sustained progress. There has been a relatively consistent swing of about 15 points to Democrats in state and congressional races that has seen them take over 40 seats from Republicans, including in states such as Florida and Wisconsin where Clinton lost in 2016. Midterm elections are almost never good for the party in the White House. On current trends, this November will be a disaster for Republicans. And yet, even as voters reject him and he becomes increasingly isolated in his own fetid lair, the cloud that glowers over this moment remains far more imposing than any silver lining. There are two main reasons why progressives should refrain from revelry. First of all, things are going to get worse before they get better. Tillerson, the former head of ExxonMobil, was a disastrous secretary of state. Ineffectual abroad, it soon became clear that he spoke with precious little authority. As he attempted to calm down tensions between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Trump sided publicly with Saudi Arabia; when he tried to kick-start negotiations with North Korea, Trump tweeted that he was “wasting his time”. It seems the place where Tillerson had most impact was in his own department where, under his watch, morale has plummeted and there has been an exodus of talent and knowledge. And yet it was, reportedly, Tillerson who helped keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. Extreme as the last year of US foreign policy has been, ostensibly Trump was being reined in. That restraint has gone. Tillerson’s replacement, CIA director Mike Pompeo, is an Islamophobic climate-change denier who opposes the deal with Iran and has made nods towards regime change in North Korea. “With Mike Pompeo, we have a similar thought process,” said Trump. That is not encouraging. Replacing Pompeo at the CIA is Gina Haspel, who oversaw a CIA torture site in Thailand where detainees were interrogated. The scandal used to be that there were advocates of torture in the West Wing. Now its practitioners are in office. But the problem is not simply that things will get worse. It’s that it’s not at all obvious that, electorally at least, there’s a clear sense of what “better” would look like, beyond getting rid of Trump. Politically the country is clearly shifting leftwards. The nationwide walkouts of schoolchildren against gun violence on Wednesday, the women’s marches and teachers’ strikes, all suggest a swelling resistance to the Trump agenda. Pennsylvania is just the latest evidence that this has had an electoral impact. But while the Democrats are happy to take the wins, they have not yet processed why they lost. They are beneficiaries of the frustration and anger. But there is little evidence that they are shifting with it, let alone cohering or leading it. Conor Lamb’s victory in Pennsylvania was a progressive advance insofar as it was a setback for Trump. That’s great as far as it goes, but it doesn’t go nearly far enough. He was introduced at one rally as a “God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending, social-security-believing, healthcare-greeting, sending-drug-dealers-to-jail Democrat”. That, arguably, is what you have to be to get elected in south-west Pennsylvania. But nationally Democrats need a more hopeful message with a broader appeal. They haven’t got one. On Wednesday the Senate passed a Republican bill that would provide the most comprehensive rollback in banking regulation since the financial crisis, with significant Democrat support. One would have assumed, in a period of growing inequality and stalling social mobility, that opposing it would be obvious if you wanted to win back those disenchanted rust-belt voters in Michigan and Wisconsin who stayed at home or backed Trump. Senate Democrats are instead divided, apparently confused over whether they should advocate for their base or the banks. The problem with Democrats looking on Donald Trump’s presidency as a slow-motion car crash is that it concedes they are spectators at a moment when they should be in the driving seat – and that, when we come to survey the wreckage, there will be many innocent victims. • Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/15/britains-key-role-in-helping-the-un-to-combat-sexual-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T15:19:50Z","webTitle":"Britain’s key role in helping the UN to combat sexual abuse | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/15/britains-key-role-in-helping-the-un-to-combat-sexual-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/15/britains-key-role-in-helping-the-un-to-combat-sexual-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s key role in helping the UN to combat sexual abuse","bodyText":"Your article criticises the UK for not contributing to the trust fund in support of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse (‘Glib’: UK criticised for failing to give to fund for survivors of UN sexual abuse, theguardian.com, 13 March). Since 2015, the UK has been one of the most consistent and generous contributors in helping the UN combat sexual exploitation and abuse. This commitment was reinforced by the UK’s signing of the voluntary compact with the secretary general on the engagement to eliminate sexual exploitation and abuse last year. The UK is also a member of the secretary general’s circle of leadership to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse in UN operations and continues to support key initiatives in peacekeeping and special political missions. The UK has been a key enabler in the fields of prevention, enforcement and remedial action to address sexual exploitation and abuse, supporting initiatives in a variety of fields: screening of all personnel for prior misconduct; development of a risk management toolkit and of policies related to enforcement including a reporting template for member states; updates to the victim assistance programme; development of a victim assistance tracking database; rollout of an e-learning module on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and the new conduct website, www.conduct.unmissions.org. The British government is also funding a groundbreaking project on communicating with the public on sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping missions. This project has helped set up and expand community-based reporting networks and assisted communities and the media understand the risks associated with sexual exploitation and abuse in local languages. We are grateful for the continued partnership and support of the UK on this critical issue.

But no, here’s another: send a bunch of them on a gruelling 800km hike across the mountains and plains of France and Spain. Yes, I think that works. Because they will also be exploring their spiritual sides as well as contemplating the existence of God as they trudge. No problem for Kate Bottley, the Gogglebox priest, though sometimes her godliness deserts her. “Are we going up that bastard?” she asks Badly Behaving Man Neil Morrissey, pointing at a hill ahead. Turns out they’re not going up that bastard, a beautiful bastard, created by God. Lovely scenery by the way. Comedian Ed Byrne doesn’t believe. “The moment of realisation was when I saw them installing a lightning conductor on my local church,” he says. “You’re not showing any faith, why should I?” Heather Small, once of M People, says: “All my life I’ve searched for…” THE HERO INSIDE YOURSELF, shouts everyone who remembers the 90s. Wrong, the correct answer is “a place to be a spiritual home”. Still she should bellow out Search for a Hero, to keep them all going, and thinking positive. Moving On Up maybe on ascent of bastards. Investigative journalist Raphael Rowe doesn’t like the single bunks and the slatted windows in the lodges along the way; it gives him flashbacks to the 12 years he spent in prison. Debbie McGee agrees. “Cell Block H comes to mind,” she says. Debbie has a meaningful encounter with a man who’s finding it even tougher getting over the death of his father than she is getting over the death of Paul Daniels. The fact that they’re seeking answers to a few of life’s big questions as they go lifts Pilgrimage a little above other celebrity humiliation shows. It’s still reality/survival television, but a slightly classier, BBC2 variety of it. Quite good fun and you needn’t feel embarrassed watching it. “They have only 15 days to cover nearly 800 kilometres,” says narrator Lee Ingleby. “So they’ll walk some of the route in sections.” Er, hang on, I think he means they’re cheating, doesn’t he?

The thunderclaps were created by lightning in the towering plumes of ash that rose from the Bogoslof volcano in the Aleutian islands. The booms were picked up by microphones on another island some 40 miles away. The sound of volcanic thunder has never been captured before, chiefly because it is so hard to disentangle from the bangs and rumbles that already accompany volcanic eruptions. In the audio recording, the thunder sounds like pops and clicks over the lower-pitched rumble of the eruption. “It’s something that people who’ve been at eruptions have certainly seen and heard before, but this is the first time we’ve definitively caught it and identified it in scientific data,” said Matt Haney, a seismologist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage. The Bogoslof volcano erupted more than 60 times between December 2016 and August 2017, handing researchers the ideal opportunity to record the blasts from the neighbouring island of Umnak. In March and June, microphones picked up the distinctive sounds of volcanic thunder, which arrived at Umnak three minutes after a global network of lightning sensors detected flashes in the Bogoslof ash plume. “If people had been observing the eruption in person, they would have heard this thunder,” said Haney, whose work is published in Geophysical Research Letters. The thunder follows lightning that is created in the plume when tiny ash and ice particles collide with each other and become electrically charged in the process. The Bogoslof volcano lies directly under major flight paths from Asia to North America and the eruptions last year prompted an aviation warning, as plumes of ash rose high into the sky. With further research on volcanic thunder, scientists believe they can find more accurate ways to predict the size of volcanic plumes and thus how disruptive they may be to air travel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/17/flight-of-the-conchords-live-good-girl-naomi-sheldon-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T13:00:34Z","webTitle":"Flight of the Conchords review – business time again, with irresistible new songs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/17/flight-of-the-conchords-live-good-girl-naomi-sheldon-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/17/flight-of-the-conchords-live-good-girl-naomi-sheldon-review","fields":{"headline":"Flight of the Conchords review – business time again, with irresistible new songs","bodyText":"“Some of you are probably thinking, ‘Gosh, they look a lot older,’” says Bret McKenzie, during one of Flight of the Conchords’ deliciously pregnant inter-song pauses. It is a remark met with a wall of knowing laughter: the screens either side of the stage succeed in underlining the star status of the duo, but also in highlighting the flecks of grey peppering their hair. Since they were last in the UK, the New Zealanders may indeed have become “dustier”, they may even have become rustier, but the pair are keen to reassure their Milton Keynes audience that they still know how to rock. This confidence isn’t misplaced. The Conchords have lost neither their beguiling, monotonous demeanour nor their ability to perform laugh-out-loud, foot-tapping bangers while simultaneously deconstructing them. How easy it would have been to perform nothing but the hits – yet more than half of the 15 songs they play are comparatively new. If anything, it’s the new songs that shine brightest, and not simply because they have the element of surprise. Their second song, a father-and-son number that begins tenderly, takes the first of several turns when McKenzie, the son, points out that his mother didn’t die, as his father likes to believe, but simply chose to live with another man. The premise alone might delight, but it’s the straight-faced vehemence with which both parties belt out the matter-of-fact lines, increasingly loudly so as to be heard over the pounding piano, that makes it stand out. Their medieval pastiche, The Summer of 1353, is unimprovable. In a bid to “woo a lady” – how exquisitely well chosen their lyrics are – Jemaine Clement’s starry-eyed suitor walks around town, sprucing himself up. After he asks the florist to recommend a flower with a rose-like scent, the florist says that a rose would probably be best. Trying to hire a horse from which to woo the lady, Clement discovers that some form of ID is necessary. Having none, he sings: “I quickly had an unflattering tapestry made of me.” The pair make no secret of the fact that the process of learning the songs is an ongoing one. “We’re a bad covers band of ourselves,” McKenzie says apologetically, after having to stop and restart when it proves too tricky to simultaneously sing and play the piano. The Conchords’ songs are complex, they are performing to 1,400 people, and they draw on an ocean of goodwill. That said, these road bumps, and the stilted “low-key crowd banter”, do sometimes, ever so slightly, take the shine off an otherwise magisterial performance. With a range of elegant lighting effects, their own merch, and a string of shows at the O2 Arena, Flight of the Conchords are now bona fide rock stars, unlikely as it may have once seemed. Given their extraordinary talent, only a sourpuss would begrudge them their success. “We’d love to stay but we’d prefer to go,” they sing in Back on the Road. They could easily have carried on for another hour and not outstayed their welcome. Dustier, rustier, but absolutely irresistible. It seems a long way from the roar of this large theatre to Naomi Sheldon’s debut solo show Good Girl at Trafalgar Studios’ intimate Studio 2 space, where every laugh, every gasp, and every creak from the audience is audible. When I see a man staring comatose at his lap for much of the first half (he perks up later when the show becomes more explicitly sexual), I hope for Sheldon’s sake that the lights render him invisible. Good Girl is a show about emotion – “big emotion that leaves you feeling you’ll evaporate or explode”. It is the story of GG, a girl who grows up feeling out of place and disconnected from a body that feels as though it is leaking away from her. As she becomes a woman, she is still constantly trying to “feel something”, searching for sensation in meaningless sexual encounters. In dungarees, T-shirt, red flats and a gold hairband, Sheldon performs her hour on top of a rose-gold plinth in the middle of the stage. She is a consummate professional: her expressive, wide-eyed face demands to be looked at, and the monologue flies by without a fluffed line. It’s her character work and raw emotion that command most of the attention, but evocative lines are studded throughout: “I leave puffy clouds of skin in the sunlight,” says one of the protagonist’s eczema-afflicted childhood friends. The great majority of tonight’s audience are women and, as well as the laughs provoked by Sheldon’s exaggerated antics, there are chuckles of recognition from those who see themselves in her recollections. “It’s the 90s, no one knows what the fuck’s going on,” gets one of the biggest laughs of the evening. Sheldon’s repudiation of the received wisdom that “good girls are neat; they have neat little emotions” is a welcome tonic in a show that feels buoyed by the recent surge in women speaking out about harassment. It is impossible not to admire its intentions. But its origins as an Edinburgh fringe show are a little too visible to fully transport the audience. The performance is so studied and the laughs so telegraphed that sometimes it feels like an audition piece, seeking a little too strenuously to win the audience’s approval.

The statement by Democrats on the House intelligence committee, who have had access to internal Trump Organization documents and interviewed key witnesses, raises new questions about the Trump Organization’s financial ties to Russia and its possible willingness to deal with a bank that had been placed under US sanctions. Trump has personally denied that he ever had business dealings with Russia. In a tweet that was published shortly before his 2017 inauguration, he said he had “nothing to do with Russia – no deals, no loans, no nothing”. But doubts about the veracity of that statement began to emerge last August, when the New York Times published emails from a longtime business associate of Trump called Felix Sater, who boasted that he had lined up financing for a Trump Tower in Moscow with VTB Bank, which is under US sanctions. It is not clear from the Democrats’ memo whether the deal they are referring to is the same deal mentioned in Sater’s emails. In another email obtained by the newspaper, Sater wrote that he would get “Putin on this programme and we will get Donald elected”. Trump eventually signed a non-binding “letter of intent” for the project to go forward and his attorney, Michael Cohen, told the New York Times that they had discussed the project three times. The Moscow project did not go ahead. Now the memo released by Democrats suggests investigators have confirmed that the Trump Organization was deeply involved in Moscow talks, and that the talks involved a bank that was under US sanctions. The Democrats did not indicate the source of their information. The Democrats’ statement came days after Republicans on the House intelligence committee said they had concluded that Trump’s 2016 campaign had not colluded with Russian operatives and that the committee was nearing the end of its investigation. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, called the decision a “capitulation” to the White House. The Democrats then released a 21-page memo detailing some of the committee’s findings, outstanding questions and a long list of witnesses that had yet to be questioned by the committee. The memo stated that congressional investigators had – among many open questions – not yet determined whether Trump campaign officials had received advanced knowledge of or access to emails that had been hacked by Russians from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The memo stated that there were “critical unanswered questions” about the sources of Trump’s personal and corporate financing, including his relationship with his biggest lender, Deutsche Bank. It said it needed answers about whether the Russian government, through “business figures close to the Kremlin”, was seeking to launder funds through the Trump Organization, and whether Trump’s financial exposure – through his debt with Deutsche Bank – gave a point of leverage to Russia. New questions about the Trump Organization’s possible dealings with a Russian bank came on Thursday as it was reported that Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is leading the criminal investigation into the Trump campaign and possible collusion, has issued a subpoena demanding that the Trump Organization turn over documents. The subpoena, which was reported by the New York Times, included a demand for documents related to Russia, according to two sources cited by the newspaper. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news was significant because it showed that Mueller is definitively including the president’s private business in his investigation and examining possible financial ties to Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2018/mar/19/brexit-creates-big-challenges-for-government-science-advisers-can-universities-help","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T08:00:16Z","webTitle":"Brexit creates big challenges for government science advisers.

Can universities help?","bodyText":"Brexiters pursue freedom of choice for the UK. After Brexit, even if UK regulations remain harmonised with the EU, it is we – the people of the UK – who will choose to be harmonised. We will be free to optimise consumer protection and negotiate our own trade relationships rather than fit into deals struck by Brussels. That is the theory. Whatever model of Brexit emerges, government will become responsible for swathes of policy and regulatory functions that have belonged to the EU for decades. Even Brexit enthusiasts would surely agree that there is no point in self-determination unless we use it wisely. Government will face complicated decisions: where to remain harmonised with the EU; where to build closer ties with new trading partners; where to go our own way, or have no regulation at all. UK authorities will need new expertise to handle these hard-won responsibilities and make these coveted choices. Much of that expertise is in science and engineering. Policy officials in healthcare, food and environment have already reached out for advice from the scientific community. Other government departments and devolved administrations will no doubt follow. For example, we may have the freedom – and the responsibility – to set standards for vehicle safety, fuels and exhaust emissions. Debates over diesel vs petrol emissions and the way car companies have interpreted emissions standards show the depth of scientific expertise needed for regulation in just one area. Shortly after the 2016 referendum, a House of Commons report described hundreds of policy impacts of Brexit. This month, the Cabinet Office published its assessment of more than 150 EU laws intersecting with the responsibilities of devolved administrations. We have yet to see an assessment of the implications of Brexit for city mayors and local government. These reports imply that scientific expertise will be needed for post-Brexit regulations in chemicals, medicines and ionising radiation as well as areas of transport, border control, energy, broadcasting, policing and international trade. Take international trade, for example. Trade agreements often provide equivalent levels of consumer protection as well as setting any tariffs. Trade negotiators draw on scientific advice to determine regulatory equivalence in manufacturing standards, environmental protection, food safety and countless specific products. An EU briefing on transatlantic trade negotiations shows that science advice reaches far beyond high-technology business sectors: Oysters, like many other EU products, can’t be exported to the US. Why? Well, to ensure they’re free of dangerous bacteria, the US tests the water in which oysters are grown. In Europe we test the oyster itself. Scientists confirm both ways of testing are equally good. As for beach holidays: Sunscreens contain special filters which block out these [ultraviolet] rays. In the EU, companies can only sell them after scientists test them to check they work and are safe. But if they want to sell the same product in the US, it then has to pass a second set of different tests … We want to help regulators streamline the process for approving filters in the US which the EU has already approved. This country’s trade negotiators will need top-quality science advice to understand the countless details that make a good deal for UK exporters. Chief scientific advisers (CSAs) in government departments are going to be busy. Fortunately, they are already supported by more than 10,000 people working on science and engineering in the civil service. They are the interface between the academic community and the policy professionals in government who will develop regulatory and enforcement proposals. But a report from the Campaign for Science and Engineering found shortcomings in current arrangements. For example, fewer than 20% of government bodies appoint their CSA to their management board, leaving the majority without the authority and influence that come with a board position. Furthermore, arrangements for scientists from businesses and universities to move into government are fragmented and cumbersome, making it difficult for CSAs to bring experts into government at short notice to advise on specialist problems. Universities may be able to help but existing collaboration between academics and public policy is patchy. There are longstanding – and outstanding – examples of collaborations between universities and government. But many academics and policy officials are still learning how to blend scientific expertise with the realities of policy and regulation. In any case, research teams seldom have the capacity to release talented scientists to work on unforeseen government projects at short notice. University–policy collaboration needs to develop further before it reached the more sophisticated levels that businesses and universities have developed over the last decade. The transfer of responsibilities could begin as soon as March 2019 as we move into the transition phase of Brexit. The clock is ticking.

Expelling diplomats, limiting attendance at the World Cup, and orchestrating international condemnation through the UN and Nato are good symbolic gestures. But they will not stop Russian state-inspired terrorism taking place in the UK. Wouldn’t it be far more effective to clamp down on Russian use of Britain as a safe haven for illegal wealth? Britain has become the jurisdiction of choice for kleptocrats, crooks and money launderers – including Russians – because of our weak regulatory framework, shrouded in secrecy and very lightly policed. Our historic reputation for integrity and trustworthiness is being undermined by the rapid growth of illicit wealth that is brought into or through the UK and its tax havens. The National Crime Agency estimates that £90bn of criminal money is laundered through the UK each year. That is 4% of the UK’s GDP – and the estimate is probably conservative. Much of the money goes into buying UK properties. Global Witness claims 85,000 properties across the UK are owned by companies that are incorporated in UK tax havens. According to Transparency International, almost one in 10 of the properties in the City of Westminster are owned by companies registered in an offshore jurisdiction. Many of the houses are bought and then left to lie empty; Indeed, Kensington and Chelsea’s electoral roll has declined by 8% since 2010, while the UK as a whole has experienced a 3% increase in its electorate over the same period. So who is buying homes in the borough, and why are they leaving them empty? Britain has always been open and welcoming, and there are many people from other countries who want to come and live here for good reasons who make a great contribution to our society. But we need to know that those buying our houses are doing so for legitimate reasons, and with clean money. In 2015, David Cameron promised to introduce a register detailing the beneficial owner of all UK properties. But the government has just announced this will not happen before 2021. If we really want to stop corrupt money – from Russia and elsewhere – being used to acquire British homes the government could implement Cameron’s undertaking immediately. And it should strengthen the checks and balances on company formation: the laxness of current rules makes it too easy for crooks to set up corporate entities through which they might launder money. Consider Scottish limited partnerships. These were created in 1907 to help Scottish farmers invest in their land but limit their liability. But when you set one up, you are not required to name an actual person as a partner: you simply cite a company, often located in a tax haven. The reporting requirements for Scottish partnerships are minimal: there is no need to file accounts at Companies House, no requirement to have a UK bank account, and no need to pay UK tax. This allows the creation of anonymous and untraceable entities for potentially laundered money. Unsurprisingly, there was a 430% increase in the creation of Scottish limited partnerships between 2007 and 2016. In 2016 alone, 94% of the new partnerships were set up by corporate partners, and more than seven out of 10 of these were based in tax havens. Last year the government required newly formed partnerships to register the names of the person with significant control in a company. A quarter of the new Scottish partnerships have failed to reveal this information. Of those that did complete the register, 30% were Ukrainian, 16% were Russian and just 8.7% were British. If we simply required better information about those who set up UK corporate entities, we could stem the flow of dirty money into Britain. All we need do is ask for a birth certificate or passport so we can assess the legitimacy of both the individual and their money. We should also strengthen the way our corporate structures are policed. It’s ridiculous that just six people in Companies House are trying to check whether or not some 4m companies comply with the law and provide accurate information. It’s shortsighted to starve HMRC, the police, the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Conduct Authority of the resources they need to stamp out corruption and tackle financial crime. Finally a growing number of MPs from all parties want the government to implement another undertaking made by David Cameron in 2013. We need public registers of beneficial ownership in our tax havens so that the public, the media and civil society knows who owns the companies that hide their identity and their wealth in these secret jurisdictions.

Below, seven healthcare professionals explore how staff shortages in the health service affect them and their jobs. Student nurse: I have been used to cover for registered staff I am a student nurse and am often used to make up for a shortfall in support staff. This compromises my education and therefore the safety of my future patients. I was even used as cover for a registered staff member on one occasion, although this was an exceptional circumstance. The main issue, and I hear it from other students too, is being used as a support worker and even asked to sacrifice learning opportunities in order to push beds/wheelchairs, do clerical work, collect and deliver parcels. Paramedic: I see families wait hours before an ambulance arrives Patients frequently wait an unacceptably long time because there are insufficient ambulances to meet demand. I regularly work on a rapid response vehicle and attend incidents where I have to hold the fort because no ambulance is available. This is stressful for me, for the dispatcher who sends me, and for the patient and their family who sometimes have to wait hours before an ambulance arrives. Consultant: Patients’ families are having to provide basic care Shifts are left unfilled, meaning other doctors cover more than one person’s role or, worse, act up in a role they are not fully trained to do. Patients are being reviewed by staff with less training. Low numbers of nurses mean more pressure is put on patients’ families to provide basic care – and few nurses are available to accompany doctors on ward rounds, meaning that they are not always aware of changes to patient care. Discharges can be delayed as there are fewer people to complete the paperwork – and beds cannot be freed for the next admission. Allied health professional: I had a breakdown and resigned. I’m now homeless I was working in a team of clinic-based and outreach therapists at a hospice. My job consisted of a large caseload at a junior level. Then everyone above me either left or went on long-term sick leave. I was left with no one but HR and the trustees to answer to – all other clinical heads of department were in the same crisis, or worse. I was told by HR to “hold the fort” and attempt to get guidance from my line manager, who was had been off for some time. As time passed I could tell there were fundamental breaches of Care Quality Commission standards with regards to annual training and staff development. I repeatedly asked for help, but got no reply. Another therapist on the team made a complaint about my managerial incompetence. I was called in for a meeting soon after a member of my family was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I had a breakdown and resigned. I’m now homeless, sleeping on my parents’ sofa. Psychologist: It’s a matter of when, not if, I leave the NHS I’ve only worked in the NHS for four years, but already I’m feeling burnt out. Most of my colleagues who have recently trained as psychologists feel the same and it’s a matter of when, not if, we leave. Many of us are planning to cut down to two days a week in the NHS and one or two days a week in private practice. We can earn many multiples of our NHS hourly rate in private practice, but that’s not why we’re thinking of going. We love the NHS, we believe in it, but not at the expense of our mental health. Nurse: Short staffing is detrimental to patient care, staff morale and retention Short staffing is detrimental not only to patient care, but also to staff morale and retention. On many occasions I have come away from work frustrated and upset that I have not been able to deliver the standard of care that I would expect for a family member. I have worked many shifts where I have been a nurse to 16 high risk poorly patients. Patients don’t see that you are doing your best, they just feel let down. Who can blame them? If you have one patient that needs immediate life-saving care and there are not enough staff, what are you to do? You treat them, but you are still accountable. It’s unfair to everyone involved, and unsafe. Consultant: I waste time organising cover when I should be treating patients Staffing levels aren’t just about direct patient care, though that is the most vital area. There are also multiple knock-on effects. As a consultant I have worked extra shifts as far down as a senior house officer level to cover gaps, and have gone in when off duty because more help was needed. When there are gaps in medical cover, I waste a lot of time trying to juggle rotas, negotiate cover, review possible locums and induct new locums. This time should be spent on treating patients, training juniors, developing services, and maintaining my own professional development. Job plans have become complete works of fiction. When departments become increasingly reliant upon consultant locums, then the managerial load of running the place safely falls upon a smaller and smaller group of consultants, who are more likely to burn out. That then makes it even harder on those who are left. Morale was already low. But after the case of Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, who was struck off, I have seen what little morale remained drain away from my juniors. They know that if they whistleblow, they will end up like Dr Chris Day. It seems if they do their best in impossible conditions and something goes wrong, the NHS will hang them out to dry and the courts will throw the book at them. Several juniors have informed me that they are now strongly considering emigrating.

Neville Hord, 44, admitted murdering Jodie Willsher in front of shoppers in an attack the judge said was planned to cause “the maximum pain, horror, shock and trauma”. Hord was the former partner of Willsher’s mother, Nicole Dinsdale, and the motive was revenge, Bradford crown court heard on Thursday. Willsher, 30, sustained multiple injuries when she was attacked in the supermarket where she worked in Skipton, North Yorkshire, on 21 December. The court heard children were among the witnesses to the attack, as customers rushed to pin down and detain Hord before the emergency services arrived. Peter Moulson QC, prosecuting, said it was a “cold-blooded public execution perpetrated for the purpose of revenge”. Hord’s relationship with Dinsdale broke down in November and prosecutors said he blamed this on Willsher. Detectives discovered that while planning the attack, Hord had fitted a GPS tracking device to Willsher’s car and made inquiries about buying a gun. The Crown Prosecution Service said he “researched his attack extensively on the internet” and had a knife, axe and crossbow on the day it took place.Sentencing Hord to a minimum of 30 years in prison, the judge, Jonathan Durham Hall QC, told him he was “truly and horribly rotten to the core” and it was highly likely he would never be released. “You chose a time and a place to, in effect, execute; to kill; to murder,” the judge told Hord, adding that he had “sentenced her, in your mind, to death”. In a statement read to the court, Willsher’s husband, Malcolm, said his life and that of his five-year-old daughter, Megan, had been ripped apart. He said mother and daughter had an “unbreakable bond” and Megan had told him: “I hate you Daddy for not bringing Mummy back.” He said their daughter had been looking forward to opening her Christmas presents with her mother and the family had a trip to Disneyland planned for Boxing Day. “I’m so scared he’ll get out and do something to Megan,” Malcolm Willsher said. Hundreds of mourners lined the streets of Skipton for Jodie Willsher’s funeral in January. In a eulogy read to the congregation, Malcolm Willsher said her death had left a “great hole in our lives” and she and Megan were “more than mother and daughter; they were best friends”. During an earlier court hearing, Hord’s family passed a statement to the media that said: “Neville’s family wish to express our sincere condolences to Jodie’s family at what should have been a time of joy and happiness for them. No words can convey our sorrow for this tragic turn of events.” Colin Breslin, a regional managing director at Aldi, said Willsher was a “much-loved and popular colleague”, and staff were all deeply shocked and saddened by her death."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/05/millions-uprooted-boko-haram-lake-chad-basin-nigeria-cameroon-niger-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:10:02Z","webTitle":"What next for the millions uprooted by Boko Haram? – photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/05/millions-uprooted-boko-haram-lake-chad-basin-nigeria-cameroon-niger-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/apr/05/millions-uprooted-boko-haram-lake-chad-basin-nigeria-cameroon-niger-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"What next for the millions uprooted by Boko Haram? – photo essay","bodyText":"In Cameroon, a family dreams of the thousands of cows, sheep and goats its village used to have, inherited from their forebears. They dream of going home to the village they had to flee when Boko Haram moved in. A refugee camp run by the run by the International Committee of the Red Cross for Cameroonian civilians who have been affected by armed violence In Chad, cattle herders watch their animals die because they are unable to access fertile grazing on Lake Chad’s labyrinth of islands, now infiltrated by heavily armed insurgents. In Nigeria, a woman trying to process the year of rape and abuse she escaped learns to cope without her family in a camp run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).Members of a displaced family who used to live on the lakeshore hear that a missing son has been seen in Niger. They have no way of contacting him. Women widowed by the conflict register to receive economic support from the ICRC The effects of the nine-year Boko Haram insurgency reach into four countries and millions of lives, and it is by no means over. Security forces pass near a refugee camp in south-eastern Niger, where 47,000 Nigerien refugees and people forced from their homes by conflict have taken shelter Over and over, Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and his generals have declared that they have “beaten”, “defeated”, “technically defeated”, “routed” and “broken the heart and soul” of Boko Haram, the militant group that has wreaked havoc in north-east Nigeria and caused millions of people to flee their homes. In a video released recently by Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram’s most notorious leader, he asks the Nigerian army: “If you have killed us, why are we still alive?” More than half of the Chibok girls have been freed, as well as all but one of the 110 Dapchi girls kidnapped in February, but thousands of less high-profile abductees are still missing. Tens of thousands have been killed – the UN says at least 20,000, but that is widely held to be far below the true number. Fractured families: Paulina, 42, was abducted during a Boko Haram attack Nearly 8 million people in the Lake Chad region are in acute need of aid and protection, and this year’s humanitarian response plan is asking for more than $1bn (£714m) in donations. “Innocent civilians continue to suffer daily from direct and indiscriminate attacks in the north-east of Nigeria,” said Yassine Gaba, the UN’s deputy humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria. “Endless numbers of explosions, brutal killings, abductions and lootings continue to uproot the lives of women, children and men daily. I call on all parties to the conflict to end this violence and to respect human life and dignity.” Trade routes are closed, the fish trade is banned, farmers cannot access their land, and food prices are extremely high. Hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in garrison towns throughout north-east Nigeria, with no jobs or income, waiting for the much-repeated mantra of President Buhari and his subordinates to be true. But even if Boko Haram is routed, defeated and beaten, the displaced communities may never be allowed to go home. “We will not allow the people to go to the countryside,” said Kashim Shettima, the governor of Borno, a Nigerian state at the epicentre of the crisis. “We will not allow them to go back to the villages, but we’ll allow them to go back to the local government headquarters. You know, the world is changing. This issue of allowing the fractured existence of our people – 10, 20 families making up a village – is gone. “We have to aggregate them into larger settlements so that we can provide them with services: schools, clinics, boreholes. The fractured existence makes them vulnerable to Boko Haram,” he said in an interview with the Guardian last year. Rebuilding all the damaged homes, infrastructure and restoring public services would cost more than $9bn, according to a recent assessment. Shettima said this was essential, along with creating millions of jobs. Men who were forced from their homes on one of the islands on Lake Chad “A military solution can never be the only solution to this insurgency; there has to be a political solution, there has to be an economic solution. Beneath the mayhem of Boko Haram, underneath the nihilism, lies the real problem, which is extreme poverty. Once you engage the youth, once you create jobs, this madness will evaporate.

Over the last quarter-century its productions have spanned the whole history of opera, from Monteverdi’s Return of Ulysses to the British premiere of Stockhausen’s Mittwoch aus Licht, and the guiding principle behind every one has been the involvement of the people of Birmingham, not only working backstage in whatever unlikely venue the company has touched down in that year, but forming the onstage chorus and all the extras too. BOC’s latest project – for each show is as much a community project as it is a production – is entirely bespoke. Wake has been conceived for this very particular mix of talents by Giorgio Battistelli, a composer we’ve heard little of in the UK since three of his theatre pieces (the slickly inventive Experimentum Mundi, and the more conventional but less convincing The Cenci and The Embalmer) were performed in London around the turn of the century. His list of operas and music-theatre works now stretches well beyond 20, though BOC’s claim that he is Italy’s greatest living composer – Sciarrino, anyone? Or Francesconi? – is rather stretching things. With an English text by Sarah Woods, Wake is an updating of the New Testament story of Lazarus. It’s certainly been well tailored to the strengths of the Birmingham company, and the house style that director Graham Vick has devised for it. Even though there are some of the company’s familiar tics, there’s no sense of Wake having to be shoehorned into the template of mobile tableaux, which has become a bit too familiar. Here the use of different acting areas for each scene within the warehouse space (the same one used for the production of Tippett’s The Ice Break three years ago) seems much less contrived. It lasts 75 minutes, without a break, though dramatically it’s uneven and oddly proportioned. There’s an overlong opening section in which the audience are given black veils to wear, members of the chorus wander between them muttering to themselves and a brass ensemble plays a mournful chorale. The final scene is equally protracted as Jesus is crucified, and the restored Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, are steered around the auditorium in a boat. In between, the biblical essentials of the story are compressed, so the moment of Lazarus’s return to life seems far less climactic than perhaps it should. Though, in what is effectively a non-acoustic space, much of the text is hard to catch. The opera, and Vick’s production, seem much more concerned with the effect of Lazarus’s return and what it provokes among his people and those oppressing them than with the miracle itself. Stylistically, Battistelli’s score seems to be rooted somewhere between Berio and Stockhausen, but it’s eclectic, too, with a lapse into Straussian lushness at one point and a hint of the spiritual at another. Jonathon Heyward conducts an ensemble overwhelmingly dominated by woodwind and brass, with three percussionists stationed around the performing space too. There are four protagonists: Joshua Stewart is Lazarus, Elliott Carlton Hines is Jesus, and Nardus Williams and Mimi Doulton are the sisters Martha and Mary, who get the most rewarding vocal lines. But as so often in these productions it’s the involvement of the non-professional performers, acting and singing, who give the evening its unique atmosphere. Wake is at B12 Warehouse, Birmingham, until 20 March.

After lead character Bridgette makes a thwarted attempt at flirting during a basketball game, there’s some Girls-style matter-of-fact nudity during a bath scene. It serves as a decent indication of the type of comedy that’s to come, as does the frank title - that Smilf means Single Mom I’d Like to Fuck, though it quickly becomes apparent that Bridgette is more the Single Mom That Would Like to Fuck (granted, SMTWLF is less catchy). In the bath, Bridgette grabs a handful of her belly, stretch marks and all, and wiggles it around. “You did this to me,” she coos, splashing water towards her absurdly cute infant son Larry. Smilf is not just a show about being a parent. It’s about young women and dating and sex, but Bridgette is having to navigate that world while also looking after her small child. In that respect, its rawness is its selling point and the catalyst for many of its best jokes, which, in the tradition of most modern comedies, are usually of the tragicomic variety. Frankie Shaw plays Bridgette, and Shaw – who was last seen in the first series of Mr Robot – clearly knows something about multi-tasking, having created, written and directed the show she also stars in. Bridgette is not breezing through life as a young, single mother; her experience is chaotic and unsettled, and she’s struggling both financially and emotionally. Recent sitcoms like Catastrophe and Motherland have played on the stress and messiness of raising children. But in those shows, the families are so well-off that the viewer is left to wonder what dastardly deeds they did to end up with more than a corner of a patio in London. Smilf’s Boston is unforgiving. Bridgette is bringing up a toddler in a single room with a flaky sort-of support network comprised of her troubled mother Tutu (a subtle but vivid Rosie O’Donnell) and Larry’s father Rafi, the kind of never-quite-ex that she’s desperate to keep around. At one point, she runs out of clean towels to dry Larry, and resorts to a roll of kitchen paper; later, when rent money is scarce, there’s a mythical fantasy sequence about turning to sex work to pay the bills. Its upfront, almost defiant bluntness turns out to be both a strength and a flaw. At its best, Smilf is dryly funny and deeply amiable. Since Bridesmaids, the quirky Australian roommate has become something of a comic staple - hello, Love - but here, Nelson (named after Mandela) is upgraded to Rafi’s girlfriend. What starts as a one-note gag about nipples quickly turns into a winning kind of warmth, and Nelson can even get away with admiring Bridgette’s “grittiness”. It’s impossible not to root for Bridgette, too, whose difficult past is alluded to often, to uncomfortable and bracing comic effect. In a roundabout way, a bulimic binge leads her to run into someone who she thinks might be able to check the current state of her vagina; when auditioning for a role as a soldier with PTSD, she’s so good that she’s asked if she’s been to war. “I was sexually abused by my dad,” she shrugs, leaving any awkwardness to percolate. “My sister was raped in college,” offers one of the producers, eventually, by way of sympathy. In that instance, the brutality of the humour works, but there’s an occasional sense that Smilf tries too hard to be Fleabag-shocking, and that if it worked through some of its more confrontational tics, it would feel less self-conscious and more honest. In the first episode alone, the plot of which revolves around whether Bridgette’s vagina bears any resemblance to the one she had before childbirth, there are two vibrator-based interludes, and a sex scene that takes place, sort of, next to Larry, who’s hidden underneath a blanket. Boundaries are pushed and lines are crossed, and it only ever feels half necessary. Ironically, the best gags are the ones that are less eye-opening, and more casual in their bite. Still, it’s difficult not to be entirely charmed by Smilf, which, if it can settle its temperament just slightly, feels like a new kind of story, one that should be told, and in Frankie Shaw, it marks the arrival of an important and original voice.

Up for grabs are 47 seats in the state of assembly (lower house) and 11 of 22 seats in the legislative chamber (upper house). Is Labor or the Coalition going to win? Interestingly, the answer could well be: neither. When Nick Xenophon quit the federal Senate last year to lead his SA Best party in the state election, polls placed him as the clear preferred premier, an unprecedented situation for a minor-party leader. For most of the period since bookies have had SA Best neck and neck with Labor and the Liberals to win, but polling over the past two weeks indicates support for Xenophon is softening. Regardless, the SA Best factor still makes it difficult to predict who will win between the Labor premier, Jay Weatherill, and the Liberal opposition leader, Steven Marshall. The three-way contests around the state are a pollster’s nightmare – many seats are likely to come down to a complicated web of preferences. A statewide Newspoll conducted from 27 February to 1 March has the Liberals at 32%, Labor at 30%, and SA Best at 21% (although that moves up to 27% when only counting the 36 seats Xenophon’s party is contesting). In the final week Weatherill is a slight favourite to continue as premier, with the most likely outcome a hung parliament where the two major parties have fallen short of a majority and are forced to cut a deal with SA Best and/or a gaggle of independents to decide who gets to form government. Typically a hung parliament sees independents stick with the status quo but after 16 years of Labor in government the case for change is there. What are the main issues? With high electricity costs and a series of power outages including a statewide blackout triggered by a storm, it might seem a surprise that the Weatherill government chose to put energy front and centre of the campaign. However, Weatherill’s green energy strategy is popular with voters, and Labor has subsequently increased its state renewable energy target to 75% by 2025 and introduced a storage target of 25%, complemented by various funding mechanisms that have encouraged an array of projects, including the world’s largest battery storage system, world’s largest virtual power plant and world’s largest solar thermal tower. Marshall is urging an end to Labor’s “experiments”, promising to kill off the state-based renewable energy target and build a second interconnector to the eastern states enabling the state to import energy from the coal-intensive New South Wales grid, and also export green energy. In addition the Liberals are doing a little experimenting themselves, promoting a plan for $100m in grants for home battery storage systems. Xenophon has promised a not-for-profit retailer to provide cheaper energy to lower income households and pledged that any government that has failed to reduce power prices at least 20% by 2020 would lose SA Best’s support. Just as transitioning to a new energy system is a hot topic, so too is transitioning to a new economy. This is the first state election since Adelaide closed down its car manufacturing industry last year. Labor has staked its reputation on a medley of employment generating projects, including the creation of more than 1,000 jobs by luring hi-tech factories that manufacture cutting-edge products including cancer proton machines, battery storage devices and cybersecurity components. The Liberal jobs pitch is grounded in stimulating growth through cuts to regulations, eliminating payroll tax for small businesses and cutting land tax. Xenophon has offered support for elements of both platforms. Another important issue is elder care and mental health, largely thanks to the mid-election campaign release of independent commissioner against corruption Bruce Lander’s damning report into the Oakden scandal. The review sternly criticised the former mental health minister Leesa Vlahos, who quit days before the report’s release. The abuse of elders at Oakden hit close to home for South Australians who live in a state featuring the second-oldest population in the country. Over-50s represent more than half of voters. Marshall and Xenophon savaged Labor over the revelations, and both have pledged to force the release of cabinet documents to the Icac investigation and to increase funding for mental health and aged care. Other policies to attract attention include Xenophon’s plan to halve the number of pokies in the state, a $35m Labor proposal to roll out high-speed internet 10 times faster than the NBN across Adelaide, and a Liberal plan to consider construction of an underground CBD rail line. Where are the key battlegrounds? Seats that have been safe Labor and Liberal strongholds for generations are in play for the first time, in part thanks to SA Best’s arrival and partly due to an extensive redrawing of electoral boundaries in 2016, made after the Liberals lost four elections in a row despite winning the popular vote in three of them. This is particularly the case along the eastern fringes of Adelaide, where the city meets the hills. A prime example is the new electorate of King in place of the working-class north-eastern suburbs electorate of Napier, which had been a safe seat for Labor in the since its creation in 1977. King adds more rural territory to the mix, reducing Labor’s margin to 0.1% from Napier’s 9% buffer. SA Best’s arrival has disrupted Liberal ambitions for the area however, and both challengers have a chance at unseating the Labor incumbent, Julie Duncan. On the south-eastern fringes, a long-term blue-ribbon Liberal seat – Heysen – is under threat. Retiring Liberal MP Isobel Redmond’s margin of 12.2% has been whittled away by SA Best candidate John Illingworth, who according to a 25 February Galaxy poll narrowed the gap down on a two-party preferred basis to 49% to 51%, behind Liberal candidate Josh Teague. Bordering the hills directly east of the city is the Liberal marginal seat of Hartley, where Xenophon will be pitting his personal popularity against incumbent Vincent Tarzia, former Labor education minister Grace Portolesi and a tide of Greens preferences and pokies lobbying. The central seat of Adelaide is a more traditional two-party battle, with SA Best nowhere to be seen and Labor throwing significant campaign resources and a $538m pledge for inner suburban tram extensions at Liberal member Rachel Sanderson. In the south-east of the state, popular independent Troy Bell, a former Liberal, is attempting to hold Mount Gambier despite being charged with 26 criminal offences related to alleged misappropriation of more than $2m in taxpayers’ money. He denies the allegations. Bell remains the favourite despite the allegations and a strong challenge from the Liberals, who have matched Bell’s commitment to a 10-year moratorium on fracking in the area. What about the upper house? The legislative assembly is a veritable logjam, with 10 seats likely to be divvied up between Liberal, Labor and SA Best, leaving just one seat hotly contested by Greens MLC Tammy Franks and Robert Brokenshire of Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives, which has secured an unlikely third-place preference deal with Labor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27462","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T00:00:04Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,462","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27462","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27462","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,462","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/prize/27465","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T00:00:08Z","webTitle":"Prize crossword No 27,465","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/27465","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/prize/27465","fields":{"headline":"Prize crossword No 27,465","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27463","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T00:00:11Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,463","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27463","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27463","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,463","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/mar/13/ten-years-post-gfc-were-still-working-thats-the-good-news","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ten years post-GFC we're still working.

That's the good news","bodyText":"It is now a decade since the US sub-prime mortgage crisis started wreaking havoc on the world’s economy, and in that time our economy has changed greatly. While as many workers in their prime-earning years are now employed as was the case in the middle of 2008, where they are working and who is doing that work is very different. One of the problems with economics is trying to judge how things are going. The unemployment rate used to be a good measure but one clear sign of how poor it can be occurs when you compare our current unemployment rate of 5.5% with the US’s 4.1%: It would seem we’re doing much worse, whereas I’d take our economy any day of the week. The main reason the US’s unemployment rate is better than ours is that they have comparatively fewer people in the workforce now, as a percentage of the overall population, than we do – their participation rate has plummeted, whereas ours is almost as high as it ever has been. A better way to compare the two economies is to look at the employment rates of those in the “prime working age” of 25-54. That removes those young enough to still be expected to be in education, and those old enough to have their employment affected by changes to their retirement prospects. At the start of 2008, 80% of prime-aged workers in both the US and Australia were working. Because our economy was hit by the GFC later than the US, the level of prime-aged employment here rose to 80.3% in August 2008 before falling. But in January this year, we finally returned to that 80.3% level. As many Australians in their prime-earning years are employed now as was the case before the GFC. In the US, however, just 79% of the same age workers are employed. That is equivalent to two and half million fewer Americans not working: It highlights why you want to do everything within your power to avoid a recession – they destroy jobs and livelihoods and take a very long time to recover from. While Australia’s experience in the GFC was nowhere near that in the US, the time it took for the level of prime-aged employment to return to the pre-downturn levels was as bad as in any recession. After the 1982-83 recession it took 52 months for the prime-aged employment rate to recover, whereas it has taken 113 months for us to get back to the August 2009 levels – that is almost as long as the impact of the 1990s recession: The graph clearly shows that the stimulus package worked – it turned things around – and we looked set for a quick return, but then in mid-2011 things went backwards. You can write your PhD thesis on why this occurred – our non-mining export industries being hit by the value of our dollar reaching US$1.10, the government attempting to get back to surplus too quickly, the RBA failing to cut interest rates (they only began cutting at the end of 2011), or the global economy struggling to recover. Whatever the case, it meant another six and half years was required to get us back to pre-GFC levels. But all is now good? Are we back to where we were when things were booming? Not by a long shot. Our economy has massively changed since then, and that includes who works and what type of work is done. Over the past decade, the growth in employment among prime-aged workers has been very much women-based, and very much in part-time work: Consider that in August 2008, 88.4% of prime-aged men were employed – now it is just 86.7%; whereas back then 72.4% of women aged 25-54 were working, now it is 74.2%. In effect, since August 2008 the rate of prime-aged men working has fallen by 1.7% points, while it has risen by the same amount for women: The reason is because of the changing economy. Over the past 10 years, five of the eight industries with the biggest employment growth have been in industries such as healthcare, accommodation and food services, and education, which have an above-average level of women employed and a below-average level of full-time employment: But there has also been big differences in age of the workforce. A good, quick guide for judging how well the economy is doing is looking at the employment rates of younger workers. They are always the first retrenched in slow periods and the last to be re-hired when the going gets good. Since early 2008, the rates of 15 to 24-year-olds employed has fallen from a high of 65.1% to the current level of 59%: By contrast, since the GFC, older workers have been staying in work longer than in the past – both overall and in full-time employment – possibly as a result of concerns about the ability to afford to retire, as well as a long-term trend of older workers remaining in work as the baby boomer generation has neared retirement age. The past 10 years have seen great changes in our economy. While as many people aged 25 to 54 work now as did then, fewer men do, and much fewer men work full-time. The decade has also seen jobs for younger workers disappear and not return, while older workers have stayed in the workforce longer than in the past. It’s a combination that makes for low wages growth and a lot of spare capacity as workers seek more hours in industries that are historically lower-paid.."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/12/minor-party-support-surge-driven-more-by-cultural-anxiety-than-economics","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Minor party support surge driven more by cultural anxiety than economics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/12/minor-party-support-surge-driven-more-by-cultural-anxiety-than-economics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/12/minor-party-support-surge-driven-more-by-cultural-anxiety-than-economics","fields":{"headline":"Minor party support surge driven more by cultural anxiety than economics","bodyText":"A surge in support for minor political parties since 2004 is attributable more to a collapse in trust in government and rising cultural anxiety in the regions than economic insecurity, according to new research by the Grattan Institute. With South Australians due to go to the polls this weekend in an election where an insurgency led by the populist Nick Xenophon could reshape the political landscape in the state, the Grattan Institute has examined the underlying factors behind the increase in the minor party vote in Australia over recent election cycles. The study by Danielle Wood and John Daley indicates the minor party vote in Australia, which hit its highest level since the second world war in the 2016 federal double-dissolution election, is increasing faster in outer metropolitan areas and the regions far from the coastal capitals than in the inner cities. The study found minor parties have captured a larger share of the total vote over the past five elections, but the distribution of support differs geographically. Between 2004 and 2016 the minor party vote in the cities went from 10% to about 20%. In outer metropolitan areas it’s higher than 30% and in some areas of regional Queensland, it’s between 35% and 45%. While voters are parting ways with the major parties to support high-profile minor party players, like Xenophon or Pauline Hanson, an array of micro parties attracting less than 3% of the vote in each state is also part of the story. “These parties have increased their share of first-preference Senate votes from 7.2% in 2004 to 12.5% in 2016,” the researchers write. “This accounts for around one-third of the increase in the minor party vote since 2004.” The rise of outsiders in politics is a global phenomenon. A common explanation given for the trend is that voters are acting out because of growing inequality or wages stagnation or the negative effects of trade liberalisation in countries where governments have not been active in providing structural adjustment assistance. But the research by the Grattan Institute indicates there is no concrete evidence in Australia that economic factors are the main drivers in the increase in the minor party vote. “The minor party vote rose most when wages were rising and inequality was flat-lining,” the study notes. It says the voters defecting to minor parties do not seem energised by boosting the social safety net or by redistributive platforms. But the study acknowledges that rising job insecurity is a factor in the shift, as is cultural anxiety triggered by globalisation. “Minor party voters are more likely to identify as working class,” the researchers write. “They are also more likely to offer a negative assessment of globalisation and free trade. “The overall loss of economic and cultural power in the regions looms large in regional dissatisfaction. Regions hold a falling share of Australia’s population and consequently their share of the nation’s economy is shrinking. “Concerns that the world is changing too fast are higher among regional voters, as are concerns about immigration. But cultural anxiety is not restricted by geography: there are a swathe of minor party voters in the cities and regions who are unhappy with the way the world is changing. “These voters place more emphasis on tradition and the Australian way of life. The rhetoric and policies of some minor parties tap into these values.” The authors argue the best way for the parties in government to respond to the rise of outsiders is to formulate policies that respond directly to the declining trust in institutional politics – such as reforming donations and disclosure laws or transparent regulation of lobbyists. Addressing the growing perception of a divide between the city and the bush is also important. They suggest negative impressions could be addressed by increasing interactions between regional and metropolitan areas, improving services and ensuring that communities disrupted by globalisation are given assistance through economic transitions. Important, too, is explicitly recognising the positive contributions made by migrants to Australian life, rather than inflaming the cultural divides associated with immigration. “Politicians should also seek to dampen rather than inflame cultural differences,” the study concludes. “Language and symbols matter in these debates. “Politicians can take a positive leadership role in stressing the common ground between city and country, and between communities with different backgrounds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/13/graham-arnolds-local-tactics-may-be-ill-suited-to-international-stage","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:00:18Z","webTitle":"Graham Arnold's local tactics may be ill-suited to international stage | Ante Jukic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/13/graham-arnolds-local-tactics-may-be-ill-suited-to-international-stage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/13/graham-arnolds-local-tactics-may-be-ill-suited-to-international-stage","fields":{"headline":"Graham Arnold's local tactics may be ill-suited to international stage","bodyText":"“They aren’t the only one interested at the moment,” Graham Arnold said in January, when asked about the then vacant Socceroos coaching position. “I’ve had a fair bit of interest from around the world. “I’ve had no contact with FFA, I can honestly say that. I can’t control the decisions they make. If they haven’t had time to do what they need to do, I can’t control that. I just need to do what I do.” Arnold’s comments only helped form a perception of contrived public avoidance before last week’s announcement that he would become Australia’s national team coach following the World Cup. As diplomatic as Arnold may have at least attempted to be until Thursday’s announcement, it has been a foregone conclusion that he would be tasked with leading the Socceroos at next year’s Asian Cup and beyond. In reality, since news emerged that Ange Postecoglou would depart from the role in October, everyone knew Arnold would be the next long-term successor. Self-fulfilling prophecy aside, it made the idea of consultancy during the hiring process – a task which directly falls under the purpose of a Technical Director and Head of National Performance, a position Football Federation Australia installed – all the more hollow. The issues with Arnold’s hire, however, go beyond his appointment and to the footballing environment in which he became the leading local candidate. In comparison to other Australian coaches with club experience on a national level, the 54-year-old was not particularly the best person for the job, but arguably just the least unsuitable. Almost entirely reflective of Arnold’s characteristics as a coach, his supporters will look to his results in the A-League as proof of suitability. With 111 wins from 205 matches, Arnold holds the highest win percentage for coaches in the A-League at 54.2%. His win rate with Sydney FC is only slightly higher at 56.3%, but the reigning champions’ dominance can also be attributed to the severely low functionality that cripples the majority of A-League teams with the ball. That has only been amplified this season. It is a competition littered with central midfielders – or the coaches who direct them – who wholly misinterpret their responsibilities in regards to fluidity and tempo within the collective’s phases of possession. Consequently, there is rarely any music between the notes during A-League matches and although some have continually dismissed this line of argument, the standard of play is rigid and not very high. Notably, the one central midfielder who excels in receiving the ball in threatening spaces and advancing his team’s field position, Steven Ugarkovic, has rattled Joshua Brillante and Brandon O’Neill – a duo pivotal to Arnold’s game plan – twice already in 2018. This lack of functionality in the A-League heavily contributes to why the attributes of “Arnieball” have, overall, not been transferable with his sides to the AFC Champions League. To then use results at that level as a vindication of ability for a position at international level – the very pinnacle of the game – can be illusory. How his game plan would transfer to international football in a permanent role remains to be seen for Arnold, but this tactical fallibility is a wider problem in the Australian game. Dead and formulaic possession outside of transitional phases is prevalent at all levels of football, from National Premier Leagues to youth internationals to the A-League, because most players simply aren’t taught any better or exposed to senior football in formative years. While the technical aptitude of individuals contributes to the acceptance of risk that comes with moving into advanced positions on a football pitch, the mere recycling of possession to create a numbers game is predominantly implemented by Australian coaches. Arnold and the effectiveness of his reactive football in Australia is simply an indication of that. If the only option for FFA was to select a local coach, Arnold is the best possible choice with Postecoglou out of the picture, but that doesn’t exactly equate to competency for the international game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/12/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T09:02:51Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/12/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/12/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","bodyText":"1) Iwobi missing something vital in his make up It always feels unfair to single out a young player, not least one who seems with each performance these days to become a one-man Arsenal social media event, a living banter-meme. Just check out Alex Iwobi on Twitter the next time Arsenal are playing – and hope he never makes the mistake of searching his own name. But watching him against Watford it was tempting to wonder about stalled progress, and a comfort zone at the wrong moment in his career. He has been more productive since Christmas, has made an effort to make more decisive forward runs. But he remains a strange footballer, a creative midfielder who seems to be always shuttling in vaguely the right area, but who somehow ends up doing very little actual creating. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has shown the fruits of moving on to develop. Iwobi still seems unsure of his place in the pecking order, too mannered to have any real sharp edges, and in danger of becoming a poster boy for late-Wenger drift. Barney Ronay • Match report: Arsenal 3-0 Watford • Barney Ronay: Özil springs to life to offer hope 2) Alli can shine in Kane’s absence Mauricio Pochettino will have hoped he would never have to do without Harry Kane. But after the England striker limped off against Bournemouth he put his plan C into action as Fernando Llorente was left on the bench, with Erik Lamela coming on to form a potent front three to provide guile, speed and movement. The upshot was that Tottenham did not miss their talisman and they came from behind to win. Dele Alli was afforded the central role from where he converted a cross like a natural No 9, while Son Heung‑min reached 12 goals for the season, leaving the manager relieved and relatively optimistic, even if he needs to do without Kane for an extended period. In what has been a tough season for Alli, he may well be able to revel in being the focal point of a team living in Kane’s prolific shadow. Will Unwin • Match report: Bournemouth 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur • Kane set for scan on ankle injury which threatens World Cup 3) Conte at ease before Barcelona return Chelsea should have won this by a country mile but were pegged back by the spirit of Crystal Palace and, specifically, Wilfried Zaha. When asked if he was disappointed at the way his team relaxed in the game, Antonio Conte said: “Sometimes you can think the situation is easier than it is.” That was about as far as the criticism got. To hear the Italian soft-pedalling on a matter is unusual given the voracity with which he has torn into so many aspects of his own club this season. Chelsea have largely performed to their capabilities in the bigger matches, so getting the players up for Barcelona on Wednesday should not require a confidence boost from the manager. Instead it was as if the Italian wanted a break from any of the nitpicking. Even the toughest, most obdurate of characters needs a day off sometimes. Paul MacInnes 4) Hodgson talking tough over relegation The good news for Crystal Palace came with confirmation that Yohan Cabaye, Mamadou Sakho and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will resume full training on Monday morning, alongside the excellent Wilfried Zaha, ahead of the critical trip to Huddersfield on Saturday. More troubling had been the team’s slapdash first-half performance which even Zaha could not rectify. “There were a lot of players who didn’t give me the sort of commitment and desire,” Roy Hodgson said. Christian Benteke was the one player hooked at the break, “but it would be unfair to put it totally on him”. The manager retains belief in his group and has urged his players to show more mental courage, and Palace will attack a more appealing run-in with gusto. “We certainly won’t go gently out of the league,” he said. “We’re going to make it as big a fight as we can. They’re going to have to bash us over the head to get us down.” Their recovery must begin in west Yorkshire. Dominic Fifield • Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Crystal Palace 5) Tosun and Walcott make their mark Sam Allardyce took extra satisfaction in Everton’s win not only because of the team’s first clean sheet since Boxing Day but also the impact of two January signings, Cenk Tosun and Theo Walcott, who both helped to quell discontent around Goodison Park. Tosun sealed victory with his second Everton goal – created by the crucially fit-again Leighton Baines – and showed the work-rate and commitment that supporters have craved from the team this season. After a slow start to his Everton career, the Turkey international is beginning to repay a transfer fee that could rise to £27m. “We had a winter break in Turkey but in England they don’t,” the striker said. “I had seven or eight days off and then played the Tottenham game without being in the best shape. I was not good physically but the training in Dubai and here made me better. Now I feel better physically and I feel sharper. I hope it will be better in the next few weeks.” Andy Hunter • Match report: Everton 2-0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion • Allardyce would have struggled with fan demands ‘if 15 years younger’ 6) Mawson deserves England call The only upside for Swansea to Jordan Ayew’s 11th-minute sending off against Huddersfield was that it gave them another chance to demonstrate the defensive fortitude that they have developed under Carlos Carvalhal. They rose well to that challenge and truly earned their point, even if Huddersfield would have won if Tom Ince or Steve Mounié had finished more sharply, or if Scott Malone had been able to connect with the ball from close range after being picked out by Ince. Overall, Swansea’s three central defenders kept Huddersfield at bay, with Alfie Mawson particularly defiant. It was further evidence that Gareth Southgate should include the 24-year-old in the England squad to be announced this week, especially if the manager intends deploying a back three at times at the World Cup in Russia this summer. Paul Doyle • Match report: Huddersfield Town 0-0 Swansea City 7) Sánchez shows his worth Manchester United’s win was their most accomplished of the season, a classic demonstration of how José Mourinho feels all opposition should be dispatched. United were mentally tough, muscular and executed their chances ruthlessly. Unlike Manchester City, who fashion a glut of opportunities each time they step on to the turf, Mourinho’s blueprint relies on a killer touch in the rare openings his team manage. What he requires, then, to challenge seriously for the title next season is to up creativity and the goal return. The solution may be Alexis Sánchez, who again misfired but never stopped niggling away at Liverpool. There is no question about his attitude, so once form is discovered how high United might fly will fascinate. Last season the Chilean scored 30 in 51 outings for Arsenal. Imagine what that weight of goals could do for the Mourinho project. Jamie Jackson • Match report: Manchester United 2-1 Liverpool • Mourinho: Sevilla and Brighton more important 8) Pellegrino rolls the dice Where do Southampton go from here? On Saturday Mauricio Pellegrino pressed football’s equivalent of the nuclear button and accused his underachieving players of “giving up”. After one win in 17 league games, the Championship beckons and the fans are calling for the manager’s head. Pellegrino says senior professionals have much for which to answer. “I observed some players who gave up,” he said following a comprehensive Newcastle victory. “I’m really disappointed. We were never a threat to Newcastle. I must apologise to our supporters because we did not represent our club well enough. You can have good players but without personality it’s really difficult to compete. We have to switch on our spirit. The players are intelligent, they know what they did.” Pellegrino can only hope his side are shamed into improvement. Louise Taylor • Match report: Newcastle United 3-0 Southampton 9) Vardy keeps confounding the doubters The sight of Jamie Vardy filing a contender for goal of the season with a brilliantly executed, controlled volley provided a gentle reminder, for anyone who needed one, that the 31-year-old is one of the Premier League’s outstanding strikers. Only Harry Kane, Sergio Agüero, Raheem Sterling and Mohamed Salah have scored more league goals than Vardy this season, and it is tempting to wonder whether the England international would have a few more to his name if he was playing for a top-six club. Vardy may not be everyone’s cup of tea but those who dismissed him as a one-season wonder after Leicester’s title triumph or, in Michael Owen’s case, as someone who is “not a natural finisher” could not have been more wrong. He has scored 51 Premier League goals in the past two and a half years and his latest – with his weaker foot, no less – was technically superb. Stuart James • Match report: West Bromwich Albion 1-4 Leicester City • Pardew ready for anything in talks with West Brom board 10) West Ham protests overshadow another Hart mess In different circumstances the story would have been a poor display by Joe Hart. The West Ham goalkeeper looked nervy on his first league start since 29 November and he was slightly fortunate that attention had turned to the crowd trouble at the London Stadium by the time his failure to hold Johann Berg Gudmundsson’s shot allowed Chris Wood to score Burnley’s third goal. Yet the protests against West Ham’s board by furious supporters did not completely overshadow Hart’s shoddiness. “I want Joe to have an opportunity to play,” David Moyes said. “But you cannot keep making mistakes. Joe is mentally strong. He has played for big teams in big games. He has a lot of England caps. Goalkeepers live with times when they will mistakes.” Yet Hart has made too many this season. It is impossible to see him keeping his spot as England’s No 1 at the World Cup.

A combination of recent snow, sustained wet weather and low temperatures have produced a racing surface described as “puddingy” in places by one trainer who walked round on Sunday. Not since Master Oats’s famous slog to Gold Cup victory 23 years ago has the Festival begun on such soggy terrain. Some horses for which this week has long been a target have been withdrawn, a contributing factor to disappointing field sizes on Tuesday. “Where the fresh ground is, it’s not too bad at all,” said the trainer Alan King. “But there’s not a huge amount of it.” There will be six metres of fresh ground on the inside of the course used for Tuesday and Wednesday’s action, and a bigger strip for the racing on Thursday and Friday. “On the ground that’s been raced on through the winter, it’s showing signs of having taken a hammering,” King added. “It’ll be testing.” He has taken out horses like Dingo Dollar and Mia’s Storm and will restrict himself to runners who are likely to cope. “I expected it to be a lot messier,” said Nicky Henderson, who also took a tour of the track. “Some of this is puddingy right here [just after the last fence]. It’s the first bit you walk on to and it’s very nearly the worst bit.” Cheltenham’s Simon Claisse says the going remains “soft, heavy in places”. He was tempted to delete the “heavy in places” after a day of drying wind but resisted, knowing that 10mm of rain is forecast for the early hours of . “It’s the softest it’s been at this stage in my 18 years here,” Claisse said. “With the forecast as it is, it’s unlikely to dry out before racing starts. Tuesday and Wednesday should be dry but then we’re expecting up to 9mm on Thursday morning.” Willie Mullins arrived at the track on Sunday evening to supervise final preparations for his dozens of possible runners. One of the most pressing decisions faced by the Irish champion is which race, if any, Douvan should contest, having not raced since cracking his pelvis in last year’s Champion Chase. His options are another tilt at the Champion Chase, in which he would meet a red-hot favourite in Altior, or the Ryanair, which looks more winnable but requires a step up in distance. Entries for the Champion Chase must be made on Monday morning, setting a deadline for the decision. “We’re open to the idea,” said Douvan’s owner, Rich Ricci, in relation to the Ryanair. “Douvan coming back at all is a massive ask, particularly in a red-hot Champion Chase. The Ryanair has cut up fairly badly and we just thought it was worth considering going a different route.” Ricci also has Min to run in the Champion Chase. “It’s no secret I like to split my horses.

Photos posted on Facebook show events run by several Polish Saturday schools in England with banners and signs for groups that featured in a report by the anti-fascist watchdog Hope Not Hate this year. The Polish School of the Mother Tongue in Southampton has advertised events on its Facebook page for the Link (Ogniwo), a cultural group that describes itself as a patriotic association. Some of Ogniwo’s members have expressed racist sentiments online and a picture was once posted on the group’s Facebook page showing men standing behind a banner that read “Europe will be either white or uninhabited”. The picture has since been deleted. The group has expressed support for the far-right Polish priest Jacek Międlar, who was barred from entry by the Home Office for alleged antisemitism and Islamophobia. A Facebook post last year on the London page of the organisation said: “For writing and telling the truth the road leads to the court. Please support Jacek Międlar.” A photo on the Southampton school’s Facebook page shows people holding a cake featuring the group’s logo. The school’s director, Rafal Sawulski, said a parent had brought the cake in to an open event, adding that “a few of our parents in fact are members of Ogniwo”. He said the school sometimes worked with organisations similar to Ogniwo to organise events. The Julian Tuwima Polish School of Poland-Related Subjects in Essex has also been accused of having links to far-right-connected individuals. Its website features a picture of Marian Kowalski, the vice-chair of the Polish far-right political party National Movement. Kowalski was unable to speak in London in October after a booking at Brentside high school was cancelled when the school became aware of his views. The event was moved to a Polish restaurant, Kuźnia Smaku, in west London but the authorities prevented him from speaking there too. He appeared in the photo with Michał Nalepka, who was among three people convicted of violent disorder in Liverpool last year. Iwona Schulz-Nalepka, the headteacher of the school, said Kowalski’s visit in 2015 was unplanned and that while he was there he encouraged students and their parents to support a campaign collecting food for war veterans. “[Michał] Nalepka, who is a parent of one of our students, had been helping in organisation of this campaign for the last few years,” she said. “The school does not teach politics and does not organise any political events. However, we are not responsible for private political views of our staff, parents of our students and guests visiting the school.” The Adam Mickiewicz Polish Saturday school in Blackburn has photos on its Facebook page showing children performing above a banner for Independent Poland (Polska Niepodległa), a group that has its own “patriotic magazine” and says on its website that its aim is to encourage people to fight for an independent and sovereign state. The group has produced magazines featuring the far-right priest Międlar on thefront page, with the headline “We are fighting for our identity”. The group invited Rafał Ziemkiewicz, a Polish author and journalist, to the UK to speak at several events that were shut down after local MPs became aware of the nature of his views. Independent Poland wrote on its Facebook in response: “The members of this party [Labour] in favour of communism blocked the arrival of Rafał Ziemkiewicz. I think it’s someone else promoting the system of totalitarian.” Another picture, since deleted, on the Blackburn school’s Facebook page, shows the same banner superimposed on to a photograph of children playing. A YouTube video from two years ago includes a letter at the beginning, which says the school is honoured to invite Independent Poland to the opening of a new school year. The school vehemently denies any links to the group, saying it was “non-political”. It noted that the photo of the banner was taken at an event on 11 November, which was attended by the Polish consul and not held at the school. Jan Poninska, the school’s deputy head, said it would seek legal advice if “false rumours” continued to be spread, tarnishing their reputation. However, the school did not respond to further questions about the YouTube video and why it had since deleted Facebook posts that appeared to link it to the group. Fiyaz Mughal, the founder of Faith Matters, which works to reduce extremism, said that while there was no evidence that children were being taught political content, the links these schools had with groups and individuals who were associated with the far right were extremely troubling. He said: “We need to build the resilience of communities of Polish heritage who are settled in the country and who came after the accession agreements. Some far-right groups are trying to misuse and twist the proud nationalism that is part of Polish heritage into a hatred of Jews, Muslims and migrants, and play to the view that Europe is under threat. Pluralism is at the heart of European values and not far-right hate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/13/talking-heads-the-kosovo-war-life-in-the-hitler-youth-and-the-trials-of-turning-21","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T17:00:18Z","webTitle":"Talking heads: the Kosovo war, life in the Hitler youth and the trials of turning 21","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/13/talking-heads-the-kosovo-war-life-in-the-hitler-youth-and-the-trials-of-turning-21","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/13/talking-heads-the-kosovo-war-life-in-the-hitler-youth-and-the-trials-of-turning-21","fields":{"headline":"Talking heads: the Kosovo war, life in the Hitler youth and the trials of turning 21","bodyText":"The year Ms Krconovic turned 21, in Belgrade during the Kosovo war, she was afraid for her life. Her father assured her that their town wouldn’t be bombed – he would shake his fist at the war planes in the sky – but Krconovic was terrified. She packed a bag with canned goods and personal items and dragged her mattress down the stairs into the basement of her apartment, and locked herself in. Her parents didn’t join her there – they thought she was being ridiculous – but she set up photos of them near her makeshift bed and waited for the bombing to start. After a few days, she sheepishly emerged. She opened the building door, walked through the quiet streets. Nothing had changed. When she recounted this story 15-odd years later, for Swiss artist Mats Staubs, Krconovic told it with humour and detachment. She joked about how young she was, and how overwrought. But when she listens to the audio of her story played back to her, three months after it was recorded, she began to cry. Belgrade did get bombed, targeted by a 78-day Nato campaign that killed more than 2,000 civilians. They destroyed the building next to the theatre in which she worked and Krconovic was lucky to survive. For the first time, she hears how she has been dealing with the trauma of the war: by downplaying it, and making jokes. “I’m acting there – and I’m doing a good job,” she says. Listening to her story as if it was someone else’s, she allows herself to think of herself as “that poor girl” for the first time. Krconovic is one of about 300 people – identified only by their surnames – who have so far taken part in Staubs’ audiovisual project, 21: Memories of Growing Up. The artist travelled the world recording 10 to 20 minutes of audio from people of all ages, races, backgrounds as they described their 21st year. Three months later, the project revisited these people – but this time there was a camera, not a microphone, that was turned on them. The audio of each person telling their story was played back to them, and their reaction filmed, as they listened to one past version of themselves describe another. Some 100 of these people are featured across 14 screens at the State Library of South Australia, in a moving, honest, often surprising installation that’s part of this year’s Adelaide festival. Watching these strangers grapple with their memories, and how to construct their own narratives, you think of the story you would tell: where were you when you turned 21? What kind of person were you? And which words would you use to describe that? At its most basic, the work questions the concept of adulthood, as it’s experienced around the world and across history, and how it’s changed over time. In the four hours I spend flicking through the faces at the exhibition (it’s addictive, and I could have spent four more) I hear from a German woman who was a member of Hitler Youth at 21; a young Maldivian who followed her family to Australia from Sri Lanka in 2011, curious to see the first world; and Ms West, a 45-year-old Indigenous Australian from Queensland with adopted parents, who was a dental assistant by day and a go-go dancer by night. “I still feel like an infant in my journey of working out who I am,” she says. I find Mr Cirilov, a man who turned 21 in the same city as Krconovic – but 47 years earlier, during the cold war. Cirilov grew up in extreme poverty, and watched his father die of a heart attack in front of him. “I felt very young and old at the same time, like I feel to the present day,” he says. But listening back to his own story months later, he’s struck by something else: “When I listen to myself, I remember that young boy,” Cirilov, now 77, says to the camera. “He was more daring and fresh – and at this moment I like that boy much more than I like [who I became].” The most interesting part of the work is what it reveals about how we tell our own stories. Miss Genevieve, a 37-year-old from England, talks of her 21st year with lightness, joy, good humour; she was idealistic and artistic back then, with huge hopes for herself and the world. But after listening back three months later, her body language shifts and tenses; she pushes the hair back from her face, holds her head in her hands. She looks a bit distressed. When the project recorded her story, she tells us, Genevieve’s marriage had just broken up, leaving her devastated and a sole parent. The audio is a reminder of the worst time of her life. “I sound so happy there but I was so destroyed,” she says, after it finishes. She compares the recent break-up to the one she had in her 21st year: the pain is the same, it’s still just as devastating, but the demands of age and of parenting have forced her to piece herself back together faster. And perhaps that’s the true definition of adulthood. “You have to get out of bed in the morning now,” she says. “You have to put your socks on.” • 21: Memories of Growing Up is installed at the State Library of South Australia as part of Adelaide festival.

Democracy candidates failed to recapture two out of four seats in crucial by elections on Sunday in the former British colony, with the loss depriving the camp of their power to block most bills in the city’s 70 seat parliament. All four seats were previously held by members of pro-democracy parties who were ejected after controversy surrounding their oaths of office in 2016. Two more banned lawmakers are still contesting their disqualification in court. China has taken an increasingly hard line against dissent in Hong Kong in recent years and the election was widely seen as a referendum on the creeping influence of Beijing. Over the past few years Chinese security agents have abducted Hong Kong booksellers, Beijing has evoked a power to rewrite Hong Kong laws and the government has moved to criminalise some forms of protest that involved “disrespecting” the national anthem. Hong Kong’s Beijing-appointed government has also sought to jail dozens of protesters, including several prominent politicians. “I won’t say the result today is a victory,” Au Nok-hin, who won a seat for the democrats on Hong Kong island, said after his results were announced. “I would say it’s only a hollow victory, because we’ve paid a rather high price for it. The democracy camp has faced huge suppressions due to the political turmoil in these years.” Au ran only after prominent student activist Agnes Chow was banned from standing for election over her party’s political views. The Hong Kong vote was held on the same day China’s rubber stamp parliament abolished term limits on president Xi Jinping, paving the way for him to stay in power for years to come. Joshua Wong, a well known protest leader, urged voters to support a democratic candidate in order to “stand firm against Emperor Xi”. Hong Kong is ruled by China under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems” and the city maintains separate courts, schools and many of the freedoms in place before the UK handed it back in 1997. While Beijing has sought to exert greater influence over Hong Kong’s affairs, the city remains far freer than mainland China, where open elections are nonexistent. Only one lawmaker who lost a seat stood for reelection, but Edward Yiu was defeated by his pro-Beijing rival by about 2,400 votes after Yiu requested an early morning recount. Others were banned from running over criminal convictions related to protests. “We did not underestimate the enemy. We have put in a full effort. It’s just that I did not have the experience and I had made inadequate arrangements,” Yiu told news website Hong Kong Free Press after the loss. The overall turnout for the three popularly elected seats was 43%, a sharp drop from the 58% of registered voters who came out for the full legislative elections in late 2016. Pro-democracy parties now hold 26 seats in the 70 member legislature, which is only partially democratic. About half the lawmakers are returned by business and trade groups that are overwhelmingly pro-Beijing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/12/jamie-carragher-talks-sky-future-spitting-girl-liverpool-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T07:12:53Z","webTitle":"Jamie Carragher to have talks over Sky future after spitting at girl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/12/jamie-carragher-talks-sky-future-spitting-girl-liverpool-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/12/jamie-carragher-talks-sky-future-spitting-girl-liverpool-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Carragher to have talks over future at Sky after spitting incident","bodyText":"Jamie Carragher will hold talks with Sky Sports on Monday after being caught on video spitting towards a 14-year-old girl following Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat at Manchester United. The football pundit apologised on Sunday evening for the incident via Twitter but a spokesperson for Sky reprimanded the former Liverpool defender, calling his actions “unacceptable”. The incident, footage of which was filmed on a mobile phone and obtained by the Daily Mirror, came after the Saturday lunchtime match at Old Trafford. Carragher is shown embroiled in a tasteless episode while driving, ending with him winding down his window and spitting towards the car from which the exchange was being filmed. The 14-year-old United supporter was in the passenger seat while her father was driving and talking to the former England defender about the game. When the driver repeatedly mentioned the score, Carragher is heard to say: “All right”, before spitting at the car alongside his. The incident, recorded by the girl’s father, ends with the daughter saying to her dad that Carragher’s spittle had hit her in the face. In a tweet on Sunday night Carragher wrote: “Totally out of order &amp; Ive apologised personally to all the family this evening. I was goaded 3/4 times along the motorway while being filmed &amp; lost my rag. No excuse apologies.” However, a spokesperson for the channel said: “It’s unacceptable behaviour and we will be addressing it with Jamie.” Carragher apologised for a second time on Monday, saying: “I’ll speak to the family again. I’m sorry. I’ll apologise again today properly.” Asked if he had seen the girl in the car, he replied: “I didn’t, to be honest, she was leant back. I wish she wasn’t involved. I hate that she was involved more than anything.” The incident is undoubtedly an embarrassing episode for Sky Sports and will place pressure on the channel to make an example out of the 40-year-old. Carragher was due to front the Monday Night Football programme as Sky’s cameras travel to Stoke v Manchester City but much will depend on the outcome of Monday’s meetings. Carragher has been a mainstay of Sky Sports’ football coverage since he retired from the game in 2013, now earning an annual salary thought to be in excess of £1m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/12/monday-briefing-university-chiefs-race-ahead-in-pay-stakes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T06:16:46Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: university chiefs race ahead in pay stakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/monday-briefing-university-chiefs-race-ahead-in-pay-stakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/12/monday-briefing-university-chiefs-race-ahead-in-pay-stakes","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: university chiefs race ahead in pay stakes","bodyText":"Top story: High pay fuels campus divide A good Monday morning to you all. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. The men and women running Britain’s universities are being paid far more than their peers in the public sector with similar leadership roles, according to research by the Guardian. The issue of high pay for vice-chancellors has come under intense scrutiny in recent months after Bath University chief Glynis Breakwell was revealed to earn £434,000, forcing her to promise to step down in the face of student protests. The Guardian survey shows vice-chancellors are earning substantially more than NHS and local council executives. For example, Sir David Eastwood, vice-chancellor of the University of Birmingham, is on £378,000, compared with the £185,000 pay of the chief executive of Birmingham city council – which is the largest local authority in Europe with a budget of £3bn. It comes as university lecturers continue to strike in a dispute over pensions. Becky Gardiner explains why she has walked out. * * * Doddy’s dead – The comedy legend Sir Ken Dodd has died at the age of 90. The Liverpudlian funny man died at his home in Liverpool on Sunday, two days after marrying his partner of 40 years, Anne Jones, his publicist said in the early hours of this morning. Dodd, who was famed for his tickling stick, Diddymen and epic standup shows, was “one of the last of the music hall greats”, Robert Holmes said. Dodd’s career spanned seven decades and included television shows, a No 1 hit single (Tears, in 1965) and a record 42-week run at the London Palladium in 1965. Check out our picture gallery of his life here. * * * Poison alert – The government’s national security council will meet this morning to discuss the official response to the poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. After people who visited the Zizzi restaurant or Mill pub in the town last weekend were urged to wash their clothes and belongings, concern is growing that public agencies should have warned the public of the ongoing danger before now. The guidance to diners reinforces suspicions that the nerve agent used on Skripal and his daughter was first administered inside the restaurant. Theresa May will be urged by her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, to take a harder line on Russia, which is suspected of carrying out the poison attack. * * * Property bust – The aftermath of the Brexit referendum is still being felt in the London property market, according to a survey which shows that prices have fallen sharply in areas that two years ago were showing big gains. The Your Move data shows that the average home in Wandsworth – which includes much of Clapham, Balham and Putney – fell by more than £100,000 in value over the past 12 months. There have also been big drops in other boroughs such as Southwark and Islington. The north-west of England has replaced the capital as the UK’s fastest-growing market. Top was Blackburn, which recorded average prices ahead by 16.4% over the past 12 months, while Warrington also saw double-digit growth. It’s not such good news in other parts of the north where hundreds of property investors say they have lost money in a string of developments across the region that have either stalled indefinitely or collapsed outright. A Guardian Cities investigation reveals that problems with the schemes – known as “buyer-funded developments” dependent on small investors’ deposits rather than bank funding to get off the ground – have brought calls for police investigations. * * * Web lament – It’s 29 years since Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web but he’s increasingly unhappy with what it’s become. In an open letter to mark the anniversary, he says that the power of large technology platforms such as Google, Facebook and Twitter has become too great and needs to be regulated. Conspiracy theories have spread and fake accounts have stoked social tensions, he says, because the large tech platforms “control which ideas and opinions are seen and shared”. “What was once a rich selection of blogs and websites has been compressed under the powerful weight of a few dominant platforms,” he says. * * * A Musk read – No one could ever accuse Elon Musk of not thinking big. The PayPal and SpaceX entrepreneur told the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, that we need to colonise Mars so that some of us survive in the event of a nuclear war. Musk’s space projects include an attempt to put people on the red planet but he clearly sees it as more than just an experiment. “If there’s a third world war we want to make sure there’s enough of a seed of human civilisation somewhere else to bring it back and shorten the length of the dark ages,” he said on Sunday. Lunchtime read: How to understand the future Musk also features in our lunchtime read today, which is a selection of books to help us understand the future. Compiled by the famed American physicist and futurist Michio Kaku, one of the books he chooses is Isaac Asimov’s saga of the rise and decline of a galactic empire, Foundation. Musk apparently read it as a child and it inspired him to get into space exploration. Kaku’s other choices feel more conventional, but no less fascinating, such as The Patient Will See You Now by Eric Topol, which explores the way science is transforming medicine, and The Singularity Is Now by Ray Kurzweil, which looks at how artificial intelligence might outstrip our own poor little brains. Sport Harry Kane is set for a scan on his ankle which was injured during Tottenham’s 4-1 victory over Bournemouth, and could yet rule him out of the World Cup. Joe Schmidt has set his sights on completing a grand slam by beating England next weekend after Ireland secured the Six Nations title. In Paris, Robert Kitson argues that England’s limp loss to France caps a year of decline for a coach whose methods are under renewed scrutiny. Paul Casey, meanwhile, has surged to victory at golf’s Valspar Championship in Florida on Sunday as Tiger Woods finished one stroke behind in a tie for second place. Business Downbeat data on consumer spending could overshadow the optimistic message that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, plans to send out in his spring statement tomorrow. Visa said spending on cards fell again in February, making it nine negative months out of the past 10 months. Asian markets bounced higher today in the wake of positive jobs data from the US on Friday and the FTSE100 is set to benefit as well when it opens at 8am. The pound is buying $1.385 and €1.124. The papers It is the editor’s worst nightmare: the Times managed to kill off Sergei Skripal in its splash headline, according to an early version of the front page, despite the poisoned Russian spy still being alive. “May set to hit back at Russia over spy death,” the paper’s headline read, though it was later changed to “spy attack”. The Telegraph leads with the backlash against officials after residents are told 500 people might be at risk of exposure to the nerve agent. The Express takes a similar line, asking “Why did it take so long to raise the alarm over health threat?” The Guardian has Salisbury on the front page, but leads with an exclusive about how university chiefs are earning far more than their public-sector peers. The Mail leads with “Britain’s worst child abuse scandal”, a grim story of a child grooming ring in Telford. The Mirror and Sun both splash on allegations that footballer-turned-pundit Jamie Carragher spat at a 14-year-old Manchester United supporter. The FT goes with “Multinationals pay less tax despite curb on avoidance”.

Last year’s championship-winning car, which was quick but temperamental, has undergone an evolution over the winter that looks alarming for their rivals. They clocked the most laps with 1,040 and, although only seventh on the time sheets, their pace in race simulations was relentlessly good, half a second a lap up on Ferrari and eight-tenths on Red Bull. The team chose not to run the car on the fastest hyper‑soft rubber, unconcerned about setting a single lap marker, and Lewis Hamilton, who concluded last season comfortably on top and is generally careful not to heighten expectations, declared they had made a significant step forward. Whether they have banished the diva characteristics of last season has yet to be seen but this quiet confidence is hugely ominous. Ferrari have work to do Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time over the two weeks in Barcelona with a 1min 17.182sec on the hyper-soft rubber, an unofficial lap record, and his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen also knocked out a lap only three‑hundredths down on the same tyres. But they do not appear to have made quite the same steps forward as Mercedes. Their car was well balanced and strong last year but the new high-rake approach has given them much to develop in long runs and race simulations. The engine remains strong but Vettel admitted they had “to work on the performance and the feeling”. The team did put in an impressively reliable 929 laps in the SF71-H, suggesting they have the stable platform they need to build on. On track the car looked impressive with the solid cornering balance it had last year but the Scuderia have ground to make up if they are to challenge Mercedes again. More effort for McLaren It was hoped the switch to Renault power units would herald a new era for McLaren but, if it is truly to dawn, they too are going to be very busy before Melbourne. Previous problems in testing were laid firmly at Honda’s door but the team had problems in Barcelona and no such straightforward explanation. Fernando Alonso did take second on the time sheets with a 1:17.784 on the hyper-soft tyres but it was an achievement clouded by reliability problems. They completed only 599 laps amid a worryingly wide range of problems including burning to the engine cover, turbo problems, oil and hydraulic leaks, not to mention the ignominy of losing a wheel on the opening morning. The late switch to Renault engines mitigates some of these problems, their build lead-time severely curtailed, and major developments are expected for Australia, but they are playing catch-up and a tricky test has only added to the pressure on the team. A mêlée in the midfield Red Bull may still lack the horses of Mercedes and Ferrari but their chassis is undoubtedly strong. The car looks fantastic through the medium and quick corners and indications are that they are closer to Mercedes than Ferrari. If Renault can boost their power unit, they may yet prove a real threat. Behind the top three, Renault look to have made the greatest advance over the winter. The RS17 was largely very reliable, putting in 815 laps. They should be in a real fight with McLaren for fourth. Behind them Haas proved to be the surprise package. Kevin Magnussen set the fifth-fastest time of 1:18.360 but their understated evolution of last year’s car looks strong in race pace, too. With Williams still looking to unlock the performance of their radically changed aero and Force India yet to test their Melbourne package, Haas could be the midfield’s dark horse in the opening rounds. Hiding the halo It is by no means pretty but the addition of the Halo cockpit protection device proved far from the aesthetic cataclysm many had feared. After eight days of running, drivers and observers felt no further need to mention the device, so quickly had everyone become accustomed to it. The safety benefits have been made abundantly clear by the FIA and the drivers reported no problems with acclimatising to their new view. Issues remain – identifying the man behind the wheel is trickier – while climbing in and out is more complex, as Pierre Gasly discovered after tearing holes in his race suit, but its integration into the new designs has generally gone well.

But building a colony would require “tremendous entrepreneurial resources”, Musk said. He also countered the suggestion that Mars might be “some escape hatch for rich people” by highlighting the risks of the mission: “It will be like Shackleton’s ad for Antarctic explorers: ‘Difficult, dangerous, a good chance you’ll die, excitement for those who survive.’ That kind of thing. “There’s not many people who will want to go in the beginning,” he said, adding that over time the Red Planet colony would be hospitable and have “great bars. The Mars bar! I love dad jokes, I’m a dad!” The BFR will fly for the first time in the first half of 2019, Musk said, acknowledging that his “timelines historically have been optimistic”. The production of the Tesla Model 3 electric car, for example, has been plagued by delays. Musk said he initially gave SpaceX and Tesla a likelihood of success of just 10%. “I wouldn’t let my friends invest because I didn’t want them to lose their money,” he said of SpaceX. Instead he funnelled his own money, from the sale of PayPal, into the businesses. “SpaceX is alive by the skin of its teeth. So is Tesla. If things had gone a little bit the other way, both companies would be dead.” Musk said he was now kept awake at night by the threat posed by unregulated artificial intelligence, which he has previously warned could lead humanity into a third world war – another the reason to go to Mars. “Mark my words,” he said, “AI is much more dangerous than nukes. So why do we have no regulatory oversight?” He suggested a public regulatory body would need “insight and oversight” to confirm that everyone was developing AI safely and in a way that is “symbiotic with humanity”. However, even coming up with the safety parameters would present all sorts of insidious and unexpected risks, Musk said. If the utility function of artificial intelligence is to maximise happiness of humans, a super-intelligent AI might decide that the best way to do that is to capture all humans and inject their brains with dopamine and serotonin. Musk proposed that digital intelligence should instead be directed to maximise “the freedom of action of humanity”. The Q&amp;A session ended on a surreal note as Musk, his younger brother Kimbal and Nolan all donned stetsons and sang a snippet of My Little Buttercup, a song from the 1986 movie The Three Amigos. “This is going to be real bad,” warned Musk. He was right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/12/morning-mail-75-of-voters-in-pms-seat-wary-of-adani","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T20:15:14Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: 75% of voters in PM's seat wary of Adani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/12/morning-mail-75-of-voters-in-pms-seat-wary-of-adani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/12/morning-mail-75-of-voters-in-pms-seat-wary-of-adani","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: 75% of voters in PM's seat wary of Adani","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 12 March. Top stories If Malcolm Turnbull thought the Adani Carmichael coalmine was a political minefield exclusively for Bill Shorten, a new poll conducted in his own electorate may cause a rethink. The Australia Institute commissioned the poll of the Liberal-held electorates of Wentworth, which is Turnbull’s, and Brisbane. It found 75% of voters in Wentworth (and 70% of Liberal supporters) would like to see the environmental approvals for the coalmine reviewed. In the seat of Brisbane, 59% supported a review, including 48.6% of LNP voters. “Adani isn’t just a potent issue in Batman,” said Ebony Bennett, the thinktank’s deputy director. “It’s an issue on the government and the prime minister’s plate right now.” A majority voters in Turnbull’s electorate, 64.7%, also agreed with the statement: “Australia must halt the expansion of coalmining and fast-track building wind and solar power and storage in order to effectively reduce the worsening impacts of climate change” – including 54.2% of Liberal voters. A clear majority Liberal voters also favoured the adoption of a new rule to stop government agencies from putting taxpayer funds into coalmining projects. Residents of a small Queensland town have taken to social media to rally in support of a family of asylum seekers forcibly removed from their home a day after their visa expired. The Tamil family living in Biloela in central Queensland were woken at dawn on 5 March, given 10 minutes to pack and taken 1,500km to an immigration detention centre, where they have been told they will be deported. The family, Nadesalingam and Priya and their Australia-born daughters aged nine months and two years, were asked to sign “voluntary removal” documents once they arrived in Melbourne, but say they signed under duress. Biloela, where Nadesalingam worked at the local meatworks, has set up a change.org petition to have the family released, and residents expressed their shock at the handling of the case. Donald Trump is facing criticism from Republican allies after apparently agreeing to meet Kim Jong-un without demanding that North Korea start scrapping its nuclear program. Senators from Trump’s party expressed scepticism and urged him to set tougher preconditions, amid growing concerns over the administration’s chaotic approach to nuclear diplomacy. The CIA director and the White House spokeswoman have also contradicted each other regarding the planned meeting. The president himself has offered little clarity, saying in a rambling speech at the weekend of North Korean denuclearisation: “They are thinking about that – who knows what’s going to happen?” There’s been a lot said about the “genuine three-way contest” in this weekend’s South Australian election but rather less about about the fourth option on the ballot paper: the Greens. The party is fighting an uphill battle for coverage in a campaign dominated by Nick Xenophon. Its parliamentary leader, Mark Parnell, tells Max Opray about the difficulty of conveying his message, even after a leaders’ debate on the environment that the Adelaide Advertiser said he had won. “What struck me was on this double-page election spread, they’d cropped me out of all the photos, and had seven pictures of Nick,” he said. “I don’t want to be sour grapes, but that sums up how difficult it is.” Hundreds of people who visited the pub and the restaurant in Salisbury where the Russian spy Sergei Skripal may have been poisoned have been told to wash their clothes and possessions. A full week after the attempted murder public health authorities said there may have been “limited contamination” in both venues, with a risk from low repetitive exposure, prompting the “highly precautionary” warning. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, remain in a critical but stable condition. Police have identified more than 240 witnesses and 200 pieces of evidence. Sport Five sides remain realistically in contention for the AFLW grand final after shock wins to Collingwood and GWS. The veteran Courtney Gum was influential in her side’s victory over the ladder-leading Bulldogs, her back story fittingly embodying the spirit of playing in a semi-professional league in a round dedicated to International Women’s Day. An injury to another veteran in Mel Hickey, meanwhile, ended the round on a harrowing note. Shaun “Magic” Johnson may have run the Rabbitohs ragged but it was all thanks to Warriors recruit Blake Green doing the “boring” things well. He may yet prove to be the most influential recruit of the NRL off-season. Thinking time Stacey Dash sounds like a potential dream candidate for the Democrats, and the Clueless actor hopes for Trump’s endorsement as she runs for Congress, telling Rory Carroll: “He’s representing the people that I want to represent.” But her conservative leanings have meant she has been “blacklisted” by Hollywood. “I want to be a catalyst for change,” Dash says. “I was a Fox News contributor for quite some time and I’m just done talking. I want to start doing.” I left my serious job for the frivolous food industry, writes Lucky Peach founder Chris Ying. But if chefs can bring change to the table by backing sustainable food, consumers will follow. “I won’t get too deep into the nitty-gritty of restaurants’ relationship to climate change, but the long and short of it is that growing, shipping, cooking and disposing of food is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. It’s not impossible to counteract the effect – in fact, it’s easier than people think – but it still takes time and thought and a little bit of money.” Are grammar sticklers actually fighting against language change? If so, it’s too late, writes Penny Modra. “Languages evolve – like viruses. English has been a very successful virus, now spoken by 1.5 billion earthlings thanks to its wily shape shifting. And these days, our human desire to somehow fix the language in place is being thwarted at a faster pace than ever.” Media roundup The Australian Financial Review reports that Macquarie Bank’s plans to wind up its Russian investment fund has hit a roadblock, as questions are raised about a deal with a US fraudster with links to a Georgian businessman once hunted by Interpol.

The Lions wing, who was accused by the Saints the previous week of an unwillingness to appear against Sale, scored two tries as Wales climbed to second in the table to take his total against the Azzurri to eight in eight starts. North, who was making his first full appearance for his country since the end of last year’s Six Nations, was denied a hat-trick two minutes from the end because of an earlier knock-on and set up his side’s third try, scored by Cory Hill, when his surge into midfield from a scrum created the space for the second row to exploit. North’s international career has meandered in recent seasons, partly through injuries but also because he tended to stay on his wing in a side that played with little width. That has changed and here Wales, making 10 changes from the side that lost to Ireland to finish their chance of winning the title, often resembled a sevens team, throwing the ball around with skilled abandon. They scored five tries and could easily have doubled that number. For the third home match in a row, Wales were 14 points up in the opening minutes, profiting from mistakes by Italy who dominated the opening period in terms of territory and possession before drifting into their familiar routine of all-out defence. The wooden spoon is theirs for the fourth season in the last five and for all the trickery of Matteo Minozzi at full-back and the frantic efforts of Sergio Parisse to reverse the flow of time, their basic mistakes made them fodder for a team who are now tuned to attack from everywhere. Wales’s first try, after three minutes, came after Minozzi’s slip had allowed James Davies, making his debut at open-side flanker, to win a turnover and a penalty. Wales kicked to touch and took the play through three phases before moving the ball left where Hadleigh Parkes stepped against the flow of the drift defence to leave Tomasso Castello tackling Parisse and knocking himself out. Within two minutes, Italy were under their posts for another conversion. They won the ball from the restart, but Maxime Mbanda’s hopeful pass in Wales’s 22 was collected by Owen Watkin, who covered 60 metres before finding North outside him. Although Italy quickly responded through Minozzi, who scored on the left wing after Marcello Violi held the defence, they were unable to make anything of an abundant supply of penalties that allowed them to enjoy 65% of the possession and territory in the opening period. Wales led 17-7 at the interval, Gareth Anscombe punishing another mistake by Italy when Jayden Hayward compounded a knock-on by playing the ball in an offside position, but started the second-half with 14 men. Liam Williams was in the sin-bin after hitting Minozzi in the neck with a shoulder as he tried to dispossess his opposite number: Italy may have held the numerical advantage, but it was the home side who scored next. The second half was two minutes old when Minozzi’s clearance kick from his in-goal area was charged down by Gareth Davies. Hill scored from the resulting scrum and even when Wales went down to 13 men for two minutes, when Gareth Davies saw yellow for a deliberate knock-on, they looked the more likely to score, with the Azzurri not looking after their possession. Wales should have scored the try of the match after another turnover, Anscombe’s chip gathered by James Davies who found Taulupe Faletau in support. The No 8 covered 25 metres before passing in contact to Justin Tipuric in all backrow foray that ended when the wing Steff Evans lost control of the ball 10 metres out. The bonus point was secured 14 minutes from the end when North scored from a scrum after Parkes was denied a try despite appearing to ground the ball. Tipuric made it five after Parkes’s cleverly lobbed pass but Italy, whose shortcomings do not include a lack of application, had the last word through the wing Mattia Bellini. It was Italy’s 16th successive defeat in the tournament and as long as they continue to concede cheaply and blow prime opportunities the sequence will continue. “We will get there,” said their head coach, Conor O’Shea, who pointed to the emergence of Minozzi, Sebastian Negri and Violi as evidence of a production system that has had a long overdue service. His problem is that the likes of Wales are improving at a faster rate and they will finish second if they beat France on Saturday and England do not go berserk against Ireland. Warren Gatland’s one concern was Williams’s needless yellow card, which on another day could have proved costly, and the full-back did not return when his time was up, a luxury option O’Shea dreams of."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/11/football-champions-league-barcelona-chelsea-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T22:31:00Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte to consult Chelsea players on tactics for Barcelona return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/11/football-champions-league-barcelona-chelsea-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/11/football-champions-league-barcelona-chelsea-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte to consult Chelsea players on tactics for Barcelona return","bodyText":"Antonio Conte intends to consult his players over how best to overcome Barcelona on Wednesday, a move which should allow Eden Hazard to argue against his deployment as a false No 9, as he seeks to “share responsibility” before the game at the Camp Nou. Chelsea travel to Catalonia on Tuesday bolstered by the timely weekend victory against Crystal Palace and with their Champions League tie finely balanced at 1-1. Hazard went public with his frustrations at being used in a central attacking role after the first leg and, again, in the wake of the meek 1-0 defeat at Manchester City, suggesting it was not a best use of his qualities, and he was impressive on the left on Saturday as Olivier Giroud led the line. The Frenchman is an increasingly favourable option at the Camp Nou, where Chelsea will expect to be starved of the ball, given Hazard’s reluctance to play through the middle and the reality that Álvaro Morata is still struggling for form and confidence. The Spaniard has not scored since Boxing Day and in his 18-minute cameo against Palace he was booked after an altercation with James Tomkins and risked a second for complaining to an assistant referee near the corner flag in stoppage time. Conte is expected to hold a team meeting at Cobham on Monday as preparations step up for the tie against Barça and has taken the unusual step of suggesting he will listen to his players’ opinions on Chelsea’s tactical approach. “Sometimes it is important also to share the responsibility with the players that you have to prepare for this type of game,” he said. “In every game I have to decide the starting XI and not the players, because the players are the players and the manager is the manager. But sometimes, before this type of game, it is more important to involve totally the players and then to listen. This tie seems close and, for this reason, I think that we have to try the best plan for the game against Barcelona.” Conte watched his former club Juventus eliminate Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley last week despite drawing the first leg at home but does not feel his current squad is capable of emulating the Italian club’s streetwise approach in their own fixture at Barça. “With Juve, don’t forget you are talking about a team with many players with great experience, many who have won or played in a final of the Champions League many times,” he said. “We don’t have this same experience. It is something you have to build over years. “For sure, Juventus showed great resilience, they suffered a lot and, in the right minute, they killed Tottenham. My team has not got great experience but players who need that experience: people like [Andreas] Christensen, [Tiemoué] Bakayoko are young, or we have players playing for the first time or the second time in the Champions League. So we have to work as a team and try to be ready, to suffer in the moment, but also know we have the chance to go to score.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/11/tories-say-they-are-ready-to-take-action-to-oust-john-bercow","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T17:59:32Z","webTitle":"Tories say they are ready to take action to oust John Bercow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/11/tories-say-they-are-ready-to-take-action-to-oust-john-bercow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/11/tories-say-they-are-ready-to-take-action-to-oust-john-bercow","fields":{"headline":"Tories say they are ready to take action to oust John Bercow","bodyText":"The Speaker, John Bercow, is expected to face a motion of no confidence in the Commons on Monday in the wake of allegations that he bullied a member of parliamentary staff. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, a longtime critic of Bercow, said that either he or another MP would put down an early day motion (EDM) expressing no confidence in the speaker. While an EDM is a formal motion for debate, very few are actually discussed. However, MPs can put their names to them as a way of expressing support for a particular cause. Bercow has vehemently denied claims made by BBC Two’s Newsnight that he bulled Kate Emms, his private secretary, for a period in 2010 and 2011, and that she developed post-traumatic stress disorder after working for him. Bridgen said that whatever the specific claims connected to Emms, Bercow’s more general tendency towards bullying “is obvious to anyone who watches his performances in the chair”. Rather than act impartially, Bercow has a habit of “lashing out at elected MPs as if they were schoolchildren in need of the benefit of his chastisement”, Bridgen said. Another Conservative MP, James Duddridge, has talked separately about whether Bercow should be referred to parliament’s standards committee for bringing the house into disrepute. However, he was also a strong critic of Bercow long before the bullying allegations. It remains to be seen if moves to challenge the Speaker will gain any traction beyond the group of predominantly Conservative MPs who dislike him anyway. While some Labour MPs are reported to be seeking an urgent question in the Commons on the wider bullying allegations reported by Newsnight, it is understood there is no consensus in the party over whether any action is needed against Bercow. Bercow is supported by many Labour MPs for his often interventionist role in helping MPs hold the government to account, regularly allowing urgent questions – part of the reason why a number of Tories object to him. While the bullying allegations could change opinions, they only emerged on Thursday evening when most MPs were at their constituencies, meaning no opinion has formed over what should happen next. A series of Labour MPs, including deputy speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Harriet Harman and Chris Bryant are known to be hoping to replace Bercow, who pledged to serve as speaker for 10 years and has completed almost nine. However, none is yet campaigning for Bercow to go immediately. The Sunday Times cited unnamed “friends” of Harman as saying she was preparing to launch an immediate bid to oust Bercow, but it is understood she has no plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/11/boris-johnson-clashes-with-emmanuel-macron-over-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T18:34:19Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson clashes with Emmanuel Macron over Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/11/boris-johnson-clashes-with-emmanuel-macron-over-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/11/boris-johnson-clashes-with-emmanuel-macron-over-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson clashes with Emmanuel Macron over Brexit","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has publicly clashed with Emmanuel Macron over Brexit, rebutting the French president’s invitation to Indian students to “gain access to Europe” by boasting of the increase in their numbers arriving in the UK. Macron, who has also made overtures to financial firms seeking a possible exit from London once Britain has left the EU, made his comments during a three-day trip to India. As Macron spoke at an event in New Delhi on Saturday, his official Twitter account sent out a series of tweets in English saying he wanted to make France into India’s “first strategic partner in Europe”. One tweet said: “We are at the beginning of a new momentum between France and India.” Another sought to tempt overseas Indian students, many of whom have traditionally studied in the UK, to head to France instead. The tweet said: “I want to double the number of Indian students coming to France. If you choose France you gain access to francophonie, you gain access to Europe.” It was to this message that Johnson responded, albeit a day late. He tweeted in reply: “We are proud too to have more than 14,000 Indian students coming to the UK in 2017 – up a quarter over last year – choosing the home of the greatest universities, including four of the global top ten.” He ended with the tag #educationisgreatinenglish. Johnson’s intervention indicates the wariness of ministers about EU nations seeking to capitalise on the UK’s changed status with the rest of Europe after Brexit. Overseas students provide a huge economic input to the economy, with Universities UK estimating they contribute about £25bn a year and support about 200,000 jobs around the UK. The number of overseas students has caused tensions within the government, however, with ministers continuing to count them in immigration targets despite official figures showing that hardly any stay on after their visa expires. Macron flew to India late on Friday with a clear message for his hosts. “France is the entry point to Europe. We want to be India’s best partner in Europe,” he said after meeting the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Macron’s office said French and Indian companies had signed contracts worth €13bn (£11.5bn) on the first full day of the trip, including a contract for the aviation firm Safran to supply the airline Spice Jet with engines, and a contract between the industrial gas company Air Liquide and Sterlite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/11/richard-johnson-looks-like-trouble-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T16:13:43Z","webTitle":"Richard Johnson looks to ‘family pet’ for his Gold Cup inspiration | Chris Cook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/11/richard-johnson-looks-like-trouble-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/11/richard-johnson-looks-like-trouble-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Richard Johnson looks to ‘family pet’ for his Gold Cup inspiration","bodyText":"In a field behind Richard Johnson’s Herefordshire home lives a constant reminder that the Cheltenham Gold Cup, jump racing’s most prestigious prize, can be won. Looks Like Trouble, who bore him to glory when the jockey was a mere stripling of 22, has spent a happy retirement with his former rider, who can look out the window and smile about the day they outbattled the classy Irish raider Florida Pearl. But perhaps the old horse’s presence also underlines how long it has been since Johnson, now 40 and the champion jump jockey of British racing, has got his hands on this particular trophy. “He’s the family pet,” Johnson says. “He’s 26, he doesn’t do quite so much but my little girl, Willow, she’s ridden him. He’s a gentle giant.” Johnson is not short of reasons to be grateful to Looks Like Trouble, having eventually married Fiona Chance, daughter of the horse’s trainer. “I gained a wife and a father-in-law and everything else out of it,” he recalls cheerily. Just as readily, he admits it was the kind of success which can make the game seem easy when it comes so early in a career. “I definitely didn’t appreciate winning the Gold Cup when I was 22. I think I thought, ‘Oh, these horses come along all the time.’ And then you realise how hard it is just to get a horse good enough to ride in the race, let alone win it.” Johnson has always had a big reputation, which he has justified with more than 3,000 winners. An outsider would imagine he would be a fixture in all the big races but the reality is that jockeys depend for their chances on the trainers and owners who regularly support them. It so happens that Johnson’s backers have come up with just six Gold Cup rides since that heady day in 2000 and only one of those was good enough to make the first three. That was the doughty chestnut Native River, a game third last year after leading most of the way. On Friday, Johnson climbs aboard the horse for another crack at the Cheltenham Festival’s feature event and his conversation thrums with confidence, “He’s my best ride of the week. I was delighted with him at Newbury last month and he probably has had a better build-up to the race than last year, in that he hasn’t had the stresses and strains of running in two very big handicaps.” No one worked harder than Native River that winter, when he won the Hennessy and then the Welsh Grand National under big weights on his way to Cheltenham. But his trainer, Colin Tizzard, endured a frustrating and winnerless Festival, most of his horses seeming shy of their best. Whether it was stable form or his previous exertions, Native River found something sapping at him up the famous hill climb to the post. “He didn’t quite finish out his race,” recalls Johnson. “At Aintree, Colin’s horses were absolutely on fire again but maybe at Cheltenham they weren’t quite on the same form. And you do need everything in your favour at the Festival. Any little thing gets highlighted there, because it’s such strong, competitive racing.” This time round, Tizzard kept the wraps on Native River until deep into the season, with the Gold Cup as the only focus. He has had a single, impressive run. A softer surface should help him, just as it may be a problem for his main rival, Might Bite, whose stamina for this test is not quite proven. “Everything, as much as it can be, is right on target for him and he goes there hopefully with a great chance and conditions to suit. That’s all you can ask for and we’ll find out.” Johnson has been the most successful British-born jockey at the Festival, where he has enjoyed 22 winners. Most have been supplied by his longtime collaborator Philip Hobbs, but the Minehead trainer’s winter has been undermined by an equine virus. He believes his horses are now healthy but most have seemed short of their best on the track. “They’ve been working really hard to get the horses back,” Johnson says. “It’d be lovely to finish the season on a bit of a roll. There’s a lot of horses to look forward to for next year anyway.” The jockey believes Louis’ Vac Pouch and Crooks Peak give the two men their best chances of success at this Festival. The critical thing is to get on the scoresheet. “The Festival, if anything, has grown bigger and bigger over the last 10 years. It’s a massive sporting occasion now and you want to do well there. It’s a long week when you don’t have a winner.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/modern-pilgrimage-road-to-santiago-journey-self-discovery","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T10:42:22Z","webTitle":"Faith, friendship and curses as seven celebrity pilgrims trek to Santiago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/modern-pilgrimage-road-to-santiago-journey-self-discovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/modern-pilgrimage-road-to-santiago-journey-self-discovery","fields":{"headline":"Faith, friendship and curses as seven celebrity pilgrims trek to Santiago","bodyText":"There were no road-to-Damascus experiences and very little piety. Instead, when seven people in the public eye walked the Camino de Santiago, the ancient pilgrimage route across northern Spain, there were many arguments and much snoring and swearing. The group – a priest, an atheist and assorted believers and non-believers – discussed the values shaping their lives while retracing the steps of medieval peregrinos. Along the way, they forged friendships and encountered some of the hundreds of thousands of people who walk the Camino each year, part of a resurgence in pilgrimages. Pilgrimage: The Road to Santiago, which starts on BBC Two on Friday, followed the modern-day pilgrims along part of the 500-mile route from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the French Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela, almost at the tip of Galicia in Spain. The group was made up of Kate Bottley, Anglican vicar and Gogglebox star; actor Neil Morrissey; M People singer Heather Small; comedian Ed Byrne; performer Debbie McGee; journalist Raphael Rowe, who spent 12 years in prison for a crime he did not commit; and TV presenter JJ Chalmers, who survived a bomb blast serving as a Royal Marine in Afghanistan. As they walked, they questioned their own and each other’s beliefs. “It was eye-opening,” said Rowe, a non-believer who described himself as an “ignorantist”. “It made me think differently about myself, about other people, about religion and faith. I learnt more about religion [on the camino] than I ever have in my life.” His fear that he might “catch religion” along the way proved unfounded, he said. However, by the end of the journey his “trust in people’s honesty and motivations” had been restored. Small said the experience strengthened her faith, despite an uncomfortable moment when the group stopped at a monastery and the singer was grilled unsympathetically. “Along the way you meet people who are genuinely interested in who you are. But then we went into the monastery, and the man there was not interested in me per se – what he saw was my colour, only my colour,” she said. “When you’re being treated as ‘other’, you always know.” Small walked out of the monastery, followed by the rest of the group. Their appalled reaction to the incident “showed me we’d really made a bond”, she said. Bottley had expected the camino to be a spiritual experience but found it a physical challenge. “I hated it with a passion,” she said. The group carried their own gear and slept in basic pilgrims’ hostels, sometimes in dormitory bunk beds. They walked in extreme heat and driving rain. “It was the hardest thing physically I have ever done, and I’ve given birth twice. The physical act of putting one foot in front of the other, day in, day out,” said Bottley. She had never sworn so much, she added. The vicar also felt under pressure to defend and explain her faith. “The religious debate was exhausting. I felt I came out to bat a lot. There were a couple of moments when I feared my theological rigour wasn’t enough to carry the debate.” Pilgrimage was popular in medieval times, when bands of travellers criss-crossed Europe in search of spiritual enlightenment. For many, it was a holiday as well as a religious duty, and a chance to meet new people and hear their stories. The Canterbury Tales, the epic yarn written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the late 14th century, described a group of 30 pilgrims walking from London to Thomas Becket’s shrine in Canterbury cathedral, with each telling the others a story along the way. But in 1538 the English pilgrimage movement ended. Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell moved against the pre-Reformation church, destroying monasteries, abolishing saints’ days, banning relics and smashing Becket’s shrine. Pilgrimages disappeared for more than 300 years. Now the camino has spearheaded a pilgrimage revival. In 1984 just over 400 people completed the final section of the camino, a 62-mile stretch which entitles pilgrims to a compostela, a certificate written in Latin and issued by the cathedral of St James in Santiago. By 2016 the number had topped 278,000, including 6,000 from the UK. New pilgrimage routes have opened across the UK. The Old Way, a medieval 220-mile route from Southampton to Canterbury, is being revived by the British Pilgrimage Trust. The 92-mile Two Saints Way from Chester to Lichfield aims to “set the modern pilgrim on a contemporary quest for ancient wisdom”. In Scotland, a number of pilgrim trails have been developed in response to renewed interest, including a route in honour of St Magnus in Orkney and the 72-mile Forth to Farne Way, a stunning coastal walk from North Berwick to Lindisfarne. Many walking these ancient ways are religious; but many more describe themselves as spiritual. A surprising number seek only to escape the pressures of 21st-century life with a simple existence of walking, eating and sleeping. All members of the group in The Road to Santiago said they were enriched by the experience, in particular the strength of the bond created between them. They have stayed in contact since completing the camino. “Did anyone have a road-to-Damascus experience? “No,” said Bottley. “But the camino has a way of showing the best of yourself – and the worst of yourself.” Pilgrimage: The Road to Santiago begins on BBC Two on Friday 16 March, 9pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/12/stamp-duty-share-property-inherited-sdlt","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T12:04:34Z","webTitle":"Do I have to pay stamp duty to buy my sister's share of a property?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/12/stamp-duty-share-property-inherited-sdlt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/12/stamp-duty-share-property-inherited-sdlt","fields":{"headline":"Do I have to pay stamp duty to buy my sister's share of a property?","bodyText":"Q My sister and I have each inherited a 50% share of a property valued at £120,000.

GG A Assuming that you already own property, yes, that is correct. You are being charged 3% which is the higher rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) for transactions up to £125,000 which result in multiple property ownership. It would be the same if you owned a home and bought a second one or a buy-to-let property costing more than £40,000. If buying your sister’s share of the inherited house will not leave you owning two or more properties, your solicitor is wrong. The higher rates of SDLT do not apply if you end up owning just one property. Instead, your £60,000 transaction would fall into the 0% standard SDLT rate for transactions up to £125,000 so there would be no SDLT bill. If you are going to move into the inherited house and plan to sell your current home, you can claim a refund of the higher rate of SDLT which you should do within three months of the sale of your former home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/10/stoke-manchester-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T09:00:10Z","webTitle":"Stoke City v Manchester City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/10/stoke-manchester-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/10/stoke-manchester-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Stoke City v Manchester City: match preview","bodyText":"Stoke, under Mark Hughes, were humiliated 7-2 by Manchester City back in October with six different Citizens finding the net.

Our parents had split up and we were with our father for the weekend. The day was spent feeding the ducks with thick, glutinous white bread and sailing on the Serpentine, where my father announced with a certain amount of reverence: “Your aunt will join us.” As the youngest of a small family raised by a single mum, I had no concept of wider family members. To have an aunt was monumental, and took me into somewhat uncharted territory. Friends at school talked about aunts who visited laden with sweets, ill-fitting pullovers as Christmas presents and a faint smell of musk perfume. But the only connection I had with my Nigerian aunts, uncles or cousins was through faded photographs. In them, one aunt stood out. And this was the aunt who glided towards us on that Saturday in Hyde Park. Resplendent in a traditional Nigerian tunic in burnt orange and green complemented by an intricately tied headwrap, her “Africanness” was palpable. She embodied a confident Nigerian style at odds with my upbringing – Luton by way of a Jamaican mother. We were fully anglicised and, as children of the mass immigration of the 60s, the mantra of “keep your head down, assimilate and all will be well” jarred with the way my new aunt carried herself. This aunt had swagger and turbo-charged charisma and she oozed the kind of presence that actors can only dream of. I was smitten. But there was a caveat: why was she wearing overtly Nigerian multicoloured clothes? Why couldn’t she just go with jeans and a T-shirt? Or, perhaps a nice floral dress? She was on holiday in London, after all. Couldn’t she tone it down or at least blend in with my rather fetching beige tank top and black flares? To blend in meant less scrutiny from our English hosts. But here was an aunt who did not comply with the rules. My aunt, known as Maama, the daughter of a wealthy and entrepreneurial woman, studied dress-making and millinery at the Polytechnic of North London in 1951. Her studies were financed by my grandmother, a force of nature who, according to Nigerian legend, helped to organise the Aba women’s riot – a protest against the taxes imposed by the British in 1929. At the time of her visit to Hyde Park, my aunt had been elected as the first female local councillor in Nigeria in an era when women in politics were frowned on. Of course, I knew nothing of this and just cringed at the way she referred to me as Adebisi (my Nigerian middle name) and her insistence that we children should visit “our homeland”. This confused me – wasn’t Bedfordshire home? She chided my father too. He had lived in England for far too long. Her words had an unintended effect – not long after her visit, he returned to Nigeria for good, and I never saw him again. The day in Hyde Park came to an end – presents were handed out. A Fila hat for my brother and a series of brightly coloured outfits for the girls – dresses of the finest Nigerian cotton decorated in vivid expressions of orange, yellow, dark green and gold. Now, I was not averse to a vibrant palette. Indeed, my mother wore colour. She had arrived in London in 1960 in the midst of winter. Jamaicans and other Caribbeans no doubt wore bright clothes as an antidote to the greyness of English weather. “We injected Caribbean technicolour,” my mother told me. But, my aunt’s colourful ensemble blared “foreigner” like a foghorn. These were not the kind of clothes to wear in Luton’s Arndale shopping centre or Marsh Farm, the sprawling estate we called home. Much as I appreciated my aunt’s gifts, there was no way I could wear them on the streets of Luton. Nor could they be worn at home. To my mother, they were a symbol, a reminder of her ex-husband, and his culture. She wanted no memory of this union, thank you very much. The clothes were folded and, once back home, they were neatly stored in a bottom drawer. They were forgotten about and never worn, and we lost contact with my aunt for the next 37 years. My father’s death brought her back into my life. His passing meant a trip to Nigeria (my first, I had never visited him since he returned) and a reconnection with my now eightysomething aunt. I gathered crucial snippets of information before I left for Abuja. The first was, bring Ferrero Rocher (they don’t melt in the heat and are the confectionery of choice for family members in Nigeria). One nugget of “aunt briefing” was imparted by a newly acquainted cousin. He casually said I should mention football, as she liked it. This caused some concern as I had no interest in football. I turned to my brother, a diehard Chelsea fan. He gave sanguine advice and suggested a mention of the “Super Eagles” – the nickname for the Nigerian football team. It was duly noted. Before meeting my aunt, a cousin in Nigeria asked for my dress size. I’d never met this cousin and presumed her question was out of curiosity. Perhaps she wanted a mental picture of my appearance? But once I had landed in Abuja, a tape measure was whisked out and another cousin (I was to meet a plethora of them on this trip) had her personal tailor note all the necessary statistics for what she called “this and that”. The next day an array of outfits made from the finest Nigerian cotton were laid out to rival anything from Savile Row. They were vibrant and unashamedly African: a white and blue ankle-length dress with a lace trim and white headwrap; a mid-length orange number with flecks of purple and matching headwrap – and so it went on. Garment after garment of brightly coloured clothes made especially for me – and no bottom drawer to hide them in. My jeans were discarded and replaced by an orange dress. I had no idea how to create a headwrap, but a deft twist of material by my cousin and the crowning glory was complete. The clothes signified a deep-rooted change. I was ready to meet my aunt. There is an upside to having a family member whom you remember through the eyes of a child. There is no in-between. You haven’t watched them age or lose any of their physicality. In many ways, my aunt looked exactly the same as I remembered. She was less mobile, but her fierce intellect and enormous personality were intact. As was her sense of style. An olive outfit, with on-trend chandelier earrings and Zadie Smith-style headwrap. She gave a satisfied sigh at my appearance. I had passed the test. The clothes I wore reflected a small but significant acceptance of my African heritage. She said I was the African Queen of Abuja, and, in her deep, throaty purr, said: “Wear African clothes more often.” Each time I visited my aunt, a vast television played football in her formal sitting room. It took pride of place and was positioned so she could keep an eye on all the action. It turned out my aunt didn’t just like football – her knowledge of Arsenal bordered on the fanatical. She was an encyclopedic super-fan. Neither was she an armchair fan. She started the first female football team in Nigeria and, by all accounts, was a pretty decent player in her youth. But rather than football, it was my aunt’s advice to wear brighter clothes that struck a chord. I left Abuja armed with a full suitcase. The drab blacks, browns and greys of my wardrobe were replaced with a collection of dresses, Fila hats, tunics, jumpsuits, and headwraps. A riotous celebration of colour. The perfect tribute to my aunt’s indomitable sense of style."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/10/central-heating-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T14:56:49Z","webTitle":"Is it cheaper to leave central heating on in winter if you go away?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/10/central-heating-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/10/central-heating-winter","fields":{"headline":"Is it cheaper to leave central heating on in winter if you go away?","bodyText":"Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.

For the first time in the Eddie Jones era they are playing catch-up and a bonus-point win for Ireland over Scotland in Dublin on Saturday would all but conclude the title race. The bigger picture can temporarily wait as far as England’s players and management are concerned. Jones is not even trying to downplay the standalone significance of this Anglo-French collision, a contest his side badly need to win for their own peace of mind. “It is an important game for us,” said Jones, seeking a vigorous reaction to the Murrayfield meltdown. “It is the first time we have had the team together after a loss. How we respond to it is important.” This latest version of Le Crunch, for that reason alone, has a renewed edge. England’s trips to Edinburgh and Paris in this championship, as predicted in these columns before the Scotland defeat, were always likely to be character building and certain traditions never change. “You know every time you play against the French it is a test of your manhood,” Jones said. “We have to be brutal against them. You hear those old stories from club rugby when they deliberately kick the ball into touch from the kick-off because they want to scrum you. It’s not like that now but it’s still an area that will decide how much energy they have in their game. We have to beat them in those areas.” All of which leaves England’s forwards little room for manoeuvre. Finish second best to a side who have not made the top half of the Six Nations table since 2011 and a blunt reassessment of England’s 2019 World Cup prospects will commence. Display the lack of intensity and tactical doziness which undid them in the first half against Scotland and Les Bleus will scent more rosbif blood. “They are the European version of the South Africans: they are big, physical and they want to hurt you,” Jones said. It suddenly seems a while since England clinched their long-awaited 2016 Grand Slam on this same pitch. Dylan Hartley, Mike Brown and Jonathan Joseph have gone from the starting XV, Owen Farrell will be leading England out as captain for the first time and never before has Jones had to contend with a mid-tournament defeat. “The defeat to Scotland hurt the boys a lot and took a little bit of time to get over,” said Ben Te’o, back starting in midfield alongside the promoted Farrell. Not everything, clearly, is doom and gloom. France are far from the world’s greatest side and, for all their individual potential, have beaten England only once in the championship anywhere since 2010. Anyone who imagines England will play as loosely or frenetically as Italy did in Marseille does not know Jones very well; in terms of organisation and fitness, England should still possess a clear edge. That said, Paris is seldom the most comfortable of destinations for English sides, even if Jones avoids the crowded Sunday morning Eurostar home. For all the good times they have enjoyed there have also been some horror shows, not least the 31-6 annihilation in 2006 and the 36-0 World Cup pool drubbing by South Africa the following year. Even England’s most recent winning margins at the Stade de France have been slim; they have registered only one championship victory in Saint Denis by more than a score this century. A red rose on a white jersey is a red rag to virtually every opponent, particularly a pumped-up France on home soil. “For an England team to win a grand slam is much harder than for the others – it just is,” the former England captain Will Carling once said. “The chances are that at least one team every season will play an absolute blinder against you and you are never quite sure where it is going to come from.” England can only hope they have already taken receipt of this year’s bolt from the blue. The continued exclusion of a sizeable French contingent following a distinctly messy night out in Edinburgh has done little to reduce the swirl of distractions around Jacques Brunel’s squad and the recall of François Trinh-Duc at 10 is the latest desperate attempt to restore some order amid the chaos. “In rugby terms they play better than us but if we stop them playing, work hard at the breakdown and are aggressive in defence like Scotland were then we can make it difficult for them,” Trinh-Duc said. “It will be hard and rough but we have qualities that we need to show.” It does not require a degree in psychology from the Sorbonne to identify where France will primarily be focusing. They will be particularly keen to examine England’s scrum in the absence of Hartley, see if they can send the human juggernaut that is Mathieu Bastareaud down George Ford’s channel and investigate whether Farrell, who got D in French at GCSE, can be ruffled as he was in the tunnel before the Calcutta Cup. “After a loss you are always a little bit more emotional,” Jones said. England will need all the collective sang-froid they can muster. At least the weather forecast has improved slightly from its original Jacques Cousteau setting but the playing surface will matter less to England than their leaders’ top two inches. Without two of Jones’s “glue” players this is not the moment to come unstuck mentally. Nor can the potential benefits of a bounceback victory be allowed to obscure the job in hand. Beat France with a four-try flourish and Scotland suddenly becomes a blip. If Ireland can then be defeated at Twickenham next week, the landscape will once again be transformed. Jones insists he is “not a magician” but who knows for certain what will unfold in Dublin? Amid all the bonus-point conjecture – whether or not Ireland tie up the title prematurely it is important to reward teams for positive intent – there is also the minor detail of England and France occupying the same RWC 2019 pool in Japan. England cannot afford to lose, regardless of events elsewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/09/how-to-find-your-voice-as-a-writer-gary-younge-journalism-course","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T15:06:05Z","webTitle":"How to find your voice as a writer | Gary Younge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/09/how-to-find-your-voice-as-a-writer-gary-younge-journalism-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/09/how-to-find-your-voice-as-a-writer-gary-younge-journalism-course","fields":{"headline":"How to find your voice as a writer with Gary Younge","bodyText":"This course has now passed, but you can be the first to know about the next one - and other workshops like this - by signing up to our newsletter here.

This time, the show is on ABC instead of Fox, and there’s a brand new trio of judges: Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryant. Ryan Seacrest, recently accused of sexual assault by a former stylist (a charge he denies), is still the host, and in the premiere episode claims he’s “waited a lifetime for this”, which is hard to believe given that babies born in 2002, when Seacrest began hosting Idol, will be able to vote in the next presidential election. Idol was always the best of the singing competition shows and, at least in the US, the form’s progenitor. The crop of talent was better than that of The Voice and The X-Factor and the format, with intimate auditions set across the US, allowed for the contestants’ real, observable growth. Where other shows, including The Four, Fox’s Idol replacement, throw singers in front of a studio audience right away, Idol auditions dispense with the hubbub and introduce us to the talent pool before hair, make-up and ill-advised song suggestions get in the way. Indeed, one of the great joys of the show is looking back at contestants like Katharine McPhee and Carrie Underwood singing sans music before a dumbstruck Simon, Paula, and Randy. Luckily, in the first episode of Idol’s 16th season, very little has changed. Nor has the show lost its penchant for heavy-handed inspiration, opening with a five-minute long, cross-country montage – narrated by Underwood herself – recounting Idol’s history of discovering everyone from “the dreamers to the lullaby singers”. As the music swells and shots of middle America whiz by, it becomes evident that the reboot is indulging in a bit of patriotism-lite, positioning music as a bridge between the right and the left in these divisive times. American Idol, of course, will not save us. And without the biting interplay between its former judges or any sense of novelty, the show is a safer, more cordial shell of its former self. But still, there is a lot to like, primarily the contestants, who include Ron, a James Bay-singing Congolese immigrant, and many talented singer-songwriters from the deep south. The judges are very pleasant if not especially insightful. While the show grows its legs one imagines they will too, but in the premiere there’s not quite enough substantive feedback to balance out the cutesiness. After one audition, Perry plants one on a never-kissed 19-year-old boy; before another, she and one of the episode’s most impressive vocalists lob the term “wig” back and forth, confusing Bryant and Richie, evidently not schooled in gay terminology. Perhaps Idol producers sensed that 2018 calls for a dollop of optimism and positivity, because there are also very few bad auditions, save for one or two mildly disillusioned aspiring pop stars. Instead, this new version of Idol centralizes, even more than its predecessor, the contestant’s dreams of making it big and the tribulations they’ve faced along the way. It’s not an entirely unwise decision, given that Idol’s one of the only talent shows that can boast more than a few Hollywood exports, but season 16 could use some levity and spunk to tamp down its twinkly sheen. American Idol is, of course, a most American show, driven by a persistent faith in the American dream. Integral to its appeal is the democratic voting process, which always made viewers feel like they had a hand in things, and the uplifting narratives culled from far and wide, from Fort Worth, Texas, home of the original Idol, Kelly Clarkson, to High Point, North Carolina, home of the best Idol, Fantasia Barrino. Among the reboots purporting to have interesting things to say about contemporary America – Roseanne, Will &amp; Grace, and Queer Eye among them – Idol has undoubtedly taken the most abstract and sentimental approach. While the uplift makes for happy viewing, Idol is nevertheless far from the water-cooler phenomenon it once was. The show doesn’t need Nicki and Mariah at each other’s throats or another William Hung to get wind in its sails. But by the time the third or fourth reliably good guitar-wielding hopeful walks through the door, the premiere starts to feel a bit like an open mic night, and you half wish Simon was around to shake things up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/11/corporate-hospitality-sexism-scandal-presidents-club-cheltenham","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T16:16:51Z","webTitle":"After the Presidents Club scandal, hurdles await at Cheltenham and Cannes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/11/corporate-hospitality-sexism-scandal-presidents-club-cheltenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/11/corporate-hospitality-sexism-scandal-presidents-club-cheltenham","fields":{"headline":"After the Presidents Club scandal, hurdles await at Cheltenham and Cannes","bodyText":"They are heading towards Becher’s Brook in the 2018 Inappropriate Corporate Eventing Stakes, with the field already shredded following some dramatic early fallers. You’ll recall there was an almighty pile-up at the first hurdle in January, when several veteran riders found themselves unseated during the Presidents Club charity dinner at the Dorchester hotel in Park Lane, central London. There, a steward’s inquiry was convened after a string of “hostesses” – all clad in short, tight black skirts and high heels – accused the gentlemen of the City of groping, lewd comments and extending invitations to adjourn to hotel bedrooms. Then, in February, a clutch of gambling companies fell at the second after they defied calls from their regulator to stamp out sexism at the industry’s showcase UK event – the ICE Totally Gaming conference at the Excel centre in the London docklands. The delegates were entertained by pole dancers and a Playboy-themed show, while hostesses claimed to have been harassed and propositioned. Now those who haven’t been gelded enter one of the trickier-looking legs of the whole chase this week, with the property industry assembling in Cannes for its annual boondoggle, called Mipim (Marché international des professionnels de l’immobilier). Meanwhile, in the UK, the corporate hospitality industry is working itself up into a heightened state of arousal as it prepares to serve copious amounts of Guinness to already well-refreshed stockbrokers attending a paid-for jolly at the Cheltenham festival. The property industry stable is particularly concerned here, following the string of entries it had running under its colours at the Presidents Club. For the sector’s main bash in France, frequent Mipim attendees report that the crowd is typically “90% male”, with some supposedly fond of using the phrase “a rental” to gallantly refer to something other than a tenancy on a new maisonette. Bars and hotel lobbies along La Croisette have previously been reported to be “full of leggy blondes with broken English and not even a passing interest in real estate yields”. One hotel once supplied its corporate guests with “love boxes” containing condoms, massage oil and scented candles. It is hard to discern what is more clumsy about some of this crowd: their language, their errant hands or their efforts to employ fading O-level French. But, whichever you alight on, you can tell the trade is panicking that its members might be about to let the side down again. As the event organisers reassuringly said in an official statement last month: “Under no circumstances does Mipim register prostitutes.” Over in the west country, at the other big corporate playground this week, the mood is similarly tense. The event, a huge drinking festival occasionally intertwined with a spot of National Hunt racing, is the sort of place that encourages behaviour that even footballers can feel the need to apologise for. The bookie and race sponsor Sky Bet is attempting to set the tone this year, saying: “We have long felt the use of walk-in girls for promotional uses has had its day in sport and the time was right to use this exposure opportunity more positively.” And so instead it intends to offer a charity, the Injured Jockeys Fund, the chance of walking in the winner of the first race. Meanwhile, the City firms who will be paying for a lot of the booze are believed to be warning attendees about their conduct. Nothing could possibly go wrong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/trump-kim-talks-us-signals-hardline-stance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T22:14:35Z","webTitle":"Trump-Kim talks: US signals hardline stance as it scrambles to define position","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/trump-kim-talks-us-signals-hardline-stance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/trump-kim-talks-us-signals-hardline-stance","fields":{"headline":"Trump-Kim talks: US signals hardline stance as it scrambles to define position","bodyText":"Donald Trump will take a hardline position at his planned summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the White House said on Friday, as US officials scrambled to keep pace with the president after his sudden acceptance of Kim’s offer to talk. In briefings after the surprise announcement – which would be the first ever meeting of leaders of the two countries – US officials made no mention of possible concessions that Trump might offer, other than saying that severe sanctions would stay in place until North Korea took verifiable steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. At the daily White House briefing, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders even cast doubt on Trump’s acceptance of the offer of a summit, suggesting it was dependent on preconditions. “Let’s be very clear. The United States has made zero concessions but North Korea has made some promises. This meeting won’t take place without concrete actions that match the promises that have been made by North Korea.” Sanders did not specify what actions the US required Pyongyang to take, and whether the demands amounted to more than the requirement of a pause in missile and nuclear testing, which Pyongyang appears to have already agreed to. The White House later appeared to minimise the impact of Sanders’ remarks, with one official telling the Wall Street Journal: “The invitation has been extended and accepted, and that stands.” Later, on Friday evening, Trump added to the confusion with a tweet about the meeting in which he added a qualifying phrase: “if completed”. The speed of events had Trump’s administration scrambling to keep up with the president. Thursday’s announcement appeared to have taken some senior US officials unawares: the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was travelling in Africa, and had told reporters – while the South Korean delegation was in the White House conveying the offer – that talks with the North were a distant prospect. Tillerson said on Friday that the US had been taken aback at Kim’s “forward-leaning” approach but described the outcome as a success for the US policy of severe sanctions executed by the state department. He said Trump had made the decision himself after determining the time was right for “talks” but not formal negotiations. The vice-president, Mike Pence, said that Kim’s invitation to suspend nuclear tests and meet the US president proved that Trump’s strategy was working. The North Koreans “are coming to the table despite the United States making zero concessions and, in close coordination with our allies, we have consistently increased the pressure on the Kim regime”, Pence said in a statement. “Our resolve is undeterred and our policy remains the same: all sanctions remain in place and the maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes concrete, permanent, and verifiable steps to end their nuclear program.” Reacting to the announcement of the summit, the Chinese and Japanese governments have echoed the US line that there would be no let-up in the economic pressure on North Korea until Pyongyang began to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missiles programmes. It remained unclear if Kim is prepared to limit his arsenal and what he might require in return for doing so. Pyongyang had not commented officially on the summit plans since they were revealed by a South Korean delegation on Thursday night. A previous deal, the 1994 Agreed Framework, involved deliveries of fuel oil and the promise to build civilian nuclear reactors for North Korea. But Kim has consistently demanded an end to what Pyongyang calls Washington’s “hostile policies” which involve its military presence on and around the Korean peninsula and joint exercises with its ally, South Korea. Tillerson said it will take “some weeks” to arrange the timing for their meeting. US officials said that no time or place had been agreed. Bilateral talks in the past have been conducted in Geneva, New York and Beijing, but those involved diplomats. Kim Jong-un has not ventured outside North Korea since inheriting power from his father in 2011. A strong possibility as a venue would be the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas, a backdrop that would only add to the drama of an extraordinary encounter. In the coming weeks, the Trump administration will have to develop a negotiating strategy almost from scratch. Former officials have said that while much time and effort had gone into designing and enforcing sanctions, and planning military options, almost none had been devoted to putting together a plan for negotiation. The US special envoy for North Korean policy, Joseph Yun, left his post last week, depriving the administration of the single diplomat who had been in contact with North Korea. He had been contemplating retirement for some time, one of his colleagues said, but would have stayed on if he felt the White House had been interested in his efforts. The state department has been cut out of the loop on several critical moments in the evolution of administration policy on North Korea. Leadership on Korean policy has shifted to the White House. A likely key figure in the weeks running up to a summit is Allison Hooker, the only official left in the administration with firsthand experience of North Korea. She travelled there in 2014 when she was director for Korean affairs at the national security council and accompanied the US intelligence chief, James Clapper, to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of American detainees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/canada-doctors-protest-pay-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T17:03:04Z","webTitle":"Canadian doctors: cancel our pay rise and spend money elsewhere","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/canada-doctors-protest-pay-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/canada-doctors-protest-pay-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Canadian doctors: cancel our pay rise and spend money elsewhere","bodyText":"Nearly 800 doctors and medical residents in the Canadian province of Quebec have signed a letter protesting against plans to raise their pay, arguing that the funds would be better spent on other areas of the province’s beleaguered healthcare system. “We, Quebec doctors, are asking that the salary increases granted to physicians be cancelled and that the resources of the system be better distributed for the good of healthcare workers,” reads the open letter. It was drafted late last month by Médecins québécois pour le régime public, a group of doctors and medical students who support public healthcare. The letter says recent pay raises negotiated by their professional associations as “shocking”, given the “draconian cuts” that have left nurses, orderlies and others overworked and underpaid, as well as led to a widespread lack of services for patients. “The only thing that seems to be immune to the cuts is our salary,” notes the letter. So far, it has attracted 789 signatures of support, from GPs, specialists, residents and medical students. It has attracted attention around the world. “It’s a tough stand to take,” said Isabelle Leblanc, the president of the group behind the letter. “Some people find it difficult to understand why we would do something like this, but at this point for us, it’s what makes sense.” The Quebec government recently announced increases of 1.4% and around 1.8% for specialists and general practitioners respectively, while recent data suggests that the average specialist in Quebec makes C$403,500 annually, while family physicians make C$255,000. These figures do not take into account the overhead costs incurred by physicians. A 2016 report hinted at the tradeoffs that could be sustaining this level of pay, noting that Quebec has the longest emergency room wait times in the west. Overcrowded emergency rooms have left 35% of patients waiting five hours or more for care, as compared with 15% in Ontario and 5% in the US and Germany. Leblanc said: “If you ask physicians in the street, most will tell you that they would rather have more support and have a good working environment and have other professionals to refer their patients to, rather than having more money.” The letter marks the third time in recent years that her group has taken aim at pay raises. But this time the reaction has been overwhelming, said Leblanc. “It’s the first time where we have a lot of physicians that are not that political, that are not that involved, that would not probably describe themselves as that progressive, who are saying ‘OK, enough is enough, this is not working.’” A growing number of nurses in Quebec are speaking out about excessive workloads. Earlier this year, one nurse, exhausted and exasperated after a shift in which at one point she had been the only nurse caring for as many as 76 patients, wrote on Facebook: “I’m ashamed of the poor quality of care that I’m delivering as best I can. My healthcare system is sick and dying.” Stress from the shift had left her with back pains that were making it impossible for her to sleep, she said. And she was dreading the thought of going back to work. “I don’t think I’m the only one who feels crushed by the reality of nursing,” she wrote. Her post has since been shared more than 55,000 times. The doctors have yet to receive an official response to their protest. Last month, the province’s health minister, Gaétan Barrette, said he would happily direct the physicians’ pay raises to other areas of the health care system. “If they feel they’re overpaid, they can leave the money on the table. I guarantee that I can make good use of it,” he told reporters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/crufts-these-people-arent-my-tribe-but-with-a-little-more-weirdness-on-my-part-they-could-be","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T16:13:02Z","webTitle":"Crufts people aren't my tribe but if I could get a little weirder they could be","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/crufts-these-people-arent-my-tribe-but-with-a-little-more-weirdness-on-my-part-they-could-be","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/crufts-these-people-arent-my-tribe-but-with-a-little-more-weirdness-on-my-part-they-could-be","fields":{"headline":"Crufts people aren't my tribe but if I could get a little weirder they could be","bodyText":"At Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre, a woman dressed as Lawrence of Arabia has just placed a plastic palm tree in the middle of the arena before going to retrieve her dog. Moments later, the music starts and the woman begins a vaguely Middle-Eastern dance while her pooch stares up at her lovingly and tries to keep track of her movements. Every so often, just for the hell of it, he skips between her legs or shuffles sideways. Now I love dogs. I even count how many I come across on the way to work: the more I see, the better the day is going to be. It’s an OCD thing. But even I have to admit I haven’t got a clue what’s going on. Nor, it turns out, does our Lawrence of Arabia as halfway through her routine she unexpectedly withdraws from the competition. Next to appear is a woman dressed like something out of Riverdance. Her pooch also stares up at her lovingly, trying to keep track of her movements and darting between her legs to an Irish jig. Much the same thing happens with a woman dressed like an Indian, dancing to a bhangra soundtrack while her dog tries to humour her by tagging along. “Make sure you’re here tomorrow as today’s winner will be taking part in the international final,” says the MC to an audience of about 1,000. As an afterthought, he adds: “Heel work to music is becoming huge over here.” I may have been missing something, but it felt rather niche to me. Crufts is one of the largest dog shows in the world and over the course of its four days about 160,000 people will come through its doors. Yet even though it all happens under one roof, it feels like it exists in two parallel universes. There are those who just like dogs and come along for the craic. A chance to see all the different breeds in one place. Pedigrees naturally, crossbreeds like my own Herbert Hound are only allowed in on the Saturday to take part in Scrufts – and maybe buy some doggy paraphernalia. A handmade sculpture of your mutt for £280 or a cushion handspun out of its hair. There’s even a pet food supplier who invites you to “live as well as your dog”. If it’s all the same, I’ll leave the dried biscuits to Herbie. And then there are the hardcore exhibitors and performers who wouldn’t dream of travelling anywhere without their dogs. For them Crufts is both about the glory and the cash. It is a tense business. A Crufts rosette is not just reward for having spent much of the year travelling around smaller dog shows, picking up the championship prizes that will qualify them for Birmingham, but can add hundreds of pounds on to stud fees. Anneli Varg and several friends have brought their bedlington terriers from the north of Sweden to take part. The journey has taken the best part of three days by car and Anneli insists she needs about seven or eight hours to finally primp each dog into shape. She combs the dog meticulously and scans for any stray hairs that are removed with scissors. By the time she has finished, her dog looks like no other dog I have ever seen. But almost identical to all the others it is in competition with. Over near Ring One, Sharne Williams is waiting to show her wheaten terrier, Griff, who looks like he is having the time of his life. He clearly knows the score and chills out while he is given a last brush. Then he walks out into the ring with Sharne and goes through the motions. First, legs astride with his tail held up in the air. Then stand still while the judge gives him the once over and finally a quick run around to show off his gait. After about five minutes his perseverance is rewarded with third prize and a yellow rosette. Sharne tries to explain what category exactly he was competing in but there are so many subdivisions that I soon get lost. Ted, another wheaten terrier, doesn’t look at all put out to have come fourth. But then he was just having so much fun he couldn’t stop bouncing up and down in the ring. Everywhere I look there are dogs in cages. Either waiting to be exhibited or waiting to go home. They seem quite used to the experience. Another day, another dog bone. After a while, I start to believe that I can match the owners to their dogs, as they look alike to me. You can spot a skye terrier owner anywhere. They’re all dressed in tartan. Before long, I begin to feel almost at home. There is a weirdness to it all with which I identify. These people aren’t my tribe, but with a little more effort and weirdness on my part they could be. Back in the main arena, I fall in love with Sherlock who is taking part in a race against the clock obstacle race. Sherlock gets to the start line and … stops. He decides he can’t be bothered to run through a set of sticks and strolls off to be admired by the people in the front row seats. It strikes me that Sherlock might just be the sanest thing alive at Crufts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/09/sir-john-sulston-pioneering-genome-scientist-dies-aged-75","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T15:30:22Z","webTitle":"Sir John Sulston, pioneering genome scientist, dies aged 75","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/09/sir-john-sulston-pioneering-genome-scientist-dies-aged-75","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/09/sir-john-sulston-pioneering-genome-scientist-dies-aged-75","fields":{"headline":"Sir John Sulston, pioneering genome scientist, dies aged 75","bodyText":"The pioneering geneticist Sir John Sulston has died, it has been confirmed. The scientist led the UK side of the landmark Human Genome Project and founded and directed the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, one of the country’s leading biomedical institutions. Sulston’s work on decoding the genome of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which revealed how genes control cell division, won him the 2002 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. The findings underpin the modern understanding of developmental growth and of how cancers emerge. In a series of experiments culminating in a paper published in 1983, Sulston analysed the total cell lineage (about 1,000 cells in total) of the worm, making it the first organism for which the origin of every cell was exactly known. The species is about a millimetre long, is completely transparent and eats nothing but bacteria, but Sulston established the unglamorous creature as a lens through which our own biology could be understood, saying: “When we understand the worm, we will understand life.” In 2017, Sulston was made a companion of honour by the Queen in her birthday honours for his major contribution to science and society. Prof Sir Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “We all feel the loss today of a great scientific visionary and leader who made historic, landmark contributions to knowledge of the living world, and established a mission and agenda that defines 21st century science.” Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: “John was a brilliant scientist and a wonderful, kind and principled man. His leadership was critical to the establishment of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Human Genome Project, one of the most important scientific endeavours of the past century.” Sulston was a passionate advocate for scientific information being freely available, describing as “totally immoral and disgusting” the idea of profiteering from such research. He is widely credited for ensuring that the reference human genome sequence was published openly for the benefit of society rather than commercialised. “Without his influence we may well be struggling to work under a veil of secrecy and patent protection, which would have been terrible for basic research and ultimately for humanity,” said Robin Lovell-Badge, a group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London. “His legacy is enormous.” Born on 27 March 1942, the young Sulston was fascinated with figuring out how things worked, from Meccano to tiny animals. He took apart radios and dissected a dead bird that he found. “I understood that living things were mechanisms,” he told the Guardian in a 2002 interview. He went on to complete his undergraduate degree in organic chemistry at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1963, followed by a PhD at the university in the chemistry of nucleotides, the molecular chunks that carry information in DNA and RNA. He retained a knack for the practical as a professional scientist, developing the first method for freezing worms without killing them so that interesting specimens could be kept for future investigation. Conceived by James Watson, one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA, the Human Genome Project set out to be biology’s answer to the Apollo moon programme when it launched in 1990. Sulston’s work on the nematode genome persuaded the Wellcome Trust that he was the person to lead the UK arm of the transatlantic collaboration. Famously, the project came under intense time pressure when in 1998 the US scientist Craig Venter entered the fray with a competing private venture to sequence the human genome, announcing that he would complete the project three years ahead of the scheduled six years that Sulston and colleagues were aiming for. As leader of the British project and a lifelong socialist, Sulston championed the moral case for public ownership of the genome data. When the sequencing of a “rough draft” of the genome was announced jointly by US president Bill Clinton and British prime minister Tony Blair in 2000, Sulston said: “The only thing I have retained from my upbringing – I did not retain the religious element – is the idea that you do not do things for money.” He leaves his wife, Daphne Sulston, and their two adult children, Ingrid and Adrian. This article was amended on 13 March 2018 to clarify that James Watson was one of the people who discovered the structure of DNA, not DNA itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/14/which-football-clubs-are-named-after-political-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T10:00:08Z","webTitle":"Which football clubs are named after political leaders?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/14/which-football-clubs-are-named-after-political-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/14/which-football-clubs-are-named-after-political-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Which football clubs are named after political leaders?","bodyText":"“Gambian top-flight club Steve Biko FC are named after the late South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko” tweets Kameel Gopal. “Are there any other clubs named after political figures of another country?” When our readers come through, they really come through. Sit back and watch the answers to this one roll in, kicked off by Philip Farrell, who has a number of suggestions. “French medieval hero and Saint Joan of Arc is memorialised in the name of ASC Jeanne d’Arc, from Senegal,” he writes. “Spartacus was a legendary gladiator and slave turned rebel who was born in what is now Bulgaria and was an important character in the history of the Roman Republic. Yet, a host of clubs outside Italy and Bulgaria share his name, Spartak. “Explorer Vasco da Gama was from Portugal. But no less than four clubs (two in Brazil, one in South Africa, and one in India) bear his name. (Although he was one of the first Europeans to reach these lands – by sea). Rutherford B Hayes was the 19th President of the United States (1877-1881). Club Presidente Hayes in Paraguay are named after him. (He mediated in a peace treaty for Paraguay at some point).” Fine work Philip. But there’s more. Athena Brown perhaps goes off-piste slightly as she notes: “May I point you to the Argentine club CA Douglas Haig, named after the British military general and ‘Butcher of the Somme’, Field Marshal Douglas Haig.” Daniel Jonathan nominates Club Bolívar from La Paz, named of course after Simón Bolívar, but he has more: “Galvez Esporte Clube are from Rio Branco, the capital of the Brazilian state of Acre, which borders Bolivia, and in fact used to belong to it, until in 1899 the Spanish adventurer Luis Gálvez Rodríguez de Arias organised a successful independence movement, becoming the new Republic of Acre’s first president.” And finally, Tim Dockery has this: “Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. He was the King of Saudi Arabia from 1964 until 1975. The Ghanaian Club King Faisal Babes FC was named after him and played in the Ghana Premier League as recently as 2014.” Any advance on those? Email knowledge@theguardian.com Rapid-fire trebles “Has anyone ever scored a hat-trick with three consecutive touches?” asks Danny Israel. “If not what is the fewest used by a player?” To a point this might be impossible to know for sure. But we have a few best guesses. Chris Fowler nominates Hugo Sánchez who, while playing for Real Madrid against Real Oviedo in 1990, scored on 36, 46 and 64 minutes. “All were one-touch goals, and he probably didn’t touch the ball much between them,” says Chris. Sadio Mané’s 2min 56sec treble for Southampton against Aston Villa – the Premier League record – was spoiled slightly by the forward taking plenty of touches between the goals, but one candidate could be Tommy Ross, who scored three in 90 seconds while playing for Ross County against Nairn County in 1964. Robbie Fowler’s 4min 35sec hat-trick for Liverpool against Arsenal in 1994 is also worth a shout. He took one touch for his first, two for his second and four for his third and was never one to hang on to the ball for too long. But Ben Usaf might have a winner in rapid hat-tricker James Hayter, playing for Bournemouth against Wrexham in February 2004. “He totalled five touches in 141 seconds, completing the league’s fastest ever hat-trick. Unfortunately his folks had left the ground at around 75 minutes with him still on the bench to make the ferry back to the Isle of Wight so missed it.” The Palace percentage “Seven of the 44 managers in the top two tiers have managed Crystal Palace (Roy Hodgson, Sam Allardyce, Alan Pardew, Neil Warnock, Tony Pulis, Steve Bruce and Ian Holloway) – that’s 16%. Is this a record?” asks Hamish Nesbit Joe Murphy has this one covered. “If you look further afield to the sack-happy clubs of Italy then 16% is not even high. I picked two clubs at random and both have more than this! “Seven out of 42 managers in Serie A and Serie B have managed Pescara. Those being Zeman (Pescara), Oddo (Udinese), Cosmi (Ascoli), Stroppa (Foggia), Di Francesco (Roma), Ballardini (Genoa) and Sarri (Napoli). That’s 17%. “However, 12 out of 42 managers in Serie A and B have managed Palermo. Those being Bortoluzzi (Palermo), Lopez (Cagliari), De Zerbi (Benevento), Ballardini (Genoa), Novellino (Avellino), Iachini (Sassuolo), Gattuso (Milan), Gasperini (Atalanta), Colantuono (Salernitana), Zenga (Crotone), Cosmi (Ascoli) and Pioli (Fiorentina). That’s 29%. Additionally, up until February Corini managed Novara making 13 out of 42 or 31%.” Knowledge archive “The recent discussion about teams scoring an own goal without touching the ball brought back a memory that I need confirmation of,” wrote Barrie Voyce, this time last year. “I’m sure in the late-80s I saw Watford’s Neil Redfearn score with the Hornets’ first touch of the game. I don’t recall the opponents but seem to remember they kicked off and somehow immediately conceded a free-kick outside their own box. Redfearn stepped up and duly dispatched the ball into the top corner. Can anyone verify I actually witnessed this?” Richard Scrimshaw has his hand up. “I can confirm the event,” he writes. “It was an FA Cup third-round replay against Newcastle on 10 January 1989. They kicked off and passed back to Dave Beasant, who handled the ball outside his area. Neil Redfearn put the free-kick into the top corner, but the game finished 2-2.

It was challenging’","bodyText":"A framed letter hangs in the dining room of Claire Birkenshaw’s neat Victorian terrace in Hull. Signed by the last education secretary, Justine Greening, it is a prized possession. “My ambition is to build a society that is free from discrimination, in any form, and utterly free and equal for everyone,” the letter states. “You should feel proud that, through your openness about your own gender identity, you are directly contributing to this goal – it is going to make a difference to so many.” To Birkenshaw, the letter is much more than ink on a page: it is recognition from the government of a life spent trapped in a stranger’s body. “It’s great, isn’t it,” Birkenshaw says with a wry smile. Just over two years ago the then headteacher told her chair of governors she had gender dysphoria and was going to live as a woman. For years, the principal everyone knew as Mr Birkenshaw had been living a double life. “I was existing as Claire at home and coming into work as how I was previously. That was incredibly challenging psychologically,” she says. It had taken a lifetime to get to that point. As a child, Birkenshaw would find reasons to visit her grandmother’s house, where she borrowed dresses and was Claire “in secret”. She skipped days at school so Claire “could exist at home” – but never felt able to tell her parents. An “internalised shame” grew, she says, especially since her grandfather, a retired coalminer, was visibly angry when men wearing makeup appeared on television (usually David Bowie or T-Rex on Top of the Pops, she says). Eventually, her parents found out about the dresses and her father, a police officer, warned her about “a man in a dress” he had apprehended because it was “wrong”. “I distinctly thought I’ve got to stop this – I’ve got to stop being Claire. It was just a battle ever since.” But in September 2015, after a 26-year teaching career at secondary schools across Hull, Birkenshaw began hormone replacement therapy while the principal of Ashwell academy, and became the first known headteacher in Britain to transition while in post. In November 2016, she walked into a classroom for the first time as a woman. “Straight away, one kid was ‘Hi Miss’. It was brilliant. There were no sniggers,” she says. Last year, though, Birkenshaw decided to take a break from the school to focus on improving the education experience of trans students across the UK. As we talk in her living room a week before she addresses an Equality and Human Rights Commission conference in Liverpool, it is clear that coming out has not been wholly positive. While many friends celebrated her transition, others distanced themselves, she says. From some there was a “wall of silence” and some told her “We don’t know what to say to you” – a comment, she says, “that can feel like there is possibly an animosity there, a feeling of unease. That then adds to the stigma.” One person (she won’t say whether it was a teacher) told her it would be “easier to transition down south than in Hull. Another (again, she won’t say who) said: “You know, Claire, you’re going to make people feel uncomfortable.” The reaction from some made her consider leaving teaching and Hull altogether. Did she feel bullied? “I don’t have any comment to make about the school,” she says, after a long pause. “Everybody is shaped by experiences, things that you learn from and then advise people in future. While people may have been shocked when I came out – and I understand that – I learned: be mindful of your approach, be mindful of what you say, and listen.” Since leaving Ashwell academy last year, Birkenshaw has visited countless schools and given speeches around the world, and is in discussions about a book deal with Ian Gilbert, the founder of publisher Independent Thinking Associates. In the course of her travels, she says she has met a worrying number of LGBT teachers who feel unable to come out in school. As a result, she says, children are being deprived of role models because “they will be looking to members of staff who are like them”. Asked whether she wants to return to teaching, Birkenshaw says she may be able to make a bigger difference by “being visible” to thousands of pupils in schools across the country, rather than just at one. But despite a career spanning 26 years and several senior roles, the former headteacher says the experience of coming out has made her feel she may be rejected from teaching roles in the future, simply for being trans. “I don’t know whether I lack confidence that if I went for a job in a school whether really I would be employed. I just think they might think ‘OK, Claire’s really good but what are the children going to say? What are other teachers going to say? What are parents going to say? Is Claire going to make people feel uncomfortable?’,” she says, tearfully. She adds: “If Theresa May has this ambition to eradicate homophobic and transphobic bullying and to make sure that LGBT issues are taught well then, as a society, we need to make sure that it’s safe for LGBT people to be able to teach in schools.” The Gender Identity Research and Education Society estimates that about 1% of the British population are gender nonconforming to some degree. The numbers of trans boys and trans girls are thought to be about equal. The number of children being referred to gender identity clinics has rocketed from two a week in 2009-10, to about 50 a week in the past year, according to the NHS Gender Identity Development Service. The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful for any school to discriminate against a pupil, or a potential pupil, because of a “protected characteristic” such as gender reassignment. Many schools have introduced policies to support pupils struggling with their gender identity, but how they work in practice varies significantly. Some schools are introducing gender-neutral uniforms but, at the same time, many students still learn from books featuring only heterosexual couples. Mike Whale, the Hull secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the first person Birkenshaw told about her planned transition, says trans issues have been “pushed under the carpet” in education, and even now many schools are “not really aware of how to deal with the issue”. Birkenshaw says the volume and variety of guidance for schools on trans issues, drawn up separately by a number of teachers’ unions and LGBT bodies, has created confusion. She urges the new education secretary, Damian Hinds, to compile “overarching, comprehensive” guidance with a statutory backing for all schools. Teacher training on trans issues should be improved, she says, and Ofsted given a role in inspecting whether institutions are genuinely fostering equal opportunities for all pupils and staff. The curriculum needs to be modified, she adds, to include textbooks that are more reflective of modern society and to stop teaching a solely heterosexual view, “omitting the needs of gay, lesbian or bi young people”, in breach of the Equality Act. “For me it feels like the government wants to get this right. But I do worry that sometimes what may happen is yes, that’s what [the government is] saying, but how does that look in school environments? And are all teachers going to be confident in delivering LGBT issues, which Theresa May says she wants taught well?” she asks. Despite the framed letter on the wall, Birkenshaw has yet to be invited to Whitehall to discuss her experience. For now, simply speaking openly as “a former headteacher who just happens to be trans” is important enough. “I have visibility because I want trans young people to gain confidence that there is a teacher like them,” she says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/10/west-ham-burnley-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T17:22:36Z","webTitle":"West Ham chaos as pitch invaders and crowd trouble mars Burnley’s win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/10/west-ham-burnley-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/10/west-ham-burnley-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"West Ham chaos as pitch invaders and crowd trouble mars Burnley’s win","bodyText":"West Ham United are facing an investigation by the Football Association after their defeat by Burnley was marred by ugly scenes on and off the pitch as stewards at the London Stadium failed to stop supporters from mounting furious protests against the board. A match that was supposed to be remembered for the 25th anniversary of Bobby Moore’s death turned into one of chaos and farce as the London Stadium’s security failings were exposed again by hundreds of fans gathering in front of the directors’ box after Burnley took the lead in the second half. A female steward was knocked to the ground in the crush, Mark Noble, West Ham’s captain, threw one of several pitch invaders to the turf and the Metropolitan police received two allegations of assault. David Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham’s co-owners, were escorted from their seats in the 84th minute, sparking derisive jeers from the seething protesters, who chanted for the board’s removal. It is understood missiles were thrown at the directors’ box and one coin struck Sullivan in the face, however his glasses protected him from the possibility of serious injury. Some fans could be seen making throat-slitting gestures at members of the board. West Ham are likely to face punishment from the FA. The governing body will take a dim view of what took place, especially bearing in mind there was crowd trouble at the London Stadium on several occasions last season, and said in a statement: “The FA strongly condemns the crowd disturbances at West Ham United versus Burnley and will be seeking observations from West Ham as well as awaiting the match referee’s report.” A spokesman for the Met said: “Towards the end of the fixture between West Ham and Burnley at the London Stadium on Saturday 10 March, four separate pitch invasions by individual home fans took place. During the pitch incursions an impromptu protest took place within the stadium with around 200 people gathering under the directors’ box. Two allegations of assault have been received by police. These are being investigated. Exit from the stadium following the game passed without incident. At this stage there have been no arrests.” West Ham, who do not play again until hosting Southampton on 31 March and are three points above the bottom three with eight matches left, plan to take swift action. “West Ham United have immediately launched a full and thorough investigation into the incidents which marred the second half of today’s match and are committed to taking decisive and appropriate action,” the club said in a statement. “An emergency meeting has been called with all London Stadium stakeholders. There will be no further comment at this time.” As disgraceful as the scenes were, however, they had always felt possible bearing in mind the ugly circumstances surrounding the cancellation of a protest march before the game. The response from security after Ashley Barnes gave Burnley the lead was bewilderingly slow. The goal stemmed from an inspired change by Sean Dyche, who replaced Jeff Hendrick with Chris Wood and saw the substitute tee up Barnes for a fine finish in the 66th minute. The mood swiftly turned sour. A fan ran on to the pitch, with no steward tackling him for at least a minute, and clashed with Noble, who threw him to the ground. While that fan was led away, two more ran on. Burnley scored again in the 70th minute, Wood turning a loose ball past Joe Hart. The striker would score his second after an error by the recalled Hart. By then attention had turned to the astonishing scene in front of the directors’ box, where hundreds of fans overwhelmed a handful of stewards. There were more pitch invasions. One fan made off with a corner flag and stuck it in the centre circle. Play stopped briefly while the referee, Lee Mason, spoke to both benches. “As a supporter you can’t cross the line,” David Moyes said. “You know you can’t come on the pitch. That’s the rules.” The West Ham manager was soon facing questions about what it would be like to have to play games behind closed doors. Both managers praised the officials for calming the game and Moyes admitted he was worried Noble would be sent off. Barnes, meanwhile, tripped one invader. It beggared belief how long it took before police appeared. Eventually, 16 officers marched on to the perimeter of the pitch. Sir Trevor Brooking, sitting on his own in the directors’ box by the end, could only shake his head in dismay as he watched his former team slump further into disarray."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/10/rain-heavy-cheltenham-festival-simon-claisse-saturday-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T00:00:45Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Cheltenham forecast for rain could see heavy going","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/rain-heavy-cheltenham-festival-simon-claisse-saturday-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/10/rain-heavy-cheltenham-festival-simon-claisse-saturday-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Cheltenham forecast for rain could see heavy going","bodyText":"For the first time in nearly two decades, the going at the Cheltenham Festival “may well be heavy in places,” less than a week before the Festival meeting, Simon Claisse, the track’s clerk of the course, said on Friday ahead of a weekend that is forecast to see 17mm of rainfall at the course. “If we get what’s forecast, we’ll certainly end up soft,” Claisse said, “but it’s difficult to predict [the effect] because it all depends on the intensity.” In recent years, good-to-soft ground for the first day of the Festival meeting has been one of the few certainties at Cheltenham and Claisse has often needed to water the course to stop it drying out. Predominantly soft ground at the start of Tuesday’s card is now an odds-on chance, however, while heavy going is as short as 4-1 and good ground a 200-1 chance. “It was heavy [on what would have been the opening day] when we didn’t run the Festival back in 2001 because of foot- and- mouth,” Claisse said. “By the close of the weekend, we may well be heavy in places. There’s still rain forecast through Tuesday and Wednesday, [but] in many ways, what happens naturally is easier to manage than having to take decisions about any watering that we might do. If nature delivers it, then nature delivers it. It’s entirely out of our hands.” Soft ground at Cheltenham on Tuesday has been backed from 2-1 a week ago to a top price of 4-6, and punters are also beginning to look for horses with proven form on soft ground in next week’s big races. Definitly Red, who took the Cotswold Chase on heavy ground at Cheltenham’s Trials meeting in January, is 12-1 from 16-1 with Ladbrokes for Friday’s Gold Cup. The betting for Thursday’s Ryanair Chase has also seen several changes after Waiting Patiently, an impressive Grade One winner at Ascot last month, was taken out of the race at the five-day stage. Un De Sceaux, last year’s winner, is now top-priced at 6-4 (from 15-8 overnight) while the veteran Cue Card, who returned to form when second to Waiting Patiently at Ascot, is 6-1 (from 8-1). Recent jumps seasons have been quiet for the North Yorkshire trainer John Quinn, who saddled a Triumph Hurdle winner in Countrywide Flame six years ago. Quinn could make his mark in a big race once more through Master Of Irony (2.25) in Saturday’s Imperial Cup at Sandown, the highlight of ITV4’s coverage on this last weekend before the Cheltenham Festival. With Richard Johnson aboard for the first time and cheekpieces fitted, Master Of Irony looked progressive in victory at Wetherby in October. He was then caught out by the steady early pace when last seen at Newbury, never doing better than at the finish under Davy Russell in the Gerry Fielden. From the same mark and with Johnson back in the plate Master Of Irony has obvious potential to outrun odds of 12-1. He is not quite proven on such a testing surface but there is enough give in his odds to allow for that risk. Whatswrongwithyou appears to have had his problems and is not a tempting favourite for this handicap debut. Le Patriote is going the right way, however. 1.50 Sandown In this highly competitive affair Turtle Wars makes most appeal as one who could have a bit in hand at the weights. On the softest surface he has yet encountered Nicky Henderson’s five-year-old ran on pleasingly to break his duck at Huntingdon in January and his opening mark does not look terrifying. James Bowen is an encouraging booking. 2.05 Wolverhampton The best of Dragon Mall in a small field was not seen at Lingfield last time but this should be less tactical and hopefully he will get a clean run through from stall one. He has a low strike-rate but looks well treated and cheekpieces may help. 3.00 Sandown Anthony Honeyball’s bumper runners are always worth a second look and his Urca De Lima may be good enough for this. She won on her debut at Uttoxeter last April despite taking a keen hold and her reappearance in this company suggests there has been is no loss of stable confidence in her. 3.15 Wolverhampton Most of Second Thought’s rivals have had a more recent run but he looks a cut above so long as he is ready to go on this first outing since November. He is unbeaten in five on the all-weather. 3.35 Sandown The recent revival of the Tim Vaughan yard could continue through Tanit River, a winner over course and distance last month. A 5lb rise for that doesn’t even take him back to the mark he had for his previous outing, so there is clear potential for him to go in again in a weak-looking heat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/10/west-brom-leicester-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T17:14:53Z","webTitle":"Alan Pardew in West Brom’s last-chance saloon as Leicester cruise to win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/10/west-brom-leicester-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/10/west-brom-leicester-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Alan Pardew in West Brom’s last-chance saloon as Leicester cruise to win","bodyText":"With relegation all but a formality for West Bromwich Albion after yet another chastening defeat, the only question that remains is how much longer the club’s board will tolerate the sight of Alan Pardew presiding over their hapless plight. This was their seventh successive defeat, leaving them eight points adrift of safety with eight matches remaining. Pardew admitted it has now reached the stage where he needs to approach the board to see if they wish to make a change. The West Brom manager made it clear he is not the sort of character to “lay down tools”‚ yet this was the sort of performance that suggested the players are resigned to their fate. West Brom collapsed from the moment Riyad Mahrez put Leicester ahead in the second half and by the time Vicente Iborra headed in Leicester’s fourth goal, deep into injury time, the majority of the home supporters had already made their way to the exits. West Brom have won only one of their past 28 league matches and it is nigh on impossible to see any scenario other than relegation. Pardew has been in charge for 15 of those games, collecting only eight points in the process without ever giving the impression he is capable of hauling his club out of trouble. “Before you even ask me the question, ‘will I speak to upstairs?’, yeah, of course I will, because it’s getting difficult,” Pardew said. “My pride on the sideline is such that I don’t want to stand there for that last 15-20 minutes and watch that. My teams are better than that and I want my team here to be better than that. I said to the players afterwards, that last period of the game is unacceptable. “In terms of the team and the results and everything, it is what it is. And I want the best for West Brom. For me it’s about planning next week and what will be a difficult game down at Bournemouth. But I’ll still talk to [the board] and get a feeling of what they think because they might think a change is a better thing for the club. “But the one thing I’m not going to do is lay down tools. I was saying to the players you’ve got to fight to the end and I’m criticising them for the last 20 minutes that we weren’t fighting. “I don’t care what job you’re in, if you’re under pressure and you ain’t going to fight, then don’t bother turning up. So I’ll continue to fight, because that’s in me.” Although West Brom took the lead through a well-taken volley from Salomón Rondón and came close to scoring a second when Kasper Schmeichel pushed Grzegorz Krychowiak’s volley on to the bar, their fragile confidence was soon exposed. Jamie Vardy equalised with an exquisite volley – the England striker allowed Mahrez’s perfectly weighted pass to drop over his shoulder before striking it sweetly into the far corner – and Mahrez neatly tucked away Kelechi Iheanacho’s lovely pass early in the second half to put Leicester in front. Pardew withdrew Krychowiak a few minutes before that goal and the manager made it clear he was unhappy with the midfielder’s reaction to be substituted. “I do have a problem with it, because I’ve supported him and played him and stuck by him when he’s not been particularly great. To come off and not shake my hand, I made it very clear to him on the bench I’m not expecting that. He’s a player on loan [from PSG] and he should show respect.” Leicester, who were without a win in their previous five league games, then started to turn the screw. Kelechi Iheanacho’s bright cameo saw him score his first Premier League goal for the club when he nodded in Ben Chilwell’s cross and Vicente Iborra headed in Marc Albrighton’s corner to complete the rout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/11/breaking-up-with-my-smartphone-is-hard-to-do","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T16:00:50Z","webTitle":"Breaking up (with my smartphone) is hard to do","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/breaking-up-with-my-smartphone-is-hard-to-do","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/breaking-up-with-my-smartphone-is-hard-to-do","fields":{"headline":"Breaking up (with my smartphone) is hard to do","bodyText":"There is something wrong with my phone, and it is not just that the predictive text feature thinks I’m obsessed with ducks. The real problem is that my phone is the first thing I look at in the morning, and the last thing I look at at night. I come running when it makes a “ding” noise. I think in tweets and look at meals and people and imagine them cropped into squares on Instagram. There is something mentally totalitarian about it. Smartphones are designed to addict us – nagging us with notifications, disrupting us with noise, making themselves indispensable. Social media apps harness neuroscience to the same end, triggering dopamine hits that lock us into them for hours. A terrifying new book, How to Break Up With Your Phone, says we are rewiring our brains so they are less organised for deep thought; killing our attention span, destroying our memory, sleep and happiness. Phones have changed the world, too; advertisers use them to hoover up our attention. We are no longer just consumers, but product. As Ramsay Brown, co-founder of app-designers Dopamine Labs, has said: “You get to use [Facebook] for free, because your eyeballs are what’s being sold there.” The book aims to help us put our phones away. It is a 30-day plan starting with baby steps, such as buying an alarm clock, then progressing to auto-text responses, changing the screen to greyscale, and then – help! – an invitation to mindfulness. Due to my diminished attention span and craving for sensation, I’d prefer a single step, such as “throw your phone at a closed window” or “put it in the microwave” – as long as I could film it on my phone. I have tried some of the changes. I keep my phone in another room while working. I don’t cycle through a sequence of apps when I do pick it up, forgetting why I’m doing so. I now reply to messages once a day, like an 18th-century gentleman catching up on correspondence at his desk of a morning – except I do it in the bath, eating Maltesers, at night. The difference is huge. I’m reading more, I’m more able to string a sentence – hey, what’s that film where Keanu Reeves plays a Québécois goalie? I’m also bored. Reducing my smartphone use underlines what was great about it in the first place. The ability to wormhole away from the static walls of my home and work. To connect to anyone. There is no way the people I drink with on Friday can compare to anyone. And it’s not as if mental peace awaits as soon as I set down the glowing Distract-Oblong. It’s impossible to reclaim the thoughts I want without including the ones I don’t – anxious, intrusive thoughts that are always waiting. Breaking up with my phone means accepting the tortuous, paradoxical timeline of lived experience: how a day can drag on for a year, and 10 years can vanish overnight. But I’m doing it anyway. Putting down a smartphone is no less revolutionary than picking it up was. The best thing breaking up with my phone has given me is time. Time in which to be understimulated, or anxious. Time to stop being pulled in a hundred directions, envying the lives of others, and giving away my eyeballs for free. Actors become politicians, so why not put MPs in musicals Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon has edged closer to announcing an official run for governor of New York. She would probably be quite good, having previously campaigned over gay rights and for more money for publicly funded schools. But it is not a great sign that so many of us assume that it’s easy to traverse the worlds of politics and acting. One of these careers involves professional pretending and an ability to commit to pure fantasy. The other is acting. Let’s not be cynical, guys. With so many TV personalities eyeing up the political pasture, it is the suits I feels sorry for. They have to do something with themselves, too, once the time for that carriage clock rolls around. The obvious response is for our retired politicians to pick up the gauntlet, and take on the plum roles of stage and screen. Wouldn’t you binge-watch Ed Miliband in A Series of Unfortunate Events, or Nick Clegg in the next season of The Walking Dead? Crowd-pleasing musicals could take on a subversive frisson with the new approach. Neil Hamilton in Hamilton is a shoo-in; but would other ex-Tory politicians be thick-skinned enough to take on Fiddler On the Roof, Wicked or Kinky Boots? We continue to hurtle toward a future in which affairs of state are an indistinguishable variant of media, designed to entertain. But maybe that isn’t all bad. Would a national referendum decided from a cinema seat during a screening of Star Wars be more uninformed and beside the point than the last one? It would keep the numbers up. And the casting would be quite a lot more diverse. Furry animal robots get NHS seal of approval News that robotic seals could be rolled out across NHS dementia wards sounds like a nightmare world. But it’s a nice thing – the cybernetic seal pups respond to talking and touch and encourage social behaviour in those with declining cognitive function.

The launch of Labrador comes as more and more people are changing their energy companies. The company’s free service is primarily targeted at the growing number of households which have smart meters, which automate readings. More than 8m have been installed in the UK so far, and energy suppliers have to offer one to every home in the UK by the end of 2020. Unlike conventional price comparison sites, which require people to actively search for a better deal and input their details and energy use, Labrador will automatically switch people’s accounts when it finds a cheaper tariff. Jane Lucy, founder and CEO of Labrador, said: “We’re not about behaviour change: we assume consumer lethargy will remain.” Flipper is a similar service that launched in 2016, relying on accessing a customer’s energy bills, which might be estimated. Labrador believes it will be more accurate, as it use a device that plugs into a customer’s broadband router and talks wirelessly to their smart meters, taking readings direct from them. While Flipper charges an annual £25 fee, Labrador makes its money like a switching site, by being paid an acquisition fee by suppliers. Lucy said she expected customers would be switched 1-3 times a year and save on average £300 a year. They are given the choice to tailor their preferences, for example, to just green energy tariffs. The company has signed up about 500 customers since a soft launch in February, but aims to take 3% of the switching market within five years. In the future the company may branch out into home automation and helping consumers identify individual energy-guzzling appliances, Lucy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/11/populist-attacks-migants-not-a-winning-strategy-for-the-left","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T06:07:22Z","webTitle":"Aping populist attacks on migrants is not a winning strategy for the left | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/populist-attacks-migants-not-a-winning-strategy-for-the-left","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/populist-attacks-migants-not-a-winning-strategy-for-the-left","fields":{"headline":"Aping populist attacks on migrants is not a winning strategy for the left","bodyText":"On Christmas Eve 1980, Paul Mercieca, the communist mayor of Vitry, near Paris, led a gang of 60 men, mainly Communist party supporters, in a “direct action” to stop 300 Malian immigrants from being rehoused in the town. The gang turned off the water, gas and electricity at an immigrant hostel and used a bulldozer to smash up the building. Georges Marchais, general secretary of the French Communist party (PCF), justified the action, arguing that immigration was a capitalist “evil”. It’s worth recalling this story in the context of the current panic about immigration and populism. The results of last week’s Italian elections confirmed yet again the trends of many recent European polls – the trashing of the centre-left, the rise of populism, the strengthening of the far right, all against the background of a fraught debate on immigration. The Vitry case reminds us that the roots of what we now call “populism” have been marinading for a long time. It reminds us, too, of the shameful role of sections of the left in enabling rightwing populism. As the BBC correspondent Jonathan Marcus put it in his perceptive book, The National Front and French Politics: “While the National Front has been the principal beneficiary of the political debate on immigration, it was not Le Pen’s party that first brought the issue on to the political agenda. It was the communists, who… launched a campaign against what they saw as the over-concentration of immigrants in communist-run municipalities.” The Communist party did not reflect the left as a whole. The PCF was notoriously reactionary in its attitudes to immigration. And the world has changed hugely since 1980, from the rise of globalisation and free-market policies to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the decline of the labour movement. Few then talked of “populism”, still less panicked about mass anti-elite movements. The Front National was overtly neo-Nazi. Today’s populists range from organisations of the far right to those of the far left. What they have in common is that all position themselves as outsiders to the old liberal consensus. Yet, for all the differences, the response of the PCF to the nascent political threat posed by the Front National against the background of a recession echoes that of much of the non-Stalinist left to the challenge of populism in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. By insidiously linking the problems of the working class with immigration, the Communist party not only cleared the ground for the Front National, but also allowed it to project itself as a defender of working-class interests. The PCF’s strategy only hastened its demise. The old communist heartlands around Paris and in northern France are now Front National strongholds. The left has yet to learn the lesson. In the 1980s and 1990s, the initial response of much of the left to a changing world in which free-market policies looked unassailable and the labour movement had become marginalised, was to move away from its traditional working-class constituency. Feeling abandoned by the left, many working-class voters looked instead to populists to help regain a voice; many populists in turn adopted social policies that once were leftwing staples: defence of jobs, support for the welfare state, opposition to austerity. Half the unemployed who voted in last week’s Italian elections backed the populist Five Star Movement. Panicked by populism, much of the left has responded by talking tougher on immigration. It is a strategy that will no more win back support than that of the PCF four decades ago. It merely confirms, in the minds of many, that the populists were right, hence increasing cynicism about mainstream politicians, especially about the left. Since immigration is not the primary cause of working-class marginalisation, far from transforming working-class lives, it will only deepen the sense of grievance. For the left to reassert itself, it needs to rethink its whole strategy. Rather than aping populist anti-immigration sentiments, it needs to stitch together a liberal case on immigration with progressive economic arguments, rooted in social need and a belief in the community and the collective. Too many who rightly bemoan the corrosion of working-class organisations see the problem as too much immigration. Too many who have a liberal view on immigration are willing to accept attacks on working-class living standards. Until both those blinkered approaches are confronted, there will be no real challenge to the populists, nor to the erosion of the influence of the left. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/beguiling-begonias-for-the-best-foliage-james-wong-gardens","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Spots, swirls and beguiling begonias","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/beguiling-begonias-for-the-best-foliage-james-wong-gardens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/beguiling-begonias-for-the-best-foliage-james-wong-gardens","fields":{"headline":"Spots, swirls and beguiling begonias","bodyText":"It’s that time of year again: when the glossy pages of bedding plant catalogues land on your door mat, complete with page after page of massive double-flowered begonias in every Day-Glo shade possible. Indeed, these floriferous varieties are so popular that you might be forgiven for thinking that that’s all this genus has to offer for the bedding grower. But this could not be further from the truth. There are dozens of begonias available that, despite being mild-mannered in the flower department, are real showstoppers when it comes to leaves, in true Avatar shades of pink, red, silver, lime green, even deepest black. With the genes of more than a thousand species as a potential choice of breeding stock, these plants are as diverse in terms of structure as they are colour, ranging from fuzzy-leaved midgets to towering, shrub-like stunners. While for some reason these are still generally thought of in the UK only as houseplants, most will grow just as well planted out for the summer and treated like any other bedding plant. As I only have a few words to play with here, I’d better stop waxing lyrical and get on to the plants. For starters, to ease you into foliage begonias, ‘My Best Friend’ is a perfect dual-purpose variety, if you can’t bear to part with blooms, whose delicate powder-pink flowers float over crazy Jurassic Park-style foliage that’s so complexly patterned it’s hard to describe. Over a base of silver foliage, the margins of the leaf are edged with an olive-green border that’s dotted with white spots. All this struck through with fluorescent fuchsia veins. For fans of prehistoric patterns, but without the flashiest colours, ‘Emerald Giant’, ‘Green Gold’ and ‘Silver Jewel’ are your best bets. For those who like massive leaves, ‘Escargot’ has plate-sized foliage that looks that it has been spattered with silver with an air brush. But this plant’s real claim to fame, as its name implies, is the curious swirling at the centre of the leaves. Here, the edge of the two sides of the leaf overlap in a pretty perfect mathematical spiral: a wonder of geometry and nature. ‘Namur’ is a similar type, with a more subtle spiral, but it’s slightly wavy instead of flat and has a shield-like overall shape. It’s less dramatic but more elegant (to me, at least). So, I’ve saved the best for last: the giant cane begonias. I love the angel-wing foliage of B maculata ‘Wightii’, which seems to have taken over Instagram in recent years for its copper undersides with deep-green topsides dotted with bright silver dots. It can eventually grow, if brought in each winter, to well over 2m tall. Take the same huge stature and swap the butterfly wings for giant, hand-shaped leaves like a Umbrella tree Schefflera sp and you have B luxurians. All this for a plug plant that can cost you just a couple of quid.

Credit card company Visa said spending on cards fell again in February, dropping 1.1%, and that the first quarter of 2018 was on track to be the “worst on record”. It said spending by consumers had fallen in nine out the past 10 months. The number of shoppers visiting Britain’s high streets also continued to decline last month. High street analysts Springboard said footfall was down 0.5% in February but the picture was worse in shopping centres where the number of visitors was down 0.9%. The figures will be a challenge to Hammond, who is expected to tell the House of Commons tomorrow that economic growth and productivity have improved, with the public finances in better shape than previously thought. Surveys of business sentiment also paint a relatively gloomy picture for the economy – apart from optimism among manufacturers benefitting from improved exports and a stronger global economy. IHS Markit, which conducted the half-yearly survey, said service providers remain much less optimistic than the post-crisis peak seen in early-2014. Services firms and the badly hit construction sector are likely to suffer modest or negative growth this year. Against the trend, manufacturing firms expect to expand this year and employ more staff. Last week, the digger maker JCB said it plans to create 600 new jobs at its plants in Staffordshire and Derbyshire. Tim Moore, economist at IHS Market, said: “UK business confidence has edged up since last autumn, but levels of optimism remain among the lowest recorded over the past five years. Consumer-facing areas of the UK service sector were a key area of weakness, with growth expectations curtailed by worries about the outlook for household spending.” A breakdown of the Visa figures shows the extent to which Britons are tightening their belts. The amount spent on the physical high street fell 2.6% while households also cut back spending on recreation and culture by 6.1%. “Britons have been in belt-tightening mode since last summer,” said Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa. “February’s cold snap certainly didn’t alleviate this situation, particularly when we shine a spotlight on high street spending, and recreation and culture in particular, which saw its biggest decline since April 2010. “As we look ahead into March, consumer spending is at risk of posting one of the worst Q1 results on record,” he added. A separate study by the EY Item Club found that financial services firms will suffer from weak consumer confidence and rising costs during 2018. It forecast that banks will see a slowdown in one of the most profitable areas of business – consumer credit – which will slow for the first time in five years, dropping to 3% and then 2.8% in 2019, as consumers hit the brakes on the amount of debt they hold. This is a fall from the previous highs of 6.9% growth in 2017 and 8% growth in 2016. “Inflation is forecast to drop to 2.5% this year from 2.7% in 2017, which will ease the squeeze on household budgets, but real disposable incomes are forecast to only rise by 1.2% in 2018, constraining consumer’s spending power,” said Omar Ali, EY’s UK head of financial services."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/10/just-when-the-baby-boomer-is-loving-empty-nest-here-is-boomerang-child","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T17:01:23Z","webTitle":"Just when the baby boomer is loving the empty nest, here’s the boomerang child... | Yvonne Roberts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/just-when-the-baby-boomer-is-loving-empty-nest-here-is-boomerang-child","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/just-when-the-baby-boomer-is-loving-empty-nest-here-is-boomerang-child","fields":{"headline":"Just when the baby boomer is loving the empty nest, here’s the boomerang child...","bodyText":"The bedrooms have been redecorated in grown-up colours, the 25-year-old soft toys chucked out, the washing machine is blissfully underused and, thanks to the apparent current raging addictions of baby boomers, a holiday or two – cruising in the Med, the Antarctic, anywhere that avoids dry land – have been booked. And then they’re back. According to a recent study by the London School of Economics (LSE), adult children who return to the family home after a period away – often at university – cause a significant decline in their parents’ quality of life and wellbeing. The first study of its kind to measure the impact of the “boomerang generation” looked at 17 countries including France Germany and Italy. Dr Marco Tosi and Prof Emily Grundy applied “quality of life” measures that included “feelings of control, autonomy, pleasure and self-realisation in everyday life”. When a child returns home, researchers found the score went down by an average of 0.8 points, an effect on quality of life similar to developing an age-related disability such as mobility difficulties. Protestant countries showed a greater decline than Catholic ones, presumably because these nations are more accustomed to living in multigenerational, extended families. “When children leave the parental home, marital relationships improve and parents find a new equilibrium,” says Tosi. “They enjoy this stage in life, finding new hobbies and activities. When adult children move back, it is a violation of that equilibrium.” When a grown-up child does return, often reverting to tricky adolescence, there is something comfortingly familiar about doors slamming, noise accelerating and wellbeing sliding down the scale – it’s called parenting. But this time round, it can be particularly gruelling. It’s not easy for a twentysomething whose aspirations are battered by ridiculous housing costs, student debt and low wages to have to witness the daily spectacle of baby boomers bent on rediscovering their 60s mojo with late nights and long lie-ins, all the while being hard of hearing, digitally illiterate and short on memory. Repetition and constant interrogation about the strangeness of modern life are the price the returner must pay. “Did you say you’d be back for supper?”;“Six times.” “What’s that thing that works the TV?”;“The remote control.” And the rules of engagement are far from clear given that nowadays it’s more likely to be the baby boomer who is rolling a spliff and starting on a second bottle before the end of The Archers. Last week, a series of notes from parents admonishing children and teenagers was published. “Every time you don’t eat your sandwich, a unicorn dies. Love Dad,” read one lunchbox note. In a boomerang household, it’s more likely the child will leave an admonishing Post-it stuck to an empty case of wine, such as “drink kills”. Around one in four young adults now live with their parents in the UK, the highest number since records on the trend began in 1996. (In the 60s, it was the newly marrieds who returned to live with the in-laws.) The UK wasn’t part of the LSE study, but Tosi says refilling the empty nest is likely to have the same impact. And we have history. In the 18th century, young men would leave home in their teens to serve as apprentices and young women would fly the nest into domestic service, according to the sociologist Wally Seccombe’s history of working-class life, Weathering the Storm. But by the 1850s, the Industrial Revolution had led to mass “in-migration” to cities. “Home ownership was out of the question for the vast majority,” writes Seccombe. Families huddled together, sublet and took in lodgers. In 1851, in Preston, housing costs and low wages contributed to eight out of 10 males aged 15 to 19 living at home. It could take a woman, also a wage earner, up to three days to do the weekly wash by hand. Today, a returning adult child may find that the newly liberated woman of the house has resigned from all domestic duties in the name of self-realisation. The nest is no longer what it was. That said, one vital element is missing from the LSE study – how long does the return of the boomerang child last? A decade and he or she risks turning into a carer, while a year or two has its pluses – someone to feed the cat while Mum and Dad are paddling up the Amazon or, if finances are depleted by more mouths to feed again, down the Ouse. There are also surprising trade-offs. Research on the brain by two American psychologists, Mara Mather and Susan Turk Charles, involved tests on people up to the age of 80. Results indicated that as we get older our fight or flight-dictating amygdala reacts less to negative information. We tend to see the good rather than the bad, not least because time is precious. “In younger people, the negative response is more at the ready,” says Charles. So in what appears to be an age of perpetual anxiety for adult offspring who are perhaps temporarily suspending the quest for independence, to go back home is not just about cheap living (and potential continued warfare if more than one sibling also rejoins the nest). Mum and Dad may find their equilibrium, newfound hobbies and partnership wrecked, but there are compensations in making room for a broke son or daughter. Like all good-enough parents, in tough times they can make things seem not quite as bad as they might otherwise be. Even while queueing for the shower. • Yvonne Roberts is a freelance journalist, writer and broadcaster"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/14/northamptonshire-residents-angry-cuts-natalie-bloomer","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Northamptonshire residents are angry.

We won’t give in to cuts","bodyText":"I’ve lived in Northamptonshire for 19 years and since the Tory-run county council effectively declared bankruptcy, I can’t remember a time when people here were so concerned about local politics. At the school gates parents talk about what the current situation will mean for their children, in coffee shops I hear people discussing who’s to blame, and in the back of taxis I listen to the drivers’ anger about the state of the roads and the likelihood they will get a lot worse. Earlier this month, I received a text from my mum asking if I’d heard anything about the local libraries. She had received two calls inquiring about whether the small library where she volunteers would be open that day. It turned out that it wouldn’t be. The council had announced the night before that 21 libraries across the county would only open one day a week with immediate effect. Several days later that decision was reversed, but it did little to relieve fears that the county is in chaos. In recent weeks the council has said that it intends to sell off its brand-new £53m headquarters, which staff only moved into a few months ago. It has also been warned by auditors that its proposed budget plans could be illegal. The leader of the council, Heather Smith, has been involved in public spats with her own colleagues and has recently lost a vote of no confidence among her Conservative group. An emergency budget passed last month included not only the closure of libraries but also the removal of all bus subsidies, a cut of 42% to the trading standards budget and a reduction in highways maintenance. At first glance, some of these cuts might not seem like a huge loss – we’re unlikely to see many protesters demanding, “Save our trading standards”. But the council’s own equality impact assessments (EIAs) show that 100,492 elderly passengers and 8,719 disabled people use the bus routes that will be axed when subsidies go. In a consultation on the plans, respondents told the council that the proposals could lead to increased isolation, with residents becoming less independent and more home-bound. A friend who relies on a bus to get to work from one of the affected villages told me: “This could mean that I have to quit my job. I have no other way to get there.” The trading standards EIA states that the cuts could result in rogue traders targeting vulnerable consumers with significantly lower risk of getting caught, and that less enforcement activity could lead to an increase in illegal sales of alcohol and cigarettes to under-age consumers. Local charities, including Deafconnect and Northamptonshire Association for the Blind, are facing huge cuts to their funding from the council.“We’re trying to work out what we can do. Staffing will be cut,” says Joanna Steer, the chief executive of Deafconnect. “We’ll keep two drop-ins a week and children’s services are safe because of other funding, but adult services will be knocked to pieces.” This will impact advice, support and advocacy work, she says. “One minute we can be sorting out a problem with a utility company, the next we are looking for a lawyer for a client going through a divorce.” Most of the work is needed because of communication problems – workers from the charity even attend hospital appointments with clients. “We might have to start charging but that will prevent so many people from accessing our services,” Steer says. This is at a time when the county’s director of adult social care has described her department as being “on the edge of being unsafe”, as it was revealed that 2,000 vulnerable adults hadn’t been assigned a social worker. People are angry but they’re not giving up without a fight. All across the county residents are coming together to try to save the services that mean so much to them. My mum and her friends, like many other groups, are desperately trying to think of ways to keep their library open. Others are looking at possible legal routes to challenge some of the council’s decisions. Sadly, the uncomfortable truth is that nobody really knows what will happen next. “These cuts could lead to far more isolation for people in the county,” says Anjona Roy, the chief executive of the Northamptonshire Rights and Equality Council. “We’re saving up expensive issues with huge human cost for the future. We’ve got a lot of bad times to get through before things start to get any better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/17/one-to-watch-cold-callers-music-swallowed-by-the-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T18:00:41Z","webTitle":"One to watch: Cold Callers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/17/one-to-watch-cold-callers-music-swallowed-by-the-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/17/one-to-watch-cold-callers-music-swallowed-by-the-sun","fields":{"headline":"One to watch: Cold Callers","bodyText":"Hertfordshire isn’t typically a place you’d associate with smooth hip-hop-meets-R&amp;B sounds, but rising duo Cold Callers are about to subvert your expectations.

Like a lot of people from the Caribbean she took that journey for a better life in the UK. I was about nine when I joined her here and then my younger brother followed me. It was difficult for us after that as those years of bonding were missing. Your early years shape the adult you become. My grandmother was a surrogate mother to me in Jamaica, and without her I wouldn’t be who I am today. That security blanket and love from her has helped me in my adult life. So many things remind me of Stephen [Lawrence. Her son who was murdered in a racially motivated attack in 1993] and I get very tearful. A big trigger for me is when I see young people get hurt or I see that people aren’t understanding them. I want to say: “Listen to them!” There are too many times that we don’t listen to children enough. I’ve always been very stubborn. I don’t take no for an answer and I always challenge things. I feel that we are all equal. You need to treat people in a respectful way. But I would speak to you in the same way I speak to a prime minister. I don’t feel that I have to bow and scrape to anybody. Stephen had a mischievous way about him. I have a little bit of that in me, too. I do wonder what he’d be like now and whether or not he would have a family. He’d be 43 now and I’m sure he’d be well into his career as an architect. He was quite serious about that. The anniversary of Stephen’s death [22 April] is always very difficult. I mark it by going to where he died in Eltham. That’s the only place that I can go and have a connection with Stephen. I take some flowers. I visit with the minister of the church that Stephen attended when he was young. We say prayers and we chat about Stephen. It doesn’t make me feel better, but it is a remembrance of him. Some people might think that race relations in this country have improved, but society is not as accepting as you think. Mental health is a big issue within the black community, particularly for young black men. And, at times, if they are in trouble, the police quickly see the criminal side of things. There needs to be more understanding. I don’t think I became a better parent after Stephen’s death. But losing him focussed me more on my other two children, Stuart and Georgina. It’s easy to take your children for granted, to believe they’ll always be around, but after what happened I realised that there is no guarantee of “tomorrow”. There is a shift in attitude within the police. Senior officers are people who understand what it is they need to do in terms of practicing equality, but officers on the beat are never in the room to understand the implications of their actions and inactions. Those are the officers we need to spend more time working with to give them a better understanding of their place in society. There are positives that have come from my son’s death. Laws have been changed in his name, which have made life better for people. Then there’s the fact that I’m in a position to talk to the prime minister and I’m now sitting in the House of Lords able to talk to judges. It’s positive that I’ve got a voice that I can use. In order to be forgiven, you have to admit you did something wrong. Those men who murdered Stephen have never done that. So it’s very difficult for me to forgive them. To say that I’ve been dignified and strong all the time would be far from the truth. On the outside people think that I’ve not crumbled, but I have. I’ve had to step up to the plate because if I hadn’t, Stephen and his legacy would be forgotten, and I don’t ever want my son to be forgotten.

I love the peace and quiet,” said one visitor on Friday, Fran Davis. “It is funny to think just a few hundred yards over there something terrible happened. Salisbury is one of those places that doesn’t change very much. That’s the attraction.” It has been strange to see life in the city gamely carrying on while police guarded the scene of an attack with international ramifications and hundreds of reporters, photographers and camera crews from across the globe watched on. Sally Marwan, 22, a clothes shop worker in the George Mall precinct, said: “People are still carrying on with their lives in spite of everything. We panicked more about the snow than this. The bad weather had much more impact.” Although what happened is extraordinary, the people of this city, so close to the military training areas on Salisbury Plain, are used to a fair dose of intrigue. Even before the revelations about Sergei Skripal, Salisbury had a reputation as a city where old spooks came to live out their days. Some are worried that what happened may tarnish Salisbury’s reputation. Robin McGowan, the chief executive of Salisbury Business Improvement District, said: “I can understand there may be people who have uncertainties about visiting the city centre right now but Wiltshire police have assured the public that there does not appear to be any immediate risk to public health. “There are a number of cordons in the area closest to the scene, and there are indeed businesses in the Maltings [where Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, collapsed] that are closed at the moment, but otherwise it’s business as usual.” Some parents living on the city’s fringes admitted they had not taken their children into the centre. “It’s better to be safe than sorry,” said Sue Stephens, who has two children. “We still don’t know what we’re facing here. They haven’t said or really explained it. All they’ve said is that the risk is thought to be low. What does that mean? I’m taking no chances.” There was concern from some residents about the time it took for areas potentially linked to the attack to be cordoned off to the public. Vanessa Lucas, 22, was coming out of a gym close to the scene on Sunday when she saw the air ambulance that was about to airlift Yulia to hospital. “It wasn’t closed off till Monday afternoon,” she said. “They should have closed it on Sunday evening. So many people would have gone to Zizzi and the Mill [now cordoned off] during the day on Monday.” Lucas assumed she had stumbled on a training exercise: “You just don’t see that stuff in Salisbury.

They turned to magic and religion to help them survive and thrive, cure illnesses and to ensure good fortune in their uncertain lives. This was true both for pagans, who believed in many gods, and Jewish people, for whom there was only one god, Jahweh. As Robert Knapp argues, it was risky to give up your gods for new ones, inviting divine displeasure. But in the first century AD, some Jews and polytheists began breaking with traditions and embracing a new religion: Christianity. From the dust and heat of Judaea came a new message, from Jesus of Nazareth, who used magic and miracles to convince followers he spoke as a god. He offered a “reward in this life and a happy immortality in the next”. By the end of the third century, 10% of city dwellers were believers. Knapp draws on more than 30 years of research into ancient history to offer a fascinating glimpse into the beliefs of ordinary people and to show how a new religious message won hearts and minds. • The Dawn of Christianity: People and Gods in a Time of Magic and Miracles is published by Profile.

The US retail giant is selling $6,000 (£4,330) “doomsday prepper” food kits. Promising enough to feed a family of four for a year, these 600-can stacks contain freeze-dried carrots, egg noodles, quick oats, macaroni, freeze-dried banana slices and potato chunks, among many other staples. And because there’s nothing more embarrassing than starving neighbours attacking your post-doomsday compound, it is all “packaged discreetly for privacy in shipping”. It’s easy for Americans, for whom prepping appears to be overtaking baseball as the national sport. But what about Brits, for whom a can of baked beans is still just a nice Friday night post-pub snack, rather than a golden ticket to repopulate a ravaged Earth? Lincoln Miles runs Britain’s largest prepping superstore, Preppers Shop, from Roche in Cornwall. He reckons you could do it for less – around £1,000. Here are his tips: Get a bit of everything “To combat boredom,” says Miles, “variety is very important. Ideally, you’d like to have a third freeze-dried, a third tinned, and then your grains and pulses. And the freeze-dried food is surprisingly tasty. They do everything – even freeze-dried bacon and eggs.” The freeze-dried would be the cost bottleneck; each pack, of around 800 calories, costs about £5. “But if you go to Aldi, say, and buy tins, well they’re only costing you pennies.” Buy slowly and steadily “Most preppers I know tend to do a little at a time,” says Miles. “Rather than blowing £1,000 at once, which invites suspicion, it’s much better to just put a fiver a week on your normal shopping. Store them at home. Then, after a year, you’ve amassed a lot.” Choose your timeframe wisely Miles thinks storing enough to last a year might be slightly excessive. “Most [preppers] are only storing enough for three months.” Store and cook Pulses can be stored in the double-sealed steel bins Miles sells. Cans will keep for 30 years. Miles sells hex solid-fuel cookers for outdoor food preparation, but recommends also stocking up on gas cylinders. One warning though. Apart from nuclear winter, marauding animals and plague, one thing could still take down even a well-stocked prepper: forgetting the can opener."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/15/bullseye-jim-bowen-best-bits-a-backheeled-lob-and-brilliant-barrel-jumping","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T10:22:52Z","webTitle":"Bullseye's best bits, a backheeled lob and brilliant barrel jumping | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/15/bullseye-jim-bowen-best-bits-a-backheeled-lob-and-brilliant-barrel-jumping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/15/bullseye-jim-bowen-best-bits-a-backheeled-lob-and-brilliant-barrel-jumping","fields":{"headline":"Bullseye's best bits, a backheeled lob and brilliant barrel jumping","bodyText":"1) The host of darts quiz show Bullseye, Jim Bowen, died aged 80 this week.

She had a mischievous look on her face. She greeted me and laughed. As I manoeuvred my bike into the house, she asked me to say butterfly. So I did. “Butterfly,” I said. “Daddy,” she squealed, trying to suppress a laugh. “It’s pronounced buTTerfly, not bu-uh-fly.” She ran off laughing hysterically. Almost as if she couldn’t believe her luck that I had fallen into her trap. This is her new trick – to make fun of my accent. If I don’t enunciate, if I pronounce something in a way she is not familiar with, if I allude to a regional accent that is not the one in her surrounding area, she will make her feelings known. I’ve got a fairly generic London accent, which involves the dropping of “t”s and the use of innit as a full stop. And now my daughter corrects me all the damn time. In the same way my mum used to. It first started when she asked how old I was. I told her: “I’m 37 years old.” She said: “Thur-eee? Not thur-eee. ThirTy. Thir-tee.” She shook her head at me in disappointment, frustrated that I couldn’t get my basic pronunciation right. I could hear my mum in her, trying to force me to speak English properly. Mum’s fear was that if I didn’t speak English in a proper plummy posh voice, people would use it as an opportunity to remind me I wasn’t from here. She had many anxieties like this. My sister and I had to change out of our school uniforms the second we came home. She didn’t want our clothes to smell of her cooking. “Everyone will say you stink of curry. Do not give them any ammunition,” she would say. If I told her I was heading to the park to play football, she would stress the “t”. Foot-ball. Not fu-baw. Or however I pronounce it. Strangely, Mum was always fine with innit. Probably because she used it herself, innit. My daughter’s obsession with my dropped “t”s is becoming wearing. I find myself watching everything I say. And by everything, I mean e-ver-y-thing, not every-fing. Last Sunday, I was making a coffee and she was playing by herself. I heard her, in a makeshift den, under a blanket, talking to her teddy bear, Maple. She was whispering: ‘We’re going to a party… party, party, party… Not parr-eee. Par-Tee.” I asked her what was wrong. “You talk funny,” she said. “You say peanuh bu-uhr. It’s peanut butter.” “That’s just my accent,” I told her. I tried to explain the concept of accents to her. Especially as she’s growing up in Bristol and starting to develop some quaint West Country inflections, like her pronunciation of the number two. It sounds like it has an extra “w” on the end. She also sometimes adds a doing word to the end of her sentences. “I’m going to the park, I am” or “You pronounce things funny, you do.” She refused to accept she had an accent. She told me she sounds like herself. Which is true. But I wanted to impress on her the importance of accepting that people say things in different ways and there’s no one correct way to speak. Because I certainly felt that pressure from my mum growing up. To speak correctly. To erase any sense of myself or my immigrant background from my voice. To my mum, it was important that I sounded proper. Whatever that meant. And I want my daughter to appreciate difference, to not want us all to conform to one voice. As we rode my bike to nursery one morning, I asked her again about her obsession with my accent. “Daddy has an accent,” I told her. “I’m from London. You have an accent, too. You sound like you’re from Bristol.” She laughed. I told her again why it’s important to embrace people’s difference, and she replied: “Important not impor-unt.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/11/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-cup-games-more-important-liverpool-win","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T23:11:31Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho: Sevilla and Brighton ties more important than Liverpool win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/11/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-cup-games-more-important-liverpool-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/11/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-cup-games-more-important-liverpool-win","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho: Sevilla and Brighton ties more important than Liverpool win","bodyText":"José Mourinho says Manchester United have a “die or live” week ahead as they attempt to knock out Sevilla from the Champions League and Brighton in the FA Cup. On Saturday the manager oversaw a 2-1 win against Liverpool that stretched their lead in second place over Jürgen Klopp’s team to five points. Yet Mourinho believes the games against Sevilla and Brighton are more important as they are sudden‑death contests. United trail Manchester City by 13 points in the league having played one more match, with Pep Guardiola’s side at Stoke City on Monday night. That means the Champions League and FA Cup are the only competitions United can realistically win. Mourinho’s team host Sevilla on Tuesday night in a last-16 second leg, following a goalless draw in the first game. They will be eliminated if the Spanish club manage a scoring draw, while Brighton visit on Saturday for the Cup quarter-final. “Seville and Brighton are more important games than Liverpool,” Mourinho said. “Liverpool is Liverpool, it is a big match, it is a match against a direct competition for the top four. But nothing is decided yet. “We have eight more games and 24 points to play for. But Seville and Brighton are die or live games so the next two are much more important than this one.” The victory against Liverpool follows previous league wins against Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, yet Mourinho shrugged off their importance. “It says nothing. In modern football you have to live day by day, week by week and match by match. We have a match in two days and I can imagine that if we lose against Seville on Tuesday everyone will have forgotten what we did in the last couple of weeks. “That’s modern football – you have to live in the moment and cope with it. So, yes, we beat Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool – only City we have not beaten in the current top six – but that means nothing because in football these days you have to prove it every day.” Marcus Rashford scored United’s goals before Liverpool pulled one back with an Eric Bailly own goal. The 20-year-old Rashford said: “We can use the confidence of this game to push us through the next games and our focus is on the next game in the Champions League.” Jesse Lingard, a late substitute, also echoed the manager’s sentiment. “Our big week started against Liverpool,” he said. “To get the result we did shows what kind of team we are and if we can get past Sevilla, it will put us in a good position and then we have the FA Cup. The win puts us in a good position in the league, but we have still got a long way to go so we need to keep pushing.” Lingard praised the attitude of Rashford, who was making a first league start of 2018. “It’s his mentality – he has got good people around him,” he added. “They always assure him he is in a good place at the moment and what kid wouldn’t want to be at United at the moment? He is doing well, he has come in and he has got the right mentality and he has shown the manager what he can do. “It’s a big club with big players and for players like me and Marcus it’s going to be tough to start every game but once you are on the pitch you have to make an impact and maybe next game you will be playing. But you’ve got to always work hard and he does.” Paul Pogba was unavailable for the Liverpool game after a training ground accident. Mourinho is unsure if he will be fit for the Sevilla game. “I don’t know,” the manager said. “The injury? It was contact with a player in the last minute of the session yesterday. If I finished the session one minute before it wouldn’t have happened.” Klopp said he was pleased with his side’s reaction after they were 2-0 behind after only 24 minutes. “1-0 down changed the world for us, 2-0 feels really bad so early and after that you can immediately switch off,” the German said. “Of course we are not that far behind in our development. The reaction was as good as you can say after you still lost. I think we would’ve deserved a draw, that’s a fact, but we don’t have it so it’s not important. A draw at Manchester is always a sign of a good game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/11/growing-crisis-for-childrens-social-care","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T18:01:04Z","webTitle":"Growing crisis for children’s social care | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/11/growing-crisis-for-childrens-social-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/11/growing-crisis-for-childrens-social-care","fields":{"headline":"Growing crisis for children’s social care","bodyText":"As the cabinet leads for children’s services in the north-west of England we are urging the chancellor to allocate the additional funds we need to address the growing crisis in children’s social care. The demand and complexity of cases is increasing, creating overspends in our children’s services budgets, at the same time that our council budgets are being reduced. This is an unsustainable financial demand for each of our councils. In the north-west there are now more than 13,000 looked-after children. This represents a 20-year high and is the greatest number of children in care of any region in England. This has been driven by growth of 12% since 2013 alone, double the 6% increase in the rest of the country. Analysis from the Placements Northwest census identifies sharp escalation in costs, for example a £45m increase in expenditure on residential care placements this year. We have recorded 90,930 referrals in 2016-17, which is an increase of 2% on the previous year. Our data suggests that this is being driven by the increase in domestic abuse and mental ill health. We know that the sustainable solution to reducing children’s social care is early intervention. But the increasing cost of children’s social care is driving our limited resources away from funding early help. This is consistent with the national picture that is illustrated in the Turning the Tide report produced by Action for Children, National Children’s Bureau and the Children’s Society. As the finance bill makes its way through parliament, we are asking the government to respond to the crisis of children’s social care, and provide adequate funding to meet these needs.

Silva was permitted to return home while City wrapped up the home leg of their round of 16 Champions League tie against Basel last week but is back in the UK and ready to play at Stoke on Monday evening. Following the game they have a fortnight off, part of which they will spend warm-weather training in Abu Dhabi, although Silva will be granted more time in Spain. “The family is always the most important thing,” Pep Guardiola said. “David wants to be with the team but sometimes he needs to go back and see his son and his wife. He knows he has to keep training, too, so he trains alone in Valencia.” Silva was man of the match in his last outing against Chelsea; his form has held up remarkably well whenever he has played in the last couple of months. “David is a guy with a lot of technical skills and this league is so complicated because of the physicality and the weather conditions but he survives; he’s been one of the best players in England for a long time now,” the manager added. “All that time he has played at a high level and we are so happy to have him, and to extend his contract. He’s a huge competitor. He doesn’t speak too much but on the pitch, the moment the game is on, he steps forward. He never hides, even when the going is tough, and that is so important.” One player who may not be returning at Stoke is Benjamin Mendy, who is approaching full fitness and able to take part in training after a knee injury but is to be gradually reintroduced by City’s manager. “The most important thing after six months out is to be careful,” Guardiola said. “Benjamin might think he is strong enough to play like before the injury but that is not going to happen. Even if he believes he is strong he is not strong enough. The knee is going well, so maybe we can start to think about giving him the first 20 minutes in a game. Then it is best to play one game and rest for two because after six months you have to be careful to avoid a muscular injury.” Mendy was still playing for Monaco when City took a mid-season break in Abu Dhabi just over a year ago. The squad flew out between the two legs of their Champions League meeting and although the feelgood factor from a 5-3 victory in the first game was soon extinguished by a 3-1 defeat and away-goals elimination in the return, Guardiola maintains the club owners were supportive in spite of what turned out to be a trophyless season. “The relationship has always been good, we speak a lot on the telephone,” he said. “This season, with everything going well and everybody happy, it is easy to support us but what meant a lot to me was that the support was also there last season in the bad moments. They were right behind us and I will never forget that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/20/million-dollar-mouse-army-remote-antarctic-islands-hunt-pest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T03:14:30Z","webTitle":"The million-dollar mouse: navy heads to remote Antarctic islands to hunt out pest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/20/million-dollar-mouse-army-remote-antarctic-islands-hunt-pest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/20/million-dollar-mouse-army-remote-antarctic-islands-hunt-pest","fields":{"headline":"The million-dollar mouse: navy heads to remote Antarctic islands to hunt out pest","bodyText":"Ten rangers, three sniffer dogs, a government minister and members of the New Zealand defence force have been dispatched on a special mission to hunt for a rodent – known as the million-dollar mouse – living on remote islands in the sub-Antarctic. The inhospitable Antipodes Islands are located 470 miles (760km) south-east of New Zealand and were until recently home to a 200,000-strong mouse population, thought to have been introduced by sealers or a shipwreck more than a century ago. The mice – the only introduced mammalian pest on the island – ate albatross chicks alive, devastated vegetation and threatened rare insect life. In an attempt to eradicate them two years ago, New Zealand raised NZ$1m (£526,000) and embarked on one of the largest and most ambitious extermination programmes undertaken anywhere in the world. In June 2016, 65 tonnes of cereal-based rodent bait was dropped by two helicopters over a total area of 2,045 hectares (5,051 acres) of the islands. The airdrop was supported by a 13-strong crew on the ground, who spent 75 days exterminating an estimated 200,000 mice. Now, the first monitoring team from New Zealand has departed on the HMNZS Wellington to spend three weeks hunting for mice in the world heritage site, to see if the project was a success. New Zealand conservation minister Eugenie Sage, who was onboard the ship steaming south, said the expedition was exciting but nerve-wracking. “As with any island eradication, success is never guaranteed. The Antipodes operation was delivered to international best practice – however, the sheer challenge of eradicating 200,000 mice from such a remote and wild part of New Zealand should never be underestimated,” Sage said. “If any mice had survived the operation, the population would have rebounded by now to a level where they should be detectable … the international community will be watching closely.” Stephen Horn, the project manager for the department of conservation, said getting on to the islands was the team’s first challenge, with the crew having to scale 18-metre (59 feet) cliffs to access their accommodation. “The mice are having a massive impact on a whole range of species,” he said. “The beauty about the sub-Antarctic Island that is so far away from New Zealand is that over time it has developed its own unique range of species. There is rare, threatened, endemic species out there that we’re looking to protect.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/the-public-doesnt-buy-the-economic-theory-the-government-is-selling","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T00:37:10Z","webTitle":"The public doesn't buy the economic theory the government is selling | Peter Lewis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/the-public-doesnt-buy-the-economic-theory-the-government-is-selling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/the-public-doesnt-buy-the-economic-theory-the-government-is-selling","fields":{"headline":"The public doesn't buy the economic theory the government is selling","bodyText":"While the #beetrooter saga has sucked all the oxygen out of the national political debate for the past fortnight, the Coalition government is confronted by a more existential crisis. Not of morality, but of economics. It was coming to a head in the first few weeks of the year as the prime minister and treasurer set up 2018 as a test of neo-classical economic orthodoxy. At the heart of that effort was the faith that his much touted company tax cuts would trickle through the economy via increased demand for labour that would inevitably led to higher wages across the economy. This is the sort of economic that is presented as a series of immutable truths, based on the premise of individual rationality and consumer sovereignty, the complexity of the world reduced to simple mathematical equations. Of course, a lot of the economic theory is spent explaining why reality had a tendency to deliver different answers to the ones the equations predict, but as long as you were looking in the rear-view mirror it all made sense. What passes as economic debate in Australia today may not be called “neo-classical”, but take the treasurer’s lines and you get a fair idea: penalty rates distort the market, immigration drives growth by increasing the demand for goods and services. These propositions are presented by the government as articles of faith, rejecting those who disagree as flat-earthers (an interesting position given elements of the Coalition’s tendency to reject the disciplines of more mainstream branches of science). But as figures included in last week’s Essential Report illustrates, the public rejects many of these propositions. It’s interesting to reflect on what is accepted and what is not. Where the proposition is about trickle-down economics, we are sceptical. Yet when the economic arguments are focussed on intervening at what economists would call the “bottom of the market” – via income tax cuts and wage increases, the public is more receptive. We are sceptical about the benefits of immigration, yet we are not isolationist, recognising the benefits of trade agreements in improving opportunities for Australian workers. But on the cornerstone of the Coalition economic strategy – the corporate tax cut – we are just not buying. Lining up all the economic arguments in favour of the cut, less than one third of voters accept the proposition; while more see it as a simple transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to corporate Australia. What should cause the government particular concern is the high number of “other voters” – the conservative right parties, who are hostile to the idea. Now the problem with the company tax cut could be the sell. After all Scott Morrison is no Paul Keating; where Keating seduced the population into understanding economics, painting pictures and telling stories, Morrison simply bludgeons them with the theory. But there might be something more than the sale. I think more and more of the public are subscribing to neo-classical’s maligned poorer cousin political economy, where economics is seen less as an equation and more as a product of history, culture and politics. A political economist would see lower wages as the direct consequence of the Conservatives’ long-running assault on unions and their ability to bargaining collectively to demand higher wages. A political economist would look at the rampant tax evasion and minimisation industry that sees one in five of our larger companies pay zero tax and many more book profits in offshore havens. A political economist would regard cost of living pressures as a product of the government’s failure to land a plan to transition energy, or protect home buyers from speculators, or support job-creating industries. Where the neo-classical economist would argue for a simple equation, the political economist would advocate a complex web of government actions to deal with these distortion, rather than leave the market to its textbook theory. Which is why the most emphatic agreement from voters this week is for the idea the government could force companies to pass on a proposition of any tax cuts as pay rises for workers. Of course, the Turnbull government would never countenance such a market distortion. Plus, they no there’s no way to force corporations to do anything other than maximise their profits. But when the irrationality of the #bonkban is finally resolved, the government will be back to its so-called rational lines, getting increasingly frustrated that the public refuses to sign up to their equation. At least Barnaby has had cut-through."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/21/call-to-lift-secrecy-around-police-taser-use-after-mentally-ill-mans-death","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T23:17:57Z","webTitle":"Call to lift secrecy around police Taser use after mentally ill man's death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/call-to-lift-secrecy-around-police-taser-use-after-mentally-ill-mans-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/call-to-lift-secrecy-around-police-taser-use-after-mentally-ill-mans-death","fields":{"headline":"Call to lift secrecy around police Taser use after mentally ill man's death","bodyText":"Civil liberties groups have demanded more transparency around the police use of Tasers after a mentally ill man died during a police arrest in Sydney on Sunday. Stephen Blanks, the president of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, said NSW police had not released updated statistics relating to Taser use for six years. The latest report, conducted by the NSW ombudsman in 2012, found a third of people Tasered by police were suffering from mental illness and three-quarters were unarmed. On Sunday the unarmed 30-year-old man died after he escaped from Royal Prince Alfred hospital, where he was being held under the Mental Health Act. He was approached by police, was capsicum-sprayed, Tasered by one officer and arrested in a confrontation involving six officers before he stopped breathing. On Monday, the assistant police commissioner, Mark Walton, said only one Taser was used but he could not confirm how many times, or for how long, it had been discharged. No police officers activated their body-worn cameras but there was footage taken automatically by the Taser itself, Walton said. Blanks said the police use of Tasers in the state suffered from a “lack of transparency”. “We’ve got no published statistics about the use of Tasers by NSW police for several years and there hasn’t been any review of their use for several years,” he said. In 2012 the NSW coroner released a damning report into Taser use after the Brazilian student Roberto Laudisio-Curti died after being Tasered 14 times during a psychotic episode. The report said police had acted with “an ungoverned pack mentality, like the schoolboys in Lord of the Flies” and recommended new guidelines. These included a ban on the drive stun mode – where a Taser is held against a person’s body and causes pain instead of incapacitation – unless officers were under attack. She also recommended that officers better communicate, when calling for back-up, that suspects are suffering from signs of mental disturbance. On Monday Walton could not confirm whether the drive stun mode had been used. He said officers “had a concept” that the man was mentally disturbed and knew he had been in hospital for mental health issues. The NSW police handbook tells officers to “apply the least restrictive actions possible upon a person suffering from a mental illness”. “Upon receiving notification that a person has absconded from a mental health facility, speak with the hospital manager and ascertain as much detail as possible,” it says. Under the guidelines, a Taser should only be discharged to protect human life, prevent actual bodily harm, or during a violent confrontation. It should not be used against a mental health patient solely to make them comply or submit to medication, or against passive subjects. The guidelines also warn police of the risks of positional asphyxia during arrest and note that high-risk factors include “when an individual is highly stressed” and exhibiting “wild, threatening, bizarre behaviour with possible mania or psychosis”. On Monday Walton said the deceased was “a large man, somewhere in the vicinity of 120kg and over six feet tall, and he was resisting police”. “In those circumstances, the police have apparently determined it was appropriate,” he said. A spokeswoman for the police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, said it was “understood that the NSW police force is applying the recommendations made by the coroners”. The current Taser procedures were implemented in 2016 and are scheduled for review on 1 July this year. Blanks called on the police to release new data before then. “It would certainly be timely,” he said, “so that the public can consider whether the guidelines have got the appropriate settings or need to be tweaked.” The death is being investigated by the homicide squad and a report will be provided to the coroner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/19/wigan-shock-win-manchester-city-angry-scenes-dw-stadium","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T07:43:32Z","webTitle":"Wigan shock win over Manchester City sparks angry scenes at DW Stadium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/19/wigan-shock-win-manchester-city-angry-scenes-dw-stadium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/19/wigan-shock-win-manchester-city-angry-scenes-dw-stadium","fields":{"headline":"Wigan shock win over Manchester City sparks angry scenes at DW Stadium","bodyText":"Wigan put in the doughtiest of defensive performances to pull off the shock of the season against Manchester City and once again breathe life into the FA Cup, though this eventful evening was old-fashioned in an unsavoury sense too, with scenes at the end resembling the dark days of terrace hooliganism from 40 years ago. There was an old school pitch invasion at the final whistle, which might not have been so bad had the players been allowed to leave the pitch safely. They were not and Sergio Agüero was most conspicuously involved in an unseemly scuffle with fans in which a couple of punches were thrown. Then the City fans in the stand began throwing objects over the perimeter fence and by the time order was restored on the pitch they were ripping up advertising hoardings and flinging them towards stewards and police. The opposing managers, Pep Guardiola and Paul Cook, were also involved in a confrontation in the tunnel at half-time, disagreeing sharply over the red card issued to City’s Fabian Delph on the stroke of the interval. “The dismissal gave us a massive lift,” the Latics manager said later. “It was a huge factor in the game and I thought the referee got it right.” Guardiola did not disagree afterwards, even though his reaction at the time suggested he was incensed at the decision. “It was a red card,” the City manager said. “The referee decides what he decides.” Neither manager wanted to speak about the ugly scenes on the pitch at the end, both claiming not to have seen the Agüero incident, but it seems highly likely that Wigan will face an FA charge for demonstrably failing to control their supporters and City are understood to be considering a formal complaint over their players being placed in danger. Even that is unlikely to overshadow the footballing events on the pitch, however, as Wigan knocked City out of the competition for the third time in six years. This must count as the biggest surprise of the lot, as City are so far ahead at the top of the Premier League and the hosts are now in League One. “A lot of things happened in our favour but we dug in, worked hard and some of the blocks we made were tremendous,” Cook added. “I think we earned out bit of luck, and you certainly need that against City. They are an outstanding team, great to watch and they represent football in a really good way.” His chairman, David Sharpe, added: “It was a massive result but we have to stay classy in football. I didn’t like what I was seeing there at the end of the game.” Cook, Sharpe and Wigan can now look forward to a home quarter-final against Southampton, something they had not really been considering before this result. “When the draw was made I don’t think we even texted each other about it,” he said. “It was like we weren’t in it but we certainly are now.” Guardiola was disappointed but did not try to claim the dismissal had been a decisive factor. “I don’t think it was; we played well in the second half,” he said. “We created more than enough chances to go through but in the end the result speaks for itself. We didn’t score any goals and Wigan did.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/feb/21/rejecting-the-solutrean-hypothesis-the-first-peoples-in-the-americas-were-not-from-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T12:26:11Z","webTitle":"Rejecting the Solutrean hypothesis: the first peoples in the Americas were not from Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/21/rejecting-the-solutrean-hypothesis-the-first-peoples-in-the-americas-were-not-from-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/feb/21/rejecting-the-solutrean-hypothesis-the-first-peoples-in-the-americas-were-not-from-europe","fields":{"headline":"Rejecting the Solutrean hypothesis: the first peoples in the Americas were not from Europe","bodyText":"Last month’s release of The Ice Bridge, an episode in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation series The Nature of Things has once again revived public discussion of a controversial idea about how the Americas were peopled known as the “Solutrean hypothesis”. This idea suggests a European origin for the peoples who made the Clovis tools, the first recognized stone tool tradition in the Americas. As I was one of the experts appearing on the documentary, I want to share my thoughts about it and why I see the ideas portrayed within as unsettling, unwise, and scientifically implausible. First, in addition to the scientific problems with the Solutrean hypothesis which I’ll discuss shortly, it’s important to note that it has overt political and cultural implications in denying that Native Americans are the only indigenous peoples of the continents. The notion that the ancestors of Native Americans were not the first or only people on the continent has great popularity among white nationalists, who see it as a means of denying Native Americans an ancestral claim on their land. Indeed, although this particular iteration is new, the idea behind the Solutrean hypothesis is part of a long tradition of Europeans trying to insert themselves into American prehistory; justifying colonialism by claiming that Native Americans were not capable of creating the diverse and sophisticated material culture of the Americas. Unfortunately, the producers of the documentary deliberately chose not to address this issue head-on, nor did they include any critical perspectives from indigenous peoples. While supporting the agenda of white nationalists was not the intent of the producers or of the scientists involved, it would have been appropriate for the documentary to take a stand against it, and I and many archaeologists are disappointed that they did not. Bruce Bradley and Dennis Stanford, proponents of the Solutrean hypothesis, base it on the claim that the North American Clovis stone spear points are the technological descendants of a subset of those made by the Upper Paleolithic southwestern European Solutrean peoples. Specifically they cite fact that both are made by a technique known as “overshot” flaking as evidence for their common origin. From this starting point, Bradley and Stanford propose a hyperdiffusionist scenario in which a group of Solutreans migrated across the Atlantic Ocean to North America via an “ice bridge” approximately 20,000 years before present (YBP). Although they don’t deny that the majority of Native American ancestry comes from a group of Siberians who lived in Beringia during the Last Glacial Maximum (~23,000 YBP-13,000 YBP), they claim that “great numbers” of Solutreans must also have migrated to North America. Archaeologists have taken a hard, long look at this idea and dismissed it on the basis of insufficient evidence. The mismatch between the archaeological record and the Solutrean hypothesis is so extensive that I can’t cover every problem, but here is a sample: 1. There’s a serious time gap between when the Solutreans could have crossed the Atlantic via the ice bridge (~20,000 YBP) and when Clovis tools begin to show up in the archaeological record (~13,000 YBP). This means that they would have made the points in exactly the same way for 7,000 years. Nowhere else in the Americas do we see technologies and cultures existing unchanging for that length of time. 2. There is no evidence of boat use, or tools used for making boats at Solutrean sites. Although the Ice Bridge documentary makes much of an image of a fish and an auk in a French cave, it is a bit of a stretch (to say the least!) to claim that this is sufficient to demonstrate a sophisticated seafaring culture, capable of crossing the Atlantic. The existence of a year-round “ice bridge” across the Atlantic during the Last Glacial Maximum is not supported by paleoclimate data. Instead, sea ice in the Atlantic would most likely have been seasonal, with a connection between North American and Europe only a few months out of the year. 3. The notion of overshot flaking technique as evidence of a link between Clovis and Solutrean has been challenged by many archaeologists, who think it far more plausible that the two cultures arrived at the same technology independently. As Strauss (2000) puts it, “One or two technical attributes are insufficient to establish a cultural link or long-distance interconnection.” 4. Radiocarbon dates of Clovis sites do not show a pattern one would expect if people diffused into North America from the east coast, as postulated by Stanford and Bradley. Geneticists, too, have tested the Solutrean hypothesis. If it were true, we would expect to see ancestry from non-Siberian descended populations present in the genomes of ancient Native Americans. We don’t. All contemporary and ancient Native Americans, including the only known ancient individual buried in association with Clovis tools, show descent from an ancestral population with Siberian roots. There is a very clear pattern of evolutionary history recorded in ancient genomes from Siberia, Beringia, and North America, and no evidence for trans-Atlantic gene flow. This is where the Ice Bridge documentary runs into great problems. It ignores all genomic evidence and instead relies upon an old idea that a particular mitochondrial haplogroup (a group of closely related maternal lineages) known as X shows a connection between North America and Europe. In the documentary, pediatrician/popular science writer Stephen Oppenheimer asserts that the presence of haplogroup X in an ancient North American population is a priori evidence for a European connection. The documentary makes this case persuasively with graphics and maps showing the presence of this haplogroup in both Europe and North America. But look below the surface and the entire argument falls apart. First of all, Standford, Bradley, and Oppenheimer simply assume that Solutreans would have had X because it’s seen in contemporary European populations. But in fact, the contemporary European gene pool was formed only within the last 8,000 years, and it’s unknown whether earlier peoples would have had haplogroup X in the same frequencies (or at all). No genomes from Solutren peoples have ever been sequenced, and you should always be cautious when a case is made for extending present day patterns of genetic variation into the past without direct confirmation from ancient DNA. Today, lineages of haplogroup X are found widely dispersed throughout Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America. We can reconstruct their evolutionary relationships – much like you can reconstruct a family tree – by looking at patterns of shared and derived mutations. Lineages found in the Americas, X2a and X2g, are not descended from the lineages (X2b, X2d, and X2c) found in Europe. Instead, they share a very ancient common ancestor from Eurasia, X2. (Here is a detailed discussion of the evolution of these haplogroups for anyone interested). X2a is of a comparable age to other indigenous American haplogroups (A,B,C,D), which would not be true if it was derived from a separate migration from Europe. Finally, the oldest lineage of X2a found in the Americas was recovered from the Ancient One (also known as Kennewick Man), an ancient individual dating to ~9,000 years ago and from the West Coast (not the East Coast as would be predicted from the Solutrean hypothesis). His entire genome has been sequenced and shows that he has no ancestry from European sources. There is no conceivable scenario under which Kennewick Man could have inherited just his mitochondrial genome from Solutreans but the rest of his genome from Beringians. Thus, without additional evidence, there is nothing to justify the assumption that X2a must have evolved in Europe. The Ice Bridge unfortunately relied on cherry-picking of data to support the ideas of Bradley and Stanford, and it’s not up to the standards of The Nature of Things. When I write about this issue, I frequently hear an argument along the lines of “Well, it could have happened, so maybe it did”. But science isn’t built on “could haves” and “maybes”. You must build your models based on evidence you have, not evidence you wish you had, and the Solutrean hypothesis is lacking sufficient evidence to be considered seriously.

At 10pm that night, people began to assemble at Taylor Square, with the crowd surrounding a flatbed truck with a sound system playing Meg Christian’s Ode to a Gym Teacher and Tom Robinson’s Glad to be Gay as they set off down Oxford Street to Hyde Park. Even though the street festival had a permit to “assemble and march”, the police kept forcing the truck to speed up. By the time they got to College Street, the police confiscated the truck and tried to arrest the driver and key organiser, Lance Gowland, in the first confrontation of the evening. The hyped-up crowd decided to head to Kings Cross, but soon after their arrival the police swooped in without warning, blocking exits, arresting 53 and bashing many back at Darlinghurst police station.

Hired from the Tuggerah Lakes military museum, the tank arrived on the back of a large flatbed truck. Beschi notes that when they got it off the back of the truck and started it up “it tore-up 10 yards of bitumen and the noise was thunderous, so we had to put it back on the flatbed truck and drive it and us in the parade. Later I got a bill from the council for $7,000 for road repairs to Crown Street.” It tore-up 10 yards of bitumen and the noise was thunderous The Mardi Gras Workshop was the creative heart of the parade, providing space to envision the ever-expanding creative puppets, costumes and floats that became key features of the parade during the 1980s. The workshop was established by Peter Tully (1947–1992), jeweller, costume designer, activist and founding Mardi Gras artistic director in 1982. As the inaugural artistic director (1982–86), Tully fostered a blend of witty and ironic floats, puppets and costumes, a mix which continued under later artistic directors such as David McDiarmid and Ron Smith.

This informal recovery party is now a key event for Mardi Gras, called Laneway, and is produced in association with the Beresford and Flinders Hotels.

The float profiled Aboriginal lesbian identity, and protested racism and bigotry. First Nations women’s involvement and leadership in Mardi Gras extends to its origins, with Dharug woman Chris Burke (deceased) marching in the front line of the morning protest march of 1978. This involvement continued through to the first Indigenous float in 1988, which featured Malcolm Cole as Captain Cook; key figures such as Wiradjuri woman and MG Board member Wendy Brady, who gave what is likely to be the first acknowledgement of country at a Mardi Gras festival launch in 1998; and Opera diva Deborah Cheetham who was the first Aboriginal person given the honour of chief of parade in 2006. Deborah Cheetham was the first Aboriginal person given the honour of chief of parade in 2006 Robert Tait was a key figure in a friendship group who entered floats in successive Mardi Gras parades from the mid-1980s through to the mid-2000s. One of their most successful and popular floats was the satirical The Helens, after Helen Demidenko. Demidenko was the pen name of Helen Darville, whose debut novel, The Hand that Signed the Paper, was the subject of a major Australian literary controversy in the preceding year, in which Darville falsely claimed Ukrainian ancestry as part of the basis of the book and her pseudonym. The group was a hit in the parade, throwing potatoes out into the crowd, and they featured heavily in press and broadcast coverage of the event.

The participants in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade are not all from Sydney. Many groups travel from other states to take part, including the Melbourne Marching Girls, one of a number of synchronised marching groups who have taken part over the years.

Right, Melbourne Marching Girls in the marshalling area for the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade, 2001 In October 1982, the Gay Business Association (NSW), now Sydney Gay and Lesbian Business Association (SGLBA), held its first Fair Day at Shannon Reserve, Surry Hills, to “promote the products and services of gays and lesbians, businessmen and women”. While the fair was not a financial success it proved very popular, leading to expanded fairs in 1983 and 1984. In 1985 the fair shifted dates and locations, becoming the opening event of the Mardi Gras festival at Green Park on Sunday 17 February. By 1988 the GBA fair had grown so much that it was decided that it should be taken over by Mardi Gras, which has run the highly successful event ever since. The fair now draws over 80,000 to an event featuring hundreds of community and business stalls, performances, and of course the dog show.

This group became known as the 78ers, and they have led the parade since 1998. In recent years the 78ers have used their platform to engage with current activist issues from marriage equality to the detention of asylum seekers.

And in the closing moments here it is doubtful if “Will Grigg’s on fire” has ever reverberated around this stadium with greater noise and fervour. City were on their way out of the FA Cup and once again it was Wigan – little, patronised Wigan – who had left the most expensively assembled group of players in English football history on their knees. They will cherish Will Grigg’s breakaway, 79th-minute winner here with almost as much fondness as that never-forgotten moment when Ben Watson’s header in the 2013 final gave Wigan the greatest victory of their history. Grigg is now the leading scorer in the competition with seven goals and Wigan, having already beaten Bournemouth and West Ham, have become only the second team from outside the top two divisions to knock out three top-flight clubs in one FA Cup campaign since the second world war. Southampton are next in the quarter-finals. That made it a wretched night of humiliation for City and Pep Guardiola, one imagines, will not take any consolation from the fact he had repeatedly warned everyone he did not think it possible to win four trophies in one season. City have a 16-point lead at the top of the Premier League and are virtually guaranteed a place in the Champions League quarter-finals, with the Carabao Cup final against Arsenal on Sunday. Yet their manager looked almost as frazzled at the end as Roberto Mancini had at Wembley five years ago. The only downside of a glorious night for the third-placed team in League One came after the final whistle when Sergio Agüero, swapping shirts with Chey Dunkley, was goaded and attacked by a Wigan fan before losing the plot and trying to go after the aggressor. Agüero had to be chaperoned away, with Dunkley trying to stop it getting out of hand, and when hundreds of pitch invaders started goading the away fans it was almost inevitable there would be a reaction. Police reinforcements had to be called as things quickly escalated. Missiles were thrown by both sets of fans and City’s supporters could also be seen pulling down the advertising boards to hurl them on the pitch. The Football Association is bound to investigate and it is also possible City will face disciplinary action because of the way their players crowded round the referee, Anthony Taylor, to remonstrate after Fabian Delph’s red card late in the first half. As Paul Cook, the Wigan manager, pointed out afterwards, Delph’s dismissal made a considerable difference and Taylor did not help himself by initially pulling out a yellow card. Something clearly changed his mind about the severity of Delph’s flying challenge on Max Power. It was a strange set of events, to say the least, and Delph’s team-mates were probably entitled to suspect the referee had been influenced by the reaction of the Wigan players. Guardiola insisted afterwards that he agreed with the sending-off although his reaction at half-time, when he confronted Taylor in the tunnel, and another angry outburst afterwards indicated those might not have been his true feelings. Neither he nor Cook wanted to discuss the argy-bargy in the tunnel at half-time. Yet Cook, his voice hoarse with emotion, had a nice line when he was asked to describe the nerve-shredding moments when City poured forward in search of a late equaliser. “Shut your eyes and pray,” the victorious manager explained. In many ways this was actually a greater shock than 2013 bearing in mind Wigan, now two divisions lower, had also lost their most creative player, Nick Powell, to a first-half injury. Yet even when the two sides had equal numbers City had looked strangely out of sorts inside a ground where the advertising boards promote Uncle Joe’s mint balls and Ribble Farm fruit and vegetables. City always look more vulnerable when Claudio Bravo is in goal. Danilo, selected ahead of Kyle Walker at right-back, was particularly accident-prone and Wigan must have been encouraged by the space when they did venture forward. Guardiola had given Ederson, Raheem Sterling and Nicolás Otamendi the night off, with Kevin De Bruyne restricted to a substitute’s appearance, but City still had enough mega-money signings on the pitch to have done much better. Their two centre-backs alone cost well in excess of £100m and it was noticeable that Guardiola did not defend Delph for what was a silly and risky challenge. For his troubles Delph will be suspended from Sunday’s trip to Wembley. Cook had joked beforehand that he was applying for special permission to field 14 players. As it turned out, his side had the numerical advantage through unforeseen circumstances. Wigan still had to defend for their lives and for long spells City’s 10 men still dictated the pace and tempo in the second half, with Danilo and Walker often playing as auxiliary wingers. But then the ball was aimed through the inside-left channel and Walker, a half-time substitute, did not react quickly enough. Grigg still had a lot of ground to cover before he was inside the penalty area but he took his shot early, Bravo never likes having to dive and Wigan, incredibly, had done it again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/the-bollywood-song-that-takes-me-back-to-my-london-roots","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Bollywood song that takes me back to my London roots | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/the-bollywood-song-that-takes-me-back-to-my-london-roots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/the-bollywood-song-that-takes-me-back-to-my-london-roots","fields":{"headline":"The Bollywood song that takes me back to my London roots","bodyText":"I’ve always feared that my daughters, growing up in Bristol, won’t feel any connection to my entire family back in the capital. I often find myself feeling homesick for my London family. There’s a song from the Bollywood film Queen that I play on repeat when I’m feeling homesick. It’s called London Thumakda and takes place in the opening scenes of the film, at protagonist Rani’s mehndi night. Her family crowds into a room and dances and performs for her while she has her wedding mehndi done. The rest of the film results in her being jilted, going on her honeymoon by herself and going on a voyage of self-discovery across Europe. That opening scene reminds me of every family wedding I’ve been to. It’s warm, chaotic and suffocating all at once. And the song is a joyous slice of film that brings tears to my eyes. I live in Bristol, away from my family, and so the majority of times I get to see everyone it is literally everyone, crammed into a room, performing, joking, laughing, singing and sometimes dancing. The video to the song reminds me of my own family gatherings, the times when I was present and we were together, my mother and my grandfather and my aunt were in attendance, too, we were all crammed on to two sofas, being a family, bellies full of samosas and dhal bhatt shaak rotli, Hindi songs throbbing from the television, that is always on, and everyone laughing. The bit that always breaks me in the film is when the sedentary ba is finally convinced to get up and dance with all the aunties and sisters. The look of utter abandon on her face, it could be my mum. It could be my family. My three-year-old daughter also loves the video. Occasionally she’ll request it. And when she does, it’s usually just after a FaceTime with my sister or dad, back in London. And my daughter will get that same pang of missing a significant part of her family, the same way I do. Also, because she associates London with the brown part of her family, it’s become an anchor for her. It feels significant because my biggest fear in raising my children in Bristol was that they would only ever see my family at these large and intense events, the ones with everyone jammed into a room. My children would never have the mundane pop-in, the spontaneous visit, the quiet Sunday. It would only ever be FaceTime and mass family gatherings. Lying there next to my daughter, watching the video, I get the sense that she feels the same way about the film that I do. It conjures up exactly the chaotic family atmosphere that we both miss when it’s not there and that is almost too intense to cope with when you are there. I tried so many things to ensure my children felt a connection to my family in London. I spoke to them only in Gujarati in their early days, but increasingly found myself limited by my lack of vocabulary, a failure that has come about through non-usage. I bought Gujarati alphabet books. After bath time, I sang them my favourite song from the classic film Sholay, the one about friendship. I even had my daughter giving me the brown high five where we smack together the backs of our hands instead of our palms. None of them gave her that connection as much as a YouTube video of a song from a film I saw years ago. It gives me hope that much as we try to force connections or enforce memories or patterns or language or behaviours, it’ll be the small things where my kids will find their connections to that side of my family. And it’ll be through self-discovery rather than my policing, because at the next family wedding, we will all be crammed into a room, and we’ll be performing, joking, laughing, singing and sometimes dancing – and my daughter will have that feeling of recognition, and she’ll know she’s exactly where she needs to be, and that London’s not that far away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/feb/21/new-zealand-v-australia-t20-tri-series-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T10:01:04Z","webTitle":"Australia beat New Zealand in T20 tri-series final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/feb/21/new-zealand-v-australia-t20-tri-series-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/feb/21/new-zealand-v-australia-t20-tri-series-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia beat New Zealand in T20 tri-series final – as it happened","bodyText":"An unfortunately limp end then to what has been an excellent series overall and a fabulous one for Australia. In previous matches it’s been the destructive batsmen that have earned the plaudits but tonight it was all about the bowling, fielding and captaincy. David Warner marshalled his troops superbly to restrict New Zealand to 150 after Kane Williamson won the toss, with Ashton Agar, Andrew Tye, Marcus Stoinis, Billy Stanlake and Kane Richardson all excelling in their four-over spells. Colin Munro and Martin Guptill threatened to explode with the bat for the Black Caps but once they perished only Ross Taylor got in and he never displayed the timing required to find the boundary regularly. The run-chase began smoothly with a D’Arcy Short 50 but once he and David Warner perished in quick succession, along with the surprisingly elevated Ashton Agar, the wheels threatened to come off. Despite some nervy moments Glenn Maxwell and Aaron Finch steered their side through the showers and into a position of strength should a serious downpour occur. It brings to an end an extremely satisfying five-match unbeaten series for Darren Lehmann’s side with the coach and his skipper now jetting off to South Africa to join the rest of the Test squad already in situ on their four-Test tour. The one downside of the night was yet another injury to Chris Lynn. The destructive batsman dislocated his chronically injured right shoulder early in New Zealand’s innings and looks set for another spell on the sidelines. That’s all from me for now. Thank you as always for your company. We’ll catch you next time from South Africa. The umpires have decided it’s too wet to continue. Australia win by 19 runs via the Duckworth Lewis Stern method. The groundstaff are off and the umpires are inspecting the field of play. The rain has stopped, the umpires have met with the groundstaff and the covers are coming off! That was unexpected. Eden Park is a bleak sight. The stands are almost empty, the field is sodden and a rope is being dragged around the outer. We’re now into those ludicrous calculations about Australia’s target considering the tiny window of time available to fit in the remainder of play. This is very cricket. It’s still raining in Auckland, but not as heavy as when the players dashed off. The covers remain firmly in place with the groundstaff safely under cover. Play can only continue to 10.45pm local time (8.45pm AET) which is only 20 or so minutes away. I would suggest we’re unlikely to see any more cricket in this tri-series. It is hosing it down in Auckland. The full suite of covers are coming on this time. We may be off for some time. Australia require 30 runs from 32 deliveries so they are miles ahead of Duckworth Lewis Stern calculations. 14.4 over: Australia 121-3 (Maxwell 20, Finch 18) Santner’s final over begins with a massive beamer that Finch smashes to long-on where Chapman completes one of the most brilliant pieces of in-out-jumping-over-the-rope-throwing-the-ball-to-himself-for-a-catch fielding. Spectacular stuff, wasted on a no-ball. Finch learns his lesson, clearing the same fielder by miles later in the over to make a mess of Santner’s figures. That huge straight six heralds more rain and the players are off once again. 14th over: Australia 108-3 (Maxwell 19, Finch 7) The dangerous Sodhi returns for his final over and he’s greeted by Maxwell stepping to leg and walloping him back over his head for six. Only two more runs follow as both batsmen fail to convert their forceful intent into timing. 13th over: Australia 100-3 (Maxwell 12, Finch 6) A change of pace for New Zealand as Trent Boult is brought back into the attack. It’s a terrific over from the paceman, restricting Australia to just five and almost forcing the run-out of Finch but Williamson’s shy from a brilliant sliding gather at mid-off just misses with the batsman well out of his ground. Unexpectedly, this has become an edgy exciting affair. 12th over: Australia 95-3 (Maxwell 8, Finch 5) The Munro experiment gets another over but this Victorian pair are happy just to work the ball around the field and accumulate runs safely. A rare breather of an over for all concerned. 11th over: Australia 88-3 (Maxwell 3, Finch 3) It is suddenly chaos at Eden Park. Three quick wickets, nervous running and chances left right and centre. One of those falls to Ross Taylor sprinting back with the flight at point to try and catch a sliced Maxwell drive but his dive is in vain. Maxwell has enjoyed two escapes already early in his innings. It really is game on now! After that reprieve against Sodhi Agar perishes off the bowling of Santner. The ball was thrown wide of off stump, Agar chased it, missed it and Seifert safely collected the dismissal he should have completed the previous over. Odd decision to elevate Agar and it did not pay off. Can New Zealand maintain this intensity? 10th over: Australia 83-2 (Agar 2, Maxwell 1) Australia suddenly look skittish out there. Maxwell almost offers cover a catch first ball while Agar’s like a rabbit in the headlights at the non-striker’s end. When he gets to the crease he misses a huge mow well out of his ground but Seifert can’t connect and the ball runs away for four byes. This game’s just ramped up a notch. New Zealand are working their way back into this contest and it’s the spin of Sodhi once again accounting for Warner. In truth it was a long hop that Warner tried to cut, but missed, the ball skidding on to clip the top of off stump. 9th over: Australia 77-1 (Warner 25, Agar 1) Funky from Australia, sending out Ashton Agar at number three. Is this a left-hander thing to counteract Santner? Agar spends most of his first over running as Warner works the ball into the gaps. He also had a prime view of his skipper attempting three or four shots to one Santner delivery, rejecting the switch hit, the reverse sweep and the reverse ramp before almost falling out of his crease and being stumped. A few things for Australia to think about after Short’s wicket, but still very much in the driver’s seat. 8th over: Australia 72-1 (Warner 21) Williamson going deep into his bag of tricks, calling on Colin Munro’s wobblers with Seifert up to the stumps. It starts badly with Warner finding the midwicket fence via some sloppy Boult boundary riding. Some more abysmal fielding - this time from de Grandhomme - invites Short to his half-century. But, hang on, after 11 runs and zero threat Short miscues a length lollipop, launching the ball high in the air for Chapman to snaffle an easy catch running in from long on. The experiment didn’t look pretty but it bought a crucial wicket. 7th over: Australia 61-0 (Warner 14, Short 46) Australia pick up where they left off before the rain, Warner working singles, Short finding the boundary. His drive through extra cover was uppish but too powerful for the fielder in the ring to do anything about. The players are back out in the middle of Eden Park and Mitchell Santner will restart play. Play will restart shortly, time enough to relay that Chris Lynn is back from his scan wearing a sling. It’s not clear yet what his injury is but he’s had all sorts of trouble with that right shoulder. He won’t bat tonight, that’s for sure. We’re just waiting for the groundstaff to drag a rope around the outfield. Mike Hesson was seen remonstrating with the umpires. The Black Caps coach seemed adamant there ws enough standing water on the turf to warrant the intervention. The rain has stopped. The covers are off. The players are not yet back out though. Hmmm. An unscheduled very heavy shower has just decided to settle over Eden Park. The players have come off, the covers have come on. 6th over: Australia 55-0 (Warner 13, Short 41) New Zealand look to be moving from a swing-based attack to one dominated by cutters and changes of pace. Southee tries just that but Short’s in the zone now, helping one off his pads for six over midwicket then carting one high over long on for six more. Two overs of Short brutality and Australia are cruising. 5th over: Australia 39-0 (Warner 10, Short 29) D’Arcy Short take a bow. Boult returns and overpitches twice searching for any swing on offer. Both times Short presents the full face of the bat, drilling fours back past the non-striker’s stumps. Boult adjusts his length, Short stands his ground and swats a lazy six over long-on. Super batting. 4th over: Australia 23-0 (Warner 9, Short 14) Sodhi gets a second over and it only goes for six. Four of those came in one Short carve to the cover boundary after the leggie dropped too short. This is by no means a procession from Australia yet. New Zealand bowling and fielding with plenty of intensity. 3rd over: Australia 17-0 (Warner 8, Short 9) Williamson mixing things up early, handing Southee the new ball to see if he can harness the swing Boult showed is on offer. His first three balls are all on a tight leg-stump line that don’t allow the ball any opportunity to do much. The fourth is a mistimed drive from Short that lands agonisingly in front of Williamson’s dive just inside the ring at md-off. New Zealand doing well to turn this into an arm-wrestle so far. 2nd over: Australia 11-0 (Warner 6, Short 5) Following Australia’s success with Agar earlier Ish Sodhi is into the attack early for New Zealand. D’Arcy Short doesn’t look happy about the decision to begin with, failing to read any of the first three deliveries, all wrong’uns. He finds his timing eventually though, keeping the scoreboard ticking over with a beautifully timed dab to third man. Nip and tuck start to Australia’s chase. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 6, Short 0) Trent Boult has the responsibility for taking early Australian wickets but despite finding some swing he can’t make the breakthrough. The only runs come from consecutive deliveries, first Warner shovelling a four off his hip well in front of midwicket, then driving without timing over mid-off for a couple. Australia’s run-chase is about to get underway. The tri-series title and the number one T20i ranking 151 runs away. Ross Taylor’s rearguard fight dragged New Zealand to a respectable total but Australia will feel the far happier of the two sides at the innings break. The pitch is clearly harder to get away than during Friday night’s six-fest but 150 still feels below par. Australia bowled and fielded superbly, once again marshalled brilliantly by David Warner. Ashton Agar was the pick with 3-27 from his four but only one bowler conceded more than 7.5 rpo. The major downside for Australia was the injury to Chris Lynn, the star batsman once again damaging his right shoulder. It seems unlikely he will bat. We’ll be back here with Australia’s run-chase shortly. 20th over: New Zealand 150-9 (Taylor 43, Boult 1) Trent Boult nurdles a single from the only delivery he faces, leaving Taylor the final ball. Ouch! Short from Tye, Taylor’s late on the pull shot and the last delivery of the innings crunches New Zealand’s most productive batsman on the side of his helmet. Final over and Sodhi goes bang! Like Taylor the previous over, out of nowhere finding the upper deck over long-on. Tye’s unperturbed, accepting singles from his next two deliveries before making a mess of Sodhi’s visible stumps with a straight delivery that the batsman misses. Old fashioned ‘he misses, you hit’ cricket. 19th over: New Zealand 140-8 (Taylor 42, Sodhi 6) Bosh! It’s like Friday night all over again! Full from Stoinis and Taylor sends it back from whence it came - with interest - soaring into the upper deck over the sight-screen. Where has that straight drive timing been all evening? As if to answer my question Taylor swipes and misses at three of the next five deliveries, smuggling twos from the other pair, one of which should have ended in a run-out but Tye’s throw from the deep left Carey too much work to do. 18th over: New Zealand 129-8 (Taylor 32, Sodhi 6) Richardson’s final over is a good one. his array of length deliveries, slower balls and yorkers prove too good for the now-slogging Taylor. Just two singles from it. Richardson ends with 2-30 from his four. 17th over: New Zealand 127-8 (Taylor 31, Sodhi 5) Boundary klaxon! Short and wide from Stanlake and Taylor has a slash at it. He connects, but only just beyond the diving fingertips of Head at deep gully. The rest of the over does not feel like a T20 with the field closing in around Sodhi and the giant pace bowler tearing in at the tailender. 16th over: New Zealand 120-8 (Taylor 26, Sodhi 3) Another over without a boundary, the third in a row sent down by Stoinis without one. Taylor’s running hard, turning ones into twos, but it’s just not enough to worry Australia’s formidable batting card. 15th over: New Zealand 117-8 (Taylor 25, Sodhi 1) Taylor has only found the boundary once in his 22 deliveries and again fails to find the fence during Tye’s over. After a two and a single Sodhi is exposed to Tye’s variations and the number ten doesn’t seem quite sure what’s coming his way. A couple of singles round off another over in Australia’s favour. 14th over: New Zealand 111-8 (Taylor 21, Sodhi 0) Australia continuing to turn the screw at Eden Park. It has been a consummate team performance in the field so far. Kane Richardson returns to the attack and he concedes the first boundary in an age with Southee feigning a step to leg then moving towards the offside, flicking a four through midwicket. He tries the hot-shoe shuffle next ball but mistimes a lofted drive straight to Maxwell in the deep. Always here for a good time, not a long time our Tim. 13th over: New Zealand 103-7 (Taylor 17, Southee 1) Another terrific over for Australia. All down to Ross Taylor now to guide New Zealand towards a defendable total. Stoinis back into the attack and straight into the wickets, castling Seifert with a perfectly executed yorker. This is not the innings we were anticipating after Friday’s fireworks. 12th over: New Zealand 100-6 (Taylor 15, Seifert 3) Another tight over from Agar to complete a superb spell. He finishes with 3-27 from his four overs and deserves all the acclaim that will come his way in the coming days. 11th over: New Zealand 94-6 (Taylor 11, Seifert 1) Just two runs and the wicket from that excellent Tye over. Australia well on top. It’s getting ugly for New Zealand now. Santner is the latest to go, failing to deal with a Tye short ball, edging a half-hearted pull off his glove down the leg-side. 10th over: New Zealand 92-5 (Taylor 10, Santner 0) Agar continues, becoming the first bowler to send down consecutive overs from the same end tonight. And it pays off! A tidy over eventually gets under de Grandhomme’s skin who can’t resist another lovely flighted delivery that he hoicks straight to Maxwell at cow corner. 9th over: New Zealand 85-4 (Taylor 4, de Grandhomme 9) Better from New Zealand. As well as seeing Lynn limp from the field de Grandhomme finds the midwicket boundary as 12 are gathered form Stanlake’s over. 8.1 over: New Zealand 75-4 (Taylor 3, de Grandhomme 0) Oh dear, what’s happened here? The first delivery of Stanlake’s over is bunted into the ring, Chris Lynn dives with his dodgy right shoulder across his body, lands awkwardly and then immediately collapses in agony. Australia’s medical team are immediately on the field and Lynn is quickly whisked away into the sheds. I’d say he’s unlikely to be seen again tonight. 8th over: New Zealand 73-4 (Taylor 1) Australia on fire! Taylor nurdles a single first ball, allowing Agar to catch Chapman on his front pad bang in front with a stock ball that the batsman swept all around. The LBW appeal is supported on the ground, Chapman sends it upstairs but DRS confirms Agar’s second wicket of a superb over. No boundaries from the first three deliveries of Agar’s over, then the left-armer tosses up a pearler of a delivery that has Williamson swiping across the line, missing, and watching his off-stump sway groggily in the breeze. Superb bowling. 7th over: New Zealand 68-2 (Williamson 6, Chapman 7) Marcus Stoinis should be suited to these conditions and his opening over indicates exactly that. Just five from it courtesy of some well directed length deliveries and the occasional heavy yorker. Australia will be delighted with their start. 6th over: New Zealand 63-2 (Williamson 4, Chapman 4) Terrific over from Richardson. Following that six he bagged the wicket of Munro then pinned the youngster Chapman with three dots before watching a powerful cut race away for four. Australia are profiting tonight from a slightly shorter length and a surface more responsive to the slower balls. Warner switching his bowlers every over, which means a recall for Richardson but he’s greeted by the advancing Munro slapping him over long-on for six. Oh no! Munro tries again second ball but Richardson held that one back a fraction, the batsman gets under it and skies a simple chance to Agar at mid-on. 5th over: New Zealand 53-1 (Munro 23, Williamson 4) Big innings now for Williamson. The home TV feed was explaining pre-match that the Kiwi skipper is under pressure to retain his place in the T20 side after a run of low scores and strike-rates (that one superb knock against England aside). He begins with a majestic drive through the covers for four, but that was Australia’s over. Stanlake back for his second over, clearly under instruction to bowl back of a length, and it pays off with the huge wicket of Guptill! Once again it’s the shimmy down the wicket but the attempted swipe into the sight-screen is mistimed and the toe-ender sails straight to mid-off. Excellent planning from Australia and a crucial early wicket. 4th over: New Zealand 46-0 (Guptill 20, Munro 22) Brave from David Warner, calling on Ashton Agar during the powerplay, and he gets away with it, just, conceding nine from the over despite Guptill slogging the first delivery over cow corner for six. Agar’s ability to force batsmen into uncomfortable positions has been a feature of this series and it was on display again in that over. He’s become a very canny cricketer. 3rd over: New Zealand 37-0 (Guptill 12, Munro 21) Andrew Tye’s variations are into the attack early but they don’t have the desired effect. Munro feasts on a hat-trick of fours, all glorious technical cricket shots. The first cut late to third-man, the second whipped off his hip in front of square and the third driven powerfully though extra-cover. New Zealand have made a strong, controlled start to this final. 2nd over: New Zealand 22-0 (Guptill 10, Munro 8) Kane Richardson shares the new ball and despite bowling largely wicket-to-wicket on a decent length he still goes for ten. Guptill profits from a leg-glanced four and one of those front-foot enforcer shots he plays, standing tall and driving firmly beyond the helpless mid-off. 1st over: New Zealand 12-0 (Guptill 1, Munro 7) Big Billy Stanlake TM begins with a huge wide outside off that swings with the breeze. The line is much better to the left-handed Munro who defends and then scampers a leg-bye. Guptill is also becalmed, unable to connect with a backfoot drive and then forced just to nudge a single to mid-on. However, any thoughts this would be Australia’s over are dismissed by Munro picking the ball up off his toes and depositing Stanlake into the crowd behind square leg. The six-fest is underway in earnest. Here we go. Are we in for a repeat of Friday’s fireworks? It’s Stanlake to Guptill, let’s find out... Nearing go time in Auckland. Australia’s fielders are out on the Eden Park turf in their largely black uniform with a green and yellow fade. New Zealand’s opening pair are striding towards the middle in their even blacker outfit. How much more black could it be? None, none more black. England coach Trevor Bayliss caused a bit of a stir during the week with the suggestion T20s should not be played at international level (or played less often) and England should employ a specialist T20 coach (not him). As one would expect, Vic Marks is all over it. Eden Park’s serene surface and postage stamp outfield provides an added element of excitement to this finale. When these sides met here a few days ago it was practically T-ball with sixes smashed at will to the absurdly short straight boundaries. The bowling attack that copes best with these idiosyncrasies could well prove victorious tonight. David Warner has already suggested a change of strategy, indicating he may eschew the orthodoxy of square boundary-riders in favour of protecting the sight-screens. “You might have, for the spinners, everyone on the straight boundary and make them try to hit a reverse sweep and maybe get a wicket. You’ve just got to think on your feet when you’re out there,” Warner said. “Where’s a mistimed pull shot going to go? Over the top for six? You might have one just behind the keeper”. It’s a mild and dry night in Auckland with conditions disturbed only by the stiff westerly blowing across Eden Park. Not too bad at all considering cyclone Gita has been blowing a gale elsewhere in Aotearoa. It’s been a bumper summer for Australian cricket, which means a fierce battle in store for the next round of broadcast rights. One change from when these sides met last week with Mitchell Santner’s guile returning in place of the luckless Ben Wheeler. NZ: Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, Kane Williamson (c), Mark Chapman, Ross Taylor, Colin de Grandhomme, Tim Seifert (wk), Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Trent Boult. Both skippers see the pitch playing similarly to Friday night. On close inspection Mark Richardson expects plenty of runs again although he suggests the depreciation of the grass covering means there could be less pace, more turn, and potentially the exposure of a crack or two. As expected, Australia are unchanged, which means an XI of: Warner (c), Short, Lynn, Maxwell, Finch, Stoinis, Carey (wk), Agar, Tye, Richardson, Stanlake. David Warner called incorrectly and Kane Williamson has decided to bat. Regardless of the outcome tonight this series should mark a turning point in Australia’s relationship with international T20s. The success of Big Bash League specialists in recent weeks must surely now set the template for how Australia progresses in the format in the coming years. Form and fitness permitting the biggest challenges facing Australia before hosting the next World T20 in 2020 will be finding room for all the available talent. Presumably space has to be found for Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc, augmenting what is already an extraordinary unit. The lack of a spinner who can turn the ball both ways could be considered a minor flaw, and the lower middle-order has not been extended so far in this series, but that’s nit-picking of the highest order for what has been a thoroughly successful tri-series jaunt. Good evening everybody and welcome to the T20I tri-series decider between Australia and New Zealand from Eden Park Auckland. Or as Leftfield might call it, a final hit. Tonight marks the culmination of a series that has witnessed the terrifying metamorphosis of Australia into a short-form leviathan. Once the ugly duckling of hit and giggle, Australia has belatedly learned to harness the enormous potential of its Big Bash League. Instead of leaning back on long-form stars or old-time favourites this series has proven the value of selecting in-form specialists. The rest of the cricketing world must be looking on in trepidation, fearful of the genie that has escaped from the bottle. New Zealand appear in the final despite winning only one of its group matches. There is no doubt the best of the Black Caps can match it with anyone, but there remains a drop-off in quality further down the roster. It remains to be seen how much scarring Australia’s record run-chase here last Friday caused. The first ball will be bowled around 7pm local time (5pm AET).

In a report released on Tuesday the PBO found the disability support pension will cost $4.8bn less in 2027-28 than projected because of a drop in the number of recipients after the Gillard government changed the rules. The PBO found a significant decline in the number of people claiming the pension for physical impairments, with musculoskeletal conditions down from 40% of new recipients in 2001 to 11% in 2017. Over the same period the share of new recipients with psychological conditions increased from 25% to 33%, and those with intellectual conditions from 6% to 17%. The shift is contributing to a decrease in the age of recipients, because the average age for a person gaining the disability support pension for musculoskeletal conditions is 57 compared with 48 for psychological and and 37 for intellectual conditions. People under 40 made up 28% of new recipients in 2001, which increased to 40% in 2017, mainly driven by the entry of men with psychological or intellectual conditions. In 2016-17 men under 40 with these conditions accounted for three times as many new recipients than women under 40 with the same conditions. The PBO warned that although the number of new recipients had fallen, the change in composition meant an increasing proportion were likely to stay on the payment for longer. The younger cohort with intellectual and psychological conditions “could remain on the payment for over 20 years”, it said, compared with the average of about 10 years a decade ago. “This structural change will contribute to growth in [disability support pension] expenditure over the longer term as the total number of recipients will remain larger than would otherwise have been the case.” The PBO found that growth in disability support pension expenditure averaged 8.7% between 2008 and 2012 during the global financial crisis but fell to just 0.2% a year between 2012 and 2017 due to “significant changes to assessment processes” in 2011 and 2012. Changes to assessments, to focus on ability to perform certain activities rather than relying on medical diagnoses of conditions, contributed to a shift from 63% of applicants being granted the pension from 2001 to 2011 down to 43% from 2011 to 2015. After increasing for two decades, the number of recipients fell from 2013 to 2016, with recipients as a share of the working age population down to 4.7%. The PBO said that Coalition government crackdowns in 2014 and 2015 contributed “to a lesser extent” to the declines. The PBO projected that expenditure on the disability support pension will continue to grow by 1% a year, increasing from $16.3bn in 2016-17 to $23.6bn in 2027-28. That represents a $4.8bn reduction in the projected expenditure in 2027-28 compared with the PBO projection in the 2017 budget. The most common reasons for people to stop receiving the pension are shifting to the age pension (49%) and death (24%). The PBO said that each year about 70,000 people on the disability support pension have compliance with income, assets and medical criteria assessed. Only a “small proportion” of those recipients are found ineligible, accounting for just 5% of recipients leaving in 2016-17. Most were deemed ineligible for non-medical reasons. In 2016 the Coalition announced a further 90,000 medical reviews of existing recipients over three years in the budget, and in the midyear economic update further fraud prevention through more use of data-matching. The Greens welfare spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, said the report showed a “sharp slowdown in expenditure for the DSP [which] should not be seen as a positive thing by the Turnbull government”. She said the slowdown was the result of the Abbott government reviews of DSP recipients and Labor’s changes to eligibility criteria “forcing people to prove they can’t find work for 18 months … to access the support”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/20/tuesday-briefing-brexit-wont-be-like-mad-max-says-davis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T06:32:56Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Brexit won't be like Mad Max, says Davis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/20/tuesday-briefing-brexit-wont-be-like-mad-max-says-davis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/20/tuesday-briefing-brexit-wont-be-like-mad-max-says-davis","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Brexit won't be like Mad Max, says Davis","bodyText":"Top story: ‘No Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom’ Hello – I’m Warren Murray with your executive summary of the news. Brexit will not replace the European court of justice with Thunderdome, David Davis will implicitly assure everyone today. A speech in Austria by the secretary for exiting the EU should also leave us feeling confident that after 29 March 2019, busting a deal will not mean facing the wheel. “[People] fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom, with Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction,” Davis is expected to say. “These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not history, not intention, nor interest.” Expect more post-apocalyptic film references today as Davis sets out to tackle claims that Brexiters’ agenda includes cutting back on business regulation, workers’ rights and safety, environmental protections and animal welfare. Rather, Theresa May’s government wants to oversee a race to the top in global standards, he will say. The reassurances coincide with a report that suggests minimal support for deregulation accompanying Brexit, with most people wanting to maintain or tighten standards. “Regulatory divergence is both anti-worker and anti-business, so it should be no surprise that the public don’t want it,” said Tom Kibasi, director of the IPPR thinktank. * * * Sailing cavemen – The early human species Homo erectus may have been able to speak and voyage across the sea, according to a new theory. Professor Daniel Everett, from Bentley University in Boston, says the seafaring ability could help explain how they spread from Africa to places like Crete and the Indonesian island of Flores. “They needed to be able to paddle. And if they paddled they needed to be able to say ‘paddle there’ or ‘don’t paddle.’ You need communication with symbols not just grunts,” explained Everett. Other scientists are not so sure: Chris Stringer, head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London, said: “Tsunamis could have moved early humans on rafts of vegetation.” * * * Councillor’s freebie haul – A Westminster councillor has received gifts and hospitality more than 500 times in the last three years, official figures show. Robert Davis, the council’s deputy leader, has officially declared freebies including travel to the south of France, dinners in fine restaurants and tickets to West End shows – here is the full list. Davis, who chaired the planning committee, was entertained 15 times at the expense of the Westminster Property Association, which represents major developers. Labour has accused the council’s Conservatives of being too close to developers and letting them get away with building too few affordable homes. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing, and Davis has declared his meetings were “all properly declared and open to anyone to examine”. * * * Maplin’s bad moment – Maplin is racing to avoid insolvency after struggling with losses, poor Christmas sales and the impact of Brexit. The chain of 200 electronics stores, which was founded in 1972 and employs 2,500 people, might be broken up if it cannot find a buyer this week. One interested party, according to reports, is Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which also owns Jaeger, Peacocks and Jane Norman. Maplin’s CEO, Oliver Meakin, who is stepping down, said Brexit had driven up the business’s costs by 15%: “You cannot shoulder that as a retailer.” * * * Libel or just a joke? A stand-up comedian is being sued for defamation and breach of privacy over references to her estranged husband in an Edinburgh fringe show. Louise Beamont, who performs as Louise Reay, has launched a crowdfunding appeal for her defence. Thomas Reay is seeking £30,000 in damages, plus legal costs and an injunction, Beamont says: “I believe it’s the very definition of our job to talk about our lives and social issues. So this has become a free speech issue.” Thomas Reay’s solicitors say the show identified him, revealed private information and “made very serious and inflammatory allegations of wrongdoing against him” – causing enormous distress. “It’s going to be a test of whether the British judiciary understands a joke,” said libel expert Mark Stephens. “I mean that seriously.” Winter Olympics Day 11 is under way in Pyeongchang. So far, the Canadian ice dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir have claimed gold with a clutch performance for the ages. In curling, Britain’s men’s team have beaten the flash-trousered Norwegians 10-3, while the women meet Japan. Make sure to follow our live blog because still to come is Elise Christie, who goes into the short-track speed skating 1000m heats in what is her last chance to claim a medal. And the Norwegian curlers who missed out on a bronze medal due to Russian doping want Games organisers to hold a new podium ceremony for them in Pyeongchang because they feel “robbed of their moment of glory”. Japan’s ski jump legend Noriaki Kasai, who made history by competing in his eighth Winter Games at the ripe old age of 45, says he will “definitely” be at the next Games in Beijing in 2022 – and has predicted he can win another medal.

The Olympic day isn’t quite over – there are a couple of hockey matches ongoing – but nothing remotely medallish remains to be decided. It’s been a big bag of fun. Bye! Here’s the latest on the fall-out from Russia’s curler Alexander Krushelnitsky testing positive for meldonium: Italy beat Norway 6-4 in the final curling game of the day. The top four teams qualify for the semi-finals and as it stands that is Sweden (who are already through), Canada, Great Britain and Switzerland. Japan, who play seventh-placed Korea in their last game, and the USA, who play Britain, could still go through if they win. Both those games will be played tomorrow. Mica McNeill, pilot of the British bob, has a quick chat. They remain sixth, 0.16sec from medals: This is day six on the track for us, and we haven’t had a lot of time here. We just wanted to build each run. It’s a fun track and it’s gone well so far, so we’re looking forward to carrying that into tomorrow. The bobsleigh heats are over, and Germany’s Mariama Jamanka and Lisa Buckwitz lead at the end of day one. Elana Meyers Taylor and Lauren Gibbs of the USA are 0.07sec behind them in second. A couple of completed curling results from the men’s round robin: the USA have beaten Switzerland 8-4, and Japan have prevailed over Denmark, 6-4. Italy seem to be on their way to victory over Norway in the final game of the day, leading as they do 6-3 after nine ends. A spokesperson for the Hungarian Olympic Committee has given an official reaction to the controversial performance of Elizabeth Swaney in the halfpipe, and it doesn’t sound very encouraging for Swaney’s future Olympic hopes. We, the Hungarian Olympic Committee, have to learn the lessons from this case, and we must consider rethinking our nomination procedures. We shall be doing this, with the assistance of the appropriate experts, in the near future. Aha, that’s because I’m looking at the results for the heat, and not the cumulative timings. The British are next down, and though on my television it says they beat the Canadians by 0.04sec, the official results suggest they didn’t, finishing level with the slower Canadian bob and 0.04sec behind the faster one. Then the third Canadian pair, piloted by Kaillie Humphreys, beats them all – but only just. With the fastest six from the first heat still to go, Canada are first and second in the bobsleigh. There are also a couple of hockey matches, and potential for more good news for Germany there: Switzerland’s Cody Almond was thrown out or sent off or whatever they call it in ice hockey after nine seconds. Despite that, it’s currently 1-1 after the second period. There are three curling matches ongoing, and they’re all very close to a conclusion. Switzerland, who could overtake Britain if they beat the USA, are 7-4 down and almost out of time. And it is! It’s gold for Johannes Rydzek in the large hill Nordic Combined! Riessle comes second, and Frenzel takes the bronze as Germany gobble up all the medals! Which probably makes up for It’s down to four: Riiber and the three Germans. It could be a German one-two-three! Those six, then: Norway’s Jarl Magnus Riiber, Japan’s Akito Watabe, Finland’s Eero Hirvonen, and Johannes Rydzek, Eric Frenzel and Fabian Riessle of Germany. In the Nordic Combined, then, the top six are in a group and only half of them can win a medal. Geiger has done brilliantly, but is still 16.9sec behind and won’t be able to make up that much time with only 1.5km to go. I don’t mean to bicker about the BBC, but it is beyond comprehension that they are discussing Elise Christie at length for the 43rd time today, while an actual race is happening and set for an absolutely thrilling conclusion. The women’s bobsleigh is back on! The second heat has just started, with Nigeria, slowest in heat one, the first down. Their time of 52.55 is half a second slower than their first effort. The leaders have been caught! The front six are now all together, with only a couple of seconds between them. And Geiger is now 21.7sec behind the leader! Germany’s Vinzenz Geiger, in seventh, is the name on everybody’s lips – he was a minute behind the leaders as the race started, and has halved that gap in the first half. The men’s nordic combined 10km cross-country is on! Indeed, the leaders are nearly halfway through, and Japan’s Akito Watabe leads from Norway’s Jarl Magnus Riiber by a wafer-thin 0.3sec, with Germans in third, fourth, fifth and seventh. ESPN have interviewed Marc Roberge, lead singer of the American rock band OAR, about the fact that the decision to force Russia to compete without a flag as “Olympic Athletes from Russia”, and then to abbreviate that to an acronym, has led to an unexpected boost to his outfit’s popularity. It’s been surreal, absolutely surreal. At first I thought it would be a cool coincidence, maybe somebody would mention it on TV or something. But now, every single morning I’m getting phone calls, emails, text messages. Family, friends, strangers. It’s pretty wild to think somebody is watching the Olympics and thinking about us They never say Olympic Athlete from Russia. It’s OAR over and over and over. This is the most coverage our band name has ever had. Everyone, everywhere, all around the world saying OAR. Here he is in action: The BBC has finally deigned to show that women’s 3,000m speed skating final. Absolute madness. And here’s Associated Press on the 3,000m speed skating relay final: South Korea defended its women’s Olympic short-track 3,000-meter relay title on Tuesday, overtaking China with two laps to go in the penalty-filled final. The team of Shim Suk-hee, Choi Min-jeong, Kim Ye-jin and Kim Alang crossed the finish line first after rallying from third spot late in the 27-lap race. Four years ago in Sochi, the Koreans won when they passed China on the last lap to take the lead. China finished second, but was penalised by the referees. That allowed Italy, which finished third, to move up to silver. Canada was penalised, too, moving the Netherlands onto the podium for bronze. The Dutch had won the B final in a world-record time of 4 minutes, 3.471 seconds, bettering South Korea’s mark of 4:04.222 set in November 2016 at Salt Lake City, Utah. The Canadians, with their arms on each other’s shoulders, watched the overhead video board intently. Their jaws dropped and they initially celebrated before realising they too had been penalised. Belgium bring the first bobsleigh heat to a close. The second starts in a shade under half an hour. The leaders as they stand: USA (Pilot: Elana Meyers Taylor): 51.52sec Germany (Mariama Jamanka): +0.02 USA (Jamie Greubel Poser): 0.07 Germany (Stephanie Schneider): +0.11 Canada (Kaillie Humphries): +0.20 Great Britain (Mica McNeill): +0.25 Reuters have this to say about the Biathlon: France’s Martin Fourcade gave another brilliant display of skiing and shooting to erase a big German lead and claim the Olympic gold for his team in the Olympic biathlon mixed relay on Tuesday. France’s greatest Olympian destroyed Germany’s Arnd Peiffer over the final leg to win by 20.9 seconds and collect his third gold medal of the Games and fifth overall. Norway took the silver and Italy bronze in a thrilling sprint finish. There’s no fairytale for Jamaica, though, whose time of 51.29sec makes them joint 15th, faster only than Austria and Nigeria. And they cross the line in 50.77sec, 0.25sec behind the leaders and good enough for sixth! Back to the Bobsleigh, where the time set by America’s Elana Meyers Taylor and Lauren Gibbs still hasn’t been beaten. Britain’s bob is going now. Fourcade crosses the line, with the French flag held aloft, to take gold for France in the Biathlon! Norway take second, and Windisch comes through on the final straight to take silver! Germany, having started the final leg with a massive lead, ends it in fourth! Arnd Peiffer has overtaken Italy’s Dominik Windisch in the race for Biathlon bronze. There’s nothing between them, with 500m to go. Martin Fourcard has already won gold in the men’s 12.5km pursuit, and gold in the men’s 15km mass start. This will be his third gold of this Games, and his fifth in all. Germany drop down to fourth! Peiffer has a penalty loop to run, and they might have no medal at all here! France have a 34sec lead over Norway, with Italy and Germany now fighting for bronze. The front two are back on the range in the Biathlon. Fourcade, chasing his fifth gold medal, gets five out of five and is away! Peiffer messes up again, and the French are celebrating already! A gold medal has been decided while I’ve been distracted by the Biathlon: Korea have won the Ladies’ 3,000m speed skating relay, with Italy coming second and Holland third. Fourcade has overtaken Peiffer, and now has a 2sec lead of his own. Norway and Italy are 18sec behind, battling for bronze. Peiffer misses his first target! And his second! The other three go down, though, and he sweeps up the remaining two at his second attempt. But France’s Martin Fourcade gets all five targets down at the first attempt, and as they get up and get skiing is just 6.1sec behind! Peiffer’s lead is now 24.3sec, and any wobbles on his first visit to the range could yet throw this wide open. The race for the other Biathlon medals, however, couldn’t be closer: France have a 1sec lead over Norway, who are 0.7sec ahead of Italy. Belarus are a further 15sec behind, so it looks like two of those three will take the remaining spots on the podium. The final German in the relay, Arnd Peiffer, is basically running his own race with gold – which would be his second of the Games, after the men’s 10km sprint – the glittering reward. Germany continue to lead the Biathlon relay. Erik Lesser is currently in action for them and has personal motivation for Olympic excellence; his grandfather Axel was in the East German cross country relay team in 1976 and in second place when he collided with a spectator, injuring himself and ending his race. Erik won two silver medals in 2014, and is in search of his first gold. His leg has just ended, with Germany holding a 32.6sec lead. And indeed they are immediately bettered by the Americans, Elana Meyers Taylor and Lauren Gibbs, whose run is far from perfect, but still 0.20sec better than the rest so far. The first of two German bobs go next. Kaillie Humphries, who won gold for Canada in this event in 2010 and 2014, and Phylicia George take the lead in the bobsleigh, half a second faster than the Koreans, though they are the first of the real medal contenders to go down. And they start well, powered by the former Olympic hurdler Seun Adigun, but it goes in many ways downhill from there, and they finish 0.97sec behind the Koreans, who were first down. Next up in the bob, Nigeria – Africa’s first ever Olympic bobsleigh team. Germany have taken a stonking lead in the Biathlon, 28.8 seconds ahead of Italy, with Belarus just behind in third and France a further 17 seconds back. More sport alert! The women’s bobsleigh heats are about to start. Mica McNeill and Mica Moore represent Britain, and will go 17th out of 20, just before Jamaica. Biathlon is quite a good thing, I think, though it’s easy to say that at the end of the first leg of a lengthy relay. Italy, Germany and France lead after that first leg, with the Czech Republic, in fourth place, 16 seconds behind that leading three. Lisa Vitozzi, first out for Italy, is an absolute dead-eye shot, and their lead is now a little over seven seconds. Sweden, though, have an absolute disaster: Mona Brorsson misses so many times that she’ll have to do a penalty loop. 3km into leg one of that biathlon relay, and Italy have a lead of about four and a half seconds over France, with Germany a further second or so back in third. Biathlon news! The 2x6km women + 2x7.5km men mixed relay has begun! In the men’s speed skating, Holland’s much-fancied Sjinkie Knegt has received a penalty and is out. Thankfully, he disappears without making his frustration apparent – which isn’t always guaranteed with Knegt. The Nordic Combined jumping is over, and Akita Watabe pulled out a 134m jump that, while 5m shorter than Riiber’s, was given 0.3 more points, so he will start the cross-country section with a second’s lead over Riiber, with Denifl third and then German athletes in fourth, fifth and sixth We’ve now got a bit of video to go with yesterday’s article on Elizabeth Swaney, Hungary’s unlikely Olympian: Norway’s Jarl Magnus Riiber has just outjumped him, though, landing an effort measured at 139m, and he takes a narrow lead. With the Nordic Combined ski jumping competition round about three-quarters done, Austria’s Wilhelm Denifl has jumped almost 10m further than anyone else, with 137.5m. Back to the short track speed skating, where the men’s 500m heats have now started. And in style: China’s Wu Dajing has broken the Olympic record in heat one. Elise Christie speaks: A few days ago I didn’t think I’d be getting on the ice. I did everything I could to turn this around. I have ligament damage in my ankle and putting a skate on with that is not the comfiest thing int he world. We did everything we could to turn this around and it just wasn’t meant to be. In any other competition I’d have been on the ice for five or six weeks. The only reason they gave me the choice is it’s an Olympics. The worst that can happen is I damage it more, and I may well have. To me that didn’t matter. I’ve trained all my life for this, it was everything to me. And yeah, it’s done. I don’t know. I really want to get short track out there. It’s such an amazing sport. Obviously at times it does this to you. I can say now I’ve no idea why I’ve got a yellow card. I’ve never had a yellow card in my life. I went up the inside and on the video I’m past the girl, so I’ve got no idea. Right now I’m a bit shell shocked. I’ve worked so hard to come back from this injury. I can barely bend my knee. It’s just, the only thing I can say is I can promise Britain I’ll fight back from this. I will be back for Beijing, and hopefully I can make Britain proud there. I have so much belief in the programme and myself. None of that was my physical capability. It was just, short track. What else can I say? Everyone’s been such a massive support to me, to turn this around. Everyone at home, most of them anyway. I definitely think I can come back and medal in Beijing, it’s just frustrating to have to wait four more years. It just wasn’t meant to be this time. This just in from the Press Association: Elise Christie’s Olympics dream is over after she was dramatically disqualified from her women’s 1,000m heat in Pyeongchang. The 27-year-old crashed to the ice within the opening seconds of the start but under short track rules, a crash on the first lap leads to a re-start. Despite evidently being in a lot of pain, Christie soon got back into her stride and crossed the line second, before being disqualified after bumping Holland’s Anna van Ruijven. It was a nightmare end for Christie, who had faced a race against time to be fit after suffering an ankle injury in a crash in the 1500m on Saturday. Her participation in the heats for her favoured distance was only confirmed one hour before the start, and it was evident she was still troubled by the injury as she struggled to make the start line for the re-start of her heat. It is the second consecutive Olympics in which Christie has failed to finish in her three events, after she was disqualified from all three in Sochi four years ago. Kim Boutin dominates the heat and wins it, with Japan’s Hitomi Saito pulling well clear of Gilmartin over the last couple of laps. Italy’s Cynthia Mascitto falls early in the final heat, leaving the three remaining athletes – including Britain’s Charlotte Gilmartin – to decide the top two. The seventh and penultimate heat sees Korea’s Kim Alang and Canada’s Marianna St Gelais tussle for victory, with the Korean coming out on top. Japan’s Sumire Kikuchi and America’s Lana Gehring were never really in contention. The judges are going to have a look at this one as well, though. The judges get busy at the end of that heat, too. It ends with Prosvirnova and Germany’s Anna Seidel being penalised, and Yara van Kerkhof of Holland qualifying instead of them. Honestly, you couldn’t make it up. Heat six has been blown apart by a fall early in the race, which saw three of the four athletes go down and China’s Li Jinyu skate calmly to uncontested victory. The others get up and start again, and Sofia Prosvirnova of The Nation That Must Not Be Named comes second, fully 10 seconds behind Li. That’s the last we’ll see of Elise Christie in these Olympic Games! She has been given a yellow card, and Warakomska takes her place in the quarter-finals! The official result has not yet been announced, so Christie’s qualification is not quite confirmed. She has now been physically carried from the arena, to prepare for the quarter-finals. There were a couple of bumps and touches in the race, which the judges are now examining. it’s not all over! Christie squeaks past Poland’s Magdalena Warakomska in the last couple of laps, to come second behind Holland’s Lara van Ruijven. Christie starts deliberately slowly, keeping herself out of trouble. She needs to overtake at least two of the three women in front of her, though. Heat five, then, is about to restart. She’s up, and she’s going to go again! She was clipped by the blade of Hungary’s Andrea Keszler, which tripped her. Elise Christie falls within 15m of the start, and though the race is halted she looks in too much pain to participate in any restart! Heat four was a bit of a belter, with three of the four skaters neck and neck with half a lap to go and Italy’s Arianna Fontana emerging to finish first. Valerie Maltais of Canada came second and is through, while Britain’s Kathryn Thomson was a way back in fourth. Now Elise Christie takes the ice, ready for her heat. Or as ready as she’ll ever be. Heat three has been won by Holland’s Suzanne Schulting, with Ekaterina Efremenkova of The Nation That Shall Not Be Named also qualifying, in second place. The second heat has also had a South Korean winner, in the shape of Choi Minjeong, already a gold medalist in the 1,500m. Those skating heats have started: South Korea’s Shim Sukhee won the first of them. Christie is due to go in the fifth, which is due to go at 12 minutes past whatever hour it’s at where you are (10.12am GMT, 7.12pm local time). Bong! A new hour, a new day, and this one brings the women’s 1,000m speed skating heats! Here’s Reuters on the ice dancers’ wardrobe security: Olympic ice dancers are taking extra precautions to ensure their costumes get attention for all the right reasons, using tape and glue to guarantee they stay covered up as they glide around the ice. They are trying to avoid the fate of France’s Gabriella Papadakis, who skated to an ice dancing silver medal after the clasp holding her dress together came undone at the start of her routine. “I use special glue to make sure I can actually glue my dress to my skin so luckily I haven’t had any problems,” Russian ice dancer Tiffani Zagorski told Reuters after her free dance performance at the Gangneung Ice Arena. “I’ll stick to that and make sure that I’m well glued in.” British ice dancer Penny Coomes relies on body tape and safety pins to keep her colourful costumes in place. “I am taped in. I always do that with this dress,” she said. “I think it’s just a precautionary thing because no one wants that to happen.” Papadakis said she took steps to make sure there would be no repeat of Monday’s incident, which she described as her “worst nightmare”. “Yeah, we made sure,” she said with a laugh about her preparations after winning the silver medal on Tuesday, missing out on gold by less than a point. Here’s some actual sport for you to watch! Not much of it, but beggars and choosers and all that. The Nordic Combined individual ski jumping trial round is over – the actual competition round starts in about half an hour, with the medals to be decided after the 10km cross-country bit, which is in three hours or so. No news from Elise Christie, which given that Team GB said that if she was going to withdraw she would do so by now, presumably means she isn’t going to withdraw. Those two hockey matches are still stuck at 1-0. Meanwhile, we have more live sport! The Nordic Combined individual ski jumping trial round is in progress. There are no Britons involved; France’s François Braud is in the star as I type, with a distance of 132.5m and 65 points. I think that photographs of ice hockey are particularly entertaining when placed among pictures of ice skating. Here’s a few from this morning/evening/whatever: The only sport currently ongoing is ice hockey: in the women’s classifications Switzerland are currently 1-0 up against Japan, while in the men’s play-off qualifications Slovenia are 1-0 up against Norway. Also today, a third athlete has tested positive for a banned substance: the Slovenian ice hockey player Ziga Jeglic has tested positive for fenoterol, has accepted the result and will leave the Games within 24 hours. Fenoterol is often used as an asthma medication. Here’s a story from Reuters, about the local businesses that are suffering because of the Olympics. The public are not allowed to ski on any slopes in Peongchang, even those not reserved for Olympic use: Visitors coming to Phoenix Snow Park for the Winter Olympics’ freestyle skiing and snowboarding events are being stopped in their tracks by a jarring red banner that marks the front lines in a battle between local business owners and Games organisers. “2018 Pyeongchang Olympics kill us! Keep our right to live!” The banner, written in both English and Korean, greets visitors at the entrance to the venue while another is draped across the front of dozens of shuttered ski and snowboard rental shops on the road leading to the park. The shops are closed because the slopes have been off limits to the public since Jan. 22 when the Olympics took over the site. The nearby equipment rental outlets have been hit hard by the loss of ski and snowboard revenues and the mountain will not reopen for public use until next season. The shop owners say they have received no compensation for the loss of business and many workers are now without a job during the usually profitable winter months. “There are no customers even if I have the shop open. All business is stopped,” said Bae Sang-beom, who has run a ski rental shop in Pyeongchang for seven years. “The government and Olympic organisers should have come up with ways to avoid this situation before the Olympics began but they didn’t.” Hello world! So, an Elise Christie update: she’s at “80-90% fitness”, will warm up as normal, will “reassess and make sure the ankle’s OK” and then make a call in about 40 minutes about whether she will compete in the 1,000m. OK I have to head off now and hand over to my London colleague, but here are some of the key events of today. Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada won gold in ice dance free dance Cassie Sharpe of Canada won gold in women’s ski halfpipe The USA men’s ice hockey team advanced to the quarter-finals As for what’s coming up, we have the following medal events. Biathlon: 2x6km women + 2x7.5km men mixed relay (AEDT 22:15) Nordic combined: individual Gundersen LH/10km cross-country (AEDT 23:45) Speed-skating: women’s 3000m relay (AEDT TBC) And, for some final good news for UK readers, Elise Christie WILL compete in the 1000m short-track. See you here same time tomorrow. Women’s round robin curling results are in! Our winners are: China 7-5 over Canada, Republic of Korea 9-6 over USA and Great Britain 8-6 over Japan. There’s plenty of support out there today for the women’s Jamaican bobsleigh team. Here’s one of my favourite moments to come out of this Olympics, from Jazmine Fenlantor-Victorian. The women’s heats are happening tonight, starting at 22:50 AEDT (or 20:50 local time). Some good news, Korean fans... looks like it’ll be yet another victory in the curling, this time at the expense of the USA. All our women’s round robin matches are about to finish, so we’ll have results for them all soon. Great Britain leading Japan 8-5, and China leading Canada 6-5! Earlier today we had the men’s ski halfpipe qualification. Coming in first was Aaron Blunck of the USA, with a best score of 94.40. In fact, the USA nabbed spots 1-3, with Alex Ferreira and Torin Yater-Wallace finishing second and third with 92.60 and 89.60 respectively. New Zealand then had both Byron Wells and Beau-James Wells (who, yes, are siblings) come in fifth and sixth, with 88.60 and 88.20 respectively. There are actually four Wells brothers – Jossi, Byron, Beau-James and Jackson, and all four of them have followed in father Bruce’s footstpes to become Olympic freestyle skiers (their father worked as a ski patrolman in Cardrona). Jossi finished fourth in the halfpipe at Sochi four years ago, but had to pull out of Pyeongchang with a knee injury. Jackson competed in the men’s ski slopestyle event – but missed out on the final. Good news for British fans/bad news for Japanese fans, the Brits are up 7-5 in the ninth in the women’s round robin curling. Also there’s a sport Canada might NOT win in today, with China going a further point ahead, 6-4 in the ninth. Women’s round robin curling is happening live currently, which means there are another couple of games on. Currently, Republic of Korea are leading USA 7-4 (in the eighth), and Great Britain lead Japan 6-5 (also in the eighth). These are some very tense matches! We have a VERY tight curling match happening between Canada and China currently, with China up 5-4. A Chinese miss, however, has given Canada the chance to steal in the eighth. We’ve got plenty of curling action today, with the men’s round robin session 10 over and done with earlier. Our winners were: Great Britain 10-3 Norway; Canada 8-4 Japan; Republic of Korea 8-7 Switzerland; and Sweden 7-3 Italy. Speaking of the women’s downhill, the third training session finished today, and Vonn came in fourth fastest. She recorded a time of 1:40.96, behind Ramona Siebenhofer of Austria (first with 1:40.67), Michelle Gisin of Switzerland with 1:40.87 and Nadia Fanchini of Italy with 1:40.88. This is a nice little behind the scenes look at what (and who else!) is behind a run at Olympic gold. Just before Lindsey Vonn embarks on her run in the Olympic downhill on Wednesday, a nervous 55-year-old Austrian will hand her a pair of skis that he believes will be the fastest on the mountain. Heinz Haemmerle, or “Magic Heinzi” as Vonn calls him, is the American’s service rep and in a sport that can be decided by hundredths of a second, his work in preparing her skis can be the difference between winning and losing. In the nine years the pair have been working together, it has mostly been the former as the now 33-year-old Minnesotan has become the most successful woman skier of all time. “That’s something to be proud of,” Haemmerle told Reuters in his temporary workshop, a shipping container at the bottom of the Jeongseon downhill run. “It’s worked many times and I hope it continues like that. We are trying hard, she is pushing, I am pushing, and I would say we fit perfectly together. She trusts me and I trust her and that’s how it should be. She has to concentrate on her stuff and I concentrate on mine, she has to believe in me.” Haemmerle will spend six to seven hours a day in his workshop during the Pyeongchang Olympics, carefully applying two or three layers of fluorocarbon wax to the wooden bottom of the skis and sharpening the metal edges. For all the metal brushes and waxes on his bench, a large part of his work is digesting the information provided by the wax companies, coaches and his own trips up the mountain to determine what kind of snow and temperatures can be expected. Even more important than that though, he said, was listening to Vonn. “The key factor is to talk to Lindsey, she knows exactly how she needs the edges and she talks to me, say ‘I want to have it sharper’ or whatever,” he said. “I always make it as sharp as possible anyhow because it’s easier to dull it up at the start than making it sharper.” Haemmerle brought 30 pairs of skis to Pyeongchang – Vonn uses the longer men’s skis –and he will prepare two sets for race-day before deciding which to take up in the gondola and hand over to the American at the start. Then ensues the wait of 100 or so seconds when he gets to see whether his labour bears fruit. - Reuters I have to say, I loved Elizabeth Swaney’s (lack of?) effort on the halfpipe. In case you missed it, she finished last in qualification for the women’s ski halfpipe final after completing both runs without attempting any tricks more advanced than an alley-oop (when a skier rotates 180 degrees or more in the uphill direction). Her best scores were 30.00 and 31.40 (more than 40 points behind the 12th-placed qualifier for the final). Born in the USA but competing for Hungary, Swaney defended her performance: “I didn’t qualify for the finals, so I’m really disappointed with that. But I worked really for several years to achieve this,” Swaney replied when asked about her emotions after competing at an Olympics. Do not miss the footage below: Read more: Elizabeth Swaney: the Olympic halfpipe athlete who doesn’t really do tricks There was one other ice hockey match on today, and unfortunately for our hosts, the combined Korean women’s side have lost to Sweden, 1-6. This was for the position of seventh or eighth, meaning Sweden take seventh. Oh, and in case you’re wondering, Chloe Kim has finally got herself an ice-cream. Her tweet, “could be down for some ice cream rn” (purportedly tweeted while competing) has over 35,000 likes! Legend. Anyway, team USA offered to shout her one after her gold medal performance, and are now satisfied that she splurged on some frostbites crepes. I probably would’ve gone double caramel ego, but OK. Now for something you’ll really enjoy: does anyone remember ski ballet, the long-lost winter discipline? It only appeared in the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics, respectively. Apparently the International Olympic Committee didn’t see its athletic merit. Judge for yourself! I see plenty of artistic merit in this..! Thanks to Claire Phipps for this and other tip-offs above and below, this one is particularly brilliant. Although I am infinitely skeptical about this, Benjamin Haas reports that a top North Korean sports official has said his country could co-host the Asian Winter Games in 2021 with South Korea. This was from Chang Ung, the sole North Korean member of the International Olympic Committee, and echoes the comments of Choi Moon-son. “We are considering the idea of South and North Korea jointly hosting the Asian Winter Games as one way to increase the usage of the facilities after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and of continuing inter-Korean harmony and exchange,” Choi said at a press conference, according to South Korean newspaper Hankyoreh. “We will initiate detailed preparations after the Pyeongchang Olympics.” Read more: North Korea could co-host 2021 Asian games with South, official says For all the talk of a depleted USA men’s ice hockey team (thanks to the NHL boycott), they’ve won their way through to the Olympic quarter-finals with a 5-1 win over Slovakia. Ryan Donato scored twice (for his third and fourth goals of the tournament), while Troy Terry had three assists. They will now face the Czech Republic, who went undefeated through their pool on Wednesday. Read more: USA men’s hockey team through to last eight at Olympics with Slovakia rout Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron may have almost toppled Virtue and Moir (and broken their own world record), but lots of the current talk is about Papadakis’ wardrobe malfunction. Papadakis’ costume became unhooked and slipped, and she added later that it was “kind of my worst nightmare happening at the Olympics. I told myself: ‘I don’t have a choice. I have to keep going.’ And that’s what I did. I think we can be proud of ourselves being able to deliver a great performance with that happening.” Pyeongchang has delivered plenty of wardrobe malfunctions, including when Swede Henrik Harlaut’s pants came down during his freestyle skiing slopestyle. You can catch up with all the unfortunate embarrassment here. Read more: Overexposed: Gabrielle Papadakis and Winter Olympic wardrobe malfunctions Now in keeping with less serious news, have you read this piece about Benjamin Haas meeting Kim Jong-un (well, his impersonator – known by the name of Howard - anyway)? ‘Howard’ hit the headlines last week when he attempted to gatecrash the North Korean cheerleaders at the Winter Olympics. He was also briefly detained by police after marching up to the delegation at a hockey game. And, while appearing in public as Kim Jong-un might seem like a dangerous enterprise, he apparently lives by the maxim “there’s no such thing as bad press”. So just how does an Australian come to impersonate Kim Jong-un? Apparently it all began in April 2013, one year after the real Kim became leader of North Korea. In the last five years, Howard has appeared in Hollywood commercials for cryptocurrencies, Hong Kong mobile phone games and Russian music videos. Read more: ‘Kim Jong-un is hitting on us!’: my night out with Dear Leader (sort of) How incredible is Japan’s Noriaki Kasai? He’s 45, has made history by competing in his eighth (yes, eighth!) Winter Olympics, and now he says he’ll “definitely” compete in Beijing in 2022. He hasn’t starred at Pyeongchang, helping Japan to sixth place in the team event on Monday night, but he has won ski jumping medals in 1994 and 2014 – including silver in the large hill and bronze in the team events in Sochi. “I’m not going to try, I will definitely be there,” Kasai said. “I watched the others win medals and it fired me up. I can still keep going. I am by no means finished.” Read more: Ski jumper Noriaki Kasai, 45, promises to return at 2022 Winter Olympics Now, back to the Russian curler banished for doping. No, really, I’m still not over the fact that someone bothered to dope in curling? Anyway... on a more serious note, the Norwegians who were robbed of bronze because of it are now asking for a new podium ceremony so they can celebrate their medal (if he’s found guilty). Norway’s team of Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien finished fourth in the tournament last week, having lost their bronze medal match 8-4 to the Olympic Athletes of Russia team last week. Read more: ‘Robbed of moment of glory’: Norwegian curlers want special medal ceremony Did you know that the Shibutani twins are only the second brother-sister team to win an ice dance medal? Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay are the only other two to have won, with a silver at the 1992 Albertville Games. The Shibutanis won bronze with one of their best skates of the season. “It feels like gold,” Alex said. “It’s unbelievable. I am so proud of the way we fought through this week and the season. We are so emotional.” He added: “I was really proud of how we skated today. We knew that regardless of what the result was going to be we did everything that we could and have no regrets. We are really proud of each other and the result was amazing.” They do say that the bronze medallists are always happier than the silver.. Read more: Virtue and Moir win ice dance gold for Canada as Shib Sibs take bronze for USA And the good news keeps coming for Canada, with Cassie Sharpe recording the two best runs of the ski halfpipe final. Her top score, 95.80, put her well ahead of second, France’s Marie Martinod (92.60) and Brita Sigourney of the USA (91.60). Sochi gold medallist Maddie Bowman suffered a nasty fall at the end of her third run, and required medical attention. She eventually finished in 11th place in the 12-woman final. First up, more on that ice dance free dance gold. Virtue and Moir took out their second Olympic gold in the ice dance in magnificent style on Tuesday, breaking the world record overall, as well as for the free skate (122.40), and defeating their long-term French rivals by less than a point. Gabrielle Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron had broken the overall world record just moments before with a score of 205.28, but Virtue and Moir surpassed that with 206.07 skating to “Moulin Rouge” for their final routine. Virtue and Moir retired after their silver in the Sochi Games, but have dominated the competition since – losing only once to Papadakis and Cizeron in the Grand Prix final in December last year. There’s a few medal events coming up today, which are as follows: Biathlon: 2x6km women + 2x7.5km men mixed relay (AEDT 22:15) Nordic combined: individual Gundersen LH/10km cross-country (AEDT 23:45) Speed-skating: women’s 3000m relay (AEDT TBC) I’ll also take you through the other results for the day in a moment. Hello everyone and welcome to day 11 of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. As you may have already seen with our live blog, Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir have won gold in the ice dance free dance, with an overall score of 206.07. That was just enough to surpass their rivals in Papadakis and Cizeron of France (with 205.28), while the Shibutani twins of the USA came in third with 192.59. What an incredibly tight result! Stay tuned for more updates on today’s results, as well as what’s to come.

The speech, to be delivered to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday, reportedly blasts the national energy guarantee and criticises Coalition ministers for not taking up the cause of cutting immigration. On Monday Abbott seized on comments from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, that the intake should be reviewed and will now call for a specific target of 110,000, down from the current levels of 190,000. According to extracts of the speech in the Australian and the Daily Telegraph, the former prime minister will call for the substantial reduction “at least until infrastructure, housing stock and integration has better caught up”. “It’s a basic law of economics that increasing the supply of labour depresses wages, and that increasing demand for housing boosts price,” Abbott says. Labor’s shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, says an OECD survey of academic studies found that migrants had minimal impact on housing prices and studies of the impact on wages had mixed results, with many showing migration had a positive effect. Abbott champions the figure of 110,000 because it is the long-term average during the 11 years of the Howard government, although an analysis by the parliamentary library shows the figure is weighed down by low numbers in the early years and migration had risen to 160,000 by 2006-07. He will say that despite concerns about housing affordability and wages “no one on the frontbench of government or opposition had been prepared to raise the one big contributing factor that is wholly and solely within the federal government’s control — until Peter Dutton finally said last week that immigration could be cut if it’s in our national interest”. Since 2017 Abbott has suggested a reduction as part of a “conservative manifesto” to win back Coalition voters, including those who intend to vote for One Nation, whose leader, Pauline Hanson, advocates stopping migration. “In order to win the next election, the government needs policy positions which are principled, practical and popular,” he will say. “And if they also outrage the Labor party, so much the better. Scaling back immigration acknowledges that government’s first duty is to its own citizens.” The Daily Telegraph reported that Abbott will criticise the “glib talk” of politicians and, in a veiled criticism of the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, warn that “all too often … the people charged with sorting out our difficulties don’t have to suffer them”. “It’s easy to be relaxed about green scheme-driven price hikes when you’re on a big salary,” he says. “It’s easy to dismiss street crime when you live in an upmarket suburb and don’t have to use public transport or drive long distances for work. “Hence the insiders versus outsiders chasm now bedevilling the politics of the west: a talking class that’s never had it so good; a working class that’s trying harder and harder just to keep up; and a welfare class with a strong sense of entitlement.” Abbott will reportedly criticise the national energy guarantee, claiming it sounds “wonderful” but lacks any explanation as to how it would bring down prices. He will suggest something is “fundamentally wrong” when Australia has “the world’s highest energy prices” despite large reserves of coal, gas and uranium. “Our emissions obsession has made coal taboo, so policy makers pretend that a combination of wind and gas generation can keep the lights on and prices down even though most states are making further gas production almost impossible,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/19/oxfam-apologises-to-haiti-over-sex-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-19T21:36:27Z","webTitle":"Oxfam apologises to Haiti over sex allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/19/oxfam-apologises-to-haiti-over-sex-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/19/oxfam-apologises-to-haiti-over-sex-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Oxfam apologises to Haiti over sex allegations","bodyText":"Oxfam has offered its “humblest apologies” to the Haitian government over allegations of sexual exploitation by its staff. The chief executive of Oxfam GB, Mark Goldring, and the head of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima, have also requested an “official high-level meeting” with the government. On Monday, two senior members of the charity’s leadership, Simon Ticehurst and Margalida Massot, met Haiti’s minister of planning and external cooperation to present the formal apology. The meeting was called by the minister to “begin clarifying the exact allegations and investigations” into the “abusive behaviours” of some Oxfam staff after the devastating earthquake in 2010 which killed thousands of people. Ticehurst, who is the regional director for Latin America, said: “Oxfam is grateful to the Haitian government for allowing us the chance now to offer our humblest apologies and to begin explaining ourselves and start the long road ahead of re-establishing trust and partnership, given our 40-year history with Haiti and its citizens. “We stand ready to engage with the Haitian people and have expressed our openness to cooperate as much as required with the Haitian government.” The apology was made as Oxfam finally released the findings of its investigation into the behaviour of relief workers sent to Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake, as part of efforts to draw a line under the crisis that has engulfed the charity for the past week. A copy of the 10-page report includes details of how the allegations came to light and of Oxfam’s investigative process, which included interviews with about 40 witnesses – one of whom was physically threatened and intimidated by three of the suspects after details of the investigation were leaked. Responding to the report during a visit to a school in west London, Theresa May described the behaviour uncovered as “horrific”. The prime minister told journalists: “The behaviour that we’ve now discovered was horrific. It was far below the standards that we expect for the charities and the NGOs that we’re working with. And I understand there have been further revelations today which show that actually there was physical intimidation of witnesses. This is absolutely horrific. “This is exactly the problem that we see which means that all too often people don’t feel able to come forward to report what has happened to them, the behaviour that they’ve been on the receiving end of.” The apology and release of the report follows a threat by Haiti over the weekend to revoke Oxfam’s permission to work in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/20/brexit-farming-standards-nfu-trade-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T00:01:10Z","webTitle":"Brexit must not lead to fall in farming standards, warns NFU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/20/brexit-farming-standards-nfu-trade-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/20/brexit-farming-standards-nfu-trade-eu","fields":{"headline":"Brexit must not lead to fall in farming standards, warns NFU","bodyText":"The government must not allow farming standards to slip or be undermined by bad trade deals after Brexit, the National Farmers’ Union has said in a reference to fears that food standards will be sacrificed to seal deals with the US. Those who advocate a “cheap food policy” should bear in mind the price that is paid in terms of standards, traceability of produce and shifting the environmental impact to other countries, the NFU’s president will say at the union’s annual conference where delegates and politicians including the environment secretary, Michael Gove, will meet on Tuesday. Meurig Raymond will also tell Gove that farmers “must have frictionless trade with the EU” after Brexit. He will call for clarity for the £110bn-a-year agriculture and food sector after a Commons select committee on agriculture warned that consumer prices could go up and farmers could go out of business if the country was forced to adopt World Trade Organization rules and tariffs. At the weekend, the food and rural affairs select committee said the timetable for concluding a new free trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 was “extremely ambitious”. In its latest report, the committee said the government must have contingency plans to protect consumers and business from the immediate impact of tariffs, which range from about 87% on frozen beef to about 42% on cheddar cheese and 50% on grated cheese. Gove, who is also speaking at the NFU conference, is expected to renew his pledge not to let environmental and animal welfare standards slip. He has previously said that EU subsidies will switch towards payments for public goods such as environmental protection. Gove believes leaving the EU will allow the government to put food at the heart of government strategy, so that the UK can develop its own “farm to fork” production strategy for the first time in almost 50 years. He will acknowledge that food and drink is the country’s biggest sector, and exports have risen since the referendum and subsequent fall in the pound. The aim is to open new markets and make a break with a past in which agriculture was given “insufficient weight” in government policymaking. That, he will say, was “lamentable” and a “mistake”. Leaving the EU means the country is now “free to design policies from first principles that put British farmers and consumers first”, he will say. He will also promise that the government will not allow animal welfare standards to be eroded. Farmers will be told that the government is seeking to fund a new agriculture policy that will preserve “the cultural link between farmers and the landscapes they maintain”. “The work farmers do to ensure our soils can sustain growth in the future, woods are planted to prevent flooding and provide a carbon sink and hedgerows and other habitats provide a home for wildlife should be properly paid for,” says Gove."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/19/tory-deletes-spy-tweet-about-jeremy-corbyn-after-legal-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-19T21:13:36Z","webTitle":"Tory deletes ‘spy’ tweet about Jeremy Corbyn after legal threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/19/tory-deletes-spy-tweet-about-jeremy-corbyn-after-legal-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/19/tory-deletes-spy-tweet-about-jeremy-corbyn-after-legal-threat","fields":{"headline":"Tory deletes ‘spy’ tweet about Jeremy Corbyn after legal threat","bodyText":"The Conservatives’ vice-chairman, Ben Bradley, has deleted a tweet claiming that Jeremy Corbyn had been a paid informant for Czech intelligence after the Labour leader said he would take legal action against him. Bradley tweeted on Monday that Corbyn had “sold British secrets to communist spies”. The Conservative MP for Mansfield’s account has more than 4,000 followers. Earlier, a spokesman for Corbyn, who has been subject to days of headlines after it was claimed he met a Czech spy as a backbench MP, said his lawyers would be demanding the tweet be withdrawn or Bradley would face further legal action. “Jeremy instructed solicitors to contact Ben Bradley to delete his libellous tweet or face legal action,” his spokesman said. Former Czech intelligence officer Jan Sarkocy told newspapers in recent days that he met Corbyn and recruited him as an intelligence asset, which Labour has called a “ridiculous smear”. The suggestion that Corbyn was a paid agent has been denied by the director of the Czech security service archive, Svetlana Ptacnikova, who told the BBC their files suggested Corbyn was seen as a potential contact but he was not catalogued as an informant. “Mr Corbyn was not a secret collaborator working for the Czechoslovak intelligence service,” she said. “He stayed in that basic category – and in fact he’s still described as that, as a person of interest, in the final report issued by the StB agent shortly before he [the agent] was expelled from the UK.” Labour has said: “[Corbyn] neither has nor offered any privileged information to this or any other diplomat. The former Czechoslovak agent Jan Sarkocy’s account of his meeting with Jeremy was false 30 years ago, is false now and has no credibility whatsoever.” Earlier, Theresa May also addressed the allegations about Corbyn and Czech intelligence. She said: “It’s for individual members of parliament to be accountable for their actions in the past. Where there are allegations of this sort, members of parliament should be prepared to be open and transparent.” Bradley, who won his Mansfield seat from Labour at the June general election, was appointed the Conservatives’ vice-chair in charge of youth engagement during the reshuffle in January and was forced to apologise after blogs were unearthed in which he suggested unemployed people should be given free vasectomies rather than continuing to have children they could not afford to support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/19/samcro-ballymore-cheltenham-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-19T18:32:51Z","webTitle":"Samcro odds-on after Ballymore run at Cheltenham Festival confirmed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/19/samcro-ballymore-cheltenham-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/19/samcro-ballymore-cheltenham-festival","fields":{"headline":"Samcro odds-on after Ballymore run at Cheltenham Festival confirmed","bodyText":"The most significant question mark hanging over the Cheltenham Festival’s novice hurdles was removed on Monday, when Samcro, the brilliant winner of the two-mile Deloitte Hurdle this month, was confirmed as a runner in the Ballymore Novice Hurdle over an additional five furlongs. Eddie O’Leary, the racing manager to his brother Michael’s Gigginstown Stud racing operation, told the Racing Post the decision on Samcro would not be reconsidered. “He runs in the Ballymore and that’s final,” O’Leary said. “We think he will be a nice chaser over three miles for next season so, even though he won the Deloitte over two miles, he won’t be running in the Supreme.” The Ballymore appeared to be the obvious target for Samcro, who is unbeaten in six starts for Gordon Elliott, after his win in the Grade Three Monksfield Novice Hurdle over two and a half miles in November. He showed so much speed and class in the Deloitte that the two‑mile Supreme Novice Hurdle, the first race at next month’s Festival on 13 March, suddenly became a realistic alternative. “He’s opened up a lot of doors,” Elliott said immediately afterwards. Samcro was available at even-money for the Ballymore on Monday morning but shortened to a top price of 4-5 after the race was confirmed as his target, with one bookmaker going as short as 8-13. The news Samcro will line up on the second day of the Festival is also likely to have knock-on effects elsewhere. Willie Mullins’s Getabird, who also has form at two and a half miles, is now a firm favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at 2-1 ahead of Kalashnikov and If The Cap Fits at 7-1 and 8-1 respectively. The ripples could also spread to the lineup for the three-mile Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle on the final day of the Festival, with some trainers opting to step up in trip rather than take on Elliott’s odds-on favourite in the Ballymore. Mullins’s Next Destination, a 10-1 chance for the shorter race and 7-1 favourite for the Albert Bartlett, may now be a more likely runner over the longer trip. Samcro seems certain to be the first odds-on chance for the Ballymore this century. Four favourites have won the race since 2000, including Faugheen at 6-4 in 2014 and Simonsig at 2-1 two years earlier. Beaten favourites over that time include Denman and Yanworth, who both started at 11-10, as well as the subsequent champion staying hurdler Inglis Drever, a 7-4 chance in 2002."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/feb/25/forensic-architects-eyal-weizman","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T08:00:16Z","webTitle":"Forensic Architecture: the detail behind the devilry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/25/forensic-architects-eyal-weizman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/25/forensic-architects-eyal-weizman","fields":{"headline":"Forensic Architecture: detail behind the devilry","bodyText":"In 2006 a man walked into an internet cafe in Kassel, Germany, and shot dead Halit Yozgat, a 21-year-old member of the Turkish-German family who owned it. It was the ninth in a series of racist killings by neo-Nazis, the motivation for which the police persistently refused to admit. A striking fact of Yozgat’s murder was that Andreas Temme, an intelligence agent for the state of Hessen, was in the cafe at the time, logged on to a dating website in a back room. If there’s one thing a secret agent should be able to do, you might have thought, it would be to notice a killing in the next room, but Temme claimed he did not. He took part in a police video reconstruction in which he is seen placing his payment for his internet access on the reception table, unaware of the corpse on the floor behind it. His story didn’t seem likely, but in the absence of further evidence it seemed that he would have to be taken at his word. That might have been that, were it not that Forensic Architecture investigated the case and exhibited their findings at the 2017 edition of Documenta, Kassel’s five-yearly art fair. Through creating a full-scale mock-up of the cafe interior, and analysing the sound of the two shots (loud enough, even with a silencer), the dispersal of their smoke and the sightlines of the agent – a tall man – as he put money on the table behind which the young victim was sprawled, it was demonstrated that Temme could not possibly have failed to hear, smell and see the crime. Forensic Architecture, whose work is going on show next month at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, is an agency based at Goldsmiths, University of London. The organisation’s founder and director is Eyal Weizman, a British-Israeli architect. Its primary mission is research, to “develop evidentiary systems in relation to specific cases”; in so doing, it acts as “an architectural detective agency”, working with NGOs and human rights lawyers to uncover facts that confound the stories told by police, military, states and corporations. “We think that architects need to be public figures,” says Weizman. “They should take positions, whatever they do. We map the most extreme and violent forms.” “We’re building a new sub-discipline of architecture,” he adds. “We just have to figure it out.” They use whatever means they can to reconstruct a hybrid of physical and virtual space – the metadata surrounding phone calls and phone-camera videos, meteorology, eyewitness accounts, reconstructions. They might scrape thousands of images of a bombing off social media and match them with material facts to fix facts in space and time, as if with the coordinates of a multidimensional map. They learn from ancient as well as modern methods, such as the memorising techniques of Roman orators and Elizabethan actors, when helping ex-prisoners reconstruct the monstrous and secret prison of Saydnaya in Syria. They are engaged in a game of wits with military and security services. Their arena is shaped by surveillance and data collection – factors that give rise to well-founded fears that they might be abused by power. Forensic Architecture aims to make these techniques benefit rather than harm human rights. In a world saturated by images, where seemingly almost everything is exposed to view, they try to make visible those things that are kept hidden. They prefer to call their activity “counter-forensics”, “forensics” being “the art of the police”. The material is harrowing: to see, for example, from several CCTV camera positions, the daily life of an Aleppo hospital in the seconds before it is obliterated by pro-regime forces. “You never get used to it,” says Weizman. The work is also compelling, both in the inventiveness, precision and patience of the processes and the crystalline outcomes. It might take a year to reconstruct a day, as it did with the events of Black Friday, 1 August 2014, when 2,000 Israeli bombs, missiles and shells were dropped on the city of Rafah, in the Gaza strip. But Forensic Architecture’s research into that day contributed to the cancellation of the “Hannibal Directive”, a classified policy whereby the Israeli military might kill their own soldiers if they are taken prisoner, rather than allow them to become hostages. This is not the point where most architecture students expect to end up. After studying at the Architectural Association in London, Weizman set up a practice in a conventional enough way for young architects in Tel Aviv. What changed everything was his decision to do a PhD on the ways in which town planning in the occupied territories was used to divide and suppress. “I was trying to show that there could be human rights violation by architecture and planning,” he says, “and that architects can be complicit.” Asked to contribute to an exhibit of young Israeli architects in Berlin in 2002, he presented a show on settlements, which led to the Israel Association of United Architects cancelling the exhibition and destroying the catalogues. Like much censorship, it made the name of its target, and that year Weizman managed to exhibit his work at the Israeli pavilion in the Venice architecture biennale. From there he “accelerated from the slow violence of architecture and planning” to the rapid violence of warfare and displacement. He founded Forensic Architecture in 2011, their “expertise gradually growing” since. Their areas of interest expanded beyond Israel and Palestine to wherever they might be needed: Kassel, Syria, the disappearance of students in Iguala in Mexico, a lethal factory fire in Karachi, a detention centre in Cameroon where torture and executions took place with the apparent connivance of US personnel based there. They are “on the side of civil society” and won’t take commissions from government or corporations, but don’t take political sides. Which has given them a wide range of enemies and detractors who, while not equivalent in the outrageousness of their regimes, have some attitudes in common. Forensic Architecture have been dismissed by Germany’s ruling CDU party as factually challenged artists, by Assad as Qatari stooges, by the Kremlin-backed RT TV network as supporters of Islamic State. In Israel they get called “Pallywood”, as in Palestinian Hollywood. “The bastards’ last line of defence is to call it ‘fake news’,” says Weizman. “The minute they revert to this argument is when they’ve lost all the others.” It is indeed notable that Forensic Architecture use arts venues such as Documenta and the ICA among their means of getting their messages out. This might seem a bit dilettante, in relation to the hard facts of human rights disputes and war crimes cases, but Weizman argues that the means of representation, the ways in which research is communicated to the public, are vital. The proof is in Forensic Architecture’s work, which stands up in court, gets ministers to recant their previous statements, and changes lives and, sometimes, policy. Their theoretical explorations seem to help rather than hinder the factual aspects of their work. Weizman also still considers Forensic’s activities to be a way of practising architecture, wielding the profession’s potential for synthesising the contributions of multiple other disciplines. He is quick to pay tribute to the affiliated research project Forensic Oceanography, who investigated with Forensic Architecture claims that NGOs rescuing migrants off the coast of Libya were colluding with people smugglers. Forensic Architecture’s work might require knowledge of the law or munitions, on which they collaborate with the appropriate experts. Members of the agency who are not architects include an investigative journalist, a programmer, a film-maker and a preservationist. They borrow from the speculative end of the architectural profession, with surprisingly useful results. An example is parametricism, a fad that swept through architecture schools in the first decade of this millennium, which tried to design buildings by feeding data into sophisticated software that then generated exotic but intractable forms. “As a design strategy,” says Weizman, “parametricism is futile and decorative.” Forensic Architecure instead applied its techniques to analysing the clouds caused by the bombing of Rafah. “A bomb cloud is everything a building was,” he says, “in gas form: plaster, concrete, wood, flesh. It’s horrible, horrible, devilish dust.” But you can “reconstruct its force fields out of its form”. Every cloud has a “fingerprint”, a moving one, which means you can pinpoint the place and time from which a photograph was taken from the shape of the cloud. By triangulating and coordinating all the information thus gained, Forensic Architecture could locate particularly large and lethal explosions. They could also calculate the dimensions of the bombs – and hence their weight of explosives – caught in one of the photographs before they hit. In Rafah their evidence made a convincing case that the object of the onslaught was to kill an Israeli officer who had been captured that morning, who the military believed was in an underground tunnel. That there was huge collateral damage to civilians didn’t seem to be much regretted. It was a particularly aggressive interpretation of the Hannibal Directive that was in due course cancelled or at least clarified – a triumph of which Forensic was part, although as Weizman points out one that is conditional on whatever takes the directive’s place. Clear-cut victories in this business seem to be rare – it’s still not known, for example, why Temme was in the fatal cafe and why he claimed not to have noticed the shooting. But in the constant struggle to protect truth from becoming a casualty, Forensic’s version of architecture is a powerful weapon. • Counter Investigations: Forensic Architecture, a selection of Forensic Architecture’s recent and new investigations, will be at the ICA, London, 7 March to 6 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/19/full-list-of-westminster-councillor-robert-daviss-514-freebies","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-19T21:00:05Z","webTitle":"Full list of Westminster councillor Robert Davis's 514 freebies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/19/full-list-of-westminster-councillor-robert-daviss-514-freebies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/19/full-list-of-westminster-councillor-robert-daviss-514-freebies","fields":{"headline":"Full list of Westminster councillor Robert Davis's 514 freebies","bodyText":"5 January 2015 – Dinner at The Ivy Grill, Covent Garden (Lilly Newell) 7 January 2015 – Dinner at Lady Rothermere’s Home in Grosvenor Square (Lady Rothermere) 8 January 2015 – Attended a performance of Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall (Royal Albert Hall) 9 January 2015 – Attended a reception at Fortnum &amp;

The Brexit secretary will claim that Theresa May’s government wants to oversee a race to the top in global standards, listing workers’ rights, City regulation, animal welfare and the environment as areas for potential improvement. In the latest speech in the government’s “road to Brexit” series, Davis will say: “We will continue our track record of meeting high standards after we leave the European Union. Now, I know that for one reason or another there are some people who have sought to question that these really are our intentions … these fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing – not history, not intention nor interest.” British officials highlighted a recent warning in a European commission presentation to member states relating to workplace safety standards that appeared to suggest UK workers could be at higher risk of cancer after Brexit. One slide suggested that the UK might cut “levels of occupational safety and health” leading to “higher exposure to chemicals and carcinogens”, and that workers could have their consultation rights cut to reduce delays for collective dismissals. Davis will use the speech to hit back at that suggestion, outlining UK hopes that “mutual recognition” of regulations will continue after Brexit. He will add: “They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom. With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not history, not intention, nor interest.” The minister’s attempt to reassure critics of the process for leaving the EU follow comments from Damian Green, until recently the prime minister’s de facto deputy, that could ramp up tensions over Brexit within the Conservative party. In a BBC Radio 4 documentary, he questioned the ability of some pro-Brexit colleagues to “accept evidence” of the economic risks of leaving the EU, and said the government ought to publish such analysis in full after it is produced. “I do reject all the conspiracy theories that suggest there’s some sort of plot inside the official machine to thwart the will of the people,” added Green, after a row in parliament in which high-profile Tory MPs questioned the impartiality of civil servants. Davis’s speech on standards sets out some of the key issues to be discussed by cabinet ministers at May’s Chequers away day on Thursday. The team, which includes ardent Brexiters and others who campaigned to remain, are coalescing around the idea of a system in which Britain will argue in favour of aligning with the EU in some areas but immediately diverging in others. Davis’s reassurances on continued high standards coincide with a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research that suggests minimal support for deregulation. An IPPR/Opinium poll found that more than 60% of the public want to retain or tighten the rules on vehicle fuel emissions, rising to more than 70% for renewable energy targets, the working time directive and a cap on bankers’ bonuses, and more than 80% for consumer cancellation rights. Only a tiny proportion say they would be happy to relax or remove such conditions. The report, which argues in favour of staying closer to the European model of trade rather than the US one, also warns that there are signs that the UK wants to deregulate. It highlights: the fact that the EU largely sets minimum standards not maximum ones; that many senior figures have argued strongly in favour of deregulation; and that the UK may not have the resources to keep up with changes to EU regulations after Brexit so will converge “by accident rather than design”. It also says that the UK, as a “mid-sized economy”, can only maximise its trading benefits by aligning to a larger bloc, with the EU or US being the obvious options. Tom Kibasi, the director of the IPPR, said: “Our research shows there is no appetite for deregulation post-Brexit. Regulatory divergence is both anti-worker and anti-business, so it should be no surprise that the public don’t want it. “Our proposal for the ‘shared market’, where Britain and the single market would be aligned and in a customs union, remains the best way to secure our economic interests while honouring the vote to leave.” Government officials admitted that Davis’s call for “higher standards” did not mean there would be no deregulation, suggesting that Brexit would allow the UK to regulate in a different manner. One senior EU diplomat said everyone wanted frictionless trade, and that it would arguably help if the UK adopted EU standards on a broad scale. “But even with this, this will not alter the fact that there will be a border between us. And that there will be enforcement of such a border in terms of not only tariffs, but verification that the UK actually meets the standards they need to export into the EU,” he said, also listing checks for counterfeited goods or trafficking. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, will also stress the benefits of high standards in a speech to the manufacturing industry on Tuesday, calling UK-produced goods “a kitemark of quality, innovation and world-leading technological advances”. Fox will tell business leaders at the EEF conference that there will be a “functioning trade regime on day one” after Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/20/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-hector-bellerin-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T09:04:01Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Arsenal's Héctor Bellerín to Real Madrid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/20/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-hector-bellerin-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/20/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-hector-bellerin-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Arsenal's Héctor Bellerín to Real Madrid?","bodyText":"Fed up with watching Barcelona waltz off into the distance in La Liga, the Real Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, has decided to dig out his transfer war chest and take the fight to their bitter rivals off the pitch. Not content with making eyes at Neymar, Pérez has trained his sights on another Barça old boy in Héctor Bellerín and is said to have ‘personally negotiated’ with the Arsenal right-back, according to reports in Spain. As a product of Barça’s La Masia academy, Bellerín, whose form seems to have waned as his hair has grown, was always assumed to be heading back to Catalonia when he had had enough of Arsenal Fan TV – but Pérez has other ideas and is willing to pay €40m to hit Barça where it hurts. A potential spanner in the works, though, is Lionel Messi, who has allegedly informed the Barća suits that summer signing Nelson Semedo is not of the required standard to play right-back at the Camp Nou. This transfer battle could get dirty. One man who could be leaving the Bernabéu is Marco Asensio, who is so bored of watching the BBC (we’ve all been there) he has barged into the boardroom and slapped down all the offers he has received from Premier League clubs on Pérez’s very expensive table. ‘Usame o pierdeme’ was the gist of the threat from the Mallorca-born schemer. Liverpool will apparently pay up to £131m for Asensio in the summer as they look to fill a Philippe Coutinho-sized hole in their forward line, while Chelsea and Arsenal are also keen. Asensio’s two-goal showing in Real’s 5-3 win against Real Betis on Sunday had Zinedine Zidane admitting he deserves more game time, so watch this space. Barcelona and Arsenal like the cut of Willem Geubbels’ jib and could get the talented 16-year-old striker for nothing this summer if Lyon are unable to persuade him to sign a new contract. Arsenal have made the Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly their top summer target. Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are also under consideration at the Emirates. José Mourinho is apparently so eager to prise Toni Kroos from Real Madrid he is willing to offer Paul Pogba in a exchange deal. And PSG do not want to pay Manchester United £30m for Marcos Rojo after all, thereby assuaging Mourinho’s anger, for 24 hours at least."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/narcolepsy-isnt-funny-living-with-a-sleep-disorder","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"‘Narcolepsy isn’t funny’ – living with a sleep disorder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/narcolepsy-isnt-funny-living-with-a-sleep-disorder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/narcolepsy-isnt-funny-living-with-a-sleep-disorder","fields":{"headline":"‘Narcolepsy isn’t funny’ – living with a sleep disorder","bodyText":"For a serious examination of the devastating and incurable disability that is narcolepsy, Henry Nicholls’s book, Sleepy Head, is a surprisingly funny account. There is the obvious, if somewhat cruel, humour to be found in stories of people falling asleep in surprising places: in a small boat sailing around the Farne Islands, with the freezing North Sea cascading over the gunwale; while scuba diving; on a rollercoaster; at the dentist’s; on the back of a horse; on a surfboard. But there are other extremely funny insights that Nicholls gives into the crepuscular world that narcoleptics inhabit: his laconic fretting over the etiquette of attending a CBT group for insomniacs, which he discovers he also suffers from while researching the book. “A narcoleptic attending an insomnia clinic could be seen as the height of insensitivity,” he deadpans. Then there’s the attempt to solve sleep apnoea by learning the didgeridoo. (Didgetherapy, since you ask. It involves acrylic didgeridoos and is, apparently, quite effective.) Misjudging his tone entirely, I arrive at our interview expecting a garrulous chat. I’m particularly excited that I opened Nicholls’s book thinking I was pretty special to be able to share with him the fact that my father also had narcolepsy – and close his book having realised that five of my closest family members (including myself) have had diagnosable sleep disorders ranging from sleep apnoea to night terrors to – my own thrilling self-realisation – an episode of hypnagogic hallucination and sleep paralysis. Nicholls has suffered narcolepsy for 20 years. As well as the insomnia, he also has excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis and hypnagogia, and cataplexy – in which intense emotion causes all the muscles around the body to cut out for anything from a few seconds to a minute or so. To outsiders, it looks as if the sufferer has suddenly fallen asleep. In fact, they are fully conscious. Despite his multiple disabilities, Nicholls – a science journalist and author – considers himself one of the fortunate ones. During his PhD, spent studying sand martins on the Tisza river in central Europe, he found his narcolepsy fitted in quite well with his long waits for the birds to return to their colonies. “Although I did find myself motoring into the tangled banks,” he admits. Back in mainstream society, though, it was harder to keep up appearances. Working in an open-plan office, his days would be punctuated by rushes to the loos to dose himself in revivingly cold water (“It never did more than a minute’s good”) or to snatch five minutes’ kip in a locked cubicle (“There’s a limit to how many times you can do this in a day”). The drug regime Nicholls has been on since 1995 has done a great deal to help control at least some of his disabilities. Having said that, he later admits that staying awake for the two hours that we talk caused him to sleep through his underground stop and again, while standing, on the bus back home. When I tell Nicholls about my family tree, instead of warmly greeting me as a fellow traveller, he gazes stolidly into the middle distance. “Yes,” he sighs. “I would say that’s totally average. That’s a big part of why I wrote this book. I want people to realise how usual sleep disorders are. That’s why they need to be taken seriously, because when sleep goes wrong, it almost always has a profound effect on our lives. Narcolepsy isn’t funny,” he goes on, referencing a sketch a comedian recently did on the disability. “This would be a pretty shit book if it didn’t have any humour, but when you’ve got narcolepsy, there’s not a lot that’s funny.” He warms up. “And if you’re not narcoleptic, don’t you dare make ignorant, idle jokes about a devastating disability. You’re not allowed to.” His colour rises and he tilts his face to the ceiling, tensing. “I’m getting a bit cataplexic now,” he admits through gritted teeth. There is a pause while he visibly regains control. The moment passes. “If I step back from the immediate fury, I can accept that the jokes people make about narcolepsy have a use because more people have heard of it now and know it is something to do with sleep,” he grudgingly concedes. It becomes clear to me that part of his unforgiving demeanour might not only be due to him trying to stay awake during our interview – or perhaps concern that he won’t. It’s also down to his barely latent anger over the way those with sleep disorders are still so poorly understood by the medical establishment and, frequently, ignored. Child victims almost move him to tears. “I am angry,” he agrees. “Imagine being a small child with hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis.” Hypnagogia happens on the way in or out of sleep. Sufferers sense a horrifying presence – sometimes seen, sometimes not – and an urgent terror. They also experience a pressure on their bodies, have trouble breathing or feel pain. My own experience happened when I was somewhere between eight and 13. I woke to find a skeletal cowboy, wrapped in a cloak and wielding a massive weapon, looming over me from the foot of my bed. Unable to scream or move, it remains one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. Until reading Nicholls’s book, however, I had assumed it was just a uniquely vivid nightmare. “Until very recently, it was assumed that hypnagogia only developed in adolescence,” he says. “But the medical world is now beginning to admit that very little children can get it, too. Even so, often they’re ignored when they seek help. We have no idea of numbers. But what must it be like, as a very young child, to literally see witches and demons in your bedroom every night? To feel them sitting on you, pushing you down, clawing at you?” Over the years, to hold his cataplexy at bay, Nicholls has learned to instinctively subdue his emotions. “I am very controlled unless I’m with family and friends,” he admits. “My friends regulate their behaviour around me so they don’t make me laugh. I don’t make jokes any more.” He allows me a rare moment of eye contact. I begin to smile, expecting a punchline, but he is deadly serious. He goes on: “My sleep specialist is trying to help me bring back some laughter, but I have forgotten the sorts of jokes I used to make.” Poignantly, he quietly adds: “I am, however, capable of love.” Here, Nicholls has also been fortunate. He’s been with his partner, Charlotte, for longer than he’s had narcolepsy. “Just as a sleep disorder evolves over many years, so a strong relationship evolves and adapts,” he says. “I really am atypical in this regard, though, for many people with sleep disorders the impact on their relationships can be devastating.” The couple have two young sons and thankfully, narcolepsy doesn’t seem to be genetic. “As there are many triggers for narcolepsy, a constellation of unfortunate events that come together, it only rarely runs in families,” he says. Nicholls hopes his book will be a clarion call, a step towards bringing sleep into the same space of public health as exercise and diet. “It underpins absolutely everything,” he says. “You can’t name one health disorder that wouldn’t be improved by good sleep.” An extract from Sleepy Head by Henry Nicholls “How is your necrophilia?” My friend was asking after my narcolepsy, a seriously disabling neurological condition that I have lived with now for more than half my life. “It’s still an issue,” I replied. “Thanks for asking.” “Narcolepsy,” roughly translated from ancient Greek, means “an attack of sleep”, a reference to its key symptom of excessive daytime sleepiness. The passing resemblance of the word “narcolepsy” to “necrophilia” and “nymphomania” can result in some awkward conversations. I was 21 and halfway through my second year at university when I experienced my first symptoms. Within an hour of waking, it felt as if a smog were seeping into my brain and anaesthetising my faculties until I was left with no option but sleep. I tried to fight it for a while – going to lectures, tutorials, running the college bar – but the constant struggle to prevent myself from drowning was almost worse. I came up with little tricks that would hold off sleep for a minute or two, pinching myself, running violently on the spot, shouting at the top of my voice. But the feeling would soon begin to creep up on me all over again. I could battle like this for tens of minutes, convinced I was managing to take in a book, watch a film or even chat with friends, only to find I had no recollection of what had just happened. Had I been asleep, or hadn’t I? I began to confront the fact that I couldn’t function in a meaningful way. I struggled through my degree, dribbling over lecture notes and dozing through tutorials. It felt like for ever at the time, but I only had to battle for 18 months until a diagnosis. The longest recorded wait from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is a remarkable 67 years. This makes me one of the lucky ones.

He was rector of Warblington with Emsworth in Hampshire for 32 years, but his influence was felt much further afield. A regular letter writer to the Guardian and a BBC religious broadcaster, David gained a national profile by his decision after the sinking of the Belgrano in 1982 to pray for the families on both sides and resign from his position as chaplain to the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth. From then on, he committed himself to peace campaigns and especially to Clergy Against Nuclear Arms. An erudite man, reading and writing in Latin and Greek into his last year, he was also a man of parables, as is most obvious in his book, The Green Seagull (1995), dedicated to those who “find themselves square pegs in round holes or round pegs in square ones”. He was always reaching out to those who felt on the outside and inviting them in and so naturally supported controversial causes such as that of the Vietnamese refugees on Thorney Island, the Corrymeela project in Northern Ireland or a mosque’s request to broadcast the call to prayer in Oxford. His courage to stay true to his convictions even under fire has been noted by friends and foes alike. Son of John Partridge, a businessman, and his wife, Madeleine, David was born and went to school in Bristol, did national service in the Royal Marines and studied history at Balliol College, Oxford, in the late 1950s. He then did his theological training at Westcott House in Cambridge. He married Susan Cooper in 1961 and entered the ministry the next year as a curate in Bolton. In 1965, he moved to St Martin-in-the-Fields to work under his mentor, Austen Williams. In Hampshire, he served as a canon of Portsmouth Cathedral and was a pillar of the Portsmouth Housing Association. Although he was nicknamed the Whirlwind Vicar for his habit of arriving “just in time” at the crematorium, his pastoring was never rushed. After his retirement in 2001, he became active in interfaith work in Oxford, which included the creation of the Oxford Council of Faiths. His legacy lives on in the peace plaque in Bonn Square unveiled on UN Peace Day 2010 and in the annual Oxford Interfaith Walk. David is survived by Sue, and their three sons, Andrew, Jeremy and Edward, six grandchildren, and by his sisters, Clare and Alison, and me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/my-life-in-sex-man-always-gives-orgasm","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T10:00:35Z","webTitle":"My life in sex: the man who always gives an orgasm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/my-life-in-sex-man-always-gives-orgasm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/my-life-in-sex-man-always-gives-orgasm","fields":{"headline":"My life in sex: the man who always gives an orgasm","bodyText":"I’ve never asked, “How was that for you?” because, frankly, I haven’t needed to. I’m 49 and have been good at giving women orgasms since I started having sex; it’s something I can do on demand, either orally (never fails) or, to a slightly lesser extent, with penetration. I learned from reading pornographic magazines with a high lesbian sex content when I was a teenager. It’s all about getting very familiar with my partner’s anatomy and reading how she’s reacting to my touch. It’s not rocket science. How do I know my partners have never faked an orgasm? I don’t suppose I do with 100% certainty – but they’ve all displayed a few seconds of what I can only describe as total paralysis. There’s also an extreme sensitivity of the clitoris and sometimes nipples immediately afterwards. My current partner starts helplessly chuckling to herself. I haven’t experienced that before, but at least she’s consistent. I read a lot about men who are lousy lovers, often because they are only interested in their own gratification; is it so prevalent? If so, I feel sorry for them, and for their partners. Making a woman squirm with an orgasm or two gives me such a high (not to mention an ego boost). I don’t know if women generally have detailed conversations about their sex lives, but I do know that previous girlfriends have told their friends about my performance. Once, during a relationship counselling session, the therapist asked my now ex-wife whether bad sex was ever an issue.

England, against all the odds, have just beaten Australia in the World Cup quarter-finals and down in the Vieux Port area of Marseille a monumental party is brewing. Even before France’s tournament-shaping game against New Zealand in Cardiff kicks off the harbourside vibe makes Twickenham feel like a suburban vicarage. So bienvenue with knobs on to Marseille as the Six Nations’s newest host city. Whether this Friday night’s contest between France and Italy in the 67,000-capacity Stade Vélodrome will induce a similar frisson of excitement is debatable but it does raise a key question: how big a part do stadiums play in the tournament’s allure? Does rotating the scenery every now and again enhance the production or nibble away at its soul? Make no mistake, the Six Nations committee will be monitoring France’s first championship foray outside Paris with interest. No one would argue a big weekend in Cardiff or Dublin or Edinburgh has lost its lustre. Ask anyone lucky enough to be in Rome a fortnight ago for England’s visit and they will tell you the game was almost an incidental feature. It may well be similar in Scotland on Saturday by the time out-of-towners have taken the morning air in Princes Street Gardens, met old friends for a coffee in Stockbridge, strolled to Murrayfield beside the Water of Leith and stumbled back into Bert’s Bar or the Cafe Royal for the evening. Test rugby’s founding fathers were clever. They knew the value of a grand backdrop. At the same time, though, Europe is blessed with numerous great, culturally enriching cities. Everyone loves a weekend in Paris but the French federation rightly feels an obligation to promote the international game up and down the country. Italy have already played the All Blacks at the San Siro in Milan and would capture a few more imaginations if they took a championship game there. What about Scotland playing at Celtic Park, which rocked during the Commonwealth Games sevens, or Hampden Park? When Ireland played at Croke Park – albeit just down the road – while the Aviva Stadium was being rebuilt, the atmosphere was off the scale. Money plays a significant role but maybe it should be a mandatory component of future Six Nations contracts that each competing nation has to stage at least one game away from its traditional roster of venues every six years. That way even England would be forced to venture outside their London moneypit to, say, Manchester or Newcastle and take a big game to rugby lovers otherwise disenfranchised by geography and, in some cases, history. Belfast, Limerick, Cork, Swansea, Llanelli, Newport, Glasgow, Leeds, Birkenhead, Gloucester, Bristol and Leicester have all staged championship games in the dim and distant past, so a precedent exists. Maybe, one day, there will be other tantalising trips on offer to Tbilisi – where the wine and exchange rate should soon sway any floating voters – Barcelona or Madrid. Spain’s weekend win over Romania, as it happens, has left them increasingly well placed to qualify automatically for the 2019 World Cup, heaping further pressure on those who see no logical reason why the Six Nations should bother to reflect the changing rugby world beyond it. Pending that great leap forwards this feels a good moment, either way, to draw up a blueprint for the perfect Six Nations experience. Without question the anthems would be sung in Cardiff and the actual game played in the Principality Stadium; there is nothing quite like it for raising neck hairs, although Croke Park came close. Game-day morning would be spent promenading around Edinburgh before a leisurely lunch in one of Rome’s magnificent piazzas; London or Paris, depending on your architectural preference and/or relationship status, offer all the necessary ingredients for a gloriously lazy post-match Sunday mooch. Which just leaves Friday and Saturday nights. There are few better places on earth to drink in the atmosphere than Dublin, though Edinburgh is a close second. And the third podium contender? Step forward, in my experience, Marseille. As a base – make that a bouillabaisse – for a fabulous rugby weekend it takes a lot of beating. All it needs is 80 minutes of rugby to match on Friday. Wild rovers keep rolling Any retired players struggling to fill the void left by rugby should draw inspiration from a couple of lock forwards who continue to be gluttons for punishment. Damian Browne’s staggering recent achievement – rowing 3,000 miles single-handed across the Atlantic without a support vessel, surviving two capsizes in one day and narrowly missing a cargo ship – will take some beating but there are few worthier expeditions than the trek to the North Pole about to be undertaken by the former Australia and Exeter second-row Dean Mumm. The Wallaby is walking to the pole to raise funds and awareness for a charity researching premature childbirth. Gatland joins Henry in the 100 club Warren Gatland’s 100th Test as Wales’s coach on Saturday puts him in lofty company; only Graham Henry has chalked up a century in charge of one country. If Wales succeed in outwitting Joe Schmidt’s Ireland – unbeaten at home in the Six Nations since 2013 – in Dublin it will rank among the New Zealander’s finer tactical ambushes and alter the complexion of the championship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/wines-from-mountain-vineyards-david-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Wines with altitude | David Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/wines-from-mountain-vineyards-david-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/25/wines-from-mountain-vineyards-david-williams","fields":{"headline":"Wines with altitude","bodyText":"Lupin Roussette de Frangy, Savoie, France 2016 (from £13.95, Buonvino; Bybo; Joseph Barnes Wines) It may be the suggestive power of all the winter sport on TV at the moment, but the term “mountain wines” has been cropping up with increasing frequency in wine merchant marketing and tasting notes this winter. What does it mean? Well wines from mountainous regions, obviously, although curiously it’s not a phrase that people tend to use for wines from the most famously vertiginous wine producing country, Argentina. Indeed, as Wink Lorch, a specialist in this kind of wine, explains in a typically thoughtful blog at her Wine Travel Media, “mountain wines” needn’t come from high altitude; it’s more of a catch-all term for wines grown on steep slopes in mountainous areas that tend to share a certain freshness, raciness and purity. Lupin’s dry white from the French Alpine region of Savoie certainly has those qualities, deliciously presented with fresh fruit and Toblerone-esque honeyed almond. John and Mike Favre Petite Arvine de Chamoson, Valais, Switzerland 2015 (from £17.40, Kwoff; Weavers Wines; Bottle Apostle) Switzerland is another source of mountain wines, although in this case “Alpine wines” gives the same sense of their pristine appeal – as well as being the name of the merchant that has done more than anyone to bring these very distinctive and often very high quality wines to the UK. That other British merchants haven’t gone in for Swiss wines in the past is down to price: they’re expensive, in part because of the high production costs on precipitous vineyards, in part because demand for them back home is high. The best are worth it, however, with the local white variety petite arvine a genuine hidden treasure combining that Alpine-stream freshness with peachy opulence in wines such as Domaine des Muses Petite Arvine Tradition, Valais 2013 (from £30, The Wine Society; Alpine Wines) and Favre’s Petite Arvine. Cantina Terlan Terlaner Classico 2016 (from £17.95, Field and Fawcett; Butlers Wine Cellar; Handfords; Highburgy Vintners) Italy’s finest mountain wines – indeed some of its finest white wines of any kind — are, unusually, the work of a co-operative, whose various wine growing members have their vineyards planted on steep south-facing slopes at altitudes of up to 1,000m in the foothills of the Dolomites in the far northern, Austrian-influenced part of the country known as Alto-Adige. Cantina Terlano has been going for more than 100 years now, making wines that can astonish with their ability to age, and which, when compared to white wines of similar quality not just in Italy but anywhere in the world, are remarkably fairly priced. Certainly there’s a lot going on in their Classico white blend of pinot bianco, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc: tangy exotic fruit, gentle blossomy scents, and a certain smokiness, not to mention that classic crystal-clear, mountain wine freshness.

Christian was an exceptional man who had the rare quality of being able to live in the moment. A lifelong Stoke City football fan, he was also a born optimist. It was his curiosity and interest in people and the world around him that drew him to journalism. Born and raised in Stafford, Christian was the eldest of three children of Dennis, a civil engineer, and Maureen, a legal secretary. He studied accountancy and opted to become a primary school teacher in south-east London before his appetite for adventure led to a teaching post in an international school in Moscow. After that, he went to Germany to work behind a bar, then to Paris, where he taught English and played in a country rock band, Paris Texas. Two years later, he returned to the UK and trained as a journalist. In this role he was widely regarded as conscientious, thorough, fair, tenacious, probing, and keen to bring new voices to the fore. Colleagues testify to someone who could offer a fresh take on a story. Christian always took matters in his stride, such as the time he secured an interview with a Labour cabinet minister, which involved buying a first-class ticket to join the minister on a train journey from London to Liverpool. Christian arrived for what he believed to be an in-depth interview but it was already long over by the time the train had reached Watford Junction: aides had given him four minutes of the minister’s time. Unfazed, Christian filed the news feature as planned, using his ample writing skills to produce an engaging narrative of the short-lived exchange. He spent three years on the Harrow Observer, and six on Nursing Standard magazine, before freelancing for a range of national newspapers and magazines. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2010, he co-founded a band, the Billionaires, which played in pubs and at events. He played the piano and guitar and shared lead vocals. In his spare time he wrote songs, which he performed for a songwriters’ collective. Each month, contributors voted for the best of the bunch: Christian won more times than anyone else. He loved anything quirky and was a longstanding Laurel and Hardy fan. He was very popular, blessed with an offbeat sense of humour; just two days before his death, greatly weakened, he was still able to tell a joke in such a way that made you laugh out loud. Christian looked outward, playing football, reporting, and rehearsing with the band whenever his health allowed. He was a true friend: fun, compassionate, kind, and he took people as he found them. He is survived by his mother, his brother, Patrick, and sister, Alyson, and two nieces."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/feb/25/naples-elena-ferrante-brilliant-city-travel","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Naples: Elena Ferrante’s brilliant city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/25/naples-elena-ferrante-brilliant-city-travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/25/naples-elena-ferrante-brilliant-city-travel","fields":{"headline":"Naples: Elena Ferrante’s brilliant city","bodyText":"Like many tourists in Naples, I have only ever been there en route to somewhere else. For years the city has had a reputation for being dirty, dangerous and traffic-choked: why on earth would anyone choose to linger? But this has changed. Naples is becoming a destination in its own right, thanks in part to the huge popularity of the enigmatic author Elena Ferrante. And with the city’s rubbish-collection problem solved and new traffic restrictions in the centre, it is looking in better shape than it has done for decades. Ferrante, who writes under a pseudonym, is the most important literary sensation to have emerged from Italy in a generation. Her quartet of Neapolitan Novels has sold more than 5.5 million copies worldwide. The New York Times observed that enthusiasm for the novels is so intense that it is being described in “epidemiological terms, making the phenomenon sound almost like an infectious disease”. Nor is Ferrante fever likely to cool any time soon: an Italian/American television adaptation of the first book My Brilliant Friend is under way. Filming starts in Naples next spring. The ultimate aim is to adapt all four novels over 32 episodes. I came late to the books, prompted to pick up the first volume by the outrage around Italian reporter Claudio Gatti’s controversial unmasking of Ferrante’s supposed true identity. Needless to say, I loved My Brilliant Friend and devoured the next three, gripped by Ferrante’s rich portrait of the hard lives and intense friendship of the two protagonists – Elena and Raffaella (who call each other Lenù and Lila) – who grow up in a poor, violent neighbourhood against a background of mafia vendettas and social and political unrest in the 1960s and 70s. Naples is as much a character in Ferrante’s writing as Lenù and Lila themselves. Her “dark streets full of dangers, unregulated traffic, broken pavements, giant puddles … clogged sewers” work their way deep into your imagination. So you finish the Neapolitan novels not only with a sigh of regret, but an insistent desire to get to know the city for yourself. “People began asking hotels and tour operators in the area: ‘How can we find the locations in the novels?’” says Caterina dei Vivo of Progetto Museo, a Naples-based cultural heritage preservation group. “They wanted to see the stradone, the Vomero, the Rettifilo, the Corso Umberto.” Progetto Museo quickly launched a Ferrante tour of the city earlier this year and several others have jumped on board since then. I decided to combine my tour with a few nights in Sorrento. A picturesque tumble of dark red villas and ochre hotels perched on the edge of the Bay of Naples, the town works as a base not only for visits to the city – about 50 minutes away by boat, or an hour by train – but for the Amalfi coastal path (the “pathway of the gods”), Campania’s hillside towns and the islands of Capri and Ischia, too. Pompeii and Heculaneum are an easy train ride away. I was met off the boat from Sorrento by the impressively qualified Caterina, a Neapolitan with a PhD in the preservation of cultural heritage. Along with the two others in our group, I was keen to visit the working-class neighbourhood where Lenù and Lila grow up: the Rione Luzzatti in the south of the city. Frustratingly, Caterina won’t take us there. Now mainly social housing, it has a reputation for crime and is apparently “too sad and depressing” for us. Instead, we set off into the old city where our first stop was Corso Umberto, known locally as the Rettifilo. This is the main street connecting the rione [administrative district] with the city, where Lenù and Lila first start going out alone with friends – with disastrous consequences one night when the Solara brothers pick a vicious fight with some obnoxious private school boys. It is also home to the bridal shops visited by 16-year-old Lila as she prepared for her lavish wedding to Stefano Carracci. Every window is awash with frothy white lace and rainbow-coloured bridesmaids’ dresses. We turn left into the university district where Lenù found her first job in a bookshop and Nino, the love of her life, worked as a leftwing lecturer. As in the books, the lecture theatres are daubed with radical slogans – a “lotta dura” [a 60s political slogan, now more associated with football] here, a hammer and sickle there and students hand out revolutionary flyers to passersby. Next stop is Via dei Tribunale, where Lenù attended political meetings with her friends in the Red Brigades. We stop at a traditional pastry shop like the one run by the Solara brothers in the novels for a coffee and a sfogliatella, a shell-shaped pastry which originated in Naples, filled with vanilla, cinnamon and orange-flavoured ricotta. The city centre feels wonderfully unmodernised, its dark, narrow streets dripping with faded laundry, lucky bunches of dried red chillies outside every house and shop front. Walls are buried beneath layers of posters, stickers, graffiti and grime. Scooters zoom past, horns blare and truck brakes hiss. I’m struck by the absence of chains, such as Starbucks and McDonald’s. Caterina says the multinationals know they cannot compete with the street food of Naples: fried pizza, potato croquettes, courgette flowers in batter, fried anchovies and fried mozzarella are sold on every corner in brown paper cones – cuoppo – for just a few euros apiece. Pungent Neapolitan coffee likewise. East of the dead-straight Spaccanapoli which bisects the city centre, giving away its Roman heritage, the streets widen out and the Via Toledo, one of the city’s main shopping streets, leads us out of old Naples. This is where the Solara brothers paraded in their Fiat 1100 during the evening passeggiata in My Brilliant Friend. It runs past the elegant glass dome of the 19th-century Galleria Umberto – where Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf strolled in The Talented Mr Ripley – into the Piazza Trieste e Trento, home of the San Carlo opera house and the Gran Caffè Gambrinus, a Naples institution founded in 1860, which Lenù and her daughters visit with Gigliola in The Story of The Lost Child. The imposing national library, where she researched the city’s history towards the end of the book, is in the same piazza. From there it is a short walk along the well-heeled Via Chiaia to the elegant Piazza dei Martiri, home to the Solara brothers’ shoe shop, where Lila hung a giant, disfigured wedding photograph of herself in her wedding gown and later conducted an affair with Nino. Staring into the windows of the handsome Salvatore Ferragamo store, you can imagine seeing Lila behind the till, or maybe it’s Alfonso, her closeted gay friend. The city opens up here to the sea and you become aware that you haven’t glimpsed the Mediterranean since morning. As Lenù often reflects, Old Naples keeps its back to the water, brooding and looking inward. From the Villa Comunale, one of the city’s few green spaces, you can gaze towards Via Tasso, where Lenù rented an apartment while she was with Nino, and also fashionable Vomero, where a teenage Lenù attended an elegant party thrown by her professor and was amazed by her first insight into another, bourgeois world. We returned to Sorrento exhilarated and completely sold on the concept of getting to know a new place through its literary characters. Where next? Dave Eggers’s San Francisco? Marlon James’s Jamaica?

At 15, she watched on as her mother captained the Brothers Holy Spirit side in Brisbane. Weekend sport was a family affair: one of her aunties was also the coach of the Brothers, while Aunty Mary played for the opposition. This particular week, her mum’s side were short on numbers, so Elianna stepped up to fill in. As soon as she was subbed onto the ground, someone made a quick break down the sidelines. “I chased like 70m and saved the try – in my first ever game, and right on the line too,” she tells Guardian Australia in the buildup to Friday’s inaugural women’s State of Origin match at North Sydney. “Then I got up and realised it was my Aunty Mary I had tackled!” Walton can’t stop laughing as she recalls the aftermath. “She was feisty as – I remember she pushed me and said: ‘you little brat, I almost scored a try!’ So I was like, ‘not today, Aunty!’ She still remembers that, too, she says it would’ve been her first try.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Seemingly, Walton had no choice when it came to rugby. Her mum, she says, was a highly-skilled player back home in New Zealand, even making the training squad for Auckland, but with seven kids, she never had the opportunity (or the pathways) to pursue representative sport. Now, all seven of her children play, with two of Walton’s sisters representing the Cook Islands at the recent World Cup, while Walton suited up for the Jillaroos. “I’m Samoan Cook Islander,” says Walton. “They [Cook Islands] did ask me about my allegiance for the World Cup, but I’ve been a Jillaroo since 2008 and had already started training with them. I actually coached the team that got Cook Islands into the World Cup, so I pushed hard to open the door and provide that opportunity for them. Thankfully my family were supportive of the decision to stick with the Jillaroos.” Now, over a career spanning 10 years, Walton has 14 Jillaroos caps and has made nine appearances for New South Wales – the most of any NSW women’s rugby league player. Friday night’s Origin game against Queensland will make it 10 – a milestone she’s very proud of. All being well, her mother will fly over to cheer her on, while her husband, daughter and son will also be there – the latter of whom she has coached during his junior career, in keeping with family tradition. Friday night marks not only a milestone for Walton, but the women’s game in general. It is the first time the interstate representative game has been labelled State of Origin – previously having been known as the Interstate Challenge. Walton says the shift is a strange one for her, given she’s always thought of the game as State of Origin, but she can appreciate what the shift does for the profile of women’s rugby league. “I’ve only ever said it was State of Origin, whether it was [called] Interstate Challenge or not,” she says. “I’ve always taken it as that – but having the title just makes it complete – it makes us worthy of being in that same calibre as the men.” In line with the increased profile that the rebrand brings, the game will be played on Friday night under lights at North Sydney Oval. Watson says those tuning in should expect “mate on mate, state on state” action – with the NSW team fired up to make it three wins in a row in a significant turnaround on a dismal historical record. Before their breakthrough win in 2016, and with 2015 a draw, NSW had lost their last 17 games in a row to Queensland. “I’m from that era where we [women] had to pay to play, and we [NSW] used to get annihilated,” says Walton. “It wasn’t very much fun back in the day. But now we have the consistency of having the same girls in the team and we all have the same goal, we want to keep that ball rolling.” Asked what enabled such a stark turnaround, Walton pays credit to improved pathways for women and girls who want to play league in NSW. As of the 2018 season, NSWRL has implemented a number of changes to its participation and elite representative system, in part to cater for significant increases in participation. 2017 figures in NSW, for example, showed a 63% year-on-year increase in female participation. “Having the support of NSW Rugby League and having us in the same pathways program as the boys [has been a game-changer],” Walton says. “Even just understanding the science about being an athlete, understanding our bodies and what we can do – especially for us women, because we’re different, and it takes us longer to recover than men. “Understanding our bodies better means we can be smarter, with GPS tracking, heart-rate monitors, knowing how hard we’ve run and how hard we should be training is really important,” she says. “[Back when we were losing all the time] we used to get flogged at training, and it wasn’t working because we kept breaking down. Now we’re getting help with off-field stuff – becoming a better human, mental health, nutrition, knowing what to eat before training, when to eat... it has all really helped.” The effects of those pathways leave Walton confident that the Blues will make it three wins in a row – provided they play with the “NSW Origin spirit”. Asked to define the sometimes esoteric notion, Walton is precise. “We have a trademark, that we all agreed on: one in, all in,” she says. “So we have that attitude and that connection with everyone who buys into the Blues jersey. Whether it’s your first Origin, or you’ve played for 10 years like myself, everyone is a part of it, the staff, everyone who lives the lifestyle, and [subscribes to] the culture that we’ve had instilled. I think that’s what I love the most, that we’re all on the same page.” So does that mean there’ll be no nerves for Walton going into Friday night? “I feel calm and collected… normally I freak out,” she says. “I think I’m calm because of the type of players I’m playing alongside. Kezzie Apps, Sam Bremner, Maddie Studdon (captain), Taleena [Simon] transitioning from sevens who spoke this week about how Origin means to her, and then girls like Quincey Dodd, coming in for the first time ever – she’s so excited to be amongst the likes of us. We have a lot of depth now, and it really showed at nationals. So I’m calm, but ask me a couple of hours beforehand and I might not be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/18/us-immigration-border-families-separated-children-kirstjen-nielsen","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T00:17:20Z","webTitle":"Trump administration scrambles as outrage grows over border separations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/us-immigration-border-families-separated-children-kirstjen-nielsen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/us-immigration-border-families-separated-children-kirstjen-nielsen","fields":{"headline":"Trump administration scrambles as outrage grows over border separations","bodyText":"The Trump administration struggled on Monday to defend its policy of separating parents from their sons and daughters at the southern US border amid growing national outrage and the release of a shocking recording of sobbing children. As the White House scrambled to respond to the deepening political crisis, the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, flew from New Orleans to Washington to face a barrage of questions from reporters, even as Democrats demanded her resignation and the outcry reached a critical mass. Nielsen claimed that America was a country of “compassion” and “heart” but was unable to square the circle regarding whether the separations were a vindication of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy towards illegal immigration or an unintended consequence of a law made by the US Congress. During the West Wing briefing, she did not hear – or ignored – a reporter at the back of the room who played secretly recorded audio, first obtained by ProPublica, in which several Central American children, separated from their parents last week, can be heard crying for their “Mami!” and “Papa!” On the recording, one child says: “I don’t want them to stop my father, I don’t want them to deport him.” A border agent can be heard joking through the wails: “Well, we have an orchestra here, right? … What we’re missing is a conductor.” Nielsen – who Trump has reportedly criticised in private for failing to tackle border security – told reporters she had not heard the recording. Trump has found himself at the centre of many moral storms since becoming president nearly 18 months ago but they have more often related to words than to actions. The border separations, however, appear to have crossed a new line as the audio recording emerges, as well as harrowing photos of children in tears or in fenced cages, provoking some to draw comparisons with concentration camps. The process has triggered condemnation from four former first ladies: Rosalynn Carter, Laura Bush (who called it “cruel” and “immoral”), Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump. Even the current first lady, Melania Trump, has released a statement saying she “hates to see” children separated from their families. The separations followed the April announcement of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, under which everyone caught crossing the border illegally is to be prosecuted. Consequently, more adults are being jailed, pending trial, and their children are removed from them. Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their families in the past six weeks. On Monday, at a White House press briefing that started four hours later than planned, Nielsen argued that illegal immigration on the southern border had exceeded 50,000 people a month for the past three months. Since this time last year, she added, there had been a 325% increase in unaccompanied foreign children and a 435% increase in family units entering the country illegally. She denied that any children had been mistreated and argued: “This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border … Parents who entered illegally are by definition criminals … By entering our country illegally often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk.” The homeland security department, she continued, was merely enforcing the law in a way that past administrations had failed to do. “Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law. We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books.” Nielsen called on Congress to close loopholes in the law so families could stay together. “Congress and the courts created this problem and Congress alone can fix it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.” John Kelly, the White House chief of staff and Nielsen’s predecessor at homeland security, told National Public Radio in May that deterrence was “a big part” of the policy. Asked if the situation was therefore playing out as intended, Nielsen replied: “I find that offensive.” Nielsen was followed at the podium by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, who said the White House would reject a narrow fix by Congress to address the issue and that Trump’s priorities, such as funding a border wall and tightening immigration laws, must also be met. She said: “We want to fix the whole thing, we don’t want to tinker with just part of it.” As the issue overwhelmed TV news networks and threatened to cause lasting damage to America’s reputation abroad, Trump himself weighed in at an event ostensibly promoting his National Space Council. He repeated his past attempt to deflect blame to the Democrats, whom he branded “obstructionists”, and urged them to find a legislative solution. “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” the president said. “It won’t be. If you look at what’s happening in Europe, if you look at what’s happening in other places, we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” But Democrats rejected that assertion. Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, responded to Nielsen’s remarks by saying: “This utter lack of compassion and respect for basic human dignity is grotesque. And the blind contempt his staff has shown toward anyone pointing out the truth is a vile disgrace. This is not who we are. The American people are watching.” The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and senators Kamala Harris of California and Tina Smith of Minnesota called on Nielsen to resign. Smith said: “She’s denied that this is happening at all, and then said that she ‘wouldn’t apologize’ for what’s happening to families. Kirstjen Nielsen has lost the credibility and the moral authority to lead this agency.” Immigration is usually a rallying point for the Trump base but even some of his supporters have raised objections to the current action. The Rev Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump ally, said: “It’s disgraceful, and it’s terrible to see families ripped apart, and I don’t support that one bit.” Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s former communications director, told CNN: “I hope he changes it today, frankly. This is very, very bad for the Republican party, and this is bad for the president. I want to see him win re-election.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/18/tronc-tribune-publishing-changes-name-back","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T21:25:19Z","webTitle":"Tronc to change name back to Tribune Publishing after two years of ridicule","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/18/tronc-tribune-publishing-changes-name-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/18/tronc-tribune-publishing-changes-name-back","fields":{"headline":"Tronc to change name back to Tribune Publishing after two years of ridicule","bodyText":"Tronc is dead, long live Tribune! The media company that owns the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News is considering ditching its much ridiculed name and returning to the original just two years after its rebranding. Tribune Publishing rebranded itself tronc Inc (the lowercase t is deliberate) in June 2016 in a buzz-word laden press release that was greeted with much lampooning online. A company source confirmed that tronc had been considering a name change “for a few weeks” but that the final decision had not yet been taken. The newly branded company’s name went viral after it announced the home of the Baltimore Sun, San Diego Union Tribune, Los Angles Times and other papers that have garnered 105 Pulitzer prizes would now be called tronc. Tronc (it’s hard to avoid the incorrect capital) would be “a content curation and monetization company focused on creating and distributing premium, verified content across all channels”, the company wrote in a much lampooned press release. Tronc, short for Tribune Online Content, would also unleash “troncX”, a new division powered by artificial intelligence that would offer an “online curation and monetization engine”. Reaction to the troubled media company’s new branding was merciless. Tronc “is the sound of a millennial falling down the stairs”, wrote The Verge. Tronc “sounds like the noise an ejaculating elephant makes or, more appropriately, the sound of a stack of print newspapers being thrown into a dumpster”, comedian John Oliver said. Reactions on Twitter were no less acerbic. With the sale of the Los Angeles Times to billionaire surgeon and philanthropist Patrick Soon-Shiong, the company has decided it may be time to change back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/right-now-is-a-good-time-even-in-alaska-pride-for-mexico-runs-deep","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T08:30:23Z","webTitle":"'Right now is a good time': Even in Alaska, pride for Mexico runs deep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/right-now-is-a-good-time-even-in-alaska-pride-for-mexico-runs-deep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/right-now-is-a-good-time-even-in-alaska-pride-for-mexico-runs-deep","fields":{"headline":"'Right now is a good time': Even in Alaska, pride for Mexico runs deep","bodyText":"Just before 7am on a quiet cul-de-sac Sunday, the soft tones of a doorbell rang at the home of Luis and Angelica Casanova. The house smelled of coffee and frying tortillas. Visitors came in quietly and settled around the green rectangle of the TV. The racket of the World Cup crowd, half a world away, rose as Mexico’s players spilled out onto the field to face Germany, the reigning champions. “If we were to win,” Luis said. “It would be a big deal.” Alaska’s Latino community is small, percentage-wise, with Hispanics making up just about 7% of the population, compared to the US overall, where Hispanics make up about 17%, according to the US Census. In Anchorage, Spanish speakers from all over, many brought to the state for work in sectors like oil and gas, construction and tourism. People tend to congregate for things like church and sports, sharing a common language, but not always a country of origin, Luis said. “It’s so diverse,” Angelica said. “We lived before in Colorado, where (the Hispanic population) is like 80% Mexican. Here, actually, at church, there are people from everywhere.” Roughly half of Alaska’s 40,000 or so Hispanics were born in Mexico, according to state statistics. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are the next largest groups. Three out of four Hispanics living in Alaska were born in the US, a slightly higher percentage than the country as a whole. Luis, 35, an oil and gas engineer, is from Ecuador, and Angelica, 33, who works for an airline caterer, is from Mexico. They met when he was working in Mexico on a project and now have two children with another on the way, she said. Work brought them to Alaska. “The feeling (watching the game) here in Alaska is different. When our team plays at home, basically, the country stops,” Luis said. “Here, I believe there are bigger priorities: work, work, work, work. That’s what makes the US great.” Back on the living room television, El Tricolores drove the ball down the pitch. Angelica, in a green jersey, yelled, “Vamos! Vamos! Vamos!” Then Hirving Lozano made a shot on the German goal. The ball sailed by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer’s fingers. The living room lit up with cheers as the television replayed Lozano kneeling on the turf in slow-motion. Luis Mangandi, 32, who works as a car salesman, glowed with delight. He’s Salvadorian. His team didn’t qualify for the World Cup. (It’s a sore subject he’d rather not talk about.) A Mexican win would be an acceptable second best option, he said. “I just hate Germany with all my heart,” he said. Half-time came. People refilled plates with eggs and chopped hot dogs, hot tortillas and pancakes. Francisco Ramirez, 22, settled on the floor with his coffee as the game started back up. He came to Alaska recently from Oaxaca to live with his brother who owns a small flooring-install business. The job opportunities are good, he said. He works in a brewpub kitchen as a line cook and takes English classes. He sends money back to Mexico to his parents and sisters, he said. In his off time, he plays lots of pick-up soccer with a Spanish-speaking team made up of players from countries all over Latin America. They meet in a field behind a middle school. He doesn’t mind living in Alaska, but he misses his friends at home during World Cup time. “Right now maybe the people are drinking beers, it’s morning, but…” he said. Watching the sporting event at the same time as people in his country connects them, he said. “Right now we are enjoying the game together, right now is a good time,” he said. On the TV, the crowd broke into Cielito Lindo, an anthem for Mexican soccer fans, as the minutes ticked away. Germany still had no goals. On the couch, Alejandro Guadarramama, 20, and his wife, Isela Espinosa, 22, bantered away. They are both originally from Chihuahua, and came to Alaska because Alejandro was stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson with the Army, he said. Back home, he said, the game would be playing in the restaurants, bars and plazas. “There’s a lot of passion for it, even if we know we’re never going to win the World Cup, we cheer,” he said. Soon the game was down to its final seconds. Still no goals for Germany. The room got quiet. Then, finally, full time. The Alaska fans jumped up and down on the carpet, clapped and hollered. Mexico is ranked 15th in the world. It was an incredible upset. Phones dinged with text messages from friends and relatives far away. On the television, the camera panned the faces of weeping Mexican fans, and the German fans, their faces fallen. Not every Spanish speaker in Alaska was from Mexico, Angelica said, and some loved other teams more, but still, this win meant something to all of them. “In their deep heart, they are happy because it’s Latin America,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/19/egypt-russia-fitness-mo-salah-hector-cuper-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Egypt ready to take a risk on fitness of talisman Mo Salah","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/19/egypt-russia-fitness-mo-salah-hector-cuper-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/19/egypt-russia-fitness-mo-salah-hector-cuper-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Egypt ready to take a risk on fitness of talisman Mo Salah","bodyText":"For the Egypt fans taking in the sights of St Petersburg there was no mistaking the focus for their adoration. The words “Mo Salah” became a kind of greeting, as people embraced, stopped for photographs in front of the ornate Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, hoisted their flags. It has always been about Salah. Even long before his shoulder was wrenched by Sergio Ramos, it was about Salah. Their symbol was the man who had propelled them here in the first place, a World Cup 28 years in the waiting. There is an extraordinary pressure riding on whether or not he is in the best physical shape to run at the Russia defence as the second round of Group A matches gets under way. The Egypt manager, Héctor Cúper, had a stab at spreading the message that the entire squad are working collectively but there was not much point in pretending Salah’s influence was not the key to everything. “When we don’t have him we feel his absence,” Cúper said. “Nobody can deny how important he is and I say that with all due respect to the rest of the players in the squad. We have to try to find alternatives but I am optimistic he will be able to play. Salah is fit and an essential part of our team.” That declaration, a little over 24 hours before the kick-off against Russia, felt like a boost but Egypt had heard a similar message before the opening game against Uruguay. Salah had been close to playing only for a late fitness test to complicate matters. Salah will repeat the physical examination on Tuesday with Egypt desperate for a more positive outcome. Out on the pitch on the eve of the game the fitness coach made a point of bumping him with physical contact, challenging the arm, seeing how well it could withstand a body check. As if there was not enough being loaded on that recovering shoulder anyway, the way Group A has shaped up suggests Egypt desperately need a result against the host nation. Working on the assumption that Saudi Arabia look set for the wooden spoon, Egypt are aiming for a win to be the springboard to propel them into the knockout stage. Anything less is ominous for a team who do not score a lot of goals. Egypt’s reliance on Salah as a source of providing and finishing is emphasised by the fact they do not have many choices. Cúper faced a question about whether he was minded to give up the team’s cautious style given how much is at stake against Russia. Cúper sighed. “It’s a tough question to answer. The more you increase the level of competition, the higher you set the bar, the more demanding the game becomes. We have an identity, we have a personality. It may not please everyone but we have our style. Maybe we lack that last touch, that last accuracy, that last good fortune that allows a moment to become a goal.” Does he regret not calling up another forward? “Regret serves no purpose,” he replied. “It is like after a match you think if only I had done this or that. I can make a mistake but I leave no room for regret. What’s the point? We are all geniuses at hindsight aren’t we.” Cúper enthused about the impact he hopes Salah will have. “Salah is one of the best in the world, in the top 10 today no shadow of doubt. It is an honour to be able to coach him and work with him. On top of being talented he is humble, a team player, which is extremely important now.” The Russia manager, Stanislav Cherchesov, sounded confident his team had a plan to halt Salah and Cúper responded drily. “There is not only one player on the pitch. It is great if they are just focusing on Salah.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/18/dr-dre-marvin-gaye-biopic-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T20:00:50Z","webTitle":"Dr Dre to make Marvin Gaye biopic with rights to singer's catalogue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/18/dr-dre-marvin-gaye-biopic-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/18/dr-dre-marvin-gaye-biopic-rights","fields":{"headline":"Dr Dre to make Marvin Gaye biopic with rights to singer's catalogue","bodyText":"The rapper and business mogul Dr Dre is working on a movie about the Motown legend Marvin Gaye, who died in 1984 after being shot by his father.

In 2016, the singer’s estate approved of a limited series starring Jamie Foxx, the first such project to receive the family’s blessing after attempts were made by industry heavyweights such as Cameron Crowe, James Gandolfini and Scott Rudin to produce his life story. Additionally, a documentary about Gaye’s life featuring never-before-seen footage, What’s Going On, was slated to go be released in 2017 but remains in development. “This project will be a powerful and definitive telling of Marvin Gaye’s life story,” said Gaye’s son, Marvin Gaye III, about the Foxx-produced series at the time.

She has 54 descendants in Australia, the US, Indonesia and elsewhere around the world. “Apart from being the oldest member of our colony, she was also the founding member of our world-renowned breeding program and leaves an incredible legacy,” said Holly Thompson, the zoo’s primate supervisor in a statement. “Her genetics count for just under 10% of the global zoological population.” Puan was euthanised on Monday after suffering age-related complications that the zoo said were affecting her quality of life. Zookeeper Martina Hart, who had worked with Puan for 18 years, wrote a heartfelt obituary after her death. “Over the years Puan’s eyelashes had greyed, her movement had slowed down and her mind had started to wander. But she remained the matriarch, the quiet, dignified lady she had always been,” wrote Hart in the obituary, provided to Guardian Australia and printed in full in the West Australian. “Puan demanded and deserved respect, and she certainly had it from all her keepers over the years. She was the founding female of the best breeding colony in the world.” “Puan taught me patience, she taught me that natural and wild instincts never disappear in captivity.

Having started by saying she was determined to secure the NHS’s future, she immediately invoked the shoddy Brexit campaign bus slogan of 2016 with implied approval. Then she talked about the money Britain would save by leaving the EU; finally she deliberately spoke in ways that would lead any unwary listener to assume that a so-called “Brexit dividend” was the windfall that enabled her to make the new spending pledge. Characteristically, Boris Johnson was even more mendacious, calling the pledge “a down payment on the cash we will soon get back from our EU payments”. All of this was a lie. It disgraces Mrs May to tell such a whopper. True, by the time that she gave her speech on NHS spending on Monday, her words were rather more circumspect; the essential deception nevertheless endured. “Some of the extra funding” will come from money that now goes to the EU, she said at London’s Royal Free Hospital, “but the commitment I am making goes beyond that Brexit dividend.” That is true with bells on, since the NHS pledge dwarfs any future savings on the UK’s Brexit payments. That’s partly because the dividend is itself a pretence. The UK has agreed a £39bn divorce payment, plus more for the backstop agreement and further sums if it accesses EU programmes after Brexit. That’s without taking account of any weakening of the public finances – a sum put at £15bn per year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies – as a result of Brexit. But it is also because this scale of support for the NHS, welcome as it may be, can only be paid for in three ways: by cutting other spending programmes; by increasing the tax take; or by borrowing more. Ministers – more specifically the chancellor, Philip Hammond – have not yet settled on the key details and are still fighting over them. There were others deceits in Mrs May’s speech, not least in her section on NHS history. There is also this week’s politics. It is possible that Mrs May is calculating that she needs to embrace the Brexiter position on the NHS because she knows she will shortly have to upset them on issues like a customs agreement or single market access, or because she expects to lose Wednesday’s vote on MPs’ right to stop her taking Britain out of the EU without a deal. Yet the ultimate criticism of Mrs May’s speech is that she has been unable to say where the money is coming from. The politics of this are massive. For 40 years, the Conservatives have been a tax-cutting party, so to tax income or wealth on the necessary scale would represent a historic (and desirable) change of direction. For eight years they have been an anti-borrowing party too, so to change tack there would be almost equally wise and epochal. Putting more money into the NHS is desirable. The government’s commitment to do so is necessary and overdue. The sums announced on Monday – a front-loaded 3.4% real terms increase in current spending amounting to £20.5bn extra year for England, plus further sums for Scotland and Wales and to secure NHS pensions – are serious. But they cannot be explained as a consequence of Brexit, and the instant dismissal of that claim from backbench Tories, the IFS and the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs, among many others (including some Brexit enthusiasts), underlines the sheer economic speciousness of the approach that Mrs May has so far adopted to one of the most profound decisions of her premiership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/21/nhs-70-doctor-writers-healthcare","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"Doctors’ orders: writers from the medical world on how to cure the NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/21/nhs-70-doctor-writers-healthcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/21/nhs-70-doctor-writers-healthcare","fields":{"headline":"Doctors’ orders: writers from the medical world on how to cure the NHS","bodyText":"Kevin Fong When I started as a house officer in 1998, the NHS was just turning 50. I remember those early days and the endless nights; struggling on the huge open wards with breathless, blue-skinned patients in tiny pools of light cast by bedside lamps, desperately trying to do the right thing while waiting for the cavalry to arrive. I was sleepless and scared, feeling I was the weakest link in my patients’ chain of survival. In time, however, I realised that I was not, nor ever had been, truly alone; that I was instead part of something bigger. The NHS is a complex success story. It has made enormous strides against disease over the past seven decades, through a blend of policy, public health strategy and medical research – coupled with the tireless endeavours of healthcare workers. This is how we have transformed our expectations of life and survival since 1948. It is about systems, not superheroes. In search of lessons on how to improve safety in the NHS, we have looked to other high risk, high reliability industries; among them commercial aviation, automobile production and the space industry. Studies of these organisations have shown that senior executives with responsibility for budget and strategic vision must understand when to defer to on-the-job expertise and invest properly in both the staff and infrastructure that form the foundations of safe practice. Wherever these industries have failed to heed warnings from the front line, avoidable catastrophe has followed. The NHS’s stories of failure are equally complex, and if we are to learn from our errors we need to be honest about why things go wrong. We must eschew the idea of individual heroism. Not out of false modesty but because if we create lone heroes then we must also invent villains; when in fact neither character exists in isolation. Very few incidents are the product of the wilful or negligent actions of an individual. And we will not learn and cannot move forward if we treat them in that way. Whenever avoidable harm occurs it is everyone’s responsibility, from the people making decisions in the moment, to those shaping strategy and choosing how much resource to allocate. For the NHS to thrive all of us – politicians, the public, the media, as well as our healthcare workers – must be honest about what the NHS is, what it needs to guarantee its future, and how we will pay for it.

Rachel Clarke For children with cancer, the necessary separation from their parents during radiotherapy can be intolerably frightening. Sometimes, only a general anaesthetic can calm them. Recently, an NHS play therapist put her mind to this problem, devising an ingenious solution. Her “magic string” is simply a ball of multicoloured twine, one end of which can be held by the young patient, the other by their parent. The therapist invented something powerful and healing. A literal thread that is, simultaneously, a narrative thread – a story a frightened child can tell themselves, while lying alone behind a lead-lined door, that Mummy or Daddy are still there, loving and holding on to them. Cheap as chips and priceless, magic string was created not for profit or personal gain – but simply because someone cared. For 70 years, the lifeblood of the NHS has been basic, glitz-free, humdrum humanity. Kindness isn’t loud, it doesn’t grab headlines. Yet all of us, NHS staff and patients alike, know that what heals is more than doctors’ drugs or scalpels. It is the quieter, smaller things too – being heard and shown you matter – that make patients feel cherished, and hospitals humane. Right now, the magic string that binds the NHS together has never been more threadbare. Overstretched staff are burned out. Compassion fatigue is rife. If ever a birthday present mattered, it is sufficient frontline staff to preserve kindness at our NHS’s core. Rachel Clarke’s Your Life in My Hands: A Junior Doctor’s Story is published by Metro. Gavin Francis Caring for others remains the most rewarding of jobs; to work in medicine or nursing is to engage your intellect, your curiosity, your compassion, yet we’re seeing crises in recruitment and retention. If the government refuses to fund the health service to the levels enjoyed by Denmark, France or Germany, there are still ways we might build an NHS to last another 70 years. Gains have been made in ethnic diversity and gender discrimination, but in terms of socioeconomic diversity we’re going backwards. Bursaries for medical and nursing students from modest backgrounds would be a start, with admissions procedures that take account of the significant barriers those students face. Healthcare has been undergoing gentrification for decades, and it’s been shown that the more privileged your background, the less likely you are to want to work among the people who need you most. Both medicine and nursing need a return to faith in professionalism, ending systems of assessment based on adherence to centrally dictated guidelines which have seen a tripling of NHS drug prescription in 15 years, with little benefit for the patient and even some anecdotal evidence of harm. Our most experienced doctors and nurses are retiring as soon as they can – to hold on to their skills and experience we need new patterns of flexible working and an overhaul of onerous and bureaucratic systems of appraisal and revalidation. These systems, introduced following the Harold Shipman affair, are weakening the services they were intended to support – and would have done nothing to stop a murderer likehim. Finally, commercial health providers have long benefited from an NHS that will pick up the pieces whenever they fall short – we need a reliable mechanism that bills them for their failures. Gavin Francis is a GP in Edinburgh, and the author of Shapeshifters and Adventures in Human Being (Profile). Adam Kay “Gawd bless the NHS” might as well be our national anthem. But – love the NHS as much as we all obviously do – just saying it isn’t enough; it’s conversational slacktivism, as pointless as canonising the dead. We need to do something. We need to lobby our elected representatives, we need to go on frequent, noisy protests and ultimately we all need to pay more taxes. Realistically, very few of you are going to do any of that. So here’s something you can do just by talking. You all know someone who works for the NHS – a friend, neighbour, relative will be one of the 1.5 million people who keep the health service alive, keep us all alive. They might be a nurse working flat out on a ward with 50% staffing, a doctor carrying three bleeps, a physio whose clinics routinely end two hours late, a midwife who’s had all her holidays cancelled. Ask them how their day was. They’ll say “fine” and change the subject. But let them understand they’ve always got someone to talk to. Someone who understands that the days are never actually just “fine”, that the nature of illness means that more bad things happen than good, that they’re not superhumans with some kind of emotional force field. Give them that opportunity to offload at the end of every shift, whether it’s a tiny irritation, a rant or a full-on sob. Chip away at the ingrained notion that healthcare professionals shouldn’t talk about these things – because that same ingrained notion is partly responsible for the huge rise in people leaving the NHS, the rise in stress-related absence and illness among those who stay, and the tragic rise in suicide among those who find it just too much. Don’t let them bottle it up. Let them know you’re there. Care for the carer. Adam Kay’s This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor is published by Picador. Christie Watson At a time when we need more nurses than ever, they are leaving the NHS faster than they join. We are short of 40,000 nurses in England alone – the highest vacancy level since records began. It is perhaps no wonder that nursing is in crisis. Our language is reflective of our wider values, or lack of them: nursing care, growing up in care, nursing homes, all provoke such negative imagery. Care has become a dirty word.We often hear the roar of doctors, see their visible representation across all forms of media, and rightly so, but nurses outnumber doctors in the NHS two to one. They are perhaps too quiet, too soft, too kind – whatever the cause, we don’t hear nurses’ voices. Nursing students have even less of a voice and yet are a vital part of the NHS. The removal of the student bursary was sold as a way to increase nurse training numbers, but since the government scrapped it, the number of applications has fallen by a third. Student nurses work twelve and half hour shifts, nights, weekends. They can’t get part time jobs to support their studies. They can’t pay off student debts on a nurse’s salary: (NHS staff are among the biggest users of payday loans). The biggest drop in applications following the scrapping of the bursary has been from mature students, with life experience, wanting to go into the areas that are struggling most of all with recruitment: mental health and the community. I would never have been a nurse without the bursary, nor would my most senior, experienced and brilliant nurse colleagues. I think of all the patients we must have cared for over the decades, those of us who – in this political climate – would simply have been unable to train in the first place. Perhaps governments depend on those quiet voices; they trust that the public won’t hear about the plight of nursing. How nursing is in real danger, and what that will mean for patients. Because we will all rely one day on a nurse to hold our hand during our frailest, most extreme and significant moments of life. Care, compassion and kindness delivered by qualified and experienced nurses will be the most important things to every one of us, in the end. I would prescribe the NHS a reinstatement of the nursing training bursary – immediately. We do not have enough nurses. Unless we all shout about that, it is patients who will pay the real price. Christie Watson’s The Language of Kindness: A Nurse’s Story is published by Chatto. Stephen Westaby Contrast the contemporary developments in medical science with what our precious NHS can afford. I was born in the backstreets of a northern steel town in July 1948. The splendid new NHS was a blessing for the poor but what it was asked to provide was limited. In 1958 I watched my grandfather’s horrific death from heart failure. His loyal GP came to the house and put an end to his suffering with morphine. At the time cardiac surgery was new and exciting, so I decided to pursue that career to find a solution. Heart transplantation began in 1967 but never fulfilled its promise. Annually in the UK 15,000 patients under 65 could be helped, but there are only 150 donors. I decided to find an alternative. Cambridge tried pig organs without success. In Oxford I came up with “off the shelf” mechanical hearts. In 2000 I implanted a thumb-sized turbine left ventricular assist device (LVAD) into a dying patient. As a result he had no pulse in his circulation, which drew huge scepticism. He survived for almost eight years, with excellent quality of life. LVADs provide equivalent outcomes to transplantation, but without needing someone else to die first. Now we have pacemakers for heart rhythm problems and blood pumps for heart failure. This will soon include a revolutionary British LVAD. Six years ago my Greek trainees saved a dying heart attack victim with a temporary circulatory support device. When he relapsed into severe heart failure I joined them to implant a permanent LVAD and inject the scarred heart muscle with genetically engineered stem cells produced by a British Nobel laureate. This patient remains symptom free. We discovered that the cells remove scar tissue, which offers enormous promise for heart failure prevention in the future. It distresses me that none of these three components of heart failure treatment are available for NHS patients. Sixty years later NHS patients still suffer my grandfather’s fate. When my charitable funds expired so did many patients whom I could have saved. The NHS is run by politicians so smoke and mirrors are to be expected. It may well be cost effective and free at the point of delivery, but it is not patient focused. Who can justify spending a fortune publishing surgeons’ death rates while denying us the equipment to save lives? Things must change. The 70th anniversary is the end of the beginning. We must be honest about what the NHS can afford and allow insurance to cover important innovations deemed unaffordable. It is wrong to pretend that they do not exist. Stephen Westaby’s Fragile Lives: A Heart Surgeon’s Stories of Life and Death on the Operating Table is published by HarperCollins. Kathryn Mannix The success of the NHS has had an unanticipated dark side: reducing deaths in childhood and mid-life established a public expectation that sending even our frailest people to hospital would always save their lives. Death became a “medical failure”. People experience escalating hospital treatments despite likely futility. Without discussion of or preparation for dying, patients endure multiple, often unhelpful hospital admissions in the last year of life. We mistake medical prolongation of dying for appropriate care. The prescription may be difficult to swallow. We should de-medicalise dying. For practitioners to recognise diminishing returns of medical treatments, and offer timely discussion with compassion and honesty, we need to challenge both societal denial and medical paralysis. This is not only a prescription for the NHS, then: it involves all of us recognising our mortality. A skills set for NHS staff training includes conducting end of life discussions and understanding the process of normal dying. They should establish what care the patient finds acceptable, and put in place a coordination system to enable access to the patient’s preferences whenever a decision must be made, so they receive the right care quickly, and are not repeatedly subjected to unhelpful interventions or distressing end-of-life conversations. This may result in less medical treatment, but will encourage more appropriate, skilled care and real patient choice. Bad deaths follow poor planning. And that is a failure. We need to re-establish that dying is simply what happens at the end of every life, and recognise that a peaceful death is a good outcome worth striving for.

His second LP, a conceptual double album exploring earth (reality) and heaven (idealisation), is perhaps unlikely to sway the old guard, but it pushes forward with a purposeful vitality that was at times missing from his debut album, The Epic. The gripping Earth side bursts to life with Fists of Fury, a Bruce Lee film score cover (with Patrice Quinn’s refrain: “Our time as victims is over/ We will no longer ask for justice/ Instead, we will take our retribution”), setting the scene for more political charge and soaring retro cinema stylings than before. While Earth finds Washington wielding his sax as a furious, necessary weapon, the indulgent, opulent cushion of Heaven serves as a dazzling balm, the choir transforming from theatrical to celestial.

The highlight race on day one of Royal Ascot generally features a clash between Classic winners but this colt is stepping straight up from Listed company and, while he might be able to manage it with John Gosden’s help, odds of 11-4 make no appeal. A more orthodox favourite would be Romanised (4.20), winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas and beaten by only Masar, the Derby winner, when he last came to Britain in September. I don’t think there was any fluke about his Curragh win last month, when he produced a really strong finish to reel in U S Navy Flag. On a fast surface here that rival could pinch a handy lead off the home turn but Romanised is the way to bet at 5-1.

Bin Suroor fields Benbatl, whose Dubai Turf success in March is just about the best form on offer. But horses who have a busy Dubai campaign early in the year cannot always be relied on in midsummer, so a better option might be the progressive French raider Recoletos.

He produced a career best on his first run since joining Mauricio Delcher Sanchez, who won this race 10 years ago with Equiano.

Cheng Jingye also rejected suggestions China is intentionally over-burdening some Pacific island nations with debt to bring them under Beijing’s control, saying it is “absurd” to suggest such a thing. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon His remarks come a day after Julie Bishop, the foreign affairs minister, confirmed the Turnbull government will compete with China’s infrastructure development spree in the South Pacific to ensure small island nations in Australia’s neighbourhood “retain their sovereignty”. Australian foreign policy experts are increasingly wary of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious trillion dollar plan to expand Beijing’s influence across 70 or more countries, including in the Pacific, with a spending spree on hundreds of large infrastructure projects that dramatically expands China’s geographic footprint. Cheng spoke at an Australia-China Business Council event in Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday, using his opening address to call on Australians to view China far more favourably. He said China was willing to work with Australia to improve bilateral relations, but Australia had to stop being suspicious of Chinese motives. He said the Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi recently held a meeting with Julie Bishop where he outlined China’s plan for its development path and its visions for developing relations with other countries. “He pointed out China follows a development path that is completely different from that of traditional major powers,” he said. “China never interferes in the internal affairs of [other] countries, let alone carries out so-called ‘infiltration’ of other countries. China’s idea is to carry out equal cooperation with all countries, including Australia, to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes.” Cheng said it was his belief that, in order to “disperse the clouds”, Australia and China needed to be more inclusive and behave with less bias and bigotry. “We need to see each other’s development and positive intentions from a more positive perspective with less cold war mentality,” he said. “We need to build more mutual trust, with less misunderstanding. We need to develop more connections between our two countries and two peoples with less barriers. And we need to respect each other’s core interests and major concerns while managing the differences in a constructive manner.” After his speech, when Cheng was leaving the event, he gave unscripted remarks to journalists that were more pointed. He said it was “ridiculous” and “absurd” to suggest that China was over-burdening some Pacific island nations with debt. “We have a growing economic cooperation with some island countries, they are on an equal footing and I think it is mutually beneficial,” he said. “We have always been sensitive to any possible debt burden, and any items that we have in cooperation with those countries we have been very careful about their ability to [repay] the debt.” When asked who he had in mind when he mentioned bias and bigotry, he said it was up to others to come to their own conclusions. “You can make your own judgements,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/19/labor-confirms-it-will-oppose-irresponsible-10-year-tax-package","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T05:22:42Z","webTitle":"Labor confirms it will oppose 'irresponsible' 10-year tax package","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/19/labor-confirms-it-will-oppose-irresponsible-10-year-tax-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/19/labor-confirms-it-will-oppose-irresponsible-10-year-tax-package","fields":{"headline":"Labor confirms it will oppose 'irresponsible' 10-year tax package","bodyText":"Labor has thrown down the political gauntlet on the Turnbull government’s income tax cuts, confirming it will only support stage one – the tax relief for low and middle income earners – as the package sits on a knife’s edge. As foreshadowed by the shadow treasurer Chris Bowen on Monday, Labor has resolved to oppose stage two and three of the income tax cuts package outlined by the Turnbull government on May 7 – setting up a clash on the competing economic plans both at the July byelections and at the federal election this year or next. Confirming Labor’s position on Tuesday, Labor leader Bill Shorten dared the government to bring on a political confrontation about its insistence that tax relief for high income earners in 2024 needed to be legislated right now: “just put it to the people”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Shorten told reporters Labor was prepared to support tax relief for low and middle income workers today but the 10-year package was “an irresponsible plan from an irresponsible government and no responsible opposition would vote for it” “We say to the government that if you want to talk about promises in more than two election cycle’s time – take these radical proposals to the people of Australia and see what they think about them.” Shorten said in the event the entire package passed the Senate after the looming parliamentary fortnight of backroom brinkmanship, Labor would repeal the tax cuts in stage two and three if it won the next federal election – a stance reminiscent of Labor’s GST “Rollback” campaign in the early 2000s. Stage one of the government’s $143bn package, a low and middle-income tax offset, will give $530 to 4.4 million taxpayers with incomes between $48,000 and $90,000 in 2018-19. This stage also raises from $87,000 to $90,000 the income threshold under which the tax rate of 37% applies. Stage two, which begins in 2022, lifts the top threshold for the 19% rate from $37,000 to $41,000 and lifts the top threshold for the 32.5% tax rate from $90,000 to $120,000. Stage three abolishes the 37-cent tax bracket from mid-2024. As of Tuesday morning, the Turnbull government does not have the numbers in the Senate to pass the entire income tax package, with the unpredictable One Nation bloc pivotal to the eventual outcome. On Monday, in talks with other crossbenchers, Pauline Hanson signalled she was supportive of stage one, had an open mind on stage two, and was opposed to stage three. Despite lacking the requisite Senate support for all three stages of the plan, the government has gone into the last sitting fortnight before the winter recess insisting the $143bn income tax package be considered as a whole. The outcome of the coming debate is unpredictable, but some in the Senate predict the likeliest outcome is stage three of the plan will be knocked out of the legislation, forcing the government to decide if it will sink the whole package if one element doesn’t pass. Once chamber debate is underway, Labor will combine with the Greens and the South Australian independent Tim Storer to attempt to remove stage two and three from the tax package. The Greens confirmed on Tuesday it would cooperate with that effort even though it remains opposed to the entire package, and will vote against it at the third reading. The Centre Alliance bloc has now resolved to support stages one and two of the government’s tax plan, so it won’t vote for splitting the package if that action has the effect of stymying stage two. Stirling Griff of the Centre Alliance told Guardian Australia he and colleague Rex Patrick were yet to resolve their stance on stage three, which involves flattening the tax scales so workers earning between $40,000 and $200,000 pay the same rate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/18/donald-trump-us-migrant-camp-border-separation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T08:33:47Z","webTitle":"Trump says US will not be a 'migrant camp'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/donald-trump-us-migrant-camp-border-separation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/donald-trump-us-migrant-camp-border-separation","fields":{"headline":"Trump says US will not be a 'migrant camp'","bodyText":"Donald Trump said the US would not be a “migrant camp” as his administration defended its controversial practice of separating migrant children from their parents at the border. “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” Trump said during remarks at the White House on Monday. “You look at what’s happening in Europe,” he continued, “you look at what’s happening in other places – we can’t allow that to happen to the United States. Not on my watch.” Trump ignored a intensifying chorus of condemnation of a zero-tolerance enforcement policy that has resulted in the separation of nearly 2,000 children from their parents in just six weeks. The separation tactic has drawn bipartisan backlash from prominent members of Congress, human rights advocates and religious leaders who have called the tactic cruel and inhumane. Trump again tried to shift responsibility for the policy, claiming inaccurately that his administration was simply enforcing the country’s “horrible laws”. “I say it’s very strongly the Democrats’ fault,” he said. In a series of tweets earlier on Monday, Trump demanded Congress “CHANGE THE LAWS”. There is no law requiring immigration officials to separate migrant families at the border and past administrations have avoided the practice. The separations are the consequence of the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy that subjects all migrants who are caught trying to enter the US illegally to criminal prosecution. Children cannot be held in federal jails while the adults await trial and as a result they are removed from their parents. In a pair of speeches at a conference in New Orleans on Monday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, stood by the enforcement policy. “We will not apologize for the job we do, or for the job law enforcement does, for doing the job that the American people expect us to do,” Nielsen said, addressing a friendly audience at the National Sheriffs’ Association conference. “Illegal actions have and must have consequences,” she added. “No more free passes, no more get-out-of-jail-free cards.” Sessions blamed past administrations for carving out exceptions for migrant families that crossed the border illegally, paving the way for the current crisis. “Word got out about this loophole with predictable results. The number of aliens illegally crossing with children between our ports of entry went from 14,000 to 75,000 – that’s a five-fold increase – in just the last four years,” the attorney general claimed. He added the White House does not “want” to separate children from their parents and that the US is “dedicated to caring for those children”. “If we build the wall, if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness, we won’t face these terrible choices,” he said, urging Congress to act. “We will have a system where those who need to apply for asylum can do so and those who want to come to this country will apply to enter lawfully.” At turns during the conference, chants of “arrest Sessions” and “Jeff Sessions must go” from a group of demonstrators outside were audible inside the event. Meanwhile, outside the convention center where Sessions was delievring his remarks, a protester was struck by a pickup truck. The victim refused medical treatment, according to the New Orleans police department, and was not seriously injured. Witnesses on the scene said the driver had been cursing at the protesters moments before the woman was struck. But an NOPD official said they were treating the incident as an accident, and had made no arrest or filed any charges against the vehicle operator. Five demonstrators were also detained by the Orleans parish sheriff’s office. The protesters blocked traffic for a brief period before returning to the road’s median outside the convention hall. The five were issued summonses for “disturbing the peace by protesting”. On Monday, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama joined Laura Bush in condemning the practice. A day before, in a rare foray into public policy, Melania Trump weighed in to say that she “hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together”. While the first lady expressed displeasure with the practice, she avoided blaming her husband’s administration, in effect echoing the president’s claim that the actions are the result of a law passed by Democrats. In an op-ed, Bush spoke out forcefully against the Trump administration practice, comparing scenes of migrant children locked in cages away from their parents to the internment of Japanese Americans during the second world war. “I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,” she wrote in an article in the Washington Post over the weekend. Obama retweeted the op-ed, adding: “Sometimes truth transcends party.” And at an event in New York, Clinton called Trump’s assertion that family separation is mandated by law an “outright lie”. “We are a better country than one that tears families apart, turns a blind eye to women fleeing domestic violence and treats frightened children as a negotiating tool,” she said. The crisis at the US-Mexico border coincides with an effort by a group of Republicans to pass immigration reform before the November midterms. Trump is pressuring Democrats to negotiate with Republicans on an immigration bill that addresses family separations. The legislation, crafted as a compromise between moderate and conservative Republicans, would make it easier for children to be detained and harder for families to claim asylum. The bill also includes longstanding demands from the White House, including funding for a wall along the southern border and restrictions on legal immigration in exchange for legal protections for young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jul/06/tyrant-shakespeare-on-power-stephen-greenblatt-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-06T07:59:21Z","webTitle":"Tyrant by Stephen Greenblatt review – Shakespeare, power and sadistic impulses\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/06/tyrant-shakespeare-on-power-stephen-greenblatt-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jul/06/tyrant-shakespeare-on-power-stephen-greenblatt-review","fields":{"headline":"Tyrant by Stephen Greenblatt review – Shakespeare, power and sadistic impulses\r\n","bodyText":"Near the end of this book, Stephen Greenblatt observes that Shakespeare was unusually good at staying out of trouble. His friend and rival Ben Jonson was imprisoned for the allegedly seditious play The Isle of Dogs. Their contemporary, Thomas Kyd, fled from an arrest warrant for sedition and was interrogated under torture. Christopher Marlowe was stabbed to death by a government agent, while awaiting an investigation of his unconventional religious beliefs. The career of playwright was not a safe one in Elizabethan or Jacobean England. Greenblatt’s opening chapter lays out the evidence for the dangers of staging drama in Shakespeare’s day, culminating in the elderly Elizabeth I reportedly likening herself to Shakespeare’s Richard II, a monarch defeated and finally murdered by rebels. Yet Richard II was never banned. Shakespeare prospered while creating his anatomies of power and its abuse. No reader of this single-minded book could be in any doubt of Shakespeare’s fascination with the ways in which a tyrant exercised power. Some of his greatest characters are tyrants, displayed for spectators who knew that, outside the theatre, political dissent or religious heterodoxy could be death. Some of the most memorably caustic lines about the arbitrariness of authority – “a dog’s obeyed in office” – were spoken on Shakespeare’s stage to an audience that included government agents. Yet, as Greenblatt puts it with winning anachronism, “the police were never called”. If the maddened Lear said it, it was allowable. Sentiments that would have been dangerous to voice in the tavern could be broadcast at the Globe. Greenblatt is returning here to some of the questions that occupied him in the early criticism that made his name, and that established him as the leading light of new historicism. That critical movement specialised in audacious sallies of interpretation; in contrast, this book sticks to dutiful exegesis of Shakespeare’s dialogues. New historicism allowed critics to flourish their ingenuity by finding repressed meanings that their chosen authors had not themselves acknowledged. Now Greenblatt seems almost to believe in the playwright’s intentions. Anyone who has struggled with Shakespeare’s earliest history plays, his Henry VI trilogy, will be pleased to find here a condensed account of the conspiracy and treachery they dramatise, including the terrifying rise and inevitable fall of the rebel Jack Cade. It is a story of the “sadistic impulses” shared by those who love power. These three plays were the prelude to Richard III, whose warped protagonist appals and captivates Greenblatt. Richard’s skill is “the ability to force his way into the minds of those around him”. He is definitive on Richard’s psychopathology. “Sexual conquest excites him, but only for the endlessly reiterated proof that he can have anything he likes.” Tyranny is a madness that becomes eloquent in Shakespeare. Not for him the banality of the despot. Macbeth may be a “butcher”, but no one speaks better. Leontes in A Winter’s Tale turns language itself into a fevered, flickering register of paranoia. In every way, these characters are compelling. As Greenblatt elegantly shows, Shakespeare dramatises the very exercise of power – the ways in which subjects and collaborators are seduced or numbed into complicity. Those few who resist intrigue him. The book’s hero is the Duke of Cornwall’s unnamed servant in King Lear who, with his master urged on by his wife Regan to pluck out Gloucester’s eyes, calls on him to stop. The man has served Cornwall “since I was a child”, but now shows his “better service” by trying to stand between the torturer and his victim. “A peasant stand up thus?” is Regan’s contemptuous question, as she stabs him to death. Greenblatt is not unerring. He says that in Macbeth we witness “the birth of a tyrant” in the famous dialogue where Lady Macbeth goads her hesitating husband into murder. Yet the play is careful to let us know that the scheme to murder Duncan has been hatched some time before the play begins. The witches are not putting something into his head but reminding him of his own dark plans. He is already the would-be tyrant. There is also some uncertainty about what a tyrant is. We get a sharply observed chapter on Coriolanus, but its protagonist is revealed to be anything but a tyrant. He is disabled from wielding power by his distaste for the business of winning over the populace. As Greenblatt himself points out, Coriolanus’s political opponents manipulate him precisely by depicting him to the people as a would-be tyrant. A better candidate for inclusion would surely have been Hamlet’s uncle Claudius, a ruler who can manage sweet reason in his speeches alongside utter ruthlessness in his orders. And what about the Puritan tyrant Angelo in Measure for Measure, soberly making others pay for what are in fact his own sins? The book may have begun as a newspaper article, drawing lessons from Shakespeare on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, but mostly the reader is left to draw his or her lessons for the present. There are some calculatedly anachronistic analogies: Mary Queen of Scots’ beheading is likened to the killing of Osama bin Laden. Greenblatt admires Shakespeare as “the master of the oblique angle” on power – and wants to find that angle for himself. • Tyrant: Shakespeare on Power is published by Bodley Head.

Kyrgios, who frightened the life out of Roger Federer in a thrilling three-set semi-final in Stuttgart on Saturday, said of Murray’s absence since Wimbledon last year: “It’s been pretty shitty without him. I’m looking forward to going out there and playing. But to see him healthy is obviously the main thing. He’s awesome for the sport.” They have both struggled with injuries over the past year, Murray risking surgery on his hip in January to save his career, Kyrgios dealing with a recurring elbow problem that seems to have finally left him in peace – as he has done with Murray. “We kept in touch a little bit but he’s a busy man,” Kyrgios said. “The last thing he wants is to see me blowing up his phone. Probably can’t take me seriously. My elbow is fine. I have zero pain now and I played three quality matches in Stuttgart. Obviously I was pretty disappointed I didn’t win against Roger but it was a good match. I was in complete control in the third-set tie-break at one stage. I’m feeling good. My level is still there. “I know he’s going to make a lot of balls. He loves playing on grass. I know how he plays. I watched a little of him today in practice. He looked fine.” Murray, who has won this title five times, returns after 11 months away hoping just to be competitive. “There’s never a time when you feel perfect,” he told the BBC. “It’s not a gamble in terms that I’m going to re-injure my hip. But if I missed the grasscourt season and tried to play in five weeks’ time the same doubts would be there. “You re-evaluate. You find that out by being out there. It’s very different from the controlled environment of the practice court. I didn’t want to get back on the match court until I felt I could compete. Hopefully the body responds well. I expect to be a bit stiff and sore after it. “Obviously I’d love to win the tournament but I’m not thinking about that. It’s about seeing where my game’s at, hopefully moving well and not restricted. I think it’s still possible to compete [for a grand slam title] but, after you’ve been out as long as I have, that’s not how it works. The expectations from me are very low right now. I’ll reassess my goals when I’m back competing.” He said the medical feedback after his operation in January has been, “really positive” but no surgeon could assess his match fitness. Earlier Stan Wawrinka, one of a slew of leading players trying to keep their bodies in one piece for Wimbledon in a fortnight, looked as strong as ever when he thrashed Britain’s Cameron Norrie on the Queen’s grass in less than an hour, 6-2, 6-3. Norrie, who has risen to 80 in the world in his first full season on Tour, struggled to cope with Wawrinka’s power from hand and off the ground in the first set, and never properly got into the contest in the first round of the Fever-Tree Championships. Wawrinka, a three-times grand slam winner, quickly reminded Norrie of his pedigree when he broke for 3-1 and held as the second set slipped quickly from the Briton’s grasp. Norrie served through deuce in the seventh game to stay alive, calmly putting away a forehand volley, but there was not a lot he could do about the Swiss’s serve, as Wawrinka held to love with his 13th ace of the match. It was a chastening experience for the British No 2. “He managed his serve very well,” Norrie said. “It was tough for me to get into the rallies. I didn’t serve that great. I didn’t really feel comfortable on my feet. I felt like out on the corners I was going to slip and I didn’t really want to tear up my hip or anything.” That could be a warning for Murray on the lush grass that has often upended players early in the tournament. Wawrinka, who had two knee operations last year, said courtside: “In general it has been improving week after week. I feel strong physically but you need to be patient, ready to accept the frustration of not playing your best tennis. It’s never easy on the grass. But today was great.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/19/gareth-southgate-attacking-options-england-extra-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate says attacking options off bench give England extra hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/19/gareth-southgate-attacking-options-england-extra-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/19/gareth-southgate-attacking-options-england-extra-hope","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate says attacking options off bench give England extra hope","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate has pointed to the depth of England’s attacking options as cause for optimism after praising the impact made by his substitutes, Marcus Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, in the Group G victory against Tunisia on Monday. Two from Harry Kane eventually saw off stubborn opponents, with England eventually rewarded for their second-half patience having been pegged back by a soft penalty, conceded by Kyle Walker. Rashford and Loftus-Cheek staked their claims to be included from the start against Panama on Sunday with eye-catching cameos after replacing Raheem Sterling and Dele Alli in the second period, though it was deep into stoppage time before the captain nodded his side’s winner. Southgate had resisted switching systems in pursuit of a winner, but instead flung on fresh personnel who carried a different threat to pluck victory at the last. Loftus-Cheek barged forward at will down the right, while Rashford combined smartly with Kane and injected yet more pace into the frontline. “We talked about this with the players at St George’s Park over the last few weeks before coming to Russia,” the manager said. “The way we’ll change the game is by bringing on a different profile of players, who carry a different sort of threat. “When you are attacking, you need some structure to your play. You can put attacking players on in various positions, but you can lose shape and be counterattacked. Against Tunisia we kept control and the composure, but the guys who came on had a different threat. The freshness of Marcus and Ruben brought energy and a different threat to the one we’d posed. “They had a good impact on the game. That’s all you can do as a team. Keep working. We could have run out of time, but we would have been the dominant team. The best sides keep their belief in what they’re doing and break the opposition down in the end.” The win moved England level with Belgium at the top of the group before the second fixture against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday, with Southgate – who will check on the fitness of Alli back at the team’s base in Repino after he complained of discomfort in his quadricep muscles – wary of the threat that will be carried by the central Americans. “We have to prepare as perfectly for Panama as we did here to get the result we need,” he said. “It’s hard to win a match in the World Cup against anyone. Tunisia were respected. Panama were obdurate opponents against Belgium for 45 minutes [before losing 3-0], so we’ll have to prepare 100% for that game to get the right result. And remember, we are a team who are improving and developing. There will always be things we can get better at. We’re a long way from perfection. “What pleased me was there has been a long period of work gone into tonight’s result, from the players and the support team. If you don’t get the win, that can breed a bit of doubt. There’d be a different feel from the outside looking in, and the next few days would be a lot less comfortable. Now we have to enjoy this, but make sure we don’t stay too comfortable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/19/edible-coating-allows-avocados-to-stay-ripe-for-twice-as-long","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T12:00:11Z","webTitle":"Edible coating allows avocados to stay ripe for twice as long","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/19/edible-coating-allows-avocados-to-stay-ripe-for-twice-as-long","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/19/edible-coating-allows-avocados-to-stay-ripe-for-twice-as-long","fields":{"headline":"Edible coating allows avocados to stay ripe for twice as long","bodyText":"Avocados that stay ripe for twice as long as usual thanks to an edible barrier made from plant materials will be sold in the US for the first time this week. The tasteless coating, developed by Santa Barbara company Apeel Sciences, controls the two main factors that cause fresh produce to go bad: the rate at which water escapes the surface of fruit and vegetables and the rate at which oxygen enters. This allows treated produce to stay fresh for longer. “We’re creating an optimised microclimate that can double the shelf life [of the fruit],” said James Rogers, CEO of Apeel Sciences. “The average avocado might be ripe for 2-3 days. Ours will stay ripe for 4-6 days.” Apeel hopes its technology can also reduce the amount of fruit and vegetables that are thrown out by retailers and consumers because of spoilage. Americans throw away on average 400lb of food per person, costing a household of four about $1,800 per year. Although Apeel is starting with avocados, the coating’s formulation can be modified to create optimal conditions for other items including strawberries, mangoes, apples, bananas, kumquats and asparagus. Avocados were a priority because of their notoriously fleeting window of perfect ripeness and relatively high price. “Everyone has an experience of cutting into an avocado and discovering it’s past its prime,” said Rogers. “It’s a visceral reaction when you’ve spent a few dollars on something that ends up in the garbage.” From this week, the Apeel-treated avocados – grown by California-based Del Rey Avocado – will be available in Costco and Harp Foods stores across the midwest, before rolling out across the United States. Rogers says that in California, where a lot of fruit and vegetables are produced, it’s easier to find good quality items in the supermarket. “When you go anywhere besides California, the quality of fresh produce suffers,” he said, noting that the quality degrades the longer it takes to transport the produce. “We slow down the rate at which the clock is ticking.” Apeel’s coating is made from naturally occurring lipids extracted from discarded fruit or vegetable waste, including tomatoes, grapes, wasted seeds. These lipids are turned into a powder that can be reconstituted with water to create a dip or a spray. “Nature has been solving these problems for millions of years,” said Rogers. “We look at how nature has been protecting itself for years and copy those solutions. The coating can also extend the life of produce in developing countries where refrigeration is not widely available across the supply chain, which explains why the company launched in 2012 with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The company has carried out pilots in Nigeria and Kenya, treating cassava root and mangoes. “Our technology allows smaller farmers to get their produce from where it’s grown on their farm to city centres where they can earn the economic value associated with what they are producing,” said Rogers. Apeel isn’t the first company to tackle the scourge of the mushy avocado. In 2016 an Australian firm launched what it described as an “avocado time machine”, which slowed the browning process of the fruit by “switching off” the enzyme responsible for the browning using pressure fluctuations generated by steam. California-based avocado distributor Calavo uses a contraption called ProRipe VIP that measures how ripe the fruits is by “listening” to it. The machine taps the side of the avocado and then uses sensors to measure the acoustic response – that is, the way the fruit vibrates. This indicates overall firmness and freshness and allows Calavo to determine the ripeness of the tricky-to-judge flesh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/19/forced-separation-families-trump-katrina-moment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"The forced separation of families is Trump's 'Katrina moment' | Jill Abramson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/forced-separation-families-trump-katrina-moment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/forced-separation-families-trump-katrina-moment","fields":{"headline":"The forced separation of families is Trump's 'Katrina moment'","bodyText":"We all once watched a flood almost wash out the city of New Orleans and with it the presidency of George W Bush. It was the “Katrina moment”, named for the devastating hurricane of the same name in 2005, but famous for more than being a horrific storm. It was the moment when Americans recoiled from their president and the images of a struggling, mainly African American population packed into the stultifying Superdome or trekking on the city’s washed-out highways or standing on their roofs waiting for their government’s help while their leader falsely claimed that his emergency director was “doing a heck of a job”. This was not the America that people wanted the world to see. We are now witnessing Donald Trump’s Katrina moment. The American people will not tolerate having 2,000 migrant minors, many of them young children, separated from their parents, who themselves are being held at the border in what are effectively steel cages. This is not the America that even staunch conservatives want the world to see. Three first ladies, including Melania Trump, have called for an end to the boundless cruelty. Franklin Graham, the son of the late evangelical preacher Billy Graham, is trying to rally Trump’s Christian conservative base against the border spectacle. Trump is making Bush’s same fatal mistake. For days, as the chaos in New Orleans unspooled and turned into a humanitarian crisis, Bush stood aloof, continuing his vacation at his Texas ranch. On Sunday, as Beto O’Rourke, the Texas Democrat trying to unseat Senator Ted Cruz, led a march to one of the child detention facilities in Tornillo, Texas, Trump was hitting the links at his golf club near the White House. It’s the exact same heartlessness and cluelessness. In his book Decision Points, Bush wrote: “That photo of me hovering over the damage suggested I was detached from the suffering on the ground. That was not how I felt. But once that impression was formed, I couldn’t change it.” His political fortunes continued to slump deeper and deeper from that point on, ushering in the election of Barack Obama in 2008. What was striking back in 2005 was that Katrina was the culmination of so many disgusting Bush policies, including torture and massive incursions on civil liberties after 9/11 and the tragic, ill-conceived war in Iraq. Katrina was the culmination of a presidency that had turned rotten and the stench was impossible to ignore any longer. The forced separation of immigrant children at the border is the exact same phenomenon, just in a tighter time frame. The country has suffered through 18 months of a heartless, clueless presidency marked by lies, a betrayal of global alliances that have stood since the end of the second world war, the undoing of treaties and regulations that protect the environment, ceaseless attacks on the successful Obama healthcare plan and the undoing of many programs that help the poor, to name only some of the outrages. This disastrous zero tolerance immigration policy is merely the crescendo of a disastrous, young administration. Trump’s attempt to shift the blame to Democrats is laughable. Jeff Sessions’s use of the Bible to defend family separations is only one data point undermining this narrative. The New York Times published a meticulously reported article on Monday showing the genesis of the policy in the White House. It appears to be the brainchild of Steve Bannon’s Mini-me, Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, and the chief of staff, John Kelly, a like-minded hardliner who was homeland security chief before coming to the White House. Because she’s a Texas native and lived through the Katrina debacle, Laura Bush’s denunciation of the Trump policy is especially noteworthy and meaningful. Noting that 2,000 children have been sent to mass detention centers or foster care, she wrote in the Washington Post: “I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.” Of course, her op-ed was noteworthy also because she’s a Bush and the two former presidents Bush have been noticeably quiet on the issue of Donald Trump. They are presumably observing the normal tradition of former presidents not criticizing the current one. But these are not normal times and the silence of prominent Republicans on the heinous acts of this White House has been blood-chilling. The White House and the Congress are controlled by Republicans and they can change policy on a dime if they want to. Last week, Trump was promulgating the all-powerful presidency where he had the power to do anything he wants, including pardoning himself. How about pardoning the thousands of children who have been ripped from the arms of their parents? Americans everywhere should be marching behind O’Rourke and his allies. This is a situation that calls for mass civil disobedience if Congress will not act. We are the people and our government answers to us. We must disrupt the machinery of the border immigration enforcement system and stop the forced separation of children. This is not the America we want the world to see.

The Tottenham forward was wrestled to the ground by his marker at corners either side of half‑time as England heaved to re‑establish the lead surrendered to a relatively soft penalty, awarded against Kyle Walker. The referee, Wilmar Roldán, and the VAR determined neither incident worthy of review. As it was, Kane’s first goals at a major finals, converted from close range at set pieces, ensured England won their opening group game for the sixth time at a World Cup. “There could have been a couple of penalties, especially when you look at their one, which looked quite soft,” said Kane, whose two goals keep him in touch with Cristiano Ronaldo in the embryonic race for the golden boot. “The VAR is there to look at those decisions. If they don’t think it’s a penalty, we have to deal with it, but I struggled to get the Tunisia players off me all night. They were trying to grab hold, trying to stop us running, I couldn’t move at set pieces. So maybe there was a bit of justice at the end to get one at the back post. “For sure, the tactics Tunisia used were a lesson for us. It’s part of the game. We knew, watching the other matches, there have been a lot of soft decisions and penalties awarded, so we had to be aware of that. I’m just so proud we kept going, kept on fighting, and made people back home proud. It shows good character to get on with it, and it’s a massive win. We spoke a lot about togetherness. We have a great bond off the pitch and it’s nice to see it working on the pitch. Everyone, staff included, is delighted. We’ll get on that plane happy.” The team’s refusal to be dispirited at remaining level going into stoppage time despite their dominance – England created numerous opportunities – prompted praise from Gareth Southgate. “Even at 1‑1 I was really proud of the performance,” said the manager, whose team join Belgium in claiming maximum points from their first game in the section. “I’ve talked a lot in the weeks leading into this game about performance being key. That’s the bit we can control. There were things in the game we couldn’t control tonight, but we reacted really well to them. “If it had been 1‑1 there would have been a level of disappointment, and the result back home would be viewed differently, but the performance was very good. We created a lot of clear-cut chances in the first half, as many as I remember, and have to be more ruthless with those. But we recovered from a harsh decision, kept our composure, then kept our patience in the second half and looked for good opportunities rather than throwing the ball into the box and hoping. There was wave after wave of attack and we weren’t hit on the counter, so I liked the controlled manner in which we defended. “We had leaders on the field who kept delivering the right messages. We spoke this morning and covered being behind and in front in games, how we’d react being 1-1 with 15 minutes to go, and we had to keep probing and look for the win while not exposing ourselves on the counter … Maybe you run out of time, but we kept doing the right things and making good decisions. And good teams score late.” England will monitor Dele Alli, who felt discomfort in a quad muscle just before the interval and was eventually replaced by the excellent Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Alli departed saying he was hopeful the injury would not be serious. “We had to keep monitoring Dele,” Southgate said. “He was feeling a bit of an issue just before half-time, but felt he could carry on. The runs he was making was still causing problems, but we had good options on the bench. The freshness of Marcus [Rashford] and Ruben brought energy and a different threat to the ones we’d posed. They had a good impact on the game. So did the four forwards who started the game. Their movement and runs and interchanges were a real problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/18/rapper-xxxtentacion-shot-dead-in-florida","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T00:26:17Z","webTitle":"Rapper XXXTentacion shot dead in Florida","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/18/rapper-xxxtentacion-shot-dead-in-florida","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/18/rapper-xxxtentacion-shot-dead-in-florida","fields":{"headline":"Rapper XXXTentacion shot dead in Florida","bodyText":"Rapper XXXTentacion has been shot dead in Florida, authorities say. The 20-year-old Floridian, whose real name is Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was shopping for motorcycles when a gunman reportedly ran up to his vehicle and shot him, according to TMZ. His death was confirmed by the Broward sheriff’s office. In a statement, detectives said the rapper was approached by two armed suspects shortly before 4pm. “At least one of the suspects fired a gun striking Onfroy ... Both suspects fled in a dark color SUV. Investigators say it appears to be a possible robbery.” XXXTentacion’s most recent album, entitled ?, was a No 1 hit in the US this year and included the hits Sad! and Changes. His albums have so far sold over 2m units in the US. British TV presenter Louis Theroux described Onfroy in a tweet as a “huge talent” with “personal demons”. His music had briefly been taken off Spotify’s official playlists under the service’s “hateful conduct” policy in response to allegations that he attacked his girlfriend while she was pregnant. He was awaiting trial for that and other charges, including witness tampering. Onfroy has experienced legal troubles since the age of 16, when he was sent to a youth detention center for gun possession charges. In 2016, he was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. After being arrested again for aggravated battery of his pregnant girlfriend, he donated $100,000 to domestic violence prevention programs and announced an event to support rape victims. Last year, he was attacked and blamed the rap trio Migos yet later apologized after security footage showed them not to be involved. In an interview earlier this month with the Miami New Times, he talked about his history of violence which started in the classroom, where he attacked students in order to get his mother to pay him attention. “I used to beat kids at school just to get her to talk to me, yell at me,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/18/tunisia-england-world-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T05:45:39Z","webTitle":"Kane double ensures England defeat Tunisia in World Cup opener","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/18/tunisia-england-world-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/18/tunisia-england-world-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Kane double ensures England defeat Tunisia in World Cup opener","bodyText":"The clock had ticked past 90 minutes. Harry Kane was there and, in that position, Gareth Southgate could not have wished for any other player to be primed inside the penalty area. An old English routine: the corner, the flick-on, the back-post header and, suddenly, England’s opening game of the World Cup had its happy ending. It was deserved, too, bearing in mind the pattern of the game and the long spells when it had been threatening to finish with a churning sense of déjà vu. England, after all, had managed only five wins in their opening fixtures of every World Cup and European Championship since 1950. They had outplayed Tunisia without outscoring them and, at 1-1, a draw would have pained Southgate, to say the least, given the number of chances his team had passed up to make it a more straightforward evening. But when has it ever been straightforward with England? Kane had already scored from one corner and the team had played so thrillingly it was bordering on absurd that the game had reached the end of normal time without them being in a winning position. Tunisia’s equaliser had come from a penalty that could be described, at best, as generous – or from England’s perspective, utterly needless – and for a long time it seemed as though Southgate’s players did not have the wit or creativity to turn their superiority into the hard currency of goals. Enter Kane. His late, twisting header means England can qualify for the knockout stages by defeating Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday and the final game of Group G against Belgium may not be so relevant. England can therefore leave Volgograd reflecting on a hugely satisfying evening, full of drama and incident, and nobody can possibly argue the result was unjust. England were the better team by some distance, even if they did play with everyone’s nerves. Southgate certainly kept to his word that his players would deliver fluid, energetic performances with an emphasis on attack. They were quick to the ball, slick with their passing and attacked with so much adventure, particularly in the first half, that there were countless occasions when they outnumbered their opponents at the back. The pressure on Tunisia was almost unremitting and, even ignoring for a moment Kane’s goals, it must have been hugely encouraging for Southgate to see the vibrancy of his team, the number of chances they concocted and the desire of the midfieldersto break into the opposition penalty area. Unfortunately for Southgate, there was also a reminder here of England’s recurring ability to make life more difficult for themselves than necessary. On that front nothing has changed. It was difficult to keep a count of the number of chances – not just half-chances but wonderful openings – England totted up throughout the night. How much less stressful everything might have been, for instance, if England had been more ruthless inside the opening few minutes. An offside flag spared Sterling’s embarrassment with an open-goal miss after four minutes. It was a fairly staggering moment, all the same. Yet in fairness to Sterling he was not the only England player to be guilty of poor finishing during a wild, breathless opening half. One by one, the chances came and went. Jesse Lingard had a golden opportunity, at 1-0, to double England’s lead and, later on, prodded a shot against a post. John Stones wasted a gilt-edged chance shortly after Tunisia’s penalty, with Dele Alli’s looping back-header being turned against the crossbar moments earlier, and there was some splendid goalkeeping from Mouez Hassen before he was forced off with a shoulder injury. Hassen had stopped Lingard from giving England the lead after only two minutes and Tunisia’s goalkeeper was unlucky for Kane’s first goal, 11 minutes in, when Ashley Young delivered the corner and Stones showed great desire to get to the ball first. Hassen clawed away Stones’ header but the ball fell kindly for Kane and he turned in the rebound from close range. All of this seemed a far cry from the last time England were seen in a major competition, namely the ordeal against Iceland in Euro 2016. Southgate’s men set off like a team in a hurry. They have had to be patient, with six of the other World Cup groups already under way, and it quickly became apparent they were determined to make a favourable impression. Once they had the lead, however, they were far too slack in letting Tunisia back into the match through a combination of penalty-box misses, some bad luck and the penalty that Kyle Walker gave away for blocking off Fakhredinne Ben Youssef in the 34th minute. England are entitled to be aggrieved by the decision of the Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldán, and the exaggerated agony of the Tunisia player to create the deception. Equally it should be a lesson for Walker that in the modern international game it is taking a risk to jut out a trailing arm when an opponent is in close proximity. Walker has a habit of disrupting players this way and on this occasion it backfired. Ferjani Sassi took the penalty, beating Jordan Pickford to the goalkeeper’s right. And England were back level again in a game they had been controlling. They should have won a penalty of their own when Kane was pulled to the floor in the same incident that led to Stones firing wide and, after the interval, England continued to press forward. Sterling, with only two goals now in 38 England appearances, was taken off in that period and his replacement, Marcus Rashford, quickly started to threaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who came on after Alli complained about soreness in a thigh, also had a positive impact and, importantly, England kept going. Even when the ball was not running for them, they persevered. And then, finally, came the decisive corner in the first minute of stoppage time. Kieran Trippier put the ball into the penalty area. Harry Maguire won the first header. And Kane was there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/18/space-force-donald-trump-orders-new-branch-of-us-military","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T05:44:35Z","webTitle":"'Space force': Trump orders new branch of US military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/space-force-donald-trump-orders-new-branch-of-us-military","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/space-force-donald-trump-orders-new-branch-of-us-military","fields":{"headline":"'Space force': Trump orders new branch of US military","bodyText":"Donald Trump said on Monday he would direct the Pentagon to create a “space force” as a new branch of the US military to shore up American dominance in space. Trump claimed that the plan will ensure that America, which plans a return to the moon and a mission to Mars, stays ahead of China and Russia in any new space race. But it is likely to raise fears over the militarisation of space and prompted a slew of Twitter parodies featuring Star Trek and Star Wars. “Very importantly, I’m hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces,” the president said at the White House. “That’s a big statement. We are going to have the air force and we are going to have the space force – separate but equal. It is going to be something so important.” Trump asked Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to carry out the assignment. Dunford replied: “We got it.” The president added: “Let’s go get it, general. But that’s the importance that we give it. We’re going to have the space force.” The president was speaking at the third meeting of the National Space Council, revived after a quarter of a century. He was joined by Mike Pence, the new Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine and former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. But there was a sceptical reaction from Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator for Florida, home of Cape Canaveral. He tweeted: “The president told a US general to create a new Space Force as 6th branch of military today, which generals tell me they don’t want. Thankfully the president can’t do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many important missions at stake.” During his remarks, Trump promised that America will always be first in space and that national pride is at stake. “It’s going to be important monetarily and militarily,” he added. “But so important for right up here – the psyche. We don’t want China and Russia and other countries leading us.” He insisted: “When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space. So important.” Trump has floated the idea of a space force before but met both mockery and high-level resistance. Last October, his own defence secretary Jim Mattis wrote in a memo: “I oppose the creation of a new military service and additional organizational layers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint warfighting functions.” On Monday Trump also signed a policy directive for reducing satellite clutter in space. It sets up new guidelines for satellite design and operation to avoid collisions and spacecraft breakups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-crisis-20bn-standstill-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T17:53:12Z","webTitle":"The NHS crisis will go on: this is a plan that no one believes in | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-crisis-20bn-standstill-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-crisis-20bn-standstill-budget","fields":{"headline":"The NHS crisis will go on: this is a plan that no one believes in","bodyText":"It’s quite an achievement to spend £20bn and leave nobody satisfied. The NHS in England is not celebrating: this is not feast after famine. The Tory right is indignant about unspecified tax rises to pay for it, or – total anathema – spendthrift borrowing for current spending. Austerity is not over, Theresa May says firmly, so all the other starved departments will see no easing of the eight-year tourniquet that is cutting off the lifeblood of public services: schools, further education, police, prisons, transport and councils. Only Boris Johnson says: “Fantastic news for NHS funding!” But the illusion of his bogus Brexit bus money is over. No corner of the NHS – none of the bodies representing its trusts, nor any serious NHS economists or thinktanks – responded to the prime minister’s announcement with anything but despondency. After token words of gratitude for her embrace of the NHS’s founding values, the chorus says this is far too little. This can’t deliver her hyperbolic promises of “profound transformation”. Britain will not be world-leading, with patients “never left waiting” for A&amp;E and cancer treatment so “everyone gets the right care … at the right time”. Nor will there be “true parity of care” for patients with mental-health problems. Politically, will it fly? Hearing this enormous-sounding sum, for a while voters may hope that it heralds the end of the crisis in the health service, and wait to feel its effects. In the end they will make their decision based on what they see in GP surgeries and local hospitals, as well as the fly-on-the-wall documentaries of overflowing A&amp;Es and vital operations cancelled. But it looks unlikely that this apparent 3.4% uplift in the annual budget will make those things improve any time soon – or at all. Phenomenal diligence and resilience from NHS staff may stop things getting worse, so next winter’s crisis may be no worse than the last. The NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, was tactful when he said: “There will still be difficult choices to make about priorities.” Yes, with yawning gaps in care. Spending on the NHS has fallen as a share of GDP, causing 4 million people to be on the waiting list for the first time. Many of the rising number of over-65s arriving in A&amp;E are there because of a lack of social care, leaving a million people with no care at home. Where will the new money go? To start with, it’s only 3%: crafty accounting has cunningly omitted funds for public health, training of staff and capital spending – such as the gigantic backlog of repairs. Just about every health economist, including those at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned that the NHS needs 4% just to stand still. How the health service fares will depend on social care funding – but May delayed that decision until next year’s spending review. Here’s how the money will vanish before our eyes. A service parched dry will absorb every new penny just to stay on its feet. Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, spells it out: £2bn will be sucked into debts sitting within most trusts; £1.3bn will go into still unpaid pay rises next April, after all these pay-frozen years; £1bn is urgently needed for the maintenance backlog, with scanners and equipment falling apart. The staff shortage crisis is growing, not shrinking: there are 1,500 fewer GPs than two years ago, as these vital gatekeepers retire early in exhaustion. The fewer there are, the greater the strain on the rest – it’s a downward spiral. Take just one typical district general hospital. Kingston hospital, in southwest London, like two-thirds of trusts, has a £6m debt to clear if any new money comes its way. It received no share of the last bung, because perversely it was denied to any hospital in debt. The result was all the money went to already well-off trusts. Kingston’s chief executive, Ann Radmore, talks about the dearth of staff and the loss of EU nurses who make up 15% of the staff: with a 96% drop in nurses arriving from Europe last year, here’s a true Brexit dividend. She describes a recent steep cut in training funds as a disaster for motivating those staff she has. The reason why the NHS keeps needing more money is stark here: in her medical wards, half her patients suffer from dementia, so A&amp;E and outpatients are “challenging”. She still has staff working in 19th-century buildings, but nothing is done due to a longstanding political stalemate about reconfiguring local hospitals. A weak government fails to solve the many local stand-offs, because with no money to ease the path, nobody dares close or move an A&amp;E or maternity unit. The right wing and its press castigates the NHS for waste and “bureaucracy” – but the greatest waste is caused by the monumental assault of Andrew Lansley’s Health and Social Care Act 2012, shattering the health service into erratic fragments competing against each other. The bureaucracy of tendering for every contract has been phenomenal. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, struggles to repair the damage, merging most commissioners who hold the local purse strings. But in its state of inertia, the government dares not risk another NHS bill to sweep all this away and integrate social care under single regional authorities: Stevens is left wriggling round the law. In front of the Commons public accounts committee yesterday, Stevens gave a pusillanimous response. Yes, he said, this was indeed more money than the NHS had in recent years – but he knows, as does the whole of the health service, that this will bring no “transformation”. This stagnant funding can’t repair the last eight years of strangulation, the longest and worst NHS crisis in all its 70 years: voters will judge from the evidence of their own eyes, and they will judge this government harshly. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/19/morning-mail-trump-on-attack-queensland-abortion-fight-england-win","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T21:07:50Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Trump fires back on child separation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/19/morning-mail-trump-on-attack-queensland-abortion-fight-england-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/19/morning-mail-trump-on-attack-queensland-abortion-fight-england-win","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Trump fires back on child separation","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 19 June. Top stories Donald Trump has defended his administration’s controversial practice of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border, declaring “the United States will not be a migrant camp”. Nearly 2,000 children and their parents have been separated over the past six weeks, drawing criticism from prominent members of Congress, human rights advocates and religious leaders. Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, called the practice “contrary to our values in this country” and said it was “traumatising” to the children caught in the centre of an already polarising debate over immigration in Washington. But the president defended the approach. “You look at what’s happening in Europe,” he said, “you look at what’s happening in other places, we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” Our Q&amp;A has more background on why children are being separated from their parents. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning An evangelical group has stepped up demonstrations outside several Brisbane abortion clinics before expected law changes in Queensland. Witnesses confirm there have been heated verbal clashes between members of the group and clinic patients, with Pro Choice Queensland mobilising volunteers to escort women into clinics. Sinead Canning from Pro Choice Queensland described the interactions as “pretty confronting”. “Some people might go into those clinics with ectopic pregnancy or a wanted pregnancy [with complications] … they’re faced with pretty rabid harassment.” Attacks on Labor’s policy costing have been undermined, with the Parliamentary Budget Office defending the modelling after criticism from Scott Morrison and News Corp papers. Labor was accused of creating a “$10bn blackhole”, with the treasurer claiming the opposition had overestimated the revenue it expected to collect. But the PBO head, Jenny Wilkinson, has denied claims of inaccuracy. “The PBO brings our best professional judgment to the independent policy costing advice we provide,” she said. “We have access to the same data and economic parameters as the Treasury.” The conservative candidate Iván Duque has been elected as Colombia’s next president in a vote that could have ramifications for the historic peace deal with Farc rebels. The 2016 deal to end a 52-year civil war came with guarantees of softer sentencing for rebel leaders and guaranteed seats in congress, concessions Duque has vowed to revisit. Farc’s initial response has been conciliatory. Its wartime leader, Rodrigo Londoño, responded: “We have lived the quietest elections of the last decades, the peace process bears fruit. It is a moment of greatness and reconciliation.” A German NGO could hold the key to survival for a critically endangered Australian parrot but the government faces criticism for outsourcing its responsibility. The Coalition helped broker a $200,000 agreement for a Berlin-based agency to protect the western ground parrot but has only committed $80,000 of its own money to protect the rare bird. “Governments are increasingly trying to shift the cost of threatened species conservation on to communities and philanthropic organisations by touting the value of ‘partnerships’,” said Jenny Lau of Birdlife Australia. Sport England have stunned their own disbelieving country by winning a World Cup match for the first time since 2010, although it took an injury-time winner from Harry Kane to secure a 2-1 win over Tunisia. Earlier, Belgium threw down a gauntlet to many of the tournament favourites with an emphatic 3-0 win over Panama, while Sweden defeated South Korea 1-0. Nick Kyrgios says he regards Andy Murray as “one of my better mates on tour” and the Australian says it is good to see the former world No 1 back as the two prepare to meet at Queen’s. “It’s been pretty shitty without him. I’m looking forward to going out there and playing. But to see him healthy is obviously the main thing. He’s awesome for the sport.” Thinking time Silent grief and anger washed over the vigil for Eurydice Dixon in Melbourne last night, writes Gay Alcorn. Thousands of people rugged up against the damp and the cold, standing on all sides of a circle of flowers. There was barely a sound – just a rustle of a puffer jacket, a distant car engine, a baby crying. Behind them, the grey Melbourne sky faded to black. They had come for the most personal of reasons, and for the most political. Phoebe Montague placed geraniums she and her young daughter had picked from their garden. Almost every day, she takes her child to play in Princes Park, where Dixon’s body was found. The silent demonstration should be followed by AFL clubs sending a statement about men’s violence, writes Kate O’Halloran. Underemployment is not far below record highs, so what effect will this have on wages growth? Greg Jericho examines the curious change since 2015 that undermines the narrative of improving wages and low unemployment. “The more people who want to work more hours, the fewer people need to be hired to do new jobs – employers can (should they wish) just give more hours to those already working for them, and they don’t need to increase the hourly wage to entice them to work more hours.” We all know a “helicopter parent” – but what are the effects of this parenting style on toddlers and children? According to new research, it could mean problems in later life relating to impulse and emotion control, writes Nicola Davis. “Parents who are over-controlling are most often very well-intentioned and are trying to support and be there for their children,” says a research co-author, Dr Nicole Perry. “However, to foster emotional and behavioural skills parents should allow children to experience a range of emotions and give them space to practice and try managing these emotions independently.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has blamed the Democrats for “the world’s worst immigration laws” and claimed “children are being used” by criminals, to justify his policy on parent-child separations. He also claims Germans are “turning against their leadership” owing to liberal migration policies and crime in Germany is “way up” (it isn’t). Media roundup The Herald Sun gives due prominence to the vigil in Princes Park for Eurydice Dixon, attended by more than 10,000 people. The Age reports that Pauline Hanson’s One Nation is at risk of breaching electoral rules, with a letter to the NSW Electoral Commission revealing doubts over the party’s registration in that state. And the Daily Telegraph highlights the prime minister’s demand for an explanation from Optus about the debacle of its World Cup coverage. Coming up The ABC’s managing director, Michelle Guthrie, will give a speech at the Melbourne Press Club today, with supporters and opponents of the public broadcaster keenly awaiting her response to recent attacks and the $84m budget cut. In Canberra, both major parties will hold caucus meetings, with Labor expected to decide its final stance on the government’s tax proposals.

The new status needs qualification. First, in terms of lending in the UK, the combination will still be substantially less than half the size of the fifth largest bank. Second, a large building society, Nationwide, also operates in the same market; it has 15 million members versus the 6 million customers under the combined wings of CYBG and Virgin. The big banks, in other words, are probably not trembling in fear of an earthquake. Remember that Lloyds Banking Group last year quietly forked out a greater sum – £1.9bn – to get bigger in credit cards by buying MBNA’s UK operation and could call its expansion a modest bolt-on. Still, the CYBG-Virgin deal makes sense for the two parties involved. Both needed to do something. CYBG’s two brands, Clydesdale and Yorkshire, do not travel well outside their home turf and the previous plan to create an entirely new digital brand, to be called B, sounded hopeful and expensive. It is safer to rebrand everything as Virgin, even at a cost of £60m. On the Virgin side, both main engines are at risk of developing a splutter. On mortgages, the big lenders are feeling more aggressive now that their capital ratios are healthier. On credit cards, the game of chasing growth via zero-interest teaser rates probably has diminishing returns. CYBG is concentrated in personal accounts and small business lending, so the fit is excellent on paper. And the promised annual cost savings of £120m, to be secured for a one-off hit of £240m (on top of the rebranding bill), look decent – the figure is slightly more than the City expected. But it’s no surprise to see that the clearest winner will be Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Enterprises, owner of the Virgin Money brand. Virgin Money was paying £8m annually for the licence, but the sum under CYBG will rise to £12m and then to £15m, or more if turnover targets are met. One can admire Branson’s skill in pushing his brand deeper into financial services – first with the Northern Rock deal, now with CYBG. Alternatively, it is depressing that, even in an age of supposed technological revolution, CYBG feels the need to write a fat cheque every year to the bearded one in order to get noticed. From the point of the banking beasts, the competitive landscape still looks solid. Ofwat as unprepared as water firms over ‘beast of the east’ The main finding from Ofwat’s review of water companies’ failures during the “beast from the east” episode is that the regulatory system for compensating customers isn’t up to scratch. Ofwat, naturally, took a few swings at the culprits for failing to run networks that could withstand the big freeze and rapid thaw. Severn Trent, South East Water, Southern Water and Thames have been told to produce plans to demonstrate how they would do better next time. But the revelation was that only £7m has been paid to customers in compensation so far, a figure that was itself inflated because some firms paid more than statutory minimums. That is across 200,000 customers who Ofwat says were cut off from supply for more than four hours, including the 60,000 off for more than 12 hours. Why so little compensation. Well, the limits seem too low. A payment of up to £150 for 48 to 72 hours interruption seems inadequate for those obliged also to take time off work or arrange emergency childcare in cases where schools were closed. Ofwat says it is “concerned” that current compensation range are “not reflective” of the impact on customers and it will launch another review. Put another way, the regulator was as unprepared as the companies whose performance it is criticising. Wind-up or slip, Norwegian Air should exploit takeover talk Normal form is to keep your acquisition strategy secret until you are obliged to say something, but Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Lufthansa, seems bizarrely keen to spill the beans. “Everyone in Europe is talking to everyone right now,” he told German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. “There is another wave of consolidation. This means that we are also in contact with Norwegian.” One assumes his interest in Norwegian Air is serious. The only alternative explanation is that Spohr is winding up Willie Walsh at IAG, owner of British Airways. IAG, owner of 4.6% of Norwegian, has made two approaches already and would be infuriated to lose out. In Norwegian shoes, you’d exploit the competitive tension for all it’s worth – and do it soon.

He would ask, ‘Harrison, can you make magic?’ Anything less wasn’t acceptable.” Funk was the photographer who got closer to Michael Jackson than any other, working with the singer from the late 1970s right up until his death in June 2009, witnessing and capturing his many changes, as the star rose to be the most famous person on the planet. Funk was born 12 days before Jackson, on 17 August 1958, just outside Brooklyn. He was inspired to pick up a camera by his uncle, Leo Friedman, a famous Broadway photographer. Starting off with street photography and shooting local basketball matches, Funk worked his way up to such magazines as Time, Life and Newsweek. But a chance meeting with Jackson at New York’s infamous nightclub Studio 54 (where Jackson, a regular, would dance in the DJ booth to avoid autograph-hunters) set Funk’s career on a different trajectory. Impressed by his versatility, Jackson employed Funk as the official photographer for the Jacksons’ Victory tour in 1984. Funk says he quickly sensed the media circus that was starting to form around the singer: “Rupert Murdoch’s people called and practically begged me to sneak out a photo of Michael from rehearsals. I told Michael and we laughed about it – but the fact I told him built up a trust.” Subsequently, while on the Victory tour, Funk was given unprecedented access to the singer. One intimate photo taken by Funk captures Jackson applying his own makeup, something he took great pride in. “Him and Jermaine [Jackson] loved putting on their own makeup,” says the photographer, who adds that Michael became more and more interested in his appearance, more determined to look sharp, under the influence of such mentors as Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and James Brown. Jackson’s make-up routine, adds Funk, was also a sign of the singer’s gender fluidity: “It wasn’t so much femininity on Michael’s part as androgyny – he was fluid around gender. Michael had no interest in assigning a gender to anybody.” At that moment, he recalls, “he didn’t overtly identify as one particular gender”. However, when Jackson became a dad, his image changed to that “of father”, Funk says. “He became a strong man in that sense.” On the Victory tour, Funk was exposed to occasional outbursts. “Don’t be fooled,” he says. “Michael had very demanding moments. If he didn’t like something, he let you know. Michael was never ridiculing to me ever, but if someone messed up the design of his stage, then he would yell at them. He expected perfection.” The sold-out Victory tour was a turning point for Jackson. Just two years earlier, he released Thriller to stratospheric acclaim, and the media circus was now starting to spiral out of control. Yet some of Funk’s most iconic images of Jackson aren’t from his undisputed reign in the 1980s, but from the 1990s – when albums Dangerous and HIStory marked the singer’s evolution into a more socially conscious artist, who could be both profound (Black and White) and ridiculous (the messiah complex of The Earth Song was so jarring it provoked Jarvis Cocker to storm the stage during the 1996 Brits). In one of Funk’s favourite shots from this period, Jackson can be seen holding his arms out in an almost biblical pose. “People say Michael had a Jesus complex,” he says, “but that pisses me off, as it just wasn’t true. There was a practical reason for me taking that photo. Michael had huge hands and I wanted to make the most of them as they were expressive – and a good way for him to embrace the world. At that stage, his whole existence was geared towards healing the world, so having big, expressive hands was a very important way to speak to the people.” The way he communicated with his hands, adds the photographer, “you’d have thought he was Italian!” Another Funk photo shows Jackson holding a book in front his face. It is an intensely personal shot intended as an advert for the World Book Encyclopedia, which would be distributed to American classrooms. “The art director gave me carte blanche to do what I wanted, so I really wanted to push the limits of what was possible. Michael’s eyes were his most defining feature, way more than his feet. I knew I could capture his soul by focusing on his eyes and that’s exactly what happened with that photo.” But was Jackson actually covering his face due to shyness? “Maybe. But his shyness and introversion never hindered his ability to work with me as a photographer. Michael knew exactly what he wanted artistically, right up until probably the last two years of his life, where he got swayed by the wrong people and got in way over his head.” This was the time of the This Is It tour, which Funk had been due to photograph. Jackson was all set to play 50 dates in quick succession at the O2 Arena in London. But, 20 days before the opening night, he died from cardiac arrest, triggered by acute anaesthetics intoxication. “As much as I don’t like talking about the end,” says Funk, “I will say he got destroyed by people who only had their own financial interests at heart. I can tell you that a big part of his plans following the This Is It tour was to do charity work and use his influence to better mankind.” In 2003, Jackson was charged with child molestation, only to later be acquitted. The memory still angers Funk. “All the accusations and crap he went through,” he says. “Let me ask you this: what is a better way to ruin someone who is going to make massive positive changes to the children of the world than to discredit them?” Jackson’s awareness of the power of photography was perhaps best illustrated in the early 1990s, when he asked Funk to shoot him with Elizabeth Taylor and Nelson Mandela, who had recently been released from prison. The image, which Funk describes as the highlight of his career, shows the trio smiling infectiously. “Mandela was so excited to meet Michael,” says Funk. “He flew in all of his family especially. I was told by the publicists I had no time to shoot, but Michael kicked them all out and let me take my time. I didn’t want a boring photo so I suggested they jump on each other’s backs and hug one another. Liz Taylor said, ‘Harrison, you know I’ve got a bad back!’ And Nelson said he was too old and joked he wanted to put his feet up instead. I tried to capture the joy of this incredible moment.” Funk then watched as the three went into a meeting room to discuss plans to topple apartheid, improve women’s rights, tackle the Aids crisis, and address crime in Africa. He claims Jackson was acutely aware of how the photo could help Mandela’s bid for the South African presidency. “That image was in something like 400 newspapers. It was real powerful. The next year, Michael went to Africa to shoot the They Don’t Care About Us video. He would have done anything for Nelson – Michael and Liz gave his presidential campaign a very generous donation. I believe he and Nelson got on so well as Michael was like the Mandela of music, in the sense that he too broke down a lot of barriers. Remember, Michael was one of the first global black superstars.” But Jackson’s image started to change dramatically. Some critics accused the singer of being ashamed of his blackness, and of gaining a dangerous obsession with plastic surgery. In a recent interview, Thriller producer Quincy Jones said: “I used to kill [Michael] about the plastic surgery, man. He’d always justify it and say it was because of some disease he had. Bullshit … He had a problem with his looks because his father told him he was ugly and abused him. What do you expect?” Funk, however, insists Jackson was actually the victim of a “cruel” media campaign and was suffering from the pigment-destroying skin disease vitiligo (a claim confirmed by Dr Christopher Rogers, who carried out Jackson’s autopsy). “It was all a load of bullshit,” Funk says of these reports. “He didn’t want to look white or find a way out. He was immensely proud to be a black man. Michael was suffering from a cruel skin disease, which changed his appearance, and I had to rise to this as his photographer and adapt his lighting. I think the problem was Michael wanted badly for his skin to look even-toned. I didn’t have Photoshop back then so I lit Michael myself and had specific techniques to make him look at his best.” Funk, who seems to have an endless supply of Jackson stories, speaks softly in a New York accent, energetically recalling their nine consecutive rides on Space Mountain at Disneyland. Jackson attempted to persuade Funk to ride it for a 10th time but by then the photographer felt sick and his legs had turned to jelly. They would also regularly take the Viking boat ride at Jackson’s Neverland ranch. “I was sitting across from Michael,” says Funk, “shooting him with my camera, as he told the guy controlling the ride to go higher and higher. I screamed at Michael that he’d make me lose my camera. He screamed back, ‘I don’t want to lose my cookies!” These were in his shirt pocket. Yet, for all the fun they had together, Funk’s most cherished memory of Jackson is a dark one. He remembers sitting with the singer in the home theatre of his Neverland ranch while watching What’s Love Got To Do With It, the 1993 biopic about the abusive relationship between Ike and Tina Turner, when Jackson began to cry. “The scene where Ike beats on Tina was playing and Michael started to tear up. I asked him if he wanted me to stop the film but he signalled to keep it rolling. He squeezed my hand tightly. I really felt his humanity in that moment. “After the film ended, we walked out of the theatre and Michael asked me to go do bumper cars with him.” Funk laughs. “We played pretty nasty and really went for one another. He was like a big kid.” Jackson was not the only star who turned to Funk. The photographer is currently planning a London exhibition of his work, which also includes shots of David Bowie, Tina Turner and Amy Winehouse, though the king of pop will of course dominate. This will be an interesting postscript to On the Wall, the show about to open at the National Portrait Gallery that looks at how Jackson was portrayed in paintings and photography. Funk, who is based in Los Angeles, is quite happy to let his career be defined by his shots of Jackson. While daydreaming, he sometimes hears the singer’s voice, imploring him one more time. “Let’s make magic,” it says. Michael Jackson: On the Wall is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, 28 June to 21 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
