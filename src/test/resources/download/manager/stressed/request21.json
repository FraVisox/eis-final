Every day, more than 2 million birds are consumed: spiced up as drumsticks or curry-sauced thighs or succulently ham-wrapped breasts. But there is perhaps no other area of food production where what we eat has become so distant from what happens to it on the way to the plate. It is not a process for the faint-hearted: and as an investigation by the Guardian and ITV has found, it can also break the law. Undercover reporters who took jobs with 2 Sisters Food Group (2SFG) found workers at the company’s processing plant in West Bromwich packing chicken pieces that had been picked up off the floor, mixing fresh with less-fresh meat and fiddling key information about slaughter dates in a way that might have meant customers were misled about use-by dates. It ought to shame the industry. But on past evidence, it is hard to believe that it will. For this is not the first such scandal: two years ago, another Guardian investigation at a different site run by the same company found offal piled up in processing areas and other breaches of food hygiene that could have spread the campylobacter bacteria which contaminates most uncooked chicken. Nor are the problems unique to poultry. In a scandal involving other food processors, two men were jailed for their part in a conspiracy to pass off horsemeat as beef. The wrongdoing was first exposed by the Guardian nearly five years ago. That investigation triggered a detailed report from Professor Chris Elliott, which demanded urgent and comprehensive change to the policing of food safety. One result was a National Food Crime Unit, set up in 2015 within the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to keep the food chain honest – but it is without prosecution powers. That has to change. Food processing employs more than 400,000 people and contributes £20bn to the economy. It is the UK’s biggest manufacturing business and also involves multiple players across Europe, driven by an acutely price-sensitive environment. There is both motive and opportunity for food crime which, according to the food science department at Queen’s University in Belfast, can range from adulteration and contamination to misrepresentation. Some are more serious than others: olives are presented as fresh when they were harvested a year earlier; dried herbs are padded out with other greenery. Others, like the horsemeat scandal, do not just mislead but offend against food cultures. And always, with food, a few can risk human health. A well-resourced police and inspection force ought to be the first line of defence against food crime. But local police forces are reluctant to add to their responsibilities. Cash-strapped local authorities have slashed services such as food safety inspectors. There are also questions about the value of inspections. The FSA, in its response to the Guardian investigation, confirmed the company’s claim that it had nine audits, five of them unannounced, in July and August and none of them found anything wrong. 2SFG, which processes 6 million chickens a week, insists that the hygiene and safety of its products are its priorities. Food processors operate in the harshest of environments. The British grocery business, dominated by half a dozen major names from Tesco to Waitrose, is locked in fierce competition in which quality and price are the two big variables. Producers’ margins are squeezed to the bone and their costs are constantly reviewed. Of course, any allegation of food crime hits turnover (and share price) hard: within hours of the publication of the Guardian/ITV reports on Thursday, it was reported that one of 2SFG’s smaller customers – a butchers’ chain – had lost 10% of its value. But price rises hit turnover too. Yet compromising on standards in the name of “value” is an unsustainable choice that consumers should not be asked to make – let alone have made for them. This article was corrected on 9 October 2017. 2SFG processes 6 million chickens a week, not a year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/30/celebrity-interview-bullying-behaviour-balding-saga","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T23:03:01Z","webTitle":"How BBC star Clare Balding nicked my byline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/30/celebrity-interview-bullying-behaviour-balding-saga","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/30/celebrity-interview-bullying-behaviour-balding-saga","fields":{"headline":"How BBC star Clare Balding nicked my byline","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"After 35 years as a journalist, I experienced two firsts last week. One was that I asked for my byline to be removed from an interview I had written, which was a direct consequence of the other first: the subject of my interview being given, without my prior knowledge, copy control and – in a breathtaking liberty – removing sections of my interview and replacing them with her own, self-promoting, words. Who is this insecure diva who does not know better about what should be an essential divide between journalism and public relations? It must be one of those Hollywood actors, you might think, represented by aggressively image-controlling agents. Well, it is disappointing to report that it is one of the nation’s darlings and a champion of other women, particularly right now in the battle for equal pay at the BBC. Yes, it’s all-round good egg Clare Balding. In our interview, Balding talked about how much she loves the corporation. But the BBC’s badge of honour – its most cherished tenet – is editorial independence: how could one of its most recognised female broadcasters think it is acceptable to demand not only to see an article about her before publication, but then to change the words – making it look as though they were said in the interview and recorded by the journalist? This is obviously, for a start, unsisterly and undermining of a fellow woman professional. More importantly, there is an unwritten pact between a publication’s journalist and reader – certainly in reputable publications, which Saga (the magazine in question) is – that what they read is real. The deal is that the celebrity gets their new book or film promoted to a wider public by dint of being on the cover of the magazine – as Balding is in the October issue, for her new children’s book – and a mention of the product in question. What they don’t get – or should never get – is permission to make alterations to the journalist’s interview before publication. And, beyond that they do not get to substitute their own words as though this is what they have said in the interview! Some might be tempted to shrug. “It’s only an interview with a showbiz personality. Who cares if they have copy control?” But, as one of my editor friends says: “It does matter because it erodes the integrity of our public print and means the public stop believing anything they read. Also, just because someone is famous and powerful, they should not be able to bully a publication into writing what they want printed.” “Even the silliest of celebrities use their profile to make pronouncements on all manner of issues, so it’s quite right that they are questioned fairly and independently.” So how did this Saga setback happen? I have been assured by the magazine staff to whom I complained that it is not normal practice for them to give celebrities copy control. In this case, Dawn French – the intended cover – dropped out at the last minute and Balding was a rapidly found substitute. Did Saga’s editor agree to the unacceptable because she was in a jam? And if so, why not get Balding to write the piece herself? In our interview, Balding was friendly and unprickly, talking about a range of subjects – happy to be revealing about the sides of professional life she found tricky. The features editor wrote to me saying the written up interview was “absolutely lovely” but could I add a couple of sentences about Balding’s sports commentary achievements and also say how “lovely” she was – and put this quite near the beginning of the article. (I wrote back to say that I could not: “I don’t think I can write about her being incredibly warm because that is not my experience of her. She is quite a brisk, jolly-hockey-sticks type, and that is how I have written her.” Despite this, the piece will appear with these mincing words inserted: “And indeed she sparkles all the way through the photo shoot.”) By the end of that day, I’d been sent a copy of the pages and that, I thought, was that. The next day, I receive an email from the editor, Katy Bravery, apologising but adding: “Clare and her agent have complained that there is way too much about her being gay in the interview, and I have to say I agree.” Wow! Apart from anything else, the idea that in this year – the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisaton of homosexuality, for which Balding has done some broadcasts – one of the very few leading lesbians in British public life could find an article “too gay” was flabbergasting. This was very late in the day for the editor to come back to me: the piece was supposed to have gone off to the printers the previous week. I phoned her to say that I was shocked that “Clare and her agent” had been sent the piece for copy control, and Bravery’s response was that it was more like “copy approval”, and I wondered about the difference. Worse was to come. I asked the features editor to send me the new, doctored, gay-reduced version – as, after all, the piece would have my name attached to it. She wrote back: “I have attached the new version, which I hope you will see has changed little from your original copy – with a few quotes from your longer version added, together with a couple of quotes from Clare about football.” A couple of quotes from Clare! Had we reached a new low where interview subjects could write their own copy masquerading as that of an independent journalist? What had Balding inserted? A paragraph or two about her hosting the women’s European football championships in the summer and then… a shameless puff for her own book: “It’s why I wanted to have a female heroine in my book who is not afraid to take on the establishment and is also a team player. The response I received from readers and their parents has been so positive – most of whom say that it’s rare to find a sporty, strong heroine – with short hair.” This was the point at which I asked for my name to be removed. How would Balding like it if – unbeknown to her – one of her broadcasts had some new words dubbed in, written by someone else, and under her name? Since my Saga saga, I have been asking friends and colleagues in the business what they think about what I may have to call Baldingate. Some of them say I have been insulated from the copy control nightmare because of the strength of the titles I’ve worked for. Another point of view is that the reader won’t notice the difference so why does it matter? That is, it won’t reflect badly on me. But the point is that I know what has happened and it is not something with which I can knowingly collude. At a time when journalism is under siege everywhere – when fake news sites are on the rise and online newspapers just help themselves to journalists’ articles and present them as their own – it is more important than ever for those of us who are still writing to stand up for the values that attracted us to the profession in the first place. Back in 2003, I was asked to interview Madonna, after she’d written several children’s books (note to self: avoid celebrities who turn their hand to writing for kids.). The interview was a bit more obviously chequered than this Balding debacle but, again, we seemed to part on good terms. This was my conclusion to that piece: “What followed was any journalist’s idea of a nightmare. The very next day the rumbles started... This escalated into a full-blown inquiry, with her people threatening to stop dealings with the Times unless they had full approval and control of the interview… The discussions went on for four weeks and were eventually resolved, with the result that this interview is appearing as it was intended, without any interference.” We still tend to think of this bullying behaviour as an American problem. But if it originated with the big bad agents in Hollywood, it has certainly been making inroads with our homegrown, household names. So what is the way forward? Perhaps we need to adopt another response to the economic downturn in our industry – the sponsored editorial label. How about some equal transparency for the readers so they still bother to buy the product when it is genuine? A differentiating label such as, “This article has been approved by the subject” and, in cases like mine, “Some paragraphs of this interview have been written in by the celebrity after the event.” We could call it, as a writer buddy of mine suggested, celebritorial. In the meantime, I take comfort in the fact that La Balding’s behaviour is not yet completely the norm and, despite her aristocratic forbears, shows that she lacks class. The real pros – such as the marvellous Dame Judi Dench, who has provoked headlines around the world because of her recent comments to me on desire and naughty knickers – believe in letting you do your job with the same freedom and lack of interference they would expect to do their own. They are the real stars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/29/xx","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T21:06:00Z","webTitle":"England clamp down on player behaviour after Ben Stokes affair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/29/xx","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/29/xx","fields":{"headline":"England clamp down on player behaviour after Ben Stokes affair","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England have moved to clamp down on player behaviour in the aftermath of the Ben Stokes affair with Joe Root and Stuart Broad among members of the Ashes squad to have pulled out of Jos Buttler’s stag do in Amsterdam this weekend after encouragement by the team management. Stokes and Alex Hales are missing the social trip to the Netherlands as they are due in for further police questioning in the coming days. It follows the altercation in Bristol in the early hours of Monday that has led to the pair being suspended on full pay and left England in crisis. But Andrew Strauss, the team director, is understood to have “lightly pushed” others heading to Australia this winter to withdraw from the weekend’s activities, such is the fear at the England and Wales Cricket Board that it could spark more negative publicity in the current climate. England have bought themselves time to deal with Hales and Stokes, having stood the pair down from national selection indefinitely, pending the outcome of a police investigation and outsourced their internal case to the Cricket Discipline Commission, the panel of which is being led by the former Derbyshire cricketer turned lawyer Tim O’Gorman. That decision was prompted by the Sun newspaper publishing footage of the late-night incident that came after Sunday’s one-day international against West Indies in Bristol and led to Stokes’s arrest before being released under investigation. Both he and Hales say the altercation began when they came to the aid of two gay men being abused in the street at 2.30am. Avon and Somerset Police are now looking into this claim and on Friday issued an updated appeal for the two witnesses in question to come forward. While Hales is next due to play for England in the one-day series against Australia in January, Stokes is facing an anxious wait to see if he will be charged given he is part of the Ashes squad that departs on 28 October. Before then comes the announcement of central contracts for 2017-18 next Wednesday, although England may delay this given the fast moving nature of events. As it stands, both players are expected to retain their current deals given the ECB is desperate not to pre-judge the outcome of any possible criminal proceedings. Strauss has already said he will review England’s approach to conduct and team rules too, having previously endorsed the relaxed environment of the head coach Trevor Bayliss – one that sees no curfews set for nights out and trusts players to behave responsibly – only to see it blow up spectacularly. There is an internal disciplinary probe underway regarding three of the cricketers also out drinking in Bristol late on Sunday, albeit not present at the time of the incident. Jake Ball, Jonny Bairstow and Liam Plunkett are all waiting to learn if they are in trouble, with Strauss stating he would wait until after Friday’s final ODI in Southampton."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/30/macklemore-to-donate-proceeds-from-same-love-to-marriage-equality-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T06:53:35Z","webTitle":"Macklemore to donate proceeds from Same Love to marriage equality campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/30/macklemore-to-donate-proceeds-from-same-love-to-marriage-equality-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/30/macklemore-to-donate-proceeds-from-same-love-to-marriage-equality-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Macklemore to donate proceeds from Same Love to marriage equality campaign","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"American rapper, Macklemore, has pledged to donate the Australian proceeds from his track, Same Love, to the marriage equality campaign. The artist revealed his plans on the eve of the rugby league final in Sydney, where he will perform the hit song. “I was saying on the car ride over here, I haven’t figured it out yet, but I was saying in the car ride over that I want to donate my portion of the proceeds of Same Love that I get off of that record here in Australia, to voting yes,” he told Channel 9. “I need to figure out what that looks like, and how to do that, but that is something I am going to do.” The track has become an anthem for LGBT rights. Its lyrics advocate for inclusion while criticising the damaging impact of homophobia and false stereotypes. Macklemore’s pledge was welcomed by the equality campaign. Alex Greenwich, co-chair of Australian Marriage Equality, said the donations would come at a crucial time. “We are grateful for this much needed support and thank Macklemore for enregising our campaign with his song and support,” Greenwich said. “The positivity of Macklemore’s song and his donation comes at a critical time as we reach the halfway point of the postal survey campaign,” he said. But its performance at the grand final has drawn the ire of conservatives, who have launched attacks described by some of their Liberal colleagues as “bizarre”. The criticism has been led by former prime minister, Tony Abbott, and Liberal senator, Eric Abetz. Ironically, the controversy helped the track move to the top of the iTunes chart in Australia this week. Abbott’s intervention drew a sharp rebuke from his colleague, attorney general George Brandis. “It is one of his most popular songs and for Mr Abbott and anyone else to say that it should be banned, I think is a bizarre thing to say. I thought Mr Abbott believed in freedom of speech,” Brandis told the ABC. Prior to arriving in Sydney on Saturday, Macklemore said he had been receiving “a lot of tweets from angry old white men” about his planned performance. That, he said, made him want to “go harder” when performing the song. He said on Saturday music had the power to start conversations and bring people together. “I think that is what music has the power to do, is not divide people, but create an environment where people can start a debate, can have a conversation,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/30/amnesty-criticises-australian-government-over-iraq-civilian-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T04:22:44Z","webTitle":"Amnesty criticises Australian government over Iraq civilian deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/30/amnesty-criticises-australian-government-over-iraq-civilian-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/30/amnesty-criticises-australian-government-over-iraq-civilian-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Amnesty criticises Australian government over Iraq civilian deaths","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Human rights campaigners have criticised the Australian government’s delay in announcing its involvement in two airstrikes believed to have killed children in West Mosul, Iraq. On Friday, the Australian defence force and the US-led coalition in Iraq made separate announcements on the results of the latest investigations into civilian casualties caused by airstrikes targeting Islamic State fighters. Updated figures show at least 735 civilians have been killed in the US-led coalition’s airstrikes since Operation Inherent Resolve began in 2014. Recent investigations into 185 reports of civilian casualties, completed in August, confirmed a further 50 deaths. “Although the [military] coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner that minimises the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are unavoidable,” the US-led coalition said in a statement. It is still investigating a further 350 reports of civilian casualties. At roughly the same time, Australia’s chief of joint operations, Vice-admiral David Johnston, detailed the country’s involvement in two of the incidents. The most recent, on 7 June, involved two Australian F/A-18 super hornets, which were tasked to a close-quarters firefight between Iraqi forces and Isis militants in West Mosul. The fighters were within 20 metres of each other and the Iraqi forces found themselves pinned down, according to Johnston. Two nearby Australian Hornets were called for air back-up, following what Johnston said were normal targeting procedures. “It was a residential building, but it was assessed a legitimate target,” he said. A single weapon – a GPS-guided bomb – was dropped on the front of the building and two Isis fighters are believed to have been killed. Johnston said no civilians had been observed in the area before the strike but it later became apparent that some had been inside, as they “calmly” left the rear of the building that was hit. “A civilian was either seriously injured or killed as a result of that strike,” he said. “It was a child carried out.” The Australian fighter pilots reported the incident to the US-led coalition’s headquarters and up the Australian chain of command for investigation. Johnston said Australian rules of engagement had been followed and the strike had complied with the laws of armed conflict. The strike had successfully protected Iraqi soldiers on the ground, he said. In another incident, in March, a group suspected of being Isis fighters had been positioned about 300 metres from Iraqi security forces. The US-led coalition authorised an airstrike and seven civilians were killed or injured, including a child. Australian aircraft were not involved in that strike but Australian defence personnel were part of the target decision-making process. “It appeared the group was wrongly identified [as Isis],” Johnston said, adding that at the time the information that the group was armed had come from a credible and reliable source. Amnesty International has previously expressed serious concerns about the toll the war was having on civilians. In a report earlier this year, it found the battle for West Mosul “has caused a civilian catastrophe”. Civilians were being ruthlessly exploited by Isis, which had moved them into conflict zones, used them as human shields, and prevented escape. They were also being subjected to “relentless and unlawful attacks” by Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition. On Saturday, Amnesty’s Australian campaign coordinator, Diana Sayed, criticised the delay in publicly revealing Australia’s involvement in civilian casualties. “We have serious concern about the disregard for civilian lives by all parties to this conflict, and that protection of civilians in West Mosul has not been given utmost priority,” Sayed said. “It’s extremely disappointing it has taken the Australian government until now to release information about Australia’s involvement in civilian casualties, including the possible killing of a child,” she said. The US-led coalition has conducted 26,026 strikes since the mission began in August 2014. It has received 1,250 reports of civilian casualties, 178 of which it deems credible. The reports are typically made by non-government organisations, the military or the media, and are sometimes drawn from social media. “The percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was 2.32%,” the coalition said in a statement on Saturday. “The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian casualties was .33%.” Airwars, a non-government group monitoring airstrikes and civilian deaths in the Middle East, estimates that close to 5,500 civilians have died in coalition airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. – with Australian Associated Press"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/29/scott-baldwin-bitten-lion-south-africa-bloemfontein-ospreys-cheetahs-pro14","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T11:54:26Z","webTitle":"Scott Baldwin apologises for missing match after being bitten by lion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/29/scott-baldwin-bitten-lion-south-africa-bloemfontein-ospreys-cheetahs-pro14","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/29/scott-baldwin-bitten-lion-south-africa-bloemfontein-ospreys-cheetahs-pro14","fields":{"headline":"Scott Baldwin apologises for missing match after being bitten by lion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Wales hooker Scott Baldwin has apologised after being bitten on the hand while trying to pet a lion in South Africa, causing him to miss Ospreys’ defeat to the Cheetahs in their Pro14 match on Friday. The 29-year-old was described as “stupid” by the Ospreys coach Steve Tandy after suffering the wound, which needed stitches, during a pre-match visit to a game park. Baldwin took to social media on Saturday to apologise. “Sorry all Ospreys fans for letting you and the team down by missing the game through the bite!” he said on Twitter. “Should [have] known he wouldn’t be impressed with me stroking his lioness before introducing myself to him first. And for those asking, my hand is on the mend thankfully and should be up and running round soon enough, thanks for your support and concern.” Baldwin came in for a ribbing from his coach after Friday’s 44-25 defeat at the Free State Stadium, where Tandy explained the incident to the media in candid terms. “There was an incident with a lion, but in fairness it was nothing to do with the lion. He did bite Scott but when you put your hand in a fence where there is a lion, then you will get bitten. “It was pretty stupid on Scott’s behalf and he is pretty lucky … I don’t know what sort of wildlife show Scott has been watching where you can pat a lion on the head as if it’s a kitten. “It’s probably one of the silliest things I’ve ever been involved in, but thankfully he is OK and hopefully he will be back up and running in the next couple of weeks.” The club confirmed that Baldwin had suffered the injury on Wednesday and said he was treated at the scene by the team doctor before being admitted to a local hospital in Bloemfontein on Thursday for further treatment to prevent infection.

More like the cult of Saint Jeremy","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The few people not caught up in leader worship in Brighton asked how the cult of Jeremy Corbyn’s personality would die. Would his support for Brexit drive his young admirers away? Have we reached peak Corbyn? They forgot the lesson of history that you don’t worry about personality cults that fail. You worry when they succeed. Cultism was everywhere at the Labour conference. It was in the Corbyn memorabilia on sale at conference stalls. It was in the chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” that greeted his every appearance. It was in the delegates’ desire to extend the sycophancy to Corbyn’s lieutenants, which died when the crowd realised “Oh, Rebecca Long-Bailey” didn’t quite work. Most, and most ignobly, it was in the demeaning attempts by leftwing politicians and journalists to atone for the heresy of doubting Corbyn’s ability to increase Labour’s vote share and worm their way back into his affections. Tom Watson, Labour’s anti-Coriolanus, tried to save his position by telling the twee story of how he was standing in a field at Glastonbury, when the festival-goers, with that striking originality that so marks the Labour left, began the Corbyn chant. “And as they sang,” he simpered to the applauding crowd, “I realised it’s actually better to be loved than to be feared. And Jeremy has shown us that it’s possible. Thank you, Jeremy.” Everyone who knows Watson knows he believes Corbyn’s programme presents a direct threat to Britain’s economic prosperity and national security. But a politician who once found the courage to fight Rupert Murdoch is now so frightened of speaking his mind he fills his mouth with flattery. The scale of the idolatry is its most significant feature. Even the most unpopular leaders have followers who will back them unconditionally. True cults of personality are mass movements. Without the warm feeling of being part of a collective that boos and hisses together, they would fall apart. “Men, it has been well said, think in herds,” said Charles Mackay, the Victorian author of the seminal Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. “It will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” As revealing and as historically commonplace is the infantilism cults impose. The far left has succeeded by creating an overwhelming feeling that “Jeremy” – and it is always “Jeremy”, not “Corbyn” or “Mr Corbyn” – must be protected from the media and his fellow politicians. So deep does it run, Corbyn’s sidekicks banned Labour MPs from the conference floor, as if they were Glastonbury plebs without a VIP pass. Labour members treat the leader of the opposition as a child who needs a safe space to hide him from the backstabbing and barracking all other politicians must endure. In doing so, they have turned themselves into children who cannot handle the robust debates of a free society. As always, the insistence that hope resides in one hero brings with it the whiff of messianic religion. I winced in Brighton as the mere mention of Corbyn’s name on stage drew applause. Like worshippers punctuating a church service with “amens”, Labour members felt a religious duty to acknowledge the presence of goodness. Corbyn gives every appearance of wallowing in the attention. But, wisely, he adopts a saintly air of modesty. After a portrait of his head crowned by a halo was paraded in the conference centre, he told Sky News he had worked hard in the election campaign but, mighty though his labours were, he did not deserve to be sanctified. “I often feel deeply embarrassed by it. It’s not my wish and it’s not my doing.” If he meant a word of this, Corbyn would ask his aides why they appeared to take the Lord’s name in vain by addressing him as “JC” in public. The consequences of Labour’s failure to break away from a messianic leader were painfully evident in Brighton. If the conference itself might as well never have happened for all the good it did, the streets outside were filled with life. Everyone could sense that a decrepit Tory government could be forced to concede acres of ground. Unfortunately, everyone also sensed that Corbyn had no intention of applying pressure. Let us pause for a moment to consider the historical irony here. The far left says its despises “Blairite” compromise. Yet on the great issue of the day, it has so triangulated with the Tories even Tony Blair is now outflanking “Jeremy” on the left. Before the conference began, there was a demonstration by supporters of free movement. They were not just protesting to uphold the rights of EU citizens in Britain and British citizens in Europe. They understood that by stopping today’s young from becoming Europeans, the government was stopping them working where they wanted, living where they wanted and loving and marrying who they wanted. By Brighton beach, they could sense a dense fog was about to fall on the Channel that would cut them off from the wider world. On the fringe, I heard the Irish Labour leader, Brendan Howlin, talk with urgency and seriousness about the “high price in blood” Ireland and Britain had paid to remove the last hard border on the island of Ireland. The risk that Brexit would reimpose it was too great to run. In a tone that was close to an instruction, he said the British Labour party had to commit to protecting the peace by staying in the EU customs union. Labour claims to be a party of internationalists. It gratefully took the votes of Irish immigrants and their children. Under Corbyn, it says it is all for peace. But when asked to maintain the hard-won peace in Ireland, it could only waffle and censor. Corbyn does not want to reopen the EU debate because he believes Brexit frees him to push through a programme of socialism in one country. (There won’t be restrictions of “state spending”, he said last week, as if the loss of single market membership and capital flight won’t impose restrictions aplenty.) To avoid embarrassing him, Momentum blocked a full debate on the EU. As one dismissive delegate explained, arguments about the most important challenge we face were merely a “disgraceful” attempt to undermine Jeremy. It was all about Corbyn. It always is. I cannot predict if he will become prime minister. But we don’t need to wait for him to come to power to understand why we must always resist personality cults. Even while it is in opposition, cultism has turned Labour into a childish, sycophantic, thuggish and unthinking party. That, surely, is bad enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/sep/29/tom-price-donald-trump-puerto-rico-daily-politics","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T21:34:33Z","webTitle":"Price paid: health secretary Tom Price out after private jet kerfuffle | The Minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/29/tom-price-donald-trump-puerto-rico-daily-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/29/tom-price-donald-trump-puerto-rico-daily-politics","fields":{"headline":"Price paid: Trump's health secretary out after private jet kerfuffle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"US Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price resigned under pressure from Donald Trump on Friday, after Trump told reporters he did not like the optics of Price’s use of a private plane for official business.

So, mayday, we are in trouble.” Cruz appealed directly to the president, saying: “So, Mr Trump, I am begging you to take charge and save lives. After all, that is one of the founding principles of the United States of … America. If not, the world will see how we are treated not as second-class citizens but as animals that can be disposed of. Enough is enough.” The situation in Puerto Rico remains dire as residents face shortages of food, water and fuel. The electric grid was badly damaged by the two storms, leaving many without power and reliant on gas-powered generators. The hurricanes crippled the island’s already weakened waste and water treatment plants while fallen trees and strewn debris block roads and cellphone service remains limited. Trump and administration figures have sought to emphasise local support for their efforts to send aid. “Fema [Federal Emergency Management Administration] &amp; First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico,” the president wrote on Thursday in a typical tweet. “Massive food &amp; water delivered.” On Friday he claimed: “Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rossello just stated: ‘The administration and the president, every time we’ve spoken, they’ve delivered …’ Rosello has praised the federal government’s relief effort, but he told MSNBC: “The response still is not where it needs to be, certainly it’s not.” Trump has complained that the coverage of the government response has been unfair. But he has faced criticism for raising the issue of the country’s debt crisis as it reels from the impact of two hurricanes. On Friday, the president praised the relief effort, noting that 10,000 federal workers had been sent to the island along with ships bringing food and water. “All appropriate departments of our government from homeland security to defense are engaged fully in the disaster,” he said in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington. “And the response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this.” Referring to logistical challenges of sending aid to the US territory, he said: “This is an island, surrounded by water, big water, ocean water.” Puerto Rico, he said, was “totally and unfortunately unable” to manage the crisis on its own. “They are working so hard,” he said. “But there’s nothing left. It’s been wiped out. The houses are largely flattened.” Trump again referred to the island’s debt crisis, saying it would have to work with federal authorities to determine how to pay for a massive recovery effort compounded by “the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island”. He tweeted earlier: “The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!” In her conversation with reporters in San Juan on Friday afternoon, Cruz gestured to two large binders filled with paper and said: “Fema asks for documentation, I think we’ve given them enough documentation. They had the gall this morning … of asking me: ‘What are your priorities, mayor?’ “Well, where have you been? And I have been very respectful of the Fema employees. I have been patient but we have no time for patience any more. “So, I am asking the president of the United States to make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives. “They were up the task in Africa when Ebola came over. They were up to the task in Haiti [after the earthquake of 2010]. As they should be. Because when it comes to saving lives we are all part of one community of shared values. “I will do what I never thought I was going to do: I am begging. I am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency and bureaucracy.” Continuing to cry, Cruz said: “I am done being polite, and I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell because my people’s lives are at stake. “I’m asking members of the press to send a mayday call. We are dying here. If we don’t solve the logistics, we are going to see something close to a genocide.” Earlier in the day, Cruz was strongly critical after the acting homeland security secretary, Elaine Duke, said the relief effort in Puerto Rico was a “good news story”. “Dammit, this is not a good news story,” Cruz told CNN. “This is a people are dying story. This is a life-or-death story.” Cruz implored Duke to visit the ravaged island. “This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water,” she said. “When you’re drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story. When you don’t have food for a baby, it’s not a good news story … I’m sorry. That really upsets me and frustrates me.” On Friday, Duke traveled to the US territory in a visit planned before her comments drew criticism. She clarified her comments at a press conference, explaining that she meant she was encouraged by the coordination among federal agencies, local government and first responders. “Clearly the situation here in Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane is not satisfactory,” Duke said. “But together we are getting there and the progress today is very, very strong. “The president and I will not be fully satisfied, however, until every Puerto Rican is back home, the power is back on, clean water is freely available, schools and hospitals are fully open and the Puerto Rican economy is working.” Trump is due to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/29/benjamin-whitrow-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T17:11:49Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Whitrow obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/29/benjamin-whitrow-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/29/benjamin-whitrow-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Benjamin Whitrow obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Benjamin Whitrow has never given a bad performance,” said Laurence Olivier, who employed the actor in his National Theatre company at the Old Vic for seven years in the late 1960s. By the same token, you might deduce that Olivier never thought of Whitrow, who has died aged 80, as a barnstormer. And you would be right. Whitrow’s stock-in-trade was an avuncular, measured rationality, a superb stillness on the stage and the capacity, very occasionally, to take you by surprise with a controlled outburst, or a frozen stare. Tall and lean, with a beautiful speaking voice, Whitrow was a master craftsman and, as such, luxury goods as a supporting player. He may be best remembered for his resolute and placatory Mr Bennet in the great BBC TV serial of Pride and Prejudice (1995), with Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth shooting to stardom as Mr Darcy; Whitrow was a quietly hilarious buffer to Alison Steadman’s chaotically bustling Mrs Bennet. Either side of that landmark, he appeared in three episodes of The New Statesman (1990-92) as Paddy O’Rourke, a Labour shadow minister with a fake Irish accent on the trail of Rick Mayall’s blunderbuss Alan B’Stard MP; and as Squire Allworthy in a serial of Tom Jones in 1997, co-starring Max Beesley, Samantha Morton, Frances de la Tour and Brian Blessed. These roles conferred a sort of television royalty on him, but he was a class act wherever he worked. He featured in first major productions of leading playwrights, often moving with them between stage to screen: Peter Nichols’s coruscating Passion Play at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1981, with Eileen Atkins and Billie Whitelaw; Michael Frayn’s Noises Off in 1983, shortly before appearing in Christopher Morahan’s movie Clockwise (1986), scripted by Frayn and starring John Cleese; David Hare’s Racing Demon at the National Theatre in 1991, just before making Louis Malle’s Damage (1992), scripted by Hare and starring Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche; and Tom Stoppard’s The Invention of Love (1997) at the NT, directed by Richard Eyre, in which he played Ruskin as a mentally cavorting Victorian aesthete. Quiet and reserved as an actor, he was more forthright in his private life, though never into self-promotion. Public interest was aroused, however, when it emerged that, after separating from his wife, Catherine Cook, a nurse, whom he married in 1972, and with whom he remained on good termsfor the rest of his life, he had fathered the child of the actor Celia Imrie, who had no wish to marry him. The hoo-hah soon died down, and Angus Imrie, now 23, is better known for playing Josh in The Archers. Benjamin was the second son of Philip Whitrow, a schoolmaster at St Edward’s school, Oxford, who had taught Olivier there as a boy in the 1920s, and Mary (nee Flanders). He grew up in Oxford and attended the Dragon school before boarding at Tonbridge and training at Rada. For his national service, he served with the King’s Dragoon Guards, partly in Malaysia (1956-58), and he made his stage debut at the Empire, Belfast, in 1959, playing Hector Hushabye in Shaw’s Heartbreak House. He then spent an eight-year apprenticeship in rep before joining Olivier at the Old Vic. He first “walked on” in Congreve’s Love for Love, progressing through the ranks in Seneca’s Oedipus, directed by Peter Brook, The Merchant of Venice (Olivier as Shylock) and Beaumarchais’ The Marriage of Figaro, both directed by Jonathan Miller, and as Bensinger in Michael Blakemore’s notable revival of The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. In the 1980s he was a familiar face in the West End, perhaps most memorably as the exasperated and two-timing director, Lloyd Dallas, of the play within a play in Noises Off on its transfer from the Lyric, Hammersmith, to the Savoy, in 1983. In Anthony Minghella’s Made in Bangkok (1986) at the Aldwych he played scenes of exquisite tenderness with fellow tourist Felicity Kendal on day trips to the temples while others sampled the fleshpots. His Falstaff in the Merry Wives of Windsor for the RSC at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1991 was surprisingly thin-voiced, underweight and joyless in its lechery, but he compensated in the same season with a fine Camillo in Adrian Noble’s magnificent version of The Winter’s Tale and, 10 years later, at the Barbican, he was an unforgettably hilarious Justice Shallow in tandem with Peter Copley’s equally senile, whistling, Silence in Henry IV, Part Two. He toured in 2001 in Joe Orton’s What the Butler Saw with Michael Pennington and Jane Asher, and returned to Chichester with Penelope Keith in Richard Everett’s Entertaining Angels, as a ghostly vicar revisiting his wife who is preparing to live on her own. His last stage work was with the Tobacco Factory in Bristol, where in 2011 he played a great double of John of Gaunt and the first gardener in Richard II, and, in 2015, appeared in Sheridan’s The School for Scandal, for the third time in his career, as Crabtree; the first had been in John Gielgud’s 1962 Haymarket revival with Ralph Richardson, the second for Miller, at the National. At home in south Wimbledon, London, Whitrow was a book collector who loved wild orchids, golf and bridge. He is survived by Catherine, their children, Hannah and Tom, by Angus, and by four grandchildren. • Benjamin John Whitrow, actor, born 17 February 1937; died 28 September 2017 • This article was amended on 1 October 2017.

It wasn’t the multiple times I Googled the 1990 Bacardi advert five minutes before a deadline, purely to relive that glorious moment from my youth when alcohol advertised itself by promising it would make you so drunk you would fancy your Aunt Beryl. Nor was it the times my children tried to get my attention but I was otherwise engaged in the deeply important task of seeing how many likes a photo of them got on Instagram. (I should call social services on myself but I’m looking something up on my phone, so I can’t actually use it to make a call. Sorry, kids!) No, it came three years ago in a hotel room in Los Angeles. Now, I love Los Angeles, but instead of enjoying the palm trees and the hipsters on this trip, I spent it inside my hotel staring at my laptop. Someone back in Britain had taken deep offence at a throwaway line I’d written about – and I swear I’m not making this up – the salaries of footballers and, as is the way with such things, marshalled their online troops so that hundreds of people were screaming at me on Twitter. For two days, I tried to engage with these furious warriors, because having all these angry voices coming out of my computer made me feel like the most loathed person in the world and I was determined to fix this. On the third day, my boyfriend called and ordered me to go out, leave my phone behind and take a break. So I did. And as I sat on Santa Monica beach, I realised my relationship with the internet had to change. It’s easy to hate the web for turning us all into narcissists with ADD, and probably easier for me than most. My life is now spent in this weird tug-of-war of alternately relying on the web and fighting with it. I have no idea how I’d do my job without it, and when I watch movies about journalists set before its advent it is, for me, like watching movies about people who lived without indoor plumbing or modern medicine. How did they function? On the other hand, I do genuinely believe Shakespeare, Jane Austen and anyone else who wanted to do stuff before the internet had it easy. OK, they didn’t have the aforementioned indoor plumbing, but any muppet can write The Tempest if there’s nothing else to do but catch smallpox. But writing an 800-word column while resisting the siren call of online gossip? That’s a literary triumph. When I started working in 2000, the only contact I had with readers came in the form of the very, very occasional letter. Now people tell me, at all times of day – by email, by Twitter, in comments beneath articles – exactly what they think of my work. As my rock bottom moment in LA suggested, that can be unnerving, especially if you try to engage with people, as I do. I can easily spend five times as long dealing with the reactions to my articles as I do writing them. But I don’t hate the web. Aside from all its obvious benefits – I can go shopping without the inconvenience of getting off my butt, I can keep in touch with friends abroad – it has brought some more unexpected joys. So, yes, strangers can yell at me – but they can also be lovely to me. One of my favourite things about the web is the other female journalists I have met online, who now offer one another advice, support and many, many jokes. And that’s nice, isn’t it? Second, sure, some readers get angry about footballers’ salaries, but others teach me loads – including things I wouldn’t necessarily learn in my own tiny, real world. Once, some readers got cross at me for objecting to Beyoncé featuring in a sexy photoshoot, photographed by the creepy Terry Richardson. Young, mainly black women tweeted me, pointing out I hadn’t acknowledged sufficiently how important it was to have a black woman celebrated as sexy. And guess what? I hadn’t. So while I maintain my objections to Richardson were definitely right, my criticisms of Beyoncé probably weren’t. But most of all, the web has taught me – an inveterate people-pleaser – that I can never please all the people. So I need to stop trying and instead write what I truly believe, and then get on with my day. It took the web to teach me to stop looking to others for validation, and as benefits go, that might even beat access to old Bacardi adverts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/06/the-templars-by-dan-jones-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"The Templars by Dan Jones review – blood and cash fighting God’s holy wars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/06/the-templars-by-dan-jones-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/06/the-templars-by-dan-jones-review","fields":{"headline":"The Templars by Dan Jones review – blood and cash fighting God’s holy wars","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In our age, Islam is often taken to task for the violent imagery that is contained within the Qur’an, and the example set by its warrior-prophet, Muhammad, but less often scrutinised is the propensity of Christianity for acts of savagery. Many early Christians held to the pacifism of St Basil, who laid down that Christians who had shed blood were not eligible for communion, but St Augustine of Hippo developed the doctrine of the just war, arguing that it was meritorious to use violence against those who held other religious beliefs. By the end of the 11th century AD, efforts to drive the Muslim emirs out of Spain, and the growth in pilgrimage traffic to the Holy Land – large armed groups infused with religious zeal that could easily be diverted to fighting or looting – were married to a general Christian desire to own the key sites associated with the life of Christ, and the Crusades were born. The first of these bloody and often anarchic campaigns, launched by Pope Urban II in 1095, resulted in the conquest of Jerusalem, but how were the new Crusader territories to be defended from Muslim reconquest? In 1120 the Council of Nablus, held under the auspices of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, decreed: “If a cleric takes up arms in the cause of self-defence, he shall not bear any guilt.” The way was now open for the formation of an order of knights – Christendom was full of them, often underemployed and fighting among themselves – to defend the Crusader states. Under its founder, the Frenchman Hugh of Payns, the new order was governed by a strict code of humility, submission and abstinence, eschewing chivalric bling – the falconry, the pointy shoes, the ornate bridles – in favour of simple uniforms of white, “which signifies purity and complete chastity”. Baldwin gave Hugh’s men use of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, named after the Temple of Solomon, from which the Knights Templar, the subject of Dan Jones’s new book, took their name. By the time the Crusaders captured it, the Temple Mount had been Islamised through the construction of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque. The Templars took up residence at what was, and remains today, the symbolic chafing point between the three Abrahamic faiths, building a large complex of buildings that was described as “full of walking-places, lawns, council chambers, porches, consistories and supplies of water in splendid cisterns”. Within a few decades of their establishment the Templars stamped a fearsome reputation on the invasions, sieges, truces and uneasy coexistence that constituted the Crusader epoch. “They were the fiercest fighters of all the Franks,” according to the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, and held fast to the maxim: “Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.” Among their laurels was an engagement at Cresson, near Nazareth, in 1187, when 140 Templars charged with suicidal courage at a force several thousand strong that had been assembled by the renowned Saladin, paramount leader of the Islamic world and a dedicated jihadi: “Fifty to sixty knights died in a shower of their own gore,” Jones writes, while “the rest were taken away to imprisonment and enslavement at Saladin’s pleasure”. Jerusalem fell shortly afterwards; the Templars’ headquarters had contained a piggery, wrote the courtier Imad al-Din, and Saladin’s efforts to cleanse the area of “this race of perdition, unjust and criminal”, extended to washing the entire building with rosewater. Even after being expelled from their HQ, however, the Templars continued to prosper, along with the Crusader ethos of pilgrimage and conquest. If the tip of the Templar lance was in the Holy Land, its shaft lay in Europe. A non-domiciled organisation dedicated to war in the Levant, and exempt from the tithe, the Templars counted on the Vatican for patronage – Pope Innocent II placed them under the direct protection of the Holy See – while benefactors conferred on them vast estates from Portugal to Champagne. When Henry II of England did cash penance for sending Thomas Becket to his death in 1170, he gave his forfeit to the Templars, who spent it on the war against Saladin. Within a few decades of their establishment, the Templars were anything but poor knights; however bravely they submitted to unimaginable torments in the field, their European representatives enjoyed the status of bankers, mediators and advisers to kings and popes: without the bullion and coin conveyed to the east, the Crusades could not have been fought. Allegations of cupidity began to be heard. “Nowhere save in Jerusalem are they in poverty,” quipped the Plantagenet wit Walter Map, but even that wasn’t accurate, for the Templars and their rivals, the Hospitallers, were the chief landowners in the Crusader states, where their ranks were swelled by local Christian nobles as well as recruits from Europe. Anyone sifting The Templars for evidence of the interreligious cooperation and trade that prospered in the gaps between the fighting, which extended to joint hunting trips and even Templar financing of Muslim clients, will be disappointed. Jones is above all concerned with the military exploits of the order, and he gives us plenty of blood and guts shed under its piebald flag. Nor does he seem particularly interested in the surprising, malleable society that was created by the Crusaders and their Muslim antagonists, under which many Crusaders learned Arabic and Muslims might on occasion be found praying with the Templars’ permission in the corner of the old al-Aqsa mosque. Although he tells his story with a competence that will be familiar to readers of his English medieval histories, this book lacks the texture and verve of these earlier productions, possibly because Jones, like many of his knights, is on unfamiliar terrain. Perhaps the most gripping part of his story concerns the Templars’ fall, as victims of a persecution as single-minded as any conducted during the Inquisition, and linked, in Jones’s view, to a French monetary crisis that had led Philip IV to devalue the coinage and seize the wealth of the Jews. In October 1307 the king’s men arrested Templars across France and seized their assets; the subsequent, Europe-wide investigation depicted them as an order of infamy whose adepts spat on the image of Christ and were inveterate sodomites. The impossibility of resisting a legal juggernaut became clear in May 1310, when 54 Templars were sentenced to burn. Two years later the order was outlawed. The final Crusader state had in any case been snuffed out a few years earlier. The Templars no longer had anything to protect. • Christopher de Bellaigue’s The Islamic Enlightenment is published by Bodley Head.

I definitely wanted to be the one raising my children. I wanted consistency because everyone has got slight differences in style.” Fennell admits to having struggled with her sense of self in the months after giving up work to care for her son when she was 25. “I had a slight identity crisis because you are what you do,” she explains. “There’s safety in being able to say ‘I’m an editor in a publishing company’. It takes a while to build up other things.” Now 41, her experience of full-time motherhood has been a positive one. “I have loved it,” she says of an existence that is not without drudgery. “The toilet is dirty every time you go and there are piles of washing but every job has its chores. There is also the magic. The boys are so funny.” With her children now aged between two and 16, Fennell says she and her partner, who rent their north London home, have faced periods of financial strain. The impact of the means testing of child benefit led her to join, and now chair, the campaign group Mothers at Home Matter. “The real problem is that most mothers have to work because government policies of the last decade mean every financial incentive is stacked against the choice to be at home.” Erika Nilsson-Humphrey “I really enjoy working; I find joy in work and in being creative,” says Erika Nilsson-Humphrey, a former investment banker who founded the upmarket men’s fashion website Dappad. “I love being a mother and Vivi [her three-year-old daughter] is the most important thing in my life but it wouldn’t be enough for me being at home all the time,” she says. “I think I would become unhappy and that wouldn’t be good for her.” Born in Sweden, Nilsson-Humphrey lives with her husband and daughter in London, where she spent eight years working in investment banking. Starting her own business means she is no longer tied to a gruelling working week that would mean leaving home before her daughter woke up and returning when she was asleep. “Life is too short for that,” she says. “I’m trying to have more balance.” The driven entrepreneur, who lists Natalie Massenet, the founder of Net-a-Porter, among her role models, continued working on the business plan for her online personal shopping service despite being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 when her daughter was eight months old. “I always felt like I wanted to work but, looking back, it was a bit crazy,” she says. “It would have been good to have paused for a few minutes.” From the outside it looks as if the 38-year-old has it all, but she admits to bouts of self-doubt: “The worse thing is when I feel like I am rushing everywhere,” she says. “It is a juggling act but I think you have to accept it for what it is and surrender to it. I think women put too much pressure on themselves.” Whereas many women return to work for financial reasons, Nilsson-Humphrey says it was her choice: “I think society needs women to be working to provide balance in the workplace … it’s like when people say the financial crisis would have been different if it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/01/the-nobel-peace-prize-is-a-whos-who-of-hawks-hawks-hypocrites-and-war-criminals","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T16:00:06Z","webTitle":"The Nobel peace prize is a who’s who of hawks, hypocrites and war criminals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/01/the-nobel-peace-prize-is-a-whos-who-of-hawks-hawks-hypocrites-and-war-criminals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/01/the-nobel-peace-prize-is-a-whos-who-of-hawks-hawks-hypocrites-and-war-criminals","fields":{"headline":"The Nobel peace prize is a who’s who of hawks, hypocrites and war criminals","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s that time of year again! The days are growing shorter and the smell of Nordic niceties is in the air. Yes, Monday marks the start of Nobel season, the world’s most prestigious prize-giving ceremony and our annual reminder that Norway exists. Over the course of the week, Nobel prizes will be awarded in six categories – but the only ones most people pay attention to are literature (particularly if the prize goes to a rock star) and peace. There’s been quite a kerfuffle about the prestigious peace prize recently, what with that whole Aung San Suu Kyi being complicit in a genocide thing. Last month, Aung San Suu Kyi – who was awarded the 1991 Nobel peace prize “for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights” – spent weeks struggling to mention anything about the human rights abuses being committed against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. When she finally broke her silence in late September, it was to give a Trumpesque “both sides” sort of speech, which Amnesty International denounced as a “mix of untruths and victim-blaming”. Aung San Suu Kyi’s behaviour has led many to believe she no longer deserves to be a peace laureate and as of last week almost half a million people had signed a petition urging the Nobel committee to revoke her award. Now, I understand why so many people feel disappointed in Aung San Suu Kyi, I really do. But arguing she’s not worthy of her Nobel is nonsense. Sorry, but Aung San Suu Kyi absolutely deserves her peace prize. Asking the Nobel committee to revoke it is to misunderstand what the prize stands for. Which, to put it bluntly, is absolutely nothing. Let’s face it, the Nobel peace prize is a farce; it has been for a long time. Really, it’s time we stopped pretending otherwise and put an end to the pomp and pretence altogether. Indeed, it’s amazing anyone can still say the words “Nobel peace prize” with a straight face considering its recipients constitute a who’s who of hawks, hypocrites and war criminals. I know, I know, #NotAll Nobel peace laureates! There have certainly been recipients, such as Desmond Tutu, who have greatly deserved to be recognised for their work in advancing peace. However, I’m afraid there have also been enough prize embarrassments to have rendered the award meaningless. Chief among these is 1973 recipient Henry Kissinger, recognised for his efforts in negotiating a ceasefire in the Vietnam war. While negotiating that ceasefire, Kissinger was secretly carpet-bombing Cambodia. The worst of his bombing started in February 1973, a month after Washington, Hanoi and Saigon signed the Paris Peace accords. It’s little wonder that Le Duc Tho, the Vietnamese communist leader who was awarded the prize alongside Kissinger, rejected it in disgust. Then you’ve got Shimon Peres, who was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1994 with Yitzhak Rabin, and Yasser Arafat. In the decades before getting the prize Peres systematically helped amp up Israel’s nuclear capabilities – which is completely at odds with the committee’s stipulation that the award should go to those who help demilitarise their country. What’s more, two years after the prize, Peres was responsible for a massacre that killed 106 people sheltering in a UN compound in the Lebanese town of Qana. While Kissinger and Peres are two of the more egregious examples, there are numerous other peace laureates who have been extremely dubious choices, including Barack Obama, Colombian leader Juan Manuel Santos and the EU – to name just a few. Indeed, the Nobel peace prize has become so tainted that some peace activists refuse to be associated with it. Mordechai Vanunu, a former nuclear technician who spent 18 years in prison for leaking details of Israel’s nuclear programme, has repeatedly asked be removed from a list of Nobel peace prize nominees. In a 2009 letter to the Nobel committee, he said he didn’t want “to belong to a list of laureates that also includes Shimon Peres, the man behind Israeli atomic policy”. Perhaps it’s only to be expected that the Nobel peace prize has descended into farce. It was, after all, born out of a mistake. As the story goes, in 1888 a French newspaper erroneously wrote that Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, had died. The paper marked the event of Alfred’s non-death with a bit of quality French snark: “Dr Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.” Nobel was mortified that he was going to be remembered as a “merchant of death” and so set up the Nobel prize. It was a calculated rebranding effort; an exercise in PR. You might think that the peace prize has got to a place where it is beyond parody – indeed, Tom Lehrer memorably quipped that “political satire became obsolete when Kissinger was awarded the Nobel peace prize”. However, the Noble prize has actually spawned a rather notable parody. Every autumn since 1991, the Ig Nobel prizes recognise a number of unusual achievements “that first make people laugh, and then make them think”. Fittingly, last year’s Ig Nobel peace award went to the authors of a study called On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-Profound Bullshit. The introduction to the paper begins by stating that: “In On Bullshit, the philosopher Frankfurt (2005) defines bullshit as something that is designed to impress but that was constructed absent direct concern for the truth.” I don’t know about you, but that sounds like a pretty apt definition of the real Nobel peace prize to me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/08/book-of-forgotten-authors-christopher-fowler-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"The Book of Forgotten Authors by Christopher Fowler review – a bibliophile’s treat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/08/book-of-forgotten-authors-christopher-fowler-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/08/book-of-forgotten-authors-christopher-fowler-review","fields":{"headline":"The Book of Forgotten Authors by Christopher Fowler review – a bibliophile’s treat","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In 99 potted biographies and 12 short essays, Christopher Fowler endeavours to exhume the names of more than 100 authors who he believes are unjustly forgotten.

It was written for Pekka Kuusisto, and there is no other violinist quite like him. He’s an all-rounder, master of just about every playing style, the star of the 2016 Proms thanks to a new-minted Tchaikovsky concerto and an encore that had the whole Albert Hall singing a crazy Karelian ditty. Right after giving the Bjarnason’s UK premiere, he was in the foyer for a free performance of Finnish runo-song, weaving swathes of atmosphere around Ilona Korhonen’s voice with an electric violin and a loop pedal. What stories of ancient derring-do was Korhonen telling? No idea, but it was riveting. Earlier, with the Philharmonia for the first concert of the Southbank Centre’s Nordic mini-festival, Kuusisto had been playing his trusty Strad. Yet an arresting feature of Bjarnason’s piece is how the performers, all unamplified, seem to create the aura and weight of electronic instruments – a certain thud to the bass notes, the glow of string harmonics, the crunch of feedback. It began with Kuusisto simultaneously whistling and plucking a melody, an idea taken up by the other violins. The music, highly detailed, lopes and swaggers with a wonky yet irresistible rhythmic pull, but there’s room too for passages of reflection, played by Kuusisto with achingly sweet tone. Most striking, though, were the two cadenzas, improvised episodes for the violin alone, when Kuusisto’s great, scything bow strokes took on the rhythm of a heartbeat. Future interpreters will need to be able to turn their sound from ugly to beautiful on a dime, to hold a hall rapt just plucking a little tune. And they’ll need to be able to whistle. Iceland’s volcanic soil is fertile musical ground right now. Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s Aeriality had been a striking opener, built from huge, intense unisons that move glacially but seethe with life as a few instruments skitter in the background. Esa Pekka Salonen drew a performance of conviction from the Philharmonia – as he did with the encore, Sibelius’s Valse Triste. If only the two Sibelius symphonies, Nos 6 and 7, had been as convincing. Salonen’s swift conducting of No 6 drew out the music’s bucolic charm but there was little clarity or transparency in a work that its composer likened to “pure, cold water”. No 7 came over better but a lack of pinpoint definition blunted its edge. •Nordic Music Days continues at the Royal Festival Hall, London, until 1 October. Box office: 020-3879 9555.

Andrew Foster, 32, and his wife Lucy, 28, were hit by more than 1,000 tons of rock as they prepared for a climb at the end of a three-week trip to the Californian park. The couple, from Cardiff, are believed to have been scouting the route on the El Capitan rock face when a “sheet” of granite measuring 40m by 20m fell from a height of about 200m on Wednesday. Andrew was killed instantly while his wife was rescued and airlifted to hospital where she is understood to be in a critical condition. The couple, who met at Cardiff University, shared a passion for outdoor adventures, and had climbed some of the most difficult rock faces in the UK. They had told friends it was their “big dream” to test themselves in the Yosemite national park. The trip was, reportedly, planned as part of their first wedding anniversary celebrations. They flew to the US on 11 September with friends who were also experienced climbers, and had blogged about their preparations and training for the adventure. Andrew, originally from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who worked as a sales rep for the outdoor clothing and gear company Patagonia, was pictured on Instagram in the national park looking exhausted but smiling on the day before the tragedy. He and his wife, originally from Market Drayton, Shropshire, were also keen skiers, and he proposed in the French Alps in March 2015. They married in a yurt in August 2016. On their blog, Cam and Bear, they wrote: “We are a young married couple who enjoy nothing more than getting out and having adventures in the mountains together. We are not extreme athletes and describe ourselves simply as passionate weekend warriors. We hope to inspire other people to get out and experience the natural world.” Alex Beasley, Patagonia’s country manager for UK and Ireland, said: “It is with much sadness that we mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague Andrew Foster, who was killed in a tragic accident in Yosemite. “He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors. “Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife, Lucy, and their families. We offer them our deepest sympathies.” Andrew often worked out of the Up and Under climbing store in Cardiff. The couple had practised for their trip to Yosemite by climbing cliffs in Cornwall and Pembrokeshire and Lucy told friends they were both “Yosemite virgins”. On their return from America they planned to travel around the Alps for a year “skiing, climbing and being extreme” and had bought a van for the journey. Fellow workers at Up and Under later put a statement on their website describing former worker Andy as “inspirational”. It said: “Andy Foster was an inspirational member of the Up and Under family. He was a highly regarded member of staff for five years, before he took a job with Patagonia. He remained a dedicated friend of Up and Under, and was regularly to be found in the store. “His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious. Andy and Lucy’s intentions upon returning from Yosemite were, with the help of Andy’s father, to covert a van into a motorhome to enable them to explore the European Alps for the next twelve months “It was then our hope that Andy would return to Up and Under in a part time consultative role, whilst he also chased other ambitions. Andy was highly respected, loved and his loss will be sorely felt by us all. Our thoughts are with Lucy and his family.” In a Facebook tribute, friend Jess Spate described him as “always cheerful” and everyone who had climbed with him would remember “his good humour and unrivalled sense of adventure”. “There’s nobody I’d rather climb a rapidly thawing frozen waterfall with at 2am on a work night. Nobody better to play hangman with at midnight in Cardiff City Hall, waiting to impersonate beautiful female ninjas. Nobody better to be topping out of a mountain route with when the weather turned”. He added: “Go hard my friend. May the skies always be clear for you and the thermometer stay below -5.” Scott Gediman, from Yosemite national park, speaking, on Thursday said: “With all the craziness I don’t exactly know where they were going but chances are they were going up. From what I understand the were buried under rock… they were crushed by falling rocks.” They were the only known casualties despite being with a group of other climbers when the series of collapses struck. One witness, Mike Kane, tweeted that the collapse was “very loud”, adding it was a “miracle more [were] not hurt”. A second rockfall at the site on Thursday left one person injured. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are in contact with the local authorities and providing assistance to both families at this very difficult time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/29/tories-risk-permament-loss-of-youth-vote-says-willetts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T16:30:25Z","webTitle":"Tories risk permanent loss of youth vote, says Willetts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/29/tories-risk-permament-loss-of-youth-vote-says-willetts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/29/tories-risk-permament-loss-of-youth-vote-says-willetts","fields":{"headline":"Tories risk permanent loss of youth vote, says Willetts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Conservative party risks permanently losing the support of younger voters unless Theresa May urgently tackles the challenges faced by the squeezed generation, the former Tory cabinet minister David Willetts has said. Data analysed for the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank now chaired by Willetts, shows the lifestyles of 25- to 34-year-olds increasingly falling behind those of older voters, underpinning his intervention as the Conservatives gather for their annual conference. “The worst-case scenario is, we lose the support of the younger generation, and don’t regain it,” he told the Guardian. Young people have seen their living standards squeezed by a combination of weak wage growth and rapid rises in property prices over the past decade, and Willetts is concerned pension changes will make it harder for them to save for their retirement, too. Jeremy Corbyn’s overwhelming support among younger voters in the general election contributed to the buoyant mood at Labour’s conference this week in Brighton, where he claimed his party was a “government-in-waiting”. The Conservatives intend to make young people a theme of their conference in Manchester after the party suffered a string of defeats in seats with large student populations, such as Canterbury. Concern about tuition fees is adding to the party’s difficulties with the youth vote. Resolution’s findings, based on analysis of detailed consumption data by Loughborough University, shows 25- to 34-year-olds are spending 15% less than 55- to 64-year-olds, once housing costs are taken out. As recently as 2001, discretionary spending among the two groups was the same. Willetts, who has long warned about the risk of a generation being left behind, said June’s election result provided clear evidence that what his 2010 book dubbed “the pinch”, was now hitting the Tories at the ballot box. “There is a real issue here. It’s great it’s finally come into the political debate because it’s really important: younger people are having a tough time,” he said. YouGov identified 47 as the crossover age at which voters were more likely to back the Conservatives in June’s election, underlining the concerns of the party’s backbenchers, who felt they had little riposte on the doorstep to some of Labour’s attack lines, including on school funding cuts and university tuition fees. “If you were being very cynical, you could say a party that doesn’t have the support of 25-year-olds, and does have the support of 50-year-olds, that formula is fine provided people go through the life cycle, and they get to own their own home, and they have their kids and settle down, and they then turn to voting Tory,” Willetts said. “What you can’t have, 10 years later, is a party that is then only appealing to 60-year-olds, and has lost the 35-year-olds as well. The danger is that we are getting more and more disconnected.” He argued that, rather than accept the Corbynite agenda of sweeping renationalisation and radically higher public spending, the Conservatives needed to get better at meeting voters’ aspirations. “There’s a paradox here, especially for my party, because the aspirations of these people – they don’t want a Marxist revolution; they’re not voting for a massive transformation of British society – what they’re wanting, actually, I would argue, is classic Tory aspirations. It’s a property-owning democracy.” The research for Resolution, by Donald Hirsch at Loughborough, also busts the myth that while younger people’s incomes may have risen little in real terms, they are better off thanks to the mass availability of hi-tech gadgets, international travel and other social changes. The research finds that the biggest increases in spending since 2001 on eating out and foreign travel have been among the 55-64 age group. The thinktank tries to illustrate the distinction by talking about spending on pre-theatre steak frites by older voters, as opposed to the consumption of avocado on toast by younger voters. And while the younger cohort spend marginally more on mobile phones, the differences are small. Willetts said: “It is sometimes said that the great technological improvements of recent decades mean that young people enjoy a far higher living standard than previous generations. Our new research shatters this idea. Not only are young people earning less, they’re also spending less too, especially as housing takes up ever more of their outgoings. “My generation has enjoyed riding the crest of a huge consumer boom over the last 50 years. In the 1980s, when we were in our youth, we had more spending power than any other age group. Fast forward 30 years and we’re still the biggest spenders.” Theresa May has acknowledged the problem, telling the former party leader Michael Howard in an interview with parliament’s House magazine on Thursday: “I think there is a generation out there who feel that they’re going to be worse off than their parents. And what we want as Conservatives is that people should be able to see a brighter future for their children.” Downing Street has been scrambling to draw up policies that might appeal to the under-40s, and which May and other cabinet ministers could highlight at the party conference. Some government insiders complain, however, that the chief whip, Gavin Williamson, is cautious about measures that could alienate the party’s older base, such as mass housebuilding. George Freeman, the chair of the party’s policy forum, who convened the recent Big Tent ideas festival aimed at considering how to broaden the party’s appeal, has said the housing crisis is at the crux of the Conservatives’ problem with younger voters, asking: “Why would you support capitalism if you have no prospect of owning any capital?” Willetts said the challenge is so serious that his party must set aside its traditional scepticism of state intervention. “On housing, the starting point is increasingly obvious – we’ve got to build more houses, and we’ve got to use all the resources of the state to get them built. In other words, we have to recognise the power of the state,” he said. May used her speech at last year’s conference to signal a more interventionist approach, telling her party that “it’s time to remember the good that government can do”. However, she has since shown little enthusiasm for intervening in markets, and watered down a manifesto pledge to cap energy prices, and scrapped plans to put workers on boards. She also condemned the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for backing Transport for London’s decision to strip the ride-hailing firm Uber of its licence, despite its own boss admitting failings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2017/sep/30/weekend-reading-fowl-play-and-how-to-break-bad-habits","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: Fowl play – and how to break bad habits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2017/sep/30/weekend-reading-fowl-play-and-how-to-break-bad-habits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2017/sep/30/weekend-reading-fowl-play-and-how-to-break-bad-habits","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Fowl play – and how to break bad habits","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We should have seen Trump coming Obama’s rise felt like a new chapter in American history.

Several experienced pilots told the Guardian that they have faced tax investigations relating to the way in which they are employed by Ryanair. Europe’s busiest airline is already grappling with a PR disaster caused by errors in how pilots are rostered for work – leading to the cancellation of tens of thousands of flights through to March next year, which has disrupted the travel plans of 700,000 passengers. Ryanair has also clashed with its pilots over their working conditions, with many complaining about the same contract arrangements that have piqued HMRC’s interest. The tax authority’s focus on individual pilots emerged two years after it launched an investigation into Ryanair’s use of agencies such as Brookfield Aviation to provide about half of its 4,200 pilots. Those who apply to join Ryanair are told to set up an Irish limited company and are made directors of it, under the guidance of accountants recommended by the airline. That company then supplies pilots to one of several agencies, including Brookfield Aviation and McGinley Aviation, who in turn supply them to Ryanair. The system limits Ryanair’s obligations to the pilots, such as sick pay – among the factors that allows the Dublin-based carrier to keep its costs low. But the use of Irish limited companies to employ pilots based in the UK has led to pilots with limited experience of the tax obligations of a limited company falling foul of its fraud investigators. One UK-based pilot said he has been under investigation since February 2015, and is being questioned by HMRC about an employment structure he had no choice but to use. “When I started employment, I had to set up a limited company in Ireland with two other pilots who I knew from training and were employed by Ryanair at the same time. We had to go to Ireland, meet their accountant and set up a company.” He said his lack of experience of acting as a company director meant he left tax affairs to the accountant recommended by Ryanair, but has still been hit with a two-year investigation. “You’re sitting there waiting for the brown envelope to hit the doormat,” he said. “I’m no tax expert and I thought I was doing everything correctly. Now I’ve had to send my logbook off, which is priceless to me.” A former colleague, who used to train pilots for Ryanair, said: “The public should be aware that some of the pilots flying the planes are stressed because of the way they operate. “You have HMRC hounding people who have been pulled into this system that is run by Ryanair.” A third pilot, who is under investigation for non-payment of taxes over five years, said HMRC told him tax on his earnings should have been paid in the UK, even though he was employed by an Irish limited company. He said he had been given “no control over the governance of the way [tax] was being paid”. According to one letter sent to him by HMRC and seen by the Guardian, the tax authority conceded that he had not “engineered” the complex structure and was simply trying to gain employment. “You speak to some of the people affected by this and they’re broken men,” he added. Another pilot showed the Guardian a document in which the agency he worked for told him sign a disclaimer to say he was not an employee of the company but of his own Irish limited company. He said this structure ultimately led HMRC to look into his tax affairs, causing him undue anxiety. “It was one of my main reasons for leaving. I was sick of always being worried if I was paying tax correctly,” he said. And he warned that pilots from other countries are also facing investigations by their domestic authorities. “I flew with one guy who had to sell his house and car because he’d been landed with a tax bill of €40,000,” he said. “He hadn’t been fiddling it on purpose but he’d just got it wrong.” A fifth pilot said British pilots were now worried about their homes being raided, pointing to action taken by Germany tax authorities last year over pilots employed by Brookfield Aviation. “Imagine doing this job when you are constantly worrying about whether what you are doing tax-wise is legal, simply because you are not given any other option by your own employer,” he said. All of the pilots interviewed also warned that the use of self-employed contracts, which do not entitle them to sick pay, meant some were turning up to work even if they were ill. HMRC said: “We don’t comment on identifiable individuals or organisations.” Ryanair said: “We do not comment on rumour or speculation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/spain-iraq-secession-madrid-catalonia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T10:05:54Z","webTitle":"From Spain to Iraq, states have to see that suppressing secession won’t work | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/spain-iraq-secession-madrid-catalonia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/spain-iraq-secession-madrid-catalonia","fields":{"headline":"From Spain to Iraq, states have to see that suppressing secession won’t work","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Forget Brexit. The referendum that really matter is this Sunday in the wealthy Spanish province of Catalonia and its great city of Barcelona. A Catalan vote for independence from Spain would trigger a similar vote in Euskal Herria, the Basque country, and start Spain down the road to disintegration. The outcome of the referendum is considered too close to call, which is why the Madrid government has declared it illegal and done everything in its power to suppress it. Anyone who thinks Balkanisation was a 19th-century phenomenon is a fool. Earlier this month the Kurds, the world’s largest “people without a state”, voted to secede from Iraq, not to mention the Kurdish regions of Iran and Turkey. War beckons. Secession in Ukraine has produced two de facto states. Yemen is fighting itself. Myanmar is seeing the enforced secession of the Rohingya, whom a majority of Burmese do not want living in their land. In Britain, Brexit itself is a form of secession. When sovereign states see their power eroding, they act irrationally. The Spanish government’s attempts to suppress Sunday’s vote, with police raids, media censorship and imported riot police, could hardly be more counter-productive. It was London’s inept denial of devolution to Scotland in the 1980s that stirred Scottish nationalism. It was in large part the breakneck pace of the EU’s build-up of power that drove Britain to the Brexit door. The trouble is that democracy as “the will of the people” does not say which people. Britain defended the wish of the Falklanders to stay British, but not the citizens of Hong Kong or Diego Garcia. Britain went to war for Bosnia and Kosovo to secede from Yugoslavia and Serbia respectively. It would be happy if Northern Ireland voted to secede and re-join the Republic of Ireland, yet it fanatically opposed Scottish independence. Secession is a concept riddled with double standards. The only sensible conclusion is to acknowledge the right of territorial groups to some form of self-rule. The liberty of a democratic state to impede its own break-up is qualified by the right of its provinces to decide for themselves how they want to be governed and by whom. The peaceful partition of Czechoslovakia was a case in point. Where agreement is not reached, secession is the default. The alternative is conflict and, in the extreme, violence. That is why the issue is not secession as such, but the state centralism that is usually its cause. The conflict between Madrid and the Basques led eventually to compromise and “autonomy-lite”. This must surely be the sensible outcome of the Catalan dispute. How superior power treats inferior rights has lain at the root of politics since the dawn of time. Devolution is not an option but a necessity. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T11:05:07Z","webTitle":"Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever","fields":{"headline":"Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Stephen King’s It has broken the 44-year record set by The Exorcist to become the highest-grossing horror film of all time. Warner Bros announced Thursday that the film, an adaptation of King’s novel about a child-devouring clown, had crossed the $500m (£399m) mark at the global box office, besting the $441m total made by The Exorcist. It had already set the record for a horror film in 17 territories, including the US, the UK and Australia. “Crossing $500m is rarified air for any film, but for a horror film it is history-making, and we could not be prouder,” Sue Kroll, president of worldwide marketing and distribution at Warner Bros told Variety. “The film-makers and cast did more than make a box-office hit,” she said. “They created a communal, must-see moviegoing event that has reverberated around the globe and is still going strong.” However, this record-breaking performance comes with a hefty caveat: adjusted for ticket-price inflation The Exorcist’s total is still comfortably higher. In 2014, The Exorcist’s adjusted worldwide gross was calculated at $1.794bn. The highest-grossing film of all time when adjusted for inflation is Gone With the Wind, whose worldwide total of $400m equates to more than $3.4bn at 2014 prices. The success of It has prompted the studio behind the film, New Line Cinema, to fast-track a sequel, which has already been given a September 2019 release date. Andy Muschetti will again direct the film, which will be set 17 years later, mirroring King’s original novel.

England would clearly be a weaker team in Stokes’s absence but Moeen, the man of the series for the one-day internationals against West Indies, responded positively when asked about the chances of retaining the Ashes in the wake of last week’s incident outside a nightclub in Bristol. “I definitely feel we can still win‚” said Moeen. “Otherwise there’s no point going out there. If he [Stokes] is not there we are going to have to play well. We all know how good a cricketer he is and what he can bring to the table. He’s one of the main players we have and it would be great to have him out there. But we’ll see what happens.” If Stokes is absent then Moeen and Jonny Bairstow, who have been mighty effective all-rounders in the middle order in recent series, must assume even more responsibility. In Moeen’s case this would mean batting at six or seven rather than eight. He would not shy away from such elevation. “The higher up I bat the better‚” he said. “I’m used to No8 at the moment but if I get told to bat at seven I feel capable of doing well there [Moeen has flourished there in the past]. It doesn’t really matter where. I’m going to go out to Australia with a fresh mindset, hopefully winning the series and coming home with the little urn.” It would be a surprise if Moeen expressed an alternative view, but his sense of excitement with the Brisbane Test seven weeks away was palpable. “I genuinely can’t wait. I’m very, very excited. When you are a young player you’re thinking you’d love to be on that tour. I never thought I would be and to be going, I’m very fortunate.” Whether or not Stokes travels to Australia, the routine of touring there will undergo a significant change after the events of the past week. On Saturday, it became apparent that Andrew Strauss had offered “encouragement” to his players not to embark upon a stag weekend for Jos Buttler in Amsterdam. In Australia, “encouragement” may become “instruction” on what is appropriate beyond the boundary. Toby Roland-Jones, ruled out of the tour, with a back injury, has spoken intelligently about this issue. “The culture of self-governing within the dressing room has really aided this England team, certainly from the little I have experienced of it‚” he said. “The key things are timing and knowing that if you drink too much that can impact on your performance and preparation – and that is in no way accepted by the management. When you are celebrating a series win or enjoying casual beers in the dressing room that breeds a really positive culture. But there’s a fine line there and unfortunately in certain instances it becomes pretty black and white when it is crossed.” Roland-Jones clutched at a positive straw about the impact of recent events on the Ashes tour. “We’ve had various small chats about their media and my little understanding is that they’ll certainly try and make a target of him [Stokes]. Knowing him a little bit as I do, I would have no problems about him being over there and still being able to perform and having a massive impact for that England team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/30/mark-mccall-saracens-premiership-rugby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T21:00:43Z","webTitle":"Mark McCall wants coaches to have say in length of Premiership season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/30/mark-mccall-saracens-premiership-rugby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/30/mark-mccall-saracens-premiership-rugby","fields":{"headline":"Mark McCall wants coaches to have say in length of Premiership season","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Saracens’ Mark McCall, director of rugby at England’s most successful club this decade, believes coaches should be given a central role in the dispute over the length of the season that has prompted players to consider going on strike. Premiership Rugby intends to run the domestic campaign over 10 months from 2019-20, starting in September and running until the end of June when international players will go on international tours. The Rugby Football Union has said it is a decision for the Professional Game Board, not clubs, but McCall wants those at the sharp end to have a say. “It would seem to be sensible to talk to all the parties who can contribute to the debate,” he said. “Directors of rugby should definitely be involved, the players as well. At the moment, you are reliant on your Premiership representative on the board to represent the collective view of the clubs, but this is an important issue for everyone.” The Saracens captain, Brad Barritt, said while the issue was not preoccupying players, no one wanted a 10-month campaign. “Everyone has their take on it and what is universal is that no one wants to extend the length of the season,” he said. “I understand the debate to have the Premiership as strong as possible and the only way that could happen is if they reduced the number of games.” David Humphreys, Gloucester’s director of rugby, said the season length was only one part of the debate. “There are a number of big issues, including the increased number of ‘A’ games and the salary cap. We would need a bigger squad if the season was lengthened and would have to increase the cap.” Gloucester had 15 players unavailable because of injury for Friday night’s Premiership match at Sale, while Bath are without 13 for Sunday’s fixture at Wasps. “There are more injuries in the game now,” said Humphreys. “We have to ask where we are trying to take the game and how we are trying to get it there. “Player welfare has to be the priority. We want them to have long careers and that should underpin everything. The directors of rugby meet regularly and we have discussions with our club owners and chief executives. We all know the direction we would like to go and there are still discussions to be had. We have a responsibility to give players a long break from the game [in the off-season]. We cannot have them leaving the game at 21, 22 or 23 because they are injured. We need to get this right.” The England captain, Dylan Hartley, said it was different to the players’ strike in 2000 when the England squad downed boots in a dispute over appearance money and win bonuses. “It is about guys who are playing Premiership rugby every week,” the Northampton hooker said. “They are the ones who need to be considered. I get the chance of a fallow week here and there as an international. England players are a part of it, but it is not on my shoulders to lead the Martin Johnson strike of 2000. We have not had anything concrete put to us so we do not know what is going on. I won’t comment any further until I see what it is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/30/most-people-do-not-believe-the-tories-are-on-their-side-my-party-has-to-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T20:00:42Z","webTitle":"Most people do not believe the Tories are on their side.

My party has to change","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The Conservatives have a trust problem. New polling shows that the Tory party is a huge turn-off for most people under 44. Around 75% of them said they would not consider voting for us. More and more people see us as the party of the rich. And most people do not believe that Conservatives are “on their side”. This is a wake-up call. The party I know and which I joined in 1992, when I was 21, is inspiring, principled and deserves support. We have done a huge amount to further Theresa May’s promise to build a country that works for everyone. A Conservative approach offers the best hope for our future at a time of huge global challenges. And the party is full of talent and experience from all walks of life. But it is clear that this is not what most people, especially younger people, think. By dint of my professions – doctor and MP – I get a rare perspective on the difference that trust makes. It is impossible to operate in society without it. We can each point to different reasons for this. Our achievements in government are often lost in today’s dumbed-down discourse, while our few failures are amplified. But ultimately, we must face the fact that this is about something more deep-seated than misperception or disillusionment. And the only thing that will win back trust is real renewal. By this, I do not mean superficial “rebranding”. We have never been, and are not about to become, a party of gurus and gimmicks. We are a party of statesmanship and substance. To achieve such renewal I see five priorities. First, we need to get the greatest possible number of people involved – joining forces to bring about meaningful positive change and stop our country from becoming another failed socialist experiment. Second, while other parties look to the past for answers, we must present a vision for when those born today reach their prime. Third, we need to show that Conservative principles make for good government – and the best possible future for our country. Real conservatism is compassionate and responsible. We look after people, especially our most vulnerable, and nurture our country’s resources. We are engaged in the world. We value all that previous generations have fought to provide, preserving what is good and seeking to change what doesn’t work. We look to the future. We prize the talent, innovation and sheer effort that gets us ahead of the curve. We support responsibly operated free markets because they drive progress. Above all, we believe in fairness, tolerance and good stewardship. Fourth, our policies and priorities must be based on the soundest evidence. We must listen to experienced people. We need to be outward-looking and so much more than just the Brexit party to tackle the big global challenges we face. We need to make sure that we can all be decently housed. We need to work with our public servants to deliver the best public services. And we need fair ways to pay our rising health and welfare costs and to invest for tomorrow. We need to communicate a positive vision for our country and to make sure that our policies provide it and are understood by the public. Finally, we need leaders who are demonstrably worthy of trust – empathetic, principled, competent and compassionate. Most of us simply want a good crack at life – the opportunity to get a good education and a job, to earn enough to give ourselves and our families good lives and to give back to our community. These are solid, conservative aspirations. But for many young Britons, that’s exactly what they remain until well into their 30s and 40s. And that’s not good enough. No political entity can stand still while the world changes around it and expect to survive. We must revitalise conservatism and rejuvenate our party. By doing so we will secure the opportunity to continue building a better future for our country.

George Curtis will always be best remembered as John Sillett’s managerial partner on the day Coventry City won the 1987 FA Cup. Yet for Harrison’s generation in the 1950s and 1960s he was the kind of centre‑half who could trouble even the most granite-jawed opponent. Harrison played with him on their national service and was always fascinated how a man of 5ft 11in won so many headers against players who were well over 6ft. “No problem,” Curtis explained, “early in the game, when the first ball comes up the middle, I don’t head the ball. I head the back of the centre-forward’s head against the ball – and he doesn’t usually come back for more.” Harrison liked what he heard so much he adopted the same tactic, as you might expect for a man whose nickname during 10 years as a wing‑half at Halifax Town was “Chopper”. Harrison, by his own admission, saw every header as a personal challenge, no matter what was in the way. Yet it had its consequences. His wife, Shirley, told me a story recently about her first pregnancy and the arrival of their baby daughter, Kim. Harrison was in another part of the hospital that day, suffering one of his regular concussions, and missed the birth. That one wiped him out for three days. He is 79 now and the most famous players from his list of successes Old Trafford are still in thrall of their old coach. Yet it hasn’t been easy for anyone when they have called in to see him this year. “Eric still talks about them – Giggsy, Beckham, Scholesy, the Nevilles – but he doesn’t recognise them now,” Shirley explains. “He recognises me and his daughters, but not even the grandchildren. The players have all been to visit but it wasn’t the Eric they knew. Scholesy, in particular, found it really hard. They all did. It was upsetting for all of them.” Beckham had turned up with a carrot cake he had baked with his children and a bottle of whisky. Afterwards, he sat in his car and wept. By now, you have probably read about Harrison’s deteriorating health and the inevitable concerns that maybe he has suffered from what the coroner in Jeff Astle’s inquest described as “industrial disease”, namely dementia brought on by heading the ball. Nobody can be sure if there is a connection but, as Shirley acknowledges, it is something she and her family have to consider when there are so many stories of other former pros from bygone eras – in particular, players who were renowned for their heading ability – who have suffered the same way. Astle’s family have led the campaign for greater research, first featured in this column in March 2014, and maybe we are finally getting somewhere now the Football Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association are planning to commission a study to examine the risks and see what can be done. Yet it has been a bewilderingly slow process, to say the least, bearing in mind it was actually 2002 when the two organisations announced there would be a joint 10-year research programme and I wonder how Kevin Doyle feels about that now football has a story of a modern player who has been forced to retire, on medical advice, because heading the ball was causing persistent headaches. Doyle’s announcement follows what he describes as “numerous” concussions, including two this season, as a player who was always renowned for his aerial ability, scoring a high percentage of his goals that way at Reading, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Colorado Rapids. He is 34 and says his doctors have advised him to end a career that also features 64 caps for the Republic of Ireland to “avoid the possibility of these symptoms becoming more serious and permanent”. The risks are simply too great. At least he has got out now, rather than subjecting himself to any more punishment, and hopefully that will mean no further problems, whereas there once would have been a time when a footballer in that position would have been encouraged to carry on regardless. Yet it always comes as a jolt when a professional sportsman is advised to quit on medical grounds and particularly in Doyle’s case when many of us, I imagine, might presume there is not a great deal to worry about from heading the ball in today’s game. It is an easy assumption to make and I must confess I was one of those who thought the dangers had largely been removed once football phased out those heavy, leather balls, often saturated in water, that have been blamed for the issues relating to previous generations. That, however, might be a common mistake because if you listen to some of the experts who have been studying these cases it is a complete red herring. The balls might be lighter these days but that just means they travel much faster. The game is getting quicker all the time and that means more crosses are being made and more headers are necessary. There might not be the same kind of physicality compared to the days, to quote Harrison, when “trying to break opponents in half” was part of your average Saturday afternoon. But the greater speed also means there is a higher risk of players taking accidental bangs to the head. Willie Stewart, the neuropathologist who examined Astle and likened what he found to the brain of an old boxer, calls it a “lazy characterisation” to think of it as merely a problem of the past. Many people still do, however, and maybe that explains why the authorities in England have chosen to look the other way for so long, never taking the trouble to confront the evidence properly. It is certainly worth recounting what happened after the FA promised the Astle family in 2002 that it would treat the issue as a high-level priority. Instead the family received two letters and did not hear from the governing body for 12 years until Greg Dyke, the then chairman, had the decency to apologise on behalf of a previous regime. The first letter was from the FA’s solicitors to advise against legal action. The next could easily be described as a sweetener – a tactic the FA used many years later with various sexual-abuse victims – by offering free tickets for the next England friendly, albeit with the rider that it would be difficult to squeeze them all in. Two seats was the limit. Thankfully, there are other countries where they have devoted time to these studies without leaving the impression they had to be pushed into seeking answers. One study in New York found that players in their 30s who headed the ball 885 to 1,550 times a year had significantly lower water movement in three areas of their brains and those who did so more than 1,800 times tended to do notably worse in memory tests. American sports have been much quicker to recognise the dangers of concussion and when it comes to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the brain disease caused by repeated blows, Boston University announced last week there had been a significant breakthrough diagnosing it in living humans rather than having to identify it posthumously, as was previously the case. The United States feels so far ahead in terms of its research, its response (heading has been outlawed for under‑10s since 2015) and its understanding that the people playing sport have a right to know the risks. It might not change the way they play, or what their coaches demand, but at least they would be in possession of the facts. Doyle moved to Major League Soccer in 2015. It doesn’t reflect well on English football that he might still be going up for headers every Saturday, come what may, if he had stayed put. Burden of proof on Ox to show worth Who did Gareth Southgate mean when he admitted being dissatisfied with his latest England squad and volunteered the information that “one or two players” did not warrant their places judging by their club performances so far this season? Southgate was too gentlemanly to say but nobody should be surprised if Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain featured prominently in the thoughts of the England manager after a run of form that has merely confirmed the view here that Arsenal did extraordinarily well to coax a transfer fee of £40m out of Liverpool. Oxlade-Chamberlain is a curious player because he certainly does not lack admirers. Arsène Wenger wanted to keep him at Arsenal and, as well as Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool, Antonio Conte had him on his wish-list for Chelsea. Roy Hodgson spoke highly of him during his time as England manager and Southgate keeps selecting him. At the same time, it is not always easy to understand the attraction and the difficult truth, looking back over his Arsenal years, is that it is trickier even still to recall a key fixture when Oxlade-Chamberlain has played the leading role. He has started only one game for Liverpool, a Carabao Cup tie, and if there are hidden layers it is time he found a way to bring them out. Oxlade-Chamberlain is 24 now and at that age no footballer should want to be talked about for mere potential."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/01/vaginal-mesh-scandal-women-dont-need-body-shaming","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"Vaginal mesh scandal: women don’t need body-shaming on top of their pain | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/01/vaginal-mesh-scandal-women-dont-need-body-shaming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/01/vaginal-mesh-scandal-women-dont-need-body-shaming","fields":{"headline":"Vaginal mesh scandal: women don’t need body-shaming on top of their pain","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The ongoing vaginal mesh implant scandal is a complex affair, with group lawsuits erupting all around the world, including the US, the UK and Australia. Last week, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Ethicon unit was ordered to pay a record $57m in damages to a woman called Ella Ebaugh. The J&amp;J implant, launched without a clinical trial, is still marketed, often in cases involving traumatic births, years after it was known to cause appalling problems to women such as Ebaugh, including intense pelvic pain and torn bladders and vaginas, leading to agonising sex and incontinence. While many women don’t have problems with vaginal meshes, those who do suffer horribly. If that’s not bad enough, emails showed J&amp;J staff bantering about a spouse’s observation that having sex with them was akin to “screwing a wire brush”. A male Ethicon medical director replied: “I’ve never tried the wire brush thing so I won’t comment”. For me, this was one of the points where the red mist descended – it was just the sheer lack of basic human respect shown towards women going through every shade of hell and humiliation, some of them for years on end. The time factor is an issue in itself. With other types of meshes still being used, questions need to be asked. Why have women taken so long to come forward with problems, while others have been so quickly browbeaten into accepting, first, terrible treatment and advice and then condescension when meshes fail? It seems to me that some of it could be due to the culture of systemic female body-shaming, the only difference being that, this time, the body-shaming is all on the inside. Most people, especially women, know about “regular” (external) body-shaming – too fat, too thin, too young, too old, too dark, too pale, etc, etc… We all know the drill by now. Throughout her life, the average woman finds herself routinely judged on her outward appearance (and usually found wanting) as surely as a reluctant hound dragged around the ring at Crufts. Internal body-shaming is different but just as complicated. While some women are naturally modest and reserved about certain parts of their body (vaginas, bladders, bowels), when something goes wrong, this swiftly mutates into intense shame and humiliation. Sadly, too often, this can lead to problems being overlooked and sidelined, with women suffering in silence for much longer than they would with, say, a sore arm or back. In this context, sexual problems are embarrassing enough, but if symptoms include incontinence women may feel that they’re disgusting and expect others to be disgusted by them too. This is the battered, unsure, despairing self-image and inner monologue that these women would have to carry into consulting rooms, both for the treatment and resulting problems. Adding this psychological dimension, it’s hardly surprising some of the mesh-sufferers haven’t always been in the most assertive of moods when they have been fobbed off, sidelined and patronised about their symptoms. Of course, in a feminist utopia, it wouldn’t be like this – all women would feel that they could loudly, proudly own, name, examine and fight for every last inch of their bodies. They would realise that it’s nonsensical to feel ashamed of a particular ailment just because it relates to a certain part of their anatomy. In the real world, it doesn’t always work out like this. Nor is it a form of weakness. Some experiences are so horrible that they can effectively disable and muzzle the strongest-minded of women. I’m not arguing that all women are actively engaged in an old Les Dawson-style sketch, awkwardly miming to each other about their “down-belows”. However, I do wonder how much of this inbuilt shame played a part in the vaginal mesh scandal. I also wonder, with rising anger, how much their intrinsic sense of embarrassment could be used against vulnerable women – intimidating and silencing them, when they are at their lowest ebbs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/30/huddersfield-town-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T13:32:37Z","webTitle":"Harry Kane and Tottenham show Huddersfield no mercy to win at a canter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/30/huddersfield-town-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/30/huddersfield-town-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Harry Kane and Tottenham show Huddersfield no mercy to win at a canter","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"These days a team is not really a Premier League side until Harry Kane has shattered their defence. So this was an initiation of sorts for Huddersfield Town, who became the latest victims of a striker whose goals are fuelling Tottenham’s trophy ambitions and his own quest to break records. David Wagner’s team had conceded only three goals in their first six top-flight matches since promotion but Tottenham fired that many past them in the first 23 minutes here, with Kane, inevitably, leading the onslaught. He scored the visitors’ first and third goals, and was instrumental in creating the second for Ben Davies. The left-back Davies helped the visitors add a fourth in stoppage time by setting up Moussa Sissoko. Kane now has 84 goals from 123 Premier League appearances. And his strike rate is accelerating: factor in his midweek hat-trick in the Champions League against Apoel Nicosia and he has hit 13 goals in all competitions in September, the most productive month of the 24-year-old’s career to date. Mauricio Pochettino is almost lost for words. “It’s difficult to speak every three days about Harry Kane and find different words to describe him,” the Tottenham manager said. “He’s great in front of goal. And when we don’t have the ball he is the first to run and fight for it. He’s a very good example for football. So humble. It’s so lucky for us a to have a player like him.” Kane tried to open the scoring here in the second minute but saw his shot deflected behind by Mathias Jorgensen. Then Huddersfield had the temerity to try to get on the scoresheet before him, Hugo Lloris thwarting a shock by diving full-length to tip away a powerful long-range effort by Tommy Smith. Then Kane took over. He had unwitting help from Huddersfield’s left-back Chris Löwe, whose mistake on half-way turned a banal clearing header by Kieran Trippier into the perfect through-ball for Kane. The striker did the rest, cantering forward and into the box before finishing as matter-of-factly as a librarian slotting a book into the correct space on a shelf. Löwe was unfortunate to play a role in Spurs’ second, too. That came seven minutes later after snazzy interplay down the left between Dele Alli and Kane, who flicked a pass through to Christian Eriksen at the edge of the area. Löwe poked the ball off the Dane’s foot but when it ran across to the other side of the box, Davies lifted it over the advancing Jonas Lössl with a delicate finish. With Spurs seemingly intent on punishing every error, Lössl must have feared the worst when he miskicked an attempted clearance and thus gifted the ball to Kane. But the goalkeeper recovered sufficiently to rob the ball back. However, the relief was only temporary. In the 23rd minute Kane struck again, rolling past two opponents before curling a precise left-foot shot into the net from 20 yards. “He’s just a one-season wonder,” chanted the away fans with gleeful sarcasm. Spurs were a class above anyone Huddersfield have encountered so far this season. This was the fourth away match in a row in which they have struck three goals, and they could have increased the tally before half-time. Alli struck the post after one smooth move down the right. Huddersfield, made to look ragged at times, did not bow down. Laurent Depoitre cracked a ferocious long-range shot against the crossbar just before the break. The home side tightened up in the second period, determined not to permit a tonking. Christopher Schindler hurled himself in front of a shot to prevent Kane plundering another hat-trick. Alli darted through the defence in the 57th minute but when he collapsed in the box as Lössl came to challenge him, the referee booked him for diving. He had been rumbled. “If it was [a dive], he must learn because this type of action doesn’t help him, doesn’t help the team and doesn’t help football,” said Pochettino. “We’ve talked in the last few years about fair play and being honest. I think he’s improving a lot but it’s still something he has to learn.” Spurs did not over-exert themselves after that, knowing the game was up for Huddersfield. But Sissoko scored in stoppage time, anyway, bundling the ball into the net after a charge down the left by Davies. Kane had been substituted by then, leaving in the 86th minute to applause by supporters of both clubs. This was Huddersfield’s first meeting with Tottenham since 1972 and they have still not beaten the Londoners since 1956, when they had a player in their team, Ray Wilson, who would later win the World Cup with England. Here the Yorkshire team were shot down by another Englishman who could go on to greatness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/30/donald-trump-attacks-puerto-rico-mayor-carmen-yulin-cruz","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T12:53:10Z","webTitle":"Trump attacks Puerto Rico mayor: 'They want everything done for them'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/30/donald-trump-attacks-puerto-rico-mayor-carmen-yulin-cruz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/30/donald-trump-attacks-puerto-rico-mayor-carmen-yulin-cruz","fields":{"headline":"Trump attacks Puerto Rico mayor: 'They want everything done for them'","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Donald Trump lashed out at the mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital city on Saturday as the row over his administration’s response to a hurricane and humanitarian crisis escalated. Ahead of his visit to the devastated US territory next week, the president used Twitter to say of Carmen Yulín Cruz: “Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help”. He went on: “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.” Trump received a measure of praise for his handling of the recent hurricanes that struck Texas and Florida but has come under fire for a flat-footed response in Puerto Rico, where he sought to defend slow relief efforts by saying: “This is an island surrounded by water, big water, ocean water.” In the past 10 days he has been distracted by a long weekend at his golf club in New Jersey, an election contest in Alabama, a major tax reform plan and a racially charged dispute with sportsmen who kneel during the national anthem. With terrible timing, there have also been revelations about Trump’s cabinet members taking expensive charter flights at taxpayers’ expense, culminating in the resignation of the health secretary, Tom Price. Critics have warned that Maria threatens to become “Trump’s Katrina” – a reference to the 2005 hurricane that smashed New Orleans and became a defining failure of George W Bush’s presidency. Maria, the most powerful storm to strike Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, has killed at least 16 people on the island, according to the official death toll. The situation remains dire as residents face shortages of food, water and fuel. The electric grid was badly damaged by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, leaving many without power and reliant on gas-powered generators. The hurricanes crippled the island’s already weakened waste and water treatment plants while fallen trees and strewn debris block roads and cellphone service remains limited for the 3.4 million population. Trump hit out at Cruz after she decried his relief efforts on Friday, saying if the federal government did not solve the logistics “what we we are going to see is something close to a genocide”. “We are dying here,” Cruz said at a press conference, speaking with tears in her eyes. “I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out the logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles. So, mayday, we are in trouble.” Cruz had appealed directly to the president, saying: “I am asking the president of the United States to make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives … I will do what I never thought I was going to do. I am begging, begging anyone that can hear us, to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency.” Trump, who has appointed a three-star general to coordinate the response, is scheduled to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday and said on Saturday he would visit with the first lady and hopefully be able to stop at the US Virgin Islands, which have also been battered. The president also criticised “Fake News Networks” for negative coverage and said Cruz had been wound up by his political opponents to attack him. He tweeted: “The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.” Cruz was then asked on the MSNBC channel whether anyone had told her to go out and name Trump. She laughed scornfully and said: “Actually, I was asking for help. I wasn’t saying anything nasty about the president … This is a time when everyone shows their true colors. I have no time for distractions … This isn’t about me; this isn’t about anyone; this is about lives that are being lost if things do not get done properly real quickly.” She added: “I am not going to be distracted by small comments, by politics, by petty issues. This is one goal and it is to save lives. That’s all that matters.” Trump has a long history of “punching back” in business and politics. During his election campaign, he went on the offensive against the Muslim family of a dead US soldier and a former beauty queen who supported his rival Hillary Clinton. After a deadly terrorist attack in London in June, he twisted the words of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to slight him. Such broadsides appear to strike a chord with his rightwing populist base. Mike Cernovich, a notorious blogger, author and cheerleader for the president, tweeted about Cruz with no evidence: “She is garbage, she is a murderer, she failed her people and her duties and belongs in prison!” Others expressed disgust at Trump’s inaction and lack of sensitivity towards the mayor. Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical Hamilton and of Puerto Rican descent, tweeted: “She has been working 24/7./ You have been GOLFING./ You’re going straight to hell./ Fastest golf cart you ever took.” Pop star Lady Gaga tweeted her 71.4 million followers in response to the president’s criticism of Cruz: She then followed that up with another tweet speculating on the reasons why Trump, in her opinion, wasn’t helping Puerto Rico:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/01/sadiq-khan-backed-by-londoners-uber-ban-tfl","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T23:03:01Z","webTitle":"Londoners support Sadiq Khan over Uber ban and handling of Grenfell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/01/sadiq-khan-backed-by-londoners-uber-ban-tfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/01/sadiq-khan-backed-by-londoners-uber-ban-tfl","fields":{"headline":"Londoners support Sadiq Khan over Uber ban and handling of Grenfell","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sadiq Khan has received a significant boost after it emerged that Londoners support the withdrawal of Uber’s licence. The capital’s mayor was criticised by Theresa May for backing the decision by Transport for London (TfL), saying that it had put thousands of jobs at risk. However, more Londoners agree than disagree with the ruling, while the mayor’s popularity appears to be undamaged by the row. According to a YouGov poll for Queen Mary University of London, 43% back the decision, while 31% oppose it. Only voters aged between 18 and 24 are against the move, with 47% disapproving and 30% approving. Among Uber customers, 49% say TfL was wrong 31% say it was right. Khan’s personal ratings remain extremely high. His net approval rating is at plus-35, similar to the level throughout his mayoralty so far. Uber’s chief executive has since apologised for “mistakes” after TfL rejected its licence application because of a “lack of corporate responsibility” in relation to reporting criminal offences, obtaining medical certificates and driver background checks. In a worrying sign for May, the Tories have fallen even further behind in London since the June election and are now 25 points behind Labour. The poll puts Labour on 55% support, with the Tories three points further back compared with the election, on 30%. Asked who would make the best prime minister, 35% of Londoners say Jeremy Corbyn, while only 22% say May. Khan also won approval for his handling of the Grenfell tragedy. Most Londoners (55%) think he handled it well, while 24% said he handled it badly while only 20% think the same of the prime minister.Even among Conservative voters, Khan is seen to have done better at dealing with Grenfell (with a net approval rating of +6) than May (+1). “Labour’s vote is still at stratospheric levels,” said Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary. “At the general election, Labour polled 55% of the vote in London, the Conservatives on 33%. This poll has Labour slightly extending their lead. “We also asked about how Londoners would vote in a council election. These are due in London next year. Excluding don’t knows and would not votes, we have Labour on 53%, and the Conservatives on 29%. “This would represent the best performance by any party in London elections since Harold Wilson’s Labour in 1971, and put Labour on course for significant gains. “Sadiq Khan continues to poll extremely well. We have now asked a question about his approval four times since March 2017, and he polls as highly now as he did then. His net satisfaction rating – those who think he is doing well minus those who think he is doing badly – is +35, with 58% thinking he is doing well, just 23% badly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/30/archbishop-of-canterbury-accused-of-hypocrisy-by-sexual-abuse-survivors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T11:54:11Z","webTitle":"Archbishop of Canterbury accused of hypocrisy by sexual abuse survivors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/archbishop-of-canterbury-accused-of-hypocrisy-by-sexual-abuse-survivors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/archbishop-of-canterbury-accused-of-hypocrisy-by-sexual-abuse-survivors","fields":{"headline":"Archbishop of Canterbury accused of hypocrisy by sexual abuse survivors","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Survivors of sexual abuse by Church of England figures have accused Justin Welby of “breathtaking hypocrisy” after the Archbishop of Canterbury criticised the BBC for the way it handled abuse by Jimmy Savile. Welby said the BBC had not shown the same integrity over accusations of child abuse that the Catholic and Anglican churches had. In a statement, six survivors of abuse by powerful church figures rejected Welby’s comments and said the record of the church and Welby himself was one of “silence, denial and evasion”. Their statement said: “Speaking from our own bitter experience, we do not recognise Archbishop Welby’s description of the integrity with which the Church of England handles cases of abuse in a church context. “Far from the ‘rigorous response and self-examination’ he claims, our experience of the church, and specifically the archbishop, is of long years of silence, denial and evasion. The Church of England needs to confront its own darkness in relation to abuse before confronting the darkness of others.” Matthew Ineson, who was allegedly raped as a teenager by a C of E vicar, said Welby had shown “breathtaking hypocrisy”. The vicar, Trevor Devamanikkam, killed himself the day he was due in court to face charges. “I know from my own experience, and the experience of others, that safeguarding within the C of E is appalling,” Ineson said. “The church has colluded with the cover-up of abuse and has obstructed justice for those whose lives have been ruined by the actions of its clergy. I have been fighting for five years for the church to recognise its responsibilities and I’m still being met with attempts to bully me into dropping my case.” Welby was invited to contribute to a series on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme marking the programme’s 60th anniversary and changes in British society over the period. He said: “I think we are a kinder society, more concerned with our own failures, more willing to be honest where we go wrong in most of our institutions.” But “there are still dark areas”, he added. When asked which, Welby said: “If I’m really honest, I’d say the BBC is one. “I haven’t seen the same integrity over the BBC’s failures over Savile as I’ve seen in the Roman Catholic Church, in the Church of England, in other public institutions over abuse.” The BBC said it did not recognise the accusation against the corporation, and it had acted transparently over Savile. A spokesperson said: “When the Savile allegations became known we established an independent investigation by a high court judge. In the interests of transparency, this was published in full. We apologised and accepted all the recommendations. “And while today’s BBC is a different place, we set out very clear actions to ensure the highest possible standards of child safeguarding.” Senior figures in both the Anglican and Catholic churches have been accused of abuse in recent years, and both have been accused of collusion and cover-up. An independent review report of the crimes of the former Bishop of Gloucester, Peter Ball, published earlier this year found senior figures in the C of E had colluded with Ball. Following the report, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey resigned from an honorary position in the diocese of Oxford. Cardinal George Pell, a powerful Vatican official, has been charged with sexual offences in his native Australia. He denies any wrongdoing. Survivors of sexual abuse in the Church of England are planning a protest next week at the end of a five-day meeting in Canterbury of Anglican primates from around the world to draw attention to what they call the church’s failure to properly respond to disclosures and prioritise survivors’ needs. A spokesperson for Lambeth Palace said: “We fully accept the failures of the Church of England in the area of safeguarding. “Since the archbishop took up his role he has been very clear that the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults should be the highest priority of all parts of the church and was one of the first to call for the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. “The church’s national safeguarding team was created in 2015 and there are now robust house of bishops safeguarding policies in place along with independent audits for all dioceses and dedicated training on hearing disclosures for all senior clergy. The archbishop fully supports the church’s commitment to develop a stronger national approach to safeguarding to improve its response to protecting the vulnerable. “The archbishop believes this level of rigorous response and self-examination needs to extend to all institutions, including the BBC.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/30/two-men-killed-series-stabbings-london-manchester-birmingham-sheffield","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T14:03:28Z","webTitle":"Boy, 14, critical after being stabbed outside mosque in Birmingham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/two-men-killed-series-stabbings-london-manchester-birmingham-sheffield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/two-men-killed-series-stabbings-london-manchester-birmingham-sheffield","fields":{"headline":"Boy, 14, critical after being stabbed outside mosque in Birmingham","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A man has been arrested in connection with the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy outside a mosque in Birmingham. The attack, which left the teenager in a critical condition, was one of several violent incidents in four cities that left two people dead and several others injured on Friday night and the early hours of Saturday. West Midlands police said a 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder on Saturday morning and is in custody. Police said the teenager suffered several stab wounds in the attack in the Small Heath area shortly after 1am on Saturday and was taken to hospital by paramedics. A cordon has been put in place at the scene in Herbert Road while specialist teams carry out forensic investigations. Police said they were not treating the attack as a terrorist incident but the motivation remained unclear. One line of inquiry was that the incident could have been a racially motivated hate crime. The incident occurred when the boy was dropped off at the Idaara Maarif-e-Islam mosque, commonly known as Hussainia, by his father, who went to park the car. Azhar Kiana, the president of the mosque, told the Birmingham Mail: “It happened on the pavement. By the time the dad parked his car his son was on the floor. There was a young man who was brutally beating the boy with a knife. “There was blood everywhere, he was hitting the boy’s neck and head. Then the attacker ran off and got into a car.” Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, expressed his shock in a tweet: DI Jim Colclough from the complex crime investigation team at Bournville Lane police station said: “Our investigation is progressing quickly but it is still in the early stages. We do not believe it to be terror-related. The motivation for the attack is not yet known. We are keeping an open mind as to whether it could be racially or religiously motivated.” Colclough said officers were working closely with local communities and had increased police presence in the area to provide reassurance. “It is a tragic event which has left a young boy in hospital fighting for his life,” he said. “We’ve spoken to a number of witnesses but would continue to urge anyone who was in the area and saw what happened, or has any other information which may help our investigation, to contact me or my team on 101 or to call Crimestoppers as soon as possible.” Amjad Shah, general secretary of Hussainia mosque, confirmed that the boy was a member of their congregation. “This was a cowardly and unprovoked attack and the victim is critically ill in hospital. The board of trustees and the entire community is praying for his swift recovery. Our sympathies are extended to the victim’s family.” He reiterated that the motive behind the attack was unclear. “Background checks so far have not associated the suspect with any particular mosque or community,” he said. “The board of trustees emphasises that whatever the motive behind this attack, it should not be sensationalised or used as a justification to spread hatred or incite violence. Hussainia mosque will not tolerate the disturbance of the communal harmony between the various communities that share this geography.” Meanwhile, two 21-year-old men have been killed in London and Manchester. In London a murder investigation has been launched after a man, who has not been named, was found with stab wounds and later died. Police were called to reports of a disturbance in Ropery Street in Bow at about 2.30am on Saturday. They found the victim, who had been stabbed in nearby Eric Street. He was treated at the scene by paramedics from the London Air Ambulance service before being taken to hospital, where he died at 4.52am. A Met police spokesman said no arrests had been made. “His next of kin have been informed. Formal identification is yet to take place. A postmortem examination will be held in due course.” In Manchester, police are appealing for witnesses after a man was fatally stabbed during a large fight near Deansgate in the city centre. At about 2.50am police were called to reports of a large fight involving men and women, which is believed to have begun in the Suburbia nightclub. A 21-year-old man was treated for stab wounds to his neck at the scene but died as a result of his injuries. Several other people were taken to hospital with injuries, including a man who had been hit with a glass and two women, aged 19 and 21, who were left unconscious after being punched. In Sheffield five people have been injured in two linked stabbing incidents in the city centre. Four people have been arrested in connection with the incidents, which took place early on Saturday morning, according to South Yorkshire police. In a series of tweets, the force said: “We are dealing with two linked stabbing incidents in Sheffield city centre in the early hours of Saturday 30. Five people were injured. “Four people have been arrested and detained in relation to the stabbing incidents in Sheffield early this morning. One person was critically injured and is in a serious but stable condition in hospital.” A police cordon remained in place and police vans were at the scene. Forensic officers could be seen closely examining items within the cordon, which were surrounded by blood, in an area of the city centre that is popular for its nightlife."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/29/los-angeles-palm-trees-dying","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T18:15:10Z","webTitle":"Los Angeles' legendary palm trees are dying – and few will be replaced","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/los-angeles-palm-trees-dying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/los-angeles-palm-trees-dying","fields":{"headline":"Los Angeles' legendary palm trees are dying – and few will be replaced","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"They are the sultry, swaying backdrop to countless films, posters and music videos, an effective way to announce: this is Los Angeles. Palm trees greet you outside the LAX airport, they line Hollywood Boulevard, stand guard over the Pacific and crisscross neighbourhoods poor and rich, a botanical army of stems and fronds which symbolise the world’s entertainment capital. Apparently not for much longer. LA’s palm trees are dying. And most won’t be replaced. A beetle known as the South American palm weevil and a fungus called Fusarium are killing palm trees across southern California. Others are dying of old age. “It’ll change the overall aesthetic because palm trees are so distinctive. It’s the look and feel of Los Angeles,” said Carol Bornstein, director of the nature gardens at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. A city tally in 1990 estimated the number of palms on city streets at 75,000, a number which has not been updated but is destined to plunge in coming decades, the Los Angeles Times reported this week, citing officials. No one knows how many will die, or how fast. For palm lovers, the even worse news is that they won’t be replaced, perhaps not even mourned. Authorities will instead plant other species that give more shade and consume less water – important factors for an overheating city. By the middle of the century, LA is expected to be three to five degrees fahrenheit warmer and to have triple the number of extreme heat days. “Palms are decorative and iconic, but Los Angeles is facing more and more heatwaves, so it’s important that we plant trees that provide adequate shade to protect people and cool the city down,” said Elizabeth Skrzat, programme director for City Plants, the city’s tree planting arm. History may record this as the moment La La Land put utility ahead of adornment. The city will continue to plant trees in certain designated areas, including Hollywood, and developers and homeowners will probably continue to plant palms. “I seriously doubt that palms will disappear entirely,” said Skrzat. Even so, the looming die-off dismayed Becky Saava, 40, a tourist from Uganda who stood beneath giant palms on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. “They should sustain them – find out what fungus is killing them and fix it, leave the city the way it is now. Palm trees are part of it. They make the place so beautiful.” Across the street, Marcel Hidouche, a tour bus operator standing beneath another palm, said LA would rue their dwindling. “They’re relaxing. I feel like I’m on vacation, like I’m on an island and not in a big city. We come for the sunlight, not the shade.” The town of Fillmore, 50 miles north of Hollywood, has special reason to lament. In 2012 it cut down 26 queen palms to make its downtown resemble a more generic, anytown USA to lure film and TV productions. Only one species of palm – Washingtonia filifera, the California fan palm – is native to the state. All other species, from the exuberant, feather-topped Canary Island date palm to the more austere, svelte Mexican fan palm, are imports. Franciscan missionaries in the 18th century were believed to be the first to plant palms ornamentally in LA, a trend that took off in the early 20th century, when palms started adorning boulevards, parks and gardens. “It wasn’t the best choice of plants for a Mediterranean[-style] city. Especially one that has expanded so dramatically,” said Bornstein. David Fink, policy director of Climate Resolve, a not-for-profit organisation that promotes climate solutions for southern California, said the city’s love affair with palms was not necessarily a mistake but that it was time to move on. “The iconic association of palm trees with Los Angeles is a positive, but we’re now in a period where we have a better understanding of what’s needed. It makes sense that we replace the palms with trees that have wide expanses of shade and help cool things down.” Heat, he added, killed more people than other weather events combined. Climate change has made California hotter and drier, a boon to bugs that destroy vegetation, said Andy Lipkis, the president of TreePeople, an LA-based advocacy group. Palms afforded LA little protection from heat, drought and flooding, plus they served as a habitat for the Norway rat, but their die-off signalled a wider crisis, he said. “It’s a wake-up call. Millions of trees are dying in southern California. One price tag for removing the dead trees over the next 30 years is $37bn. Trees have a much harder time growing and thriving in cities today because the climate is much harsher.” For all the advantages of other species, however, Lipkis said part of him would miss the palms. “Something that drives me crazy is people think of trees as decoration rather than life support. But I must admit there is something that they convey that goes along with the image,” he said in a phone interview. “I’m parked in a canyon right now watching four palms sway in the breeze. They don’t belong here, but there’s something a little bit good for the soul in the look.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/28/yosemite-second-rockfall-el-capitan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T03:20:13Z","webTitle":"Second rock fall shakes Yosemite as British victim is named","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/yosemite-second-rockfall-el-capitan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/yosemite-second-rockfall-el-capitan","fields":{"headline":"Second rock fall shakes Yosemite as British victim is named","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A massive new rock fall hit Yosemite national park on Thursday, cracking with a thundering roar off the iconic El Capitan rock formation and sending huge plumes of white dust surging through the valley floor below. It came a day after another slab dropped from El Capitan, killing one British climber and injuring a second. The climber killed by Wednesday’s rock fall has been named as Andrew Foster, 32, from Wales. National park authorities said on Thursday night that his wife was undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital. Authorities said the latest rock fall injured one person, who was airlifted to hospital. Ken Yager, president and founder of the Yosemite Climbing Association, said he witnessed the latest fall and it appeared to be “substantially bigger” than the first. Driving past the base of El Capitan, Yager said he saw the dust cloud and emergency workers rushing to the scene. Images posted on social media showed a huge cloud of thick dust spreading across Yosemite valley. Climber Ryan Sheridan had just reached the top of El Capitan, a 7,569ft (2,307 meter) formation, when the rock slide let loose below him on Thursday. “There was so much smoke and debris,” he said by cellphone from the top of El Capitan. “It filled the entire valley with smoke.” An image Sheridan posted to Instagram shows a thick plume of dust and debris ploughing through the valley below, appearing to cross a road and river. Sheridan had also climbed up El Capitan a day earlier, when the first rock slide occurred and said this one was huge in comparison. “It was in the same location of the previous rock fall. A larger rock fall let loose, easily three times the size,” Sheridan said. Yosemite said on its Twitter page that it was closing a road on the north side of the park because of the rock fall. Officials advised visitors to use the southern access road. The New York Times, citing park officials, said there had been at least one injury and search and rescue helicopters were hovering above the mountainside looking for more victims. The massive granite slab that fell on Wednesday was seen as a rare event but only because the rock fall turned deadly, longtime climbers said on Thursday. Rocks at the world-renowned park’s climbing routes break loose and crash down about 80 times a year. The elite climbers who flock to the park using ropes and their fingertips to defy death as they scale sheer cliff faces know the risk but also know it’s rare to get hit and killed by the rocks. “It’s a lot like a lightning strike,” said Alex Honnold, who made history on 3 June for being the first to climb El Capitan alone and without ropes. “Sometimes geology just happens.” The last time a climber was killed by a rock falling at Yosemite was in 2013, when a Montana climber fell after a rock dislodged and sliced his climbing rope. It was preceded by a 1999 rock fall that crushed a climber from Colorado. Park officials say rock falls overall have killed 16 people since 1857 and injured more than 100. The slab that fell on Wednesday was about 130ft (40 meters) tall and 65ft wide and fell from the popular “waterfall route” on the east buttress of El Capitan, according to Yosemite park ranger and spokesman Scott Gediman. There were at least 30 climbers on the wall of the formation when the rock fell. Foster, who was killed on Wednesday, and his wife, who was seriously injured, were hiking at the bottom of El Capitan, far from trails used by most Yosemite visitors, in preparation for an ascent when the chunk of granite about 12 stories tall broke free and plunged, said Gediman. Yager, the president of the Yosemite Climbing Association, said the rock that broke away “cratered and sent stuff mushrooming out in all directions”. Canadian climber Peter Zabrok described Wednesday’s falling rock as “white granite the size of an apartment building”. Images posted on social media immediately after it fell showed billowing white rock dust soaring high into the air. Yosemite geologist Greg Stock said the rock fall was not caused by climbers, who wedge climbing gear into rock cracks so they can loop ropes to support their weight and the cliff-side tents they use for El Capitan climbs that generally take several days. While the cause of the rock fall will never be known, Stock said the break was probably caused by the expansion and contraction of the monolith’s granite as it heats up during the summer and gets cold and more brittle in the winter. “The rock fall itself is nothing unusual,” he said. “We have had larger rock falls occur in the valley this year.” Gediman, the park spokesman, said Wednesday’s rock fall was among seven that happened in the same general area during a four-hour period. Rescuers found no other victims. Officials had no immediate estimate for how much the big rock weighed. But Gediman said all of the rock falls combined on Wednesday weighed 1,300 tons.

Why is the no case predicting the end of the world and posturing as the victim? Why is there suddenly so much cruelty and hate in a nation renowned for tolerance? There are plenty of easy and obvious answers: the argument against allowing same-sex couples to marry is lost so the no case is fearmongering on every issue but the actual one; the right of the Liberal party is using marriage equality to stage an insurgency against the moderates; Australia has caught a cultural war fever from America’s homophobic sneezing. But none of this explains why gay people marrying is the issue among so many that has driven the right to such extreme action and rhetoric. I agree with Salman Rushdie: “Even if prejudice has roots in all societies, each malodorous flowering of the plant occurs in specific historical, political and economic circumstances.” In Australia the specific historical circumstances that shape prejudice towards LGBTI people is summed up in one word, convictism. In colonial Australia same-sex relationships among convicts were considered the most serious threat to lawful authority. In our early 19th century single-sex prisons the only bond strong enough to withstand the inducements to inform on your fellows, and the punishments meted out to surly inmates, was romantic love. This is why prison officials went to such extreme lengths to separate same-sex convict couples by relocating them to prisons hundreds of kilometres apart. Their fears were real. Same-sex bonds were at the centre of prison rebellions like the flash mob at the Cascades Female Factory or the Ring on Norfolk Island. The notorious escape from Sarah Island by convict cannibal Alexander Pearce was actually instigated by Matthew Travers and Robert Greenhill, two men historians believe were in a relationship. When the food ran out and the convicts began to conspire against each other, Travers and Greenhill’s bond outlasted every other form of confederacy between the absconders. Same-sex relationships were also the biggest bugbear of Australian colonists who sought to forge a free, stable and respectable nation out of a prison camp. The chief rhetorical weapon used by the movement to end convict transportation was the fear that Australia would be forever stained by the sin of Sodom. Not only did homosexuality not have a place in the nation they were building, it was antithetical to it. As the late Robert Hughes noted in his book on convictism, The Fatal Shore: “There could have been no better breeding ground for the ferocious bigotry with which Australians of all classes, long after the abandonment of Norfolk Island and the System itself, perceived the homosexual. And this in turn seemed like an act of cleansing – for homosexuality was one of the mute, stark, subliminal elements in the ‘convict stain’ whose removal, from 1840 onwards, so preoccupied Australian nationalists.” The third challenge homosexuality posed in the colonial mind was to modernity itself. Colm Tóibín has observed that if the English became modern in factories, then the Irish became modern in church. To that we could add that Australians became modern in prison. It was in prison that we learned how to run our day according to the clock; how to scrub everything spotless clean; how not only to use machines but to be like them; how not only to surveil others and be surveilled in turn, but to surveil ourselves. In the view of colonial officials, sodomy was the epitome of the unruly and irregular passions and perversions of pre-industrial life. It is no coincidence that the Benthamite prisons built to tame these passions and make machines of men were filled with convicts sentenced for “unnatural vice”. The uniquely threatening challenge homosexuality was thought to pose to authority, respectability and modernity in colonial Australia helps me understand Australian homophobia today. It explains why the battle to decriminalise homosexuality was most bitterly fought in the two states – New South Wales and Tasmania – that have least in common apart from their convict past. It explains why the path to that reform was smoothest in the two states – South Australia and Victoria - that pride themselves on not starting life as prisons. It explains Australia’s uniquely torturous path to marriage equality, the particular anxieties no campaigners seek to tap, and the strange perception among many no advocates that they stand for the future, not the past. Most of all, it explains the deep threat homosexuality is thought to pose in some sections of Australian society and the apocalyptic language they use to express this sense of threat. The crusade against marriage equality reveals just how deep this sense of threat runs. It isn’t your typical, garden-variety campaign to defend “traditional moral values”. It is about much more than a single law reform or a simple moral conviction. For all their talk of “respecting gay people”, crusaders against marriage equality behave like they are battling an existential threat to family, faith, nation and civilisation. Their campaign feels like a howl from the depths of Australia’s collective cultural id. None of this should be taken to mean I am pessimistic about Australia’s potential to progress. A particularly nasty form of homophobia may reside deep in our national subconscious but in our heart lies a tolerance and an aspiration for fairness that can overcome it. I know because I’ve seen it before. In the 1990s, during a long and bitter debate about decriminalising homosexuality, Tasmania faced its colonial demons and defeated them, going on to adopt some of the most progressive LGBTI human rights laws in the world. It was very painful for LGBTI Tasmanians to have our worth diminished and our lives dissected for year after horrible year, but our grace and patience have been repaid manifold. I have no doubt the same will happen for the nation as a whole. As difficult as it is for many LGBTI people and our families to endure this unnecessary and cruel postal survey, my hope is that Australia will emerge from it having rejected the darker aspects of our history and aiming for a brighter future.

Osho – as I was to find out – wasn’t a new clothing label. He was a famous guru who had been rebranded, which is unsurprising because his previous brand had become toxic. Osho, formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, was the leader of a group known as the Orange People. He is also the subject of a fascinating new six-part Netflix documentary, Wild Wild Country. As a child growing up in the 1980s, the spectre of the Orange People loomed like a bogeyman although there were none that I knew of, hiding out in Warrnambool. Despite this, for a while our favourite playground taunt was “tough titties”: the catch cry of the Baghwan’s chief bag carrier, Ma Anand Sheela, who uttered the memorable phrase while being interviewed by Ian Leslie on 60 Minutes. (When told the Orange People weren’t welcome in Australia, she replied: “What can I say? Tough titties.”) Fast forward to 2016 and the week I was away at the camp with the guy in the Osho T-shirt was the most intense week of my life. The camp was not connected to Osho but his influence and some of his techniques were used. We gave up our phones and submitted to a mysterious schedule that started early and finished late. Many of the activities involved therapies of the sort I had never encountered: screaming, hitting things, swearing, jumping up and down on the spot for ages, dancing while blindfolded, making strange sounds. The noise and the emotional distress of the other participants freaked me out. I dislike yelling, and hearing people scream and cry was frightening. The big sounds and big emotions were frightening to me initially because so much of what I had around me in daily life – from smartphones, to television to alcohol – were effectively numbing agents. It would be a few days before I adjusted and could lose my inhibitions to also scream, and only on the last day did I cry. But after I loosened up, I found I could not stop screaming. I became a champion screamer and hitter of things. In sessions lasting for hours, others at the camp were lying on the ground, spent, and I was still at it – hitting and hitting and hitting stuff with a foam bat, drenched with sweat. Energy burst geyser-like from me from some secret source. There are psychological theories behind this process of letting go in a contained and safe space. In some ways it’s like a self-exorcism: you release your own demons and suppressed emotions and afterwards, feel lighter for it. It worked for me. This week watching Wild Wild Country, I was reminded of my week away at the camp. At one point in the series, a young Christopher Hitchens narrates a BBC documentary about Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. It was the screening of this BBC documentary which initially turned the small US farming community where the Orange People had settled against them. In the Hitchen’s doco were scenes of what looked like demonic possession: naked people screaming, crying, swearing, hitting each other and hugging each other, a more hardcore, violent version of what I had done at camp. But it was essentially for the same purpose – a form of purging. (Violence in the Rajneesh therapy groups ended in 1979. Violence “had fulfilled its function within the overall context of the ashram as an evolving spiritual commune”, said a press release at the time.) When I returned to Sydney from the camp, I felt a level of happiness and contentment that I had never before experienced. It was a feeling I think about now – wistfully – because it didn’t last long. The night I returned I went to dinner with some friends in Sydney, who quickly clocked my new blissful state. One of them was scathing: this was a cult, she said, I needed to be careful. I was in no danger of joining a cult (the retreat was not a cult anyway). I was reporting on the experience for a magazine and was hyperaware of what was going on – yet she still managed to bring me down. The great feelings would have faded eventually but they die quicker when people tell you that you only feel great because you’ve been “brainwashed”. Using news footage and interviews with people involved in the Orange People, and those in the town of Antelope where the group made its uneasy home, Wild Wild Country walks the middle line between showing the Orange People as progressive and enlightened and yet depicting how unsettling their presence was in rural Oregon. It also shows the moral panic of conservative, Christian America, and how a movement that gets branded a cult becomes demonised. Yet unlike many traditional cults, most of the former Orange People interviewed by the film-makers had the time of their lives. According to a review in Vulture: “The Rajneesh faithful who appear on camera all sound perfectly rational and look like the kind of graying, progressive adults you might accidentally bump your cart into at your local Trader Joe’s. They still talk in glowing, tearful terms about their time living on the ranch and the impact that the Bhagwan, later renamed Osho, had on their lives.” But there is no doubt that some lives were ruined by the experience. One Australian woman featured, Jane Stork, was in deep before souring on the whole enterprise after she was charged with attempted murder. She said in Wild Wild Country that she had been raised under the commandment ‘Thou shalt not kill’ and was deeply shocked that she had “crossed a line”. Much has been written about the dark (very dark) side of life for Rajneesh followers – including forced sterilisations and abortions. The documentary is compelling because it shows how what was intended as a peaceful community based on love and freedom devolved into a weaponised death cult charged with the largest bioterrorism plot in US history. After it all died down and the compound dispersed, a rebrand was necessary. The Bhagwan died in 1990, but he lives on today as “Osho”. Before Wild Wild Country was released last month, Osho was enjoying something of a resurgence among the younger generation. In many ways he is the perfect guru of the Silicon Valley age. Like Osho, tech entrepreneurs also believe that mindfulness and meditation can mix well with money, that you don’t need to be poor to be enlightened, that a fast track to really knowing yourself can be had by taking some A-grade ayahuasca at a clinic in Costa Rica. (Osho’s stance on drugs was that they should be good, legal and available and if you wanted to take LSD, you should just go to a special room in a hospital and take it.) In his book God Is Not Great, Hitchens talked with some disgust about Osho’s “sibilant voice usually deployed through low volume microphone at early morning darshan, (which) possessed a fairly hypnotic quality”. And that is true, he looked and sounded like a cult leader from the playbook. But Osho’s teaching on certain things, including sex, nature, sleep and work, are great. He was funny, modern and dirty – switching between eastern religions and Christianity with ease. He swore a lot and didn’t take anything too seriously. This is him on sex: All religions have destroyed the sacredness of love – they have destroyed it as a sin and the conditioning has gone so deep in the human mind that people are making love in such a hurry – as if they want to finish it as quickly as possible. Naturally if it is a sin, it is better finished soon. And friendship: Friendship is the purest love. It is the highest form of love where nothing is asked for, no condition, where one simply enjoys giving. Last year I dropped into an upmarket yoga studio in Manhattan, squeezed between Marc Jacobs stores and cupcake franchises and there were shelves of Osho books and Osho-branded clothing for sale. And in Pune, India, thousands of westerners still attend his ashram and Osho centre. He’s been dead since 1990 but his lectures are available for download online and are doing brisk numbers. Separated from his crazy context, Osho has a lot of interesting teachings that are applicable today. My book Wellmania ends with a chapter on my experiences at the camp but there is nothing really about the soft-softly-omm-good-vibes yoga retreat that fits it into my theme of the modern wellness industry. Instead of repressing your own violence, shadow side and pain, you bring it in from the cold. It’s strong medicine. I couldn’t do it again but am forever grateful for the experience. • Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/05/papua-new-guinea-earthquake-un-pulls-out-aid-workers-from-violence-hit-region","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Papua New Guinea earthquake: UN pulls out aid workers from violence-hit region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/papua-new-guinea-earthquake-un-pulls-out-aid-workers-from-violence-hit-region","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/05/papua-new-guinea-earthquake-un-pulls-out-aid-workers-from-violence-hit-region","fields":{"headline":"Papua New Guinea earthquake: UN pulls out aid workers from violence-hit region","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UN has suspended relief efforts in areas of Papua New Guinea worst hit by February’s earthquake after violence and instability made it unsafe for its workers. More than 150 people died when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the highlands region on 26 February, and 270,000 people are still in need of emergency aid – 125,000 of them children – according to the UN. There are unconfirmed reports other non-government organisations have joined the UN in pulling out of Tari, in Hela province, as threats against aid staff and daily fighting between residents have made it too dangerous to continue. Dr Luo Dapeng, speaking on behalf of the UN in Papua New Guinea, said: “The UN has temporarily relocated 12 UN non-essential relief workers from Tari to other locations due to the current security situation in the area, which is compromising our ability to implement relief activities. “We aim to resume relief work as soon as the security situation allows.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in New Zealand, which has so far committed NZ$3.5m ($2.5m) in aid funding as well as aircraft and personnel, said the outbreak of violence was adding extra pressure to relief efforts. “This is a challenging recovery effort for a number of factors, including the remoteness of affected areas, and the recent intensification of civil unrest that has hampered access for some frontline relief efforts for security reasons,” the spokesperson said. “A full picture of the damage caused is only beginning to emerge now. What is clear, though, is that the recovery will take some time.” Road access to the affected regions of Hela, the Southern and Western Highlands remain unreliable or impossible, with all relief supplies having to be flown in by air, and then walked or driven to villages. This week Orlena Scoville, head of Care Australia’s earthquake emergency team there, visited the villages of Huya, Walagau, Mougulu and Dodomona, and said aid delivery had “stagnated”. Villages whose usual population was 300 have swollen to 2,000; with many of the new residents having little shelter or means of support, placing increased pressure on land and basic infrastructure. According to the UN close to 20,000 are living in informal care centres, many of them no more than tarpaulin sheets pulled across wooden frames, while 143,127 have been deemed food insecure due to landslides wiping out their gardens and crops, especially the local staple of sago. Scoville said: “Food is definitely a major issue, there is not enough food, the villages I was in are mostly dependent on aid drop-offs. They have been saving food, because they don’t know where the next supply is coming from. It is definitely still an insecure situation.” “The coping mechanisms people are using is they are restricting their food intake. People have had one or no meals a day; they are rationing out food as slowly as they can and not touching the food stocks they have because they don’t know when the next food supply is coming in.” The remoteness of the region meant general health and well-being were further deteriorating due to a lack of medicines and supplies, and many people remaining in states of shock and grief, five weeks after the quake struck. The Australian government has committed A$5m ($3.8m) in aid funding to the PNG government, which includes nine doctors who have treated more than 600 people at Mendi hospital in the Southern Highlands. PNG’s prime minister, Peter O’Neill, said the long-term cost of the earthquake would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and short-term emergency relief efforts in Hela province alone were estimated at $60m. Scoville said: “The biggest need going forward will be relocating these families back to a permanent area where they can re-establish their homes and gardens. “Some people are looking at going back to their old areas, but a lot of people are going to have to resettle in new areas, so this is going to be a long process of recovery.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/05/steve-ciobo-says-australia-has-permanent-exemption-on-us-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T23:05:48Z","webTitle":"Steve Ciobo says Australia has permanent exemption on US tariffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/steve-ciobo-says-australia-has-permanent-exemption-on-us-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/steve-ciobo-says-australia-has-permanent-exemption-on-us-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"Steve Ciobo says Australia has permanent exemption on US tariffs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has claimed Australia has a permanent exemption from US steel tariffs because of its trade deficit. Ciobo has rejected claims that Australia’s exemption to the steel tariff is temporary, despite the fact that, in March, the White House said Australia was among a group of countries that would have an exemption until 1 May – after which the deal will be renegotiated or quotas will apply. The comments come as Australia braces for global shocks after China imposed tit-for-tat import taxes in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium. On Thursday Ciobo told Radio National that Malcolm Turnbull had “secured an agreement with the US president that Australia will be exempt and that continues to be the case”. He said the US had included Australia in the proclamation of a temporary exemption because it could not put in place separate instruments for every country. “The simple fact of the matter is – and you’ve heard the president himself and others make this remark repeatedly – they are after other countries having a more reciprocal and fair trade arrangement with the US. “In most cases the US runs a trade deficit, which is a key measure the US administration often refers to ... In Australia’s case, it’s the opposite. “We run a trade deficit with the US, they have a surplus with us ... we buy more off them than they buy off us.” Ciobo claimed the agreement was unconditional, adding it was “hard to imagine” a better deal that could be struck between the US and Australia. Despite repeated claims the deal is unconditional, nothing in the US paperwork guarantees Australia a permanent exemption. The trade minister brushed off the suggestion of quotas, claiming there was no possibility Australia could be used as a backdoor for other countries’ steel to enter the US because of strong anti-dumping rules. In what has been described as an escalating trade war, Donald Trump’s administration has put levies on more than 1,300 Chinese goods worth $50bn to the US. China has responded by imposing additional tariffs of 25% on 106 American products from 14 categories, matching tariffs on $50bn of US products, including beef, cars, planes, soybeans and whiskey. The developments have caused stock markets to plunge. Trump has claimed the US is not in a trade war with China in a tweet bemoaning its $500bn trade deficit with China and accusing it of $300bn of “intellectual property theft”. Ciobo said he would not describe the developments as a trade war but acknowledged there is “concern there possibly could be ... action and reaction which would cause significant economic impediments to global growth”. “Australia’s national interest is best served by opening up export markets,” he said, adding that tariffs “do nothing but impoverish” people. Asked about the impact on Australia, Ciobo said the bulk of what Australia exports to China is for internal domestic consumption and only one third goes for reprocessing to be onsold. “When China has ... faced a slowdown typically there is a stimulatory response from the Chinese government, which in fact could be a positive thing for Australian exports.” Ciobo said it was possible some industries such as Australian winemakers and beef exporters could benefit but it depended on assumptions such as whether two-way trade or the entire global effect is measured."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/04/manchester-city-team-bus-anfield-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T23:32:28Z","webTitle":"Manchester City players refuse to blame bus attack for Liverpool defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/manchester-city-team-bus-anfield-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/04/manchester-city-team-bus-anfield-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City players refuse to blame bus attack for Liverpool defeat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester City players denied an attack on their coach before the Champions League quarter-final first leg at Liverpool was a factor in a stunning 3-0 loss to Jürgen Klopp’s side.

Home fans had hurled missiles at the bus on its way to ground – for which Liverpool apologised – causing the driver’s door to be smashed and the vehicle put out of commission but City refused to point to this. “The bus incident had no effect on us,” Vincent Kompany said. “Not really. We have experienced that before.” Kevin De Bruyne agreed with his captain. “It was OK,” he said. “I don’t mind supporters doing that – I’ve had it a couple of times for my team and it’s a nice feeling. Breaking windows is probably not done but who am I to say something? I am fine with it as long as no one gets hurt. It doesn’t change anything [for the players]. As long as you keep the violence down, there’s nothing wrong with it.” Pep Guardiola expressed surprise at the attack. Merseyside police, which said two of its officers had been injured, announced beforehand a change of route which meant Liverpool fans were alerted to where the coach would pass. “Yesterday [it was] explained that it is going to happen,” Guardiola said. “Normally when the police know it is going to happen, they tried to avoid it from happening. So I did not expect that from the Liverpool side, their people. The bus is destroyed but I did not expect a prestigious club like Liverpool doing this kind of thing. It is not Liverpool, it is the people, but hopefully it does not happen again.” Mohamed Salah opened the scoring on 12 minutes before goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sadio Mané on 20 and 31 minutes respectively. City lost 4-3 here in January’s Premier League fixture so Guardiola’s side have now allowed seven goals in the past two matches. Yet the manager denied City have problems defending against Liverpool. “No I don’t think it is a problem,” he said. “The first time we played here we gave them the goals. Today the first one was a corner from Leroy [Sané] and they counterattacked. In that level the players are so good [and] it is not just about the defenders.” Jordan Henderson’s booking means the Liverpool captain misses the second leg and Klopp has an injury concern regarding Salah after the Egyptian was forced off on 52 minutes. “He said to me immediately after the game: ‘All fine, all good’ but I hope that’s the case,” Klopp said. “We have to wait for that.” As Liverpool did not allow an away goal, one goal for them at the Etihad would have City needing to score five. Yet Klopp said: “I didn’t think about that. We have conceded five there once already [in September’s league defeat]. I don’t think it makes it more likely we are through. I don’t feel it. “We have to work. You have to celebrate the party when the party starts, not four weeks before and I cannot ignore that we have to play in between another game. The only place where the people are more happy about the result than here is Goodison [before Saturday’s Merseyside derby at Everton]. It is better than 3-1, better than 1-0. No one in the dressing room was dancing around.” Guardiola insists City can knock Liverpool out. “Nobody believes we will go through,” he said. “We will convince ourselves tomorrow.” Guardiola’s selection of Ilkay Gündoğan instead of Raheem Sterling was a surprise, given the former has never played on the right for City. Sterling replaced Gündoğan early in the second half. Asked if he thought the move had worked, Guardiola said: “We lost 3-0.” Regarding the bus attack, Liverpool’s statement said: “We apologise unreservedly to Pep Guardiola, his players, staff and officials caught up in the incident. The behaviour of a number of individuals was completely unacceptable and the club will cooperate fully with the authorities to identify those responsible. The priority now is to establish the facts and offer Manchester City whatever support is necessary.” On Thursday, Manchester City coach Manel Estiarte posted footage from inside the team bus to highlight the “unacceptable” behaviour by Liverpool fans ahead of the game:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/04/tiger-mania-leaves-masters-field-with-intimidation-factor-woods","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T19:18:46Z","webTitle":"Tiger-mania leaves Masters field with ‘intimidation factor’ | Ewan Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/04/tiger-mania-leaves-masters-field-with-intimidation-factor-woods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/04/tiger-mania-leaves-masters-field-with-intimidation-factor-woods","fields":{"headline":"Tiger-mania leaves Masters field with ‘intimidation factor’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In respect of the fervour attached to the 82nd Masters even before Austin Cook has cracked the first competitive drive, it is hilarious to recall the Tiger-proofing of Augusta National. This weekend, those presiding over a major championship that has triggered such excitement owing to the very same individual may wish they could prevent the other 86 members of the field from holing putts via remote control. Tiger-proofing? Now is the time of Tiger-mania. This is not Tiger Woods’s greatest test but the donning of a Green Jacket for the fifth time would without question register as his greatest victory. We have, of course, only Woods’s own stark depictions as evidence but progression from the point where sitting down at dinner triggered agony and retirement was a live option to securing a 15th major title – and all in a matter of months – would rank among sport’s greatest renaissances. Woods’s lowest ebb, after an arrest last May for driving under the influence, has kickstarted his life and turned public sentiment back in his favour. In a non‑tribal sport, the public clearly wants the 42-year-old to prevail here. So, too, and privately will Masters officials. It is that, the “can he do it?” narrative, which has afforded the Masters an eagerness level not seen since Woods was in his dominating pomp. The early part of tournament week has witnessed some staggering scenes, all only possible via word of mouth; mobile phones are prohibited on the premises. Galleries have deepened with every buildup move, with Woods cheered on like a returning hero. Yet, never mind the fact Woods has not won here since 2005 – eight years have passed since he recorded a Masters round better than 68. The irony is, a venue that micromanages to the point where absolutely nothing is left to chance did not have any input on this storyline at all. Woods’s return to the fold, one which has already shown he can compete with the best in his sport, has merely coincided with the first major of 2018. There are contrasting theories at play. It is without question that onlookers, especially those of sceptical disposition, have forgotten or chosen to ignore just how good a fully functioning Woods was. He is not a normal player, he cannot be judged via ordinary criteria. Woods made a career out of making the impossible seem perfectly natural. The second strand is the overlooking of so many of the world’s current best players as the spotlight is fixed on one man. It may appear callous but it is also logical – backing the field against Woods has merit. Justin Thomas, the player of the year thus far, was only part of early week chatter because he played a practice round in the company of the man he once idolised. Dustin Johnson, the world No 1, has barely been afforded a mention in this Masters build-up. Johnson was fourth and sixth in his past two Augusta outings, and the finest golfer in the world a year ago only to be undermined by a topple down a flight of stairs. Johnson has the power to batter parts of Augusta National into pitiful submission. He is, though, respectful of the Woods pull. “He has still got an intimidation factor,” Johnson said. “It is Tiger Woods. He is probably one of the best to ever play the game. So you would have to think he is going to figure out a way to get it [his game] back. He has.” That Justin Rose is as motivated as never before is patently obvious after his play-off defeat by Sergio García here, 12 months ago. The Englishman’s Masters statistics are more striking than most. He has finished outside of the top 20 only once since 2008. Rose has returned two second-place finishes in three years. A successful García defence cannot be ruled out. Jordan Spieth’s Augusta specialism barely requires repetition. The same applies to Bubba Watson, who produced a comfortable victory at the WGC Match Play in Austin last month. Phil Mickelson must have a live chance of becoming the oldest winner in Masters history. Spieth has been candid enough to admit he probably did not appreciate the scale of the Masters when first featuring in Georgia. “As an individual, I think I was a little naive to it,” Spieth said. “After 2014, I realised what it actually meant. An American winning the Masters is a really special thing. This is essentially our Super Bowl.” Rory McIlroy’s Masters destiny seems intrinsically linked to attitude. He freely admits there have been past occasions where the scale of a Masters triumph and all that comes with it has permitted the game’s most natural artist from reaching his holy grail. This week, McIlroy has exuded a relaxed, quiet confidence that renders him worthy of attention. The McIlroy completion of a clean sweep of majors, becoming only the sixth man in history to reach that peak, would not be such an awful alternative to Woods blasting back from the brink. To the masses, however, there may be just a single show in town. “This is my 42nd Masters,” the new Masters chairman, Fred Ridley, said. “I have never been a part of this week where there’s been any more excitement.” He was not exaggerating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/04/russia-looks-to-discredit-uk-with-special-meeting-of-un-security-council","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T06:35:30Z","webTitle":"Russia seeks to discredit UK with special meeting of UN security council","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/russia-looks-to-discredit-uk-with-special-meeting-of-un-security-council","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/russia-looks-to-discredit-uk-with-special-meeting-of-un-security-council","fields":{"headline":"Russia seeks to discredit UK with special meeting of UN security council","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An emboldened Russia will on Thursday attempt to discredit Britain’s international reputation at the UN after a series of blunders by Boris Johnson and the Foreign Office led to accusations that the UK had overstated its case that Russia was responsible for the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal. Although the carefully crafted international alliance in support of the UK has held together despite Russian pressure, ministers were forced to backtrack from a claim by the foreign secretary that the UK’s chemical weapons watchdog had told him Russia was definitely responsible for the attack. In a statement on Tuesday the chief executive of the government chemical weapons experts at Porton Down said its tests had shown the sample was of a military-grade nerve agent from the novichok family, but it was not possible to say whether it was of Russian origin. The Foreign Office, under pressure from the Russian embassy in London, also admitted it had earlier deleted a tweet making a similar inaccurate claim to Johnson. In an effort to press home its diplomatic advantage, and prevent Vladimir Putin acquiring a near pariah status, Russia announced it had convened a special meeting of the UN security council on Thursday at which it would challenge a letter previously sent to the UN by Theresa May that asserted that Russia was likely to have been responsible for the attack. During a visit to Turkey, Putin called for a thorough investigation into the poisoning, saying “the speed at which the anti-Russian campaign has been launched causes bewilderment”. Britain’s embarrassment has largely been caused by Johnson during an interview with the broadcaster Deutsche Welle on 20 March during which he said he had been told by Porton Down that they were categorical that Russia was responsible for the attack. The inaccuracy, branded a lie by Johnson’s critics, led the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to claim the foreign secretary had egg on his face and serious questions to answer. He added: “Either the foreign secretary has information that he’s not sharing with Porton Down or it was a bit of exaggeration. I don’t know which it is, but I think we need a responsible, cool approach to this. We need to get to the source of this to prevent it ever happening again.” In a tweet Johnson hit back saying it was lamentable that Corbyn was now playing Moscow’s game and had “chosen to side with Russia’s spin machine”. He added: “Porton Down identified nerve agent as military-grade novichok. 2) Russia has investigated delivering nerve agents, likely for assassination, and as part of this programme has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichok. 3) Russia has motive for targeting Sergei Skripal.” He pointed out that 28 countries had been so convinced by the case they expelled Russian diplomats from their countries. The setbacks overshadowed the extent to which the UK had fended off a Russian attempt at the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons to hijack the investigation into the samples of nerve agent found on the body of Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. At an emergency executive meeting of the OPCW that it had convened, Russia’s statement calling for a joint British and Russian investigation of the samples was only supported by six states on the 41-strong executive, with 17 abstentions. Nevertheless Russia later claimed it also had the support of China and accused the UK of procedural tricks, outright lies, Russia-phobia and deploying the language of ultimatums. But the OPCW chief executive, Ahmet Üzümcü, said Britain was following normal procedures, adding that the OPCW report into the nature of the samples was likely to be completed next week. He added: “The collection, splitting, and transportation of the samples were carried out in line with the relevant procedures of the secretariat. The chain-of-custody was fully maintained.” He said state parties were not informed of the designated laboratories selected by the secretariat to perform the technical analysis. Although it was for the UK to decide whether to share the report, Üzümcü said, Britain had expressed its wish to be as transparent as possible and had already indicated its preference for disclosure of the report to other states parties. John Foggo, the UK’s acting representative to the OPCW, defended Britain’s refusal to allow Russia be involved in the investigation, saying: “We will not agree to Russia’s demand to conduct a joint investigation into the attack in Salisbury because the UK – supported by many other countries – has assessed that it is highly likely that the Russian state is responsible for this attack, and that there is no plausible alternative explanation. “There is no requirement in the chemical weapons convention, for a victim to engage the likely perpetrator in a joint investigation. To do so would be perverse.” He continued: “Analysis of samples is being carried out by independent, impartial experts, through the designated laboratory system, which all state parties support, in accordance with the convention. The work of the technical secretariat must remain impartial. Russia’s refusal to accept the results of the OPCW’s investigation unless Russian experts participate in it suggests that Russia is opposed to the independence and impartiality of the technical secretariat and is nervous about what the results will show.” Significantly, the EU fully backed the UK, saying it had the full confidence in the British investigation and lauded its collaboration with the OPCW. Accusing Russia of a flood of insinuations against Europe, the EU added it was imperative that Moscow started to cooperate with the OPCW."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/07/robin-campillo-120-beats-per-minute-director-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T11:59:00Z","webTitle":"Robin Campillo: ‘I spent the 80s thinking I was going to die.

Being a director seemed pointless’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Last Christmas Eve, just before midnight, Barry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning director of Moonlight, settled down in a hotel room to watch the new French film 120 Beats Per Minute. After an hour, he stopped the action and fired off a tweet: “Fuuuuuuuuuuug I just had to pause BPM because this scene just destroyed me. DE.....STROYED. I shouldn’t drink because it’s late but I need to room service a glass of something before I head back in. Damn.” Written and directed by Robin Campillo, 120 Beats Per Minute is a dramatisation of the early years of the militant Aids activist group Act Up-Paris. (The title is a nod to house music, which for many was the soundtrack to this period.) Specifically, the film focuses on the relationship between Nathan (Arnaud Valois), a newcomer to the group, and Sean (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart), a charismatic campaigner behind some of Act Up’s most outrageous publicity stunts. It was a scene in which they discuss moving in together that particularly blew Jenkins away. He went on: “The patience and sensitivity of the dialogue, so many layers in what’s said, such care.” An hour later, Jenkins delivered his considered verdict. “Obviously I loved it,” he wrote. “I can only thank Robin Campillo and everyone for making this wonderful film. As someone whose mother was diagnosed HIV+ in the early 90s and IS STILL WITH US, I’m biased and thankful for Act Up and this moving testament to them.” 120 Beats Per Minute has not been short of love since it premiered at the Cannes film festival last year; it won the jury’s grand prize (essentially runner-up to the Palme d’Or), while jury president, Pedro Almodóvar, broke ranks and said it was his personal favourite for the main prize, the Palme d’Or, but the majority went with The Square. It was also awarded six Césars, including best film, at the “French Oscars” and was nominated as France’s entry for the actual Oscars, though surprisingly didn’t make the shortlist. The film was a massive hit at the French box office, selling 800,000 tickets, but Campillo insists that the greatest satisfaction of making 120 Beats Per Minute is that people are talking about Act Up again. “I hoped the visibility that the group wanted 25 years ago would be achieved today,” he says. Act Up was founded in New York in 1987 and launched in France two years later. For its first “action”, Act Up-Paris had about 15 activists stage a “die-in”: lying totally silent on the street at the Gay Pride parade. Each wore a T-shirt with a large pink triangle on the front – upending and repurposing the badge forced on homosexual men by the Nazis in the second world war – and on them was the slogan “Silence = Death”. And the protests became more and more eye-catching. Fake blood was thrown at politicians, the ashes of dead members were scattered at fancy receptions for pharmaceutical companies – anything to draw mainstream attention to the masses who were losing their lives to the so-called “gay plague”. Probably Act Up’s greatest coup was when they – with the help of Benetton – covered the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde in Paris with a giant pink condom on 1 December 1993, World Aids Day. “Yeah, I was there, that was so funny,” says Campillo, who has tightly cropped silver hair, an aquiline nose and a small, wry smile. “For many, many years, there were two things we wanted to do. We wanted to put a pink condom on the obelisk. The other thing was the red river” – turning the Seine the colour of blood – “which is practically impossible. So we did that with technicians from Benetton and we just got out of the métro to make a demonstration and then we were arrested for many hours.” The 55-year-old Campillo joined Act Up-Paris in 1992, when he was just about to turn 30. He was working as an editor in television news for the state-run France 3 channel, and knew the group well from having to cut together stories for the nightly bulletin. After he started attending meetings, he began to live a strange double life. “Sometimes I would be doing an action in the morning and I was editing it in the afternoon,” he laughs. “And one day, which is barely legal, I went back to my job with the journalist in his car.” Despite being openly gay for a decade, before Act Up Campillo had few gay friends. Now he started spending every spare minute with the group. “I don’t have words to say how much it changed my life,” he says. “It’s like I was breathing again and a lot of people were breathing again. The way you can imagine power described by Michel Foucault: an electricity that goes from people to people. And when I did this film, I found this energy again.” Born in Morocco in 1962 to French parents, Marcel and Simone, the young Campillo had a peripatetic existence. His father was in the military and the family moved around grand residences in the former French colonies. When he was about 10, in Madagascar, he saw Jean-Luc Godard’s dystopian sci-fi Alphaville; the film was roundly booed by the soldiers, but for Campillo it was the early stages of a lifelong obsession with the New Wave, especially Godard and Éric Rohmer. “I wanted to be a film-maker from the age of six,” says Campillo on the afternoon we meet, in the “living room” of a plush London hotel. He apologises for being hungover – he was out the previous night in Soho with an actor friend – but in reality he is bright eyed and an effusive talker. He goes on: “I was obsessed and I really thought it would be easy for me, such a logical thing that of course people will give me a lot of money and all the stars will want to act in my films. So I was very naive and pretentious.” After school, Campillo won a place at the prestigious film academy IDHEC, the Institute for Advanced Cinematographic Studies, whose alumni include Louis Malle. One of his contemporaries was the French director Laurent Cantet. Campillo would later be co-writer and editor of Cantet’s 2001 drama Time Out, which was placed ninth on the Guardian’s list of the best films of the 00s. Another collaboration, The Class, about a teacher struggling to keep order in a school in Paris, won the Palme d’Or in 2008, the first French film to do so for more than 20 years. Their latest project, The Workshop, about a group of teenagers at a creative writing retreat, is released in the UK this summer. “I have been very lucky,” says Campillo, smiling. “I never search for work because I am so lazy.” This makes Campillo’s path sound straightforward, yet it has been anything but. After graduating from IDHEC in the mid-1980s, he didn’t really work for many years, mainly because he convinced himself he was HIV-positive. Here, art and life start to blur. In 120 Beats Per Minute, Sean and Nathan tell each other about their sexual history. Nathan’s version, Campillo admits, is basically his own experience. He started having gay relationships in his late teens and he was especially taken with one guy (in the movie, he’s called Arnaud) who used to pick him up in Aix-en-Provence, where Campillo lived, and they’d drive back 25 miles to his apartment in Marseille. His parents had no idea. Campillo was besotted, but one day he read about Aids in a magazine. The pictures showed an American couple: in the first, they were fit and vigorous, lying on a boat; in the second, one of them was weak and puffy faced, ravaged by the disease. His name was Ken Ramsauer and he died shortly afterwards. “I’d never seen a gay couple in a magazine before,” says Nathan in 120 Beats Per Minute. “Except it was to say that homosexuals were going to die. That we were all going to die.” For around five years in his 20s, Campillo stopped having sex: not because he feared contracting Aids, but because he was certain that he was already a carrier and didn’t want to infect anyone. “Two or three years before I joined Act Up, I did my first test and [then] I knew I was negative,” he says. “That was something of a relief, of course, because I lived the 1980s thinking that I was going to die, because I was so stupid. I was in a kind of denial.” Eventually, Campillo did reconnect with “Arnaud”. They spent a day together, but Campillo could see he had lost weight, that he struggled for breath when they walked. “He was a very sexual guy who had lots of lovers and was not faithful at all,” he recalls. “I loved him so much and the last time I saw him I realised he was HIV-positive, but we didn’t say anything about that, because I wouldn’t ask him and he wouldn’t tell me. “In Act Up, we used to say our address books were cemeteries – that was a joke but it was also true. We were in a zone where people were not dead or alive; when I looked at my friends, I was thinking they were already a little bit dead. We were in a very weird place.” In this state of mind, it didn’t feel appropriate for Campillo to think about making films. “Because of the epidemic, I shrank,” says Campillo. “Being a director seemed pointless to me. The French New Wave is cinema for healthy people. You don’t have people with disease in a film by Godard, not at all I think. People die but only because they have an accident: a hard, quick death, not because they have a disease. “There’s only one film of the New Wave, Cléo From 5 to 7, by Agnès Varda, where a woman is waiting for her result for cancer,” he continues. “And that’s exactly what I was living in the 1980s.” Campillo remained involved in Act Up-Paris until around 2000. By this point, the treatment of Aids had advanced significantly and the organisation could point to numerous small victories in France: everything from condoms becoming available in schools to free medicine for HIV patients and needle exchanges for drug users. But for Campillo the biggest impact of Act Up was in changing the perception of Aids in the country. “We say to the people and to the government that an epidemic is not only a social issue, it’s a political issue.” By this point, too, his career was starting to take off. He directed his first film in 2004, They Came Back, about thousands of undead who return to a small French town where they used to live. The film was a smart twist on the zombie flick – Campillo notes that the central idea of living in a “no-man’s-land” partly came from his personal discombobulation during the Aids epidemic – but it didn’t make a huge impact outside France, at least until it was remade as the stylish TV thriller Les Revenants, and then remade again for America as The Returned. Campillo was not involved in either of those projects. “No, no, no,” he says. “I just receive money, which is great!” To be fair, Campillo does not make great claims for They Came Back. He describes it as “conservative” and says that he was guilty of being too rigid over how shots were framed and lit. He shakes his head. “It’s like a control thing and when you do the first take everyone stops breathing: ‘We are doing cinema!’ I hate that so much.” After They Came Back, he made his first attempt at writing a script about the Aids epidemic. It was called Drug Holidays: a reference to the treatment breaks that were sometimes recommended for HIV-positive patients. Only when he finished the draft did he realise that it lacked any narrative tension. “So I lost one and a half years of my life,” he says, giving that most French of gestures, the shrug. “Not very clever.” For Campillo, the reason why 120 Beats Per Minute has been successful, while Drug Holidays wasn’t, is that he and co-writer Philippe Mangeot finally captured the gallows humour of Act Up-Paris. The story he chooses to illustrate this point is especially close to the knuckle. On Campillo’s second film, 2013’s Eastern Boys, he was having an argument with one of his producers, Hugues Charbonneau, who is an old friend from the group. Campillo wanted more time and money to shoot extra scenes and Charbonneau was telling him he couldn’t have it. Eventually, Campillo lost his temper and, in front of cast and crew, he blurted: “You owe me because I dressed up your boyfriend when he died.” “It’s like a running gag between us that is not funny for the others,” explains Campillo. “They were paralysed, but at the same time I realised that this specific way of talking, this specific behaviour in front of death, was connected really to the spirit of Act Up-Paris. At this point my other producer, Marie-Ange Luciani, said, ‘You shouldn’t do anything else. You have to do this film.’ And I think she was right – enough time had passed for me to do it.” Again, life and art become hard to separate: in 120 Beats Per Minute, one member of Act Up dresses the corpse of another’s boyfriend. As this scene shows, the film probably shouldn’t have worked. The raw material is too bleak. It absolutely shouldn’t have been watched by almost a million people in France and won countless awards. Campillo cheerfully admits that it is too long (two hours, 23 minutes), has too much dialogue and makes no attempt to censor its sex scenes. For Barry Jenkins, this last detail was the only explanation he could find for why the film didn’t feature at the Golden Globes or the Academy Awards. Meeting Campillo, you have the sense that the attention 120 Beats Per Minute has received has caught him a little on the hop. As explicit as he has been about his experiences in the film, he prefers not to talk about his private life. “I do everything I’m asked, I’m a good soldier, but it’s a little bit hard,” he says, of the publicity wagon. “It’s not that I’m shy, I just don’t like to be too exposed.” Certainly LGBT films are attracting more mainstream interest than ever before: recent critical hits include not only 120 Beats Per Minute and Moonlight, but also Call Me By Your Name and A Fantastic Woman. For Campillo, though, he simply made the film he wanted to make with no compromises. “When I did this film, I didn’t try to make a universal film,” he says. “It’s a very gay film with a political topic and a long sex scene between guys. And the film has been a success.” France does not appear to be having the same degree of soul-searching that Hollywood is currently going through. This is in part because the statistics, while far from healthy, are less damning: around one in five directors in France is female, roughly double that of American studio features. But there is increasing discussion of diversity and equality. Before the recent César awards, there was the launch of 5050 Pour 2020, which promotes gender balance in the film business, and also #NowWeAct (Maintenant On Agit), the French equivalent to Time’s Up.

Amaan Shakoor, 16, was shot on Monday evening in Walthamstow about 30 minutes after Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, 17, was killed in a drive-by shooting nearby in Tottenham. It leaves open the prospect that Tanesha was not the intended target. Tensions continued to run high on Wednesday in Tottenham, where police enforced a section 60 order from 3pm authorising officers to conduct stop and searches without suspicion amid fears that Tanesha’s killing could lead to more violence. The Met said it had put 102 orders in place across London. The use of section 60 powers is highly controversial and in recent years their use – which previously led to African-Caribbean people being up to 27 times more likely to be stopped than white people – has been scaled back. Police say they use the power where they have intelligence that violence is planned. Tanesha’s death is understood to be linked to a gang feud and is also thought to have followed an escalation of violence driven on social media, with a video circulating locally of a clash in a milkshake bar that was said to be the catalyst for the attack. The shooting of Amaan was different, detectives believe, with the boy being subjected to a deliberate attack by at least one gunman. One local said Amaan had been in the “wrong place at the wrong time” and police were hunting for reasons why the teenager was picked out, which may include the killing being based on a mistaken identity. Amid mounting concerns about London’s worsening violent crime rate, one of the capital’s four trauma units reported troubling figures. The Royal London hospital said it had treated a third more young victims of knife crime and three times more young adults with gunshot wounds in the first quarter of this year than it did during same period last year. The hospital in east London dealt with 42 people under 18 who had been stabbedin the first three months of 2018.In the same period it treated 15 young adults – 18 to 25 – with bullet wounds. The hospital has treated 23 people in total gunshot wounds this year, compared with 10 in the same period in 2017. On Wednesday, police in south-west London charged a man with the murder of Devoy Burton-Stapleton, who was stabbed after leaving a bar in Wandsworth on Sunday morning. Billy Botton, 24, who lives locally, was in custody before a hearing at Wimbledon magistrates court. In Lewisham, south-east London, a 78-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a suspected burglar was fatally stabbed. It is the capital’s 49th investigation into a killing this year. In a separate murder investigation, a reward of £20,000 has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the killer or killers of Abraham Badru, 26, who was shot in Hackney, east London, on 25 March. Detectives are investigating whether Badru was killed for his role in bringing rapists to justice a decade ago. According to local sources, the video linked to the Tanesha Melbourne-Blake case – seen by the Guardian – shows young people from the Northumberland Park area beating an older man from the Wood Green area, continuing their attack even as his girlfriend tried to shield him with her body. The video was said to have been recorded on Saturday at the Tinseltown diner in Farringdon. A Met spokeswoman would not confirm reports that officers had seized CCTV from the restaurant, but added: “They are keeping an open mind and they are not confirming whether this is linked to any incident.” A worker at the restaurant declined to comment. A second social media video seen by the Guardian shows young people bragging about the incident. In the video they brandish the victim’s phone, and other posts claim he was targeted because he had mocked the victim of an earlier shooting in Tottenham. On Tuesday night community activists led a peace march from Seven Sisters underground station past a supermarket where Tanesha was seen on CCTV walking with friends, then north to the spot where she was fatally shot minutes later. Talking into a megaphone in front of a crowd of young men, some of whom had covered their face, one speaker said: “We’ve got aunties out here who care about you lot. I care about you lot. If no one ever tells young men that they love you … I fucking love you. I fucking love you. You understand me? Nobody’s going to beat this love.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/08/robots-mimic-animals-marsbees-spotmini-mantadroid","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Bio bots: robots that mimic animal physiology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/08/robots-mimic-animals-marsbees-spotmini-mantadroid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/08/robots-mimic-animals-marsbees-spotmini-mantadroid","fields":{"headline":"Bio bots: robots that mimic animal physiology","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Marsbees Last week, Nasa announced that it is developing robotic bees to gather information about areas of Mars that wouldn’t be accessible to a Mars rover.

Springing out of his attempts to steward five acres of sodden fenland in the floodplain of the river Yare in Norfolk, he says he wants to compose a work that interweaves “an autobiographical narrative of place and a historical exploration of how and why the British countryside has come to look as it does”. Like any great book – and this is a seriously great book, important and urgent – Our Place does so much more than merely fulfil its author’s admittedly wide-ranging aims. It is an elegy for a beloved landscape, an anguished lament, a manifesto, a call to arms. Cocker steps rather carefully around the subject of Brexit and his rallying cries are directed more to the people of Britain than to its politicians, but that shouldn’t mask the fact that this is a radical and polemical work in the tradition of those figures from the past and present that Cocker calls on throughout the book: Cobbett, Hazlitt, Wendell Berry, Marion Shoard. The book is full of examples of the sops and pablums by which we fool ourselves that we’re making a difference to the environmental catastrophe currently taking place in Britain (not least among them the membership fees we pay to our charitable organisations). As soon as I finished Our Place, I packaged up my copy and sent it off to Michael Gove – certainly another meaningless gesture, but this is the kind of book that demands action, which requires a response to the questions Cocker asks in an early chapter: “The British love wildlife, and they appear to love it more than others. Yet in the last half-century we have failed it and we are still losing it day after day. How can this have happened? And why?” In 2013, 25 British environmental organisations put aside their infighting and mutual suspicion for a brief moment to publish a report called State of Nature. It told a dispiriting story about the condition of what Cocker calls “the more-than-human parts of life” in Britain. Of the 3,148 species studied in the report, 60% had declined in the past 50 years, 31% had declined badly and 600 were threatened with extinction. Britain sits in last place on the European farmland bird index. We lost 44m birds from our avifauna between 1966 and 2008. We have lost 99% of our wildflower meadows, half our ancient woodland, three-quarters of our heathland, three-quarters of our ponds. These figures “don’t indicate the bottom of a curve, they chart the direction of an arrow”. We must all recognise that we have been engaged in a monumental, communal act of cognitive dissonance. The great paradox that lies at the centre of Our Place is that the British purport to care so much for wildlife, that our landscape is such a fundamental element of our national identity, that we belong to associations and organisations that claim to defend nature and the countryside in a way that is globally unique: 5m of us in the National Trust, 1.2m in the RSPB, 800,000 in the various wildlife trusts and yet we are worse at looking after our countryside than almost any other nation on Earth. Cocker recognises some of the successes of our organisations – Enterprise Neptune, in which the National Trust bought up hundreds of miles of coastline, is singled out for particular praise – and acknowledges that these successes are often achieved in the face of significant political opposition. The overall impression, though, is that our environmental institutions are poorly run, narrow-minded and, as Cocker says, “becalmed by anxiety over upsetting their members”. Our Place uses a series of evocative landscapes to tell the story of the growth of the environmental movement in Britain, serving to remind the bloated and corporate environmental bodies – the National Trust, the RSPB, the wildlife trusts – of the radical campaigning fire that initially forged them. Cocker is particularly good on the diminution of the National Trust from the visionary organisation founded in the last years of the 19th century to a stuffy pillar of the heritage industry that continues to place “architecture, Chippendale chairs and the grand prospect of the stately home before biodiversity”, and is more interested in helping the landed gentry avoid death duties than in doing what it was established to do: preserving the British landscape. Towards the end of the book, Cocker quotes Wendell Berry, who noted that any meeting on the subject of the environment was “a convocation of the guilty”. We are all complicit in the destruction of Britain’s rich natural heritage – “at every turn in the road,” Cocker says, “we chose ourselves”. But this means that we must all also play a part in providing solutions to the environmental catastrophe. What is required is coordinated, eloquent, political action. For too long, we have allowed the mindless pursuit of economic growth (literally) to bulldoze our priceless natural assets. Environmental organisations have been sucked into the relentless logic of the capitalist machine, so that they are too busy grubbing after membership fees and building gift shops to intervene in the great battle to defend our countryside. As Cocker puts it: “By adopting the language and attitudes of capitalism, environmentalists are defeated at source.” The villains of Our Story are the industrial agri-businesses, the moneyed landowners and the (usually, although by no means always, Conservative) politicians who speak for them. Cocker presents the history of the British landscape as one of beautiful places – Cley marshes in Norfolk; Kinder Scout in the Peak District; the Flow Country of Scotland; Cow Green near Sunderland – and the baleful capitalist and aristocratic forces that have threatened them. The current depredation of the British countryside by heavily subsidised industrial farming is configured as of a part with the 18th-century acts of enclosure, the corn laws, the monocultural toffs’ playgrounds of grouse moors and farmed pheasant shoots. There’s a brilliant passage towards the end of the book in which Cocker writes of the flourishing of contemporary nature writing, the way it risks becoming “a compensatory, nostalgic and internalised recreation of what was once a birthright and is no more”. He worries that even the great works of natural history will become like “the light from a dead star: they will persist for a while, maybe even decades, but they will travel onwards into the darkness that will eventually consume them”. Our Place is the opposite of that kind of writing. It is often very beautiful – the Heaney-inflected passages praising peat bogs are particularly luminous – but it is all the time grounded in the powerful insistency of its cause. If anything good is to come out of the mess that is Brexit, we must start by recognising that we are on the cusp of losing one of the things that makes Britain unique. Cocker ends his book with 10 “truths” about the situation of nature in Britain right now, none of them easy reading, and with a pointed question: “If we cannot sustain a country equal to the love we bear it, then who on Earth can?” As a nation, we need to act urgently to answer this question and we could start by asking those organisations whose membership fees we pay exactly how they intend to reverse the near-terminal destruction of Britain’s beautiful, vulnerable natural world. • Our Place: Can We Save Britain’s Wildlife Before It Is Too Late? by Mark Cocker is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99).

Griffin, 28, has been without a team since he was cut by the Cleveland Browns in March, sitting out the entire 2017 campaign. The Ravens expressed interest in adding him last summer but ultimately passed. “Obviously, his personality, he’s a confident guy. He’s a very talented quarterback,” Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said of Griffin on Wednesday. “He’s had a lot of success in this league early on. We’re excited about it. We felt like we needed a No2 quarterback.” Griffin’s last previous stop in an injury-riddled career came in 2016 with the Cleveland Browns. He started five games, winning only one of them. General manager Ozzie Newsome said Griffin didn’t have far to travel before showing the Ravens he can still fling the ball. “He still lives in the DC/Virginia area,” Newsome said. “We were bringing in some receivers and we asked him if he would come in and throw and go through a full workout for us. He took a physical. He did all of that. After that, he went to visit another team. We just were able to come to an agreement.” The terms were finalized late Tuesday night, and Newsome expects RG3 to sign the contract next week. “I feel like we got a steal,” Harbaugh said. “I felt like (Griffin) really wanted to be here. He really wanted to be a Raven.” The former Heisman Trophy winner was regarded as one of the league’s most electrifying prospects when Washington selected him with the second overall pick of the 2012 draft. He initially lived up to advance billing, throwing for 3,200 yards, 20 touchdowns, five interceptions while adding 120 rushing attempts, 815 yards and seven running scores, enough to garner Offensive Rookie of the Year over Andrew Luck. But Griffin was beset by a litany of injuries that included tears to his ACL, LCL and meniscus, an LCL sprain, a dislocated ankle, a concussion and a shoulder fracture. He was benched for the entirety of 2015 in favor of Kirk Cousins and released by Washington in 2016. Now on a third team in four years, the 28-year-old will attempt to resuscitate his career playing behind Flacco, who is entering his 11th season as Baltimore’s starting signal-caller. Even if not called upon to play, Griffin can be a valuable practice asset for when the Baltimore defense is preparing for mobile quarterbacks like Tyrod Taylor, Marcus Mariota and Cam Newton, all of whom they’re scheduled to face during the 2018 season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/04/sin-tax-sugar-alcohol-tobacco-to-help-the-poor","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T21:00:29Z","webTitle":"Tax sugar, alcohol and tobacco to help the poor, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/04/sin-tax-sugar-alcohol-tobacco-to-help-the-poor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/04/sin-tax-sugar-alcohol-tobacco-to-help-the-poor","fields":{"headline":"Tax sugar, alcohol and tobacco to help the poor, say experts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So called “sin taxes” on sugary drinks, alcohol and tobacco not only work, but will help rather than unduly penalise the poor, according to a major new international analysis. Just a day before the UK brings in a levy on sugary drinks, experts are urging every country in the world to use taxes to deter people from the eating, drinking and smoking habits that will damage their health. They warn of the urgent need to check the spread of cancers, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and other conditions caused or exacerbated by our lifestyles which have overtaken infectious diseases as the biggest killers of the modern age. Five papers published in the Lancet medical journal say these non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are having a big and growing impact in low and middle-income countries, following in the footsteps of affluent nations. Those countries have 80% of resultant deaths. “There is a vicious cycle of NCDs leading to poverty and poverty leading to NCDs,” said Dr David Peters, professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, one of the authors. But the global scale of the problem has gone under the radar. “Part of it is the spread of diet and lifestyles and part of it is because people weren’t looking at it before. If you don’t shine a light on it, you don’t see it as a problem,” he said. NCDs cause 38m deaths a year and 16m of those are premature – in people under 70. The experts analysed the effects of taxes on sugary drinks, tobacco and alcohol in countries that have introduced them and found that the criticism that they are regressive – penalising the poorest – is unfounded. They looked at 13 countries: Chile, Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua, Albania, Poland, Turkey, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Niger, Nigeria, India and Timor-Leste. They found that wealthier families generally spend more on alcohol, soft drinks and snacks. In India, for instance, wealthier households spent seven times more on alcohol and three times more on soft drinks and snacks compared to poorer households. So those households end up paying a larger proportion of any tax. On the other hand, taxes have a greater impact on the smaller household budgets of poorer families. They respond by buying less, with greater benefits for their health. In the UK, say the authors, the response to the possible introduction of a minimum price for alcohol was estimated to be 7.6 times larger in the poorest households, compared with the wealthiest. In Mexico, the introduction of a sugary drinks tax resulted in an average of 4.2 litres less of soft drinks purchased per person, with a 17% decrease in purchases among lower income groups and almost no change in higher income groups. In Lebanon, they say, a 50% increase in the price of cigarettes would lead to twice as many people quitting smoking in poorer households as affluent families. “The evidence suggests that concerns about higher taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and soft drinks harming the poor are overstated,” said Dr Rachel Nugent from RTI International in Seattle, USA, and chair of the Lancet Taskforce on NCDs and economics. “Some degree of taxation on tobacco is common in many countries, and while we are starting to see progress on alcohol taxes, there is much more governments should be doing – in both high and low income countries – to consider the careful introduction of taxes on other unhealthy products like soft drinks and snacks. Price policies such as taxes will be a key part of the response to rising rates of non-communicable diseases.” The UK sugar tax is a levy on the manufacturers of 18p per litre for drinks containing 5g of sugar per 100ml and 24p on those with 8g per 100ml. Many companies have reformulated their products, often swapping artificial sweeteners for sugar. Some – like Coca-Cola – have decided to stick to the original recipe and the price will rise, although the bottles and cans will shrink to reduce the impact."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/16/tactics-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-title","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T14:45:05Z","webTitle":"Vulnerable channels and 20 zones: the tactics behind Guardiola’s title win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/16/tactics-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-title","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/16/tactics-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-title","fields":{"headline":"Vulnerable channels and 20 zones: the tactics behind Guardiola’s title win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ottmar Hitzfeld, the former Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich manager, used to speak of the red zone, a central area of the pitch just outside the penalty box. Control that, he believed, and you controlled the game. If in your half you denied the opposition the ball in that space, they were forced wide and while crosses can be dangerous they are a low percentage route to goal. At the other end a player with time on the ball in that zone was a major threat, able to shoot or slide balls through the defence. As teams have become increasingly adept at plugging the red zone – often with the use of two holding midfielders – the danger area has shifted. Manchester City, notably, target the area on the edge of the Hitzfeld red zone, the space between the central defender and the full-back. An awareness of the vulnerability of that area is not something particularly new. In a 4-4-2 a forward with any level of tactical awareness would try to exploit it. Perhaps the centre-back and the full-back both think the other is covering and the forward is left unmarked. Or perhaps both mark the one player, leaving space elsewhere. Or if one marks the forward he can move into the other defender’s zone, disrupting the defensive structure. It is a simple enough idea but, as Thierry Henry explained on Sky, it remains potent at the highest level. The idea of disruption, of existing in the pockets that elude the marking structure, was at the heart of Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona. “If you stand between the right-back and the right centre-back and [Samuel Eto’o] or me does the same on the other side, suddenly you hold four players alone,” Henry said. “Just from you being high and wide, and then coming back in, you are actually freezing four players because we are threatening to go in behind.” Because they were so terrified of leaving Henry or Eto’o free, defences did not push up and full-backs did not move into midfield. The effect was to create more space in midfield for Lionel Messi dropping off as a false nine and for Xavi and Andrés Iniesta advancing from midfield (not to mention the complication of Dani Alves’s surges from a notional right-back position). City have exploited the same basic idea slightly differently but the importance of those channels between the centre-back and full-back is seen in the way Guardiola, as he did at Bayern, has the City training pitches marked out in 20 zones. In principle no more than three zones in the same horizontal line and no more than two zones in the same vertical line should ever be occupied. If a player moves into a zone that means four in the same horizontal line are occupied, one of the other three should move, ensuring the man on the ball always has two or three passing options. But what is also significant is that dividing the pitch in such a way emphasises the importance of those channels between full-back and centre-back. Last season one of the great strengths of Chelsea was the way their structure controlled those channels, their 3-4-2-1 system providing both two holding midfielders (N’Golo Kanté and Nemanja Matic) and two players who were in effect inside-forwards (Eden Hazard and Pedro or Willian), who operated in awkward pockets in which they fell outside the natural zone of the opposing centre-back, full-back and holding midfielder. Guardiola had Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva operating in “free eight” roles from the start of last season, to all intents roving inside-forwards whose forward runs would exploit those channels. The big difference with Chelsea, though, was that City maintained out-and-out wingers (in the modern sense of the term) rather than wing-backs. Guardiola did toy with a back three at the start of this season, although that seemed to be a way of getting Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus into the side in a 3-3-2-2 (or perhaps even 3-1-4-2) rather than Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1. The system brought two wins and a draw but perhaps because the attacking six frequently found themselves strung out in a line as the forwards tried to drop off to create space for Silva and De Bruyne to burst into, it never resurfaced after a switch to 4-3-3 brought a 6-0 win over Watford and a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace in quick succession.The role of Fernandinho in protecting the back four is crucial, particularly on those occasions when both full-backs have been given licence to attack. But there have also been times when the full-backs, Fabian Delph in particular (and most notably away against Chelsea), have tucked inside, with the corresponding centre-back moving wider, occupying precisely those channels De Bruyne and David Silva try to attack at the other end of the pitch. That is useful as a way out from the back – and Ederson’s calmness in possession has been a major feature, notably at home against Tottenham when he bypassed the press with a string of accurate long passes. It also gives City protection against the counterattack; although, as the Champions League games against Liverpool suggested, perhaps not enough. City’s domination of the channels at one end of the pitch has been their triumph; their failure to do the same at the other end has been their undoing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/04/syria-isis-latest-trump-white-house-remove-troops","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T16:34:51Z","webTitle":"White House clarification only adds to confusion over Syria withdrawal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/04/syria-isis-latest-trump-white-house-remove-troops","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/04/syria-isis-latest-trump-white-house-remove-troops","fields":{"headline":"White House clarification only adds to confusion over Syria withdrawal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The White House on Wednesday said the US fight against the Islamic State in Syria is “coming to a rapid end” even as Donald Trump reportedly agreed to keep troops in the war-torn country for the foreseeable future. Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to withdraw US troops from Syria “very soon”, which is at odds with a January declaration that “it is vital for the United States to remain engaged in Syria”. “The military mission to eradicate Isis in Syria is coming to a rapid end, with Isis being almost completely destroyed,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said in a statement. “The United States and our partners remain committed to eliminating the small Isis presence in Syria that our forces have not already eradicated. We will continue to consult with our allies and friends regarding future plans. We expect countries in the region and beyond, plus the United Nations, to work toward peace and ensure that Isis never re-emerges.” Mixed messages emerged from a meeting between Trump and his National Security Council about the US presence in Syria earlier this week. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Trump had instructed military leaders to prepare to withdraw US troops from Syria but did not agree to a timeline by which to do so. Meanwhile, other outlets said Trump agreed to keep US troops in Syria for an “undetermined period of time” to ensure Islamic State militants are defeated. Trump apparently repeated his demand that other countries in the region step up to restore stability to the country. “We’re not going to immediately withdraw but neither is the president willing to back a long-term commitment,” a senior administration official told Reuters. The White House statement appeared to be an attempt to cut through the confusion, but it offered no timetable for withdrawal. On Tuesday, at a press conference with the leaders of three Baltic nations, Trump repeated his view that the US must “get out” of Syria “very soon”. The US has roughly 2,000 forces on the ground in Syria fighting the Islamic State. He claimed that the fight against the Islamic State was “almost completed” and said: “I want to get out. I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our nation.” Trump said the US had spent $7tn on the Middle East over the past 17 years, since the US invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. “We get nothing, nothing out of it,” Trump said. “Think of it – $7tn over a 17-year period. We have nothing – nothing except death and destruction. It’s a horrible thing. So it’s time.” “So, it’s time. It’s time. We were very successful against Isis,” Trump said, using a common acronym for the Islamic State. “But sometimes it’s time to come back home, and we’re thinking about that very seriously, OK?” Speaking later on Wednesday at the White House briefing, Sanders tried again to explain the White House position adding that the “focus would be to transition and train local enforcement and as well as have allies and partners in the region, who have a lot more at risk, put more skin in the game”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/14/alan-travis-home-affairs-guardian-report-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T21:21:23Z","webTitle":"Alan Travis: 'The job hasn't changed – report the news and tell the story'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/14/alan-travis-home-affairs-guardian-report-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/14/alan-travis-home-affairs-guardian-report-politics","fields":{"headline":"Alan Travis: 'The job hasn't changed – report the news and tell the story'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alan Travis joined the Guardian in 1984 as a reporter.

It was at the height of the miners’ strike and in my first week I was sent out to Tilbury to cover a return-to-work revolt by dockers who had been called out in support of the NUM. I had a front-page story and a leader-page backgrounder. Not a bad start. Can you sum up the Guardian in a sentence? It really is one of the world’s great news organisations and a leading liberal voice. In your time covering the home affairs brief, are there stories which you are especially proud to have published? Disclosing the Home Office’s secret post-Brexit immigration plans, long-term sustained reporting of conditions in our prisons and detailing the creeping advance of the database state. In that time, who has been the best, and worst, home secretary, and why? During my career I have seen 10 home secretaries and seven justice secretaries. David Blunkett was the best. Not because he was the most liberal, although he had more liberal moments than he was given credit for, but because he was a reforming home secretary who wanted to tackle serious problems and knew how to communicate with the public, even if his solutions were often flawed – for example ID cards and IPP (Imprisonment for Public Protection) sentences. The worst was probably Michael Howard. He was a much more skilled home secretary than many, but his “prison works” response to the James Bulger murder launched a punitive penal populism in Britain among politicians that has doubled the prison population and remains rampant today. What will you miss most about working here? The daily buzz of the newsroom and the fact that the Guardian provides a really effective platform to intervene in our political life, and can sometimes make a real difference. Which journalists you have worked with do you most admire? There is a younger generation of journalists in the newsroom like Rob Booth, Amelia Gentleman and Juliette Garside who are doing fantastic original reporting each in their own different ways. How has covering government departments as a specialist changed since you started as home affairs editor? When I first started covering the Home Office, the head of the press office took me out to lunch and went through every major topic facing the department, getting me up to speed on what was coming up. The home secretary – first Ken Clarke and then Michael Howard – would have weekly press briefings for the specialist home affairs correspondents where they would explain and answer questions in detail on their initiatives on crime, immigration, prisons or whatever. This continued when Labour came to power in 1997 with first Jack Straw and then David Blunkett, which meant that you had a sense of participating in the national debate and could hold the most senior politicians to account in detail. I remember one particular press briefing called with Straw at the Home Office where he turned up an hour late. He apologised and explained that he had been delayed because he had taken his son to the police station because there was a drugs issue with him. How does that compare with now? Whitehall departments, including the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, have completely closed down, with very limited access to briefings with ministers or even senior officials. All but the most routine press inquiries are now channelled through a ministerial special adviser, which means it can take hours to receive even the blandest replies. There are a few gems left in Whitehall press offices who take the trouble to really make sure they know about their subject and have the confidence to discuss them with a specialist journalist in a non-confrontational way. But they are few and far between. Unfortunately my exasperation with some Home Office press officers were rather notable moments in the newsroom. One recently spent 20 minutes trying to insist to me I couldn’t use the word “murder” when writing about the crime figures. He was trying to insist that I use “homicide” instead. A couple of times I have ended a call with cheers breaking out around me. I am not sure they were as well received down the other end of the line. What advice would you give to a reporter starting out in the industry today? Find out about something that nobody else in the newsroom knows about and make it your own. I am a great believer in specialist journalism. It will serve you throughout your career. Polly Toynbee started out by making herself a specialist in low pay. How has journalism changed since you started? When I started it was typewriters, telephone boxes, hot metal and the Sporting Pink ’Un. Now it’s the web, the app and the personal hotspot. But the job has remained the same – reporting the news and telling a story that the reader needs to hear. What sort of Guardian would you like to see in 10 years’ time and what should it be focusing on? I want to see the same kind of campaigning journalism that has made the Guardian famous but I also want it to thrive as a mainstream news organisation. One is not possible without the other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/06/charles-darwin-lost-fossils-including-a-sloth-the-size-of-a-car-to-be-made-public","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T14:00:33Z","webTitle":"Darwin's lost fossils – including a sloth the size of a car – to be made public","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/06/charles-darwin-lost-fossils-including-a-sloth-the-size-of-a-car-to-be-made-public","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/06/charles-darwin-lost-fossils-including-a-sloth-the-size-of-a-car-to-be-made-public","fields":{"headline":"Darwin's lost fossils – including a sloth the size of a car – to be made public","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On 23 September 1832 a young naturalist, thousands of miles from home and frequently seasick and homesick, found the fossil of an enormous skull embedded in soft rock. It took Charles Darwin three hours to chip it out of the cliff face at Punta Alta in Argentina, and hours more to lug it back to base. He arrived with it long after dark at the ship which became the most famous in the history of natural science, the Beagle. Darwin was only 24, a college dropout from his medical degree who had done a crash course in geology in order to join the voyage. He was wild with excitement about the chase, writing in a letter to a friend: “I have just got scent of some fossil bones of a Mammoth, what they may be I do not know, but if gold or galloping will get them, they shall be mine”. Darwin’s treasures, brought on board after every shore trip to the exasperation of the crew of the small cramped ship, and sent back to England whenever he came upon a vessel making the return journey, were all meticulously recorded in his journals, and labelled according to a four-colour system he devised himself using printed labels he had brought from England. His fossils, much less famous now in the history of how he came to publish his theory of evolution by natural selection than his observations of wildlife, are among the treasures of the Natural History Museum in London. They are still of interest to scientists all over the world but many of the originals are almost too fragile to handle. The NHM this week launches an ambitious project to scan and digitally recreate the fossils in 3D, in such minute detail that they can be studied by scientists as well as pored over by members of the public. One of the first completed has just been digitally dissected by a scientist in Montpellier in France. The digitisation also guarantees that a permanent record of the bones will be preserved as scientific tests continue. Carbon dating has recently confirmed a date for one which Darwin could only have guessed at from the rock layer in which he found it – just 12,660 years old, so very close to the extinction of its species – and the NHM will now attempt to extract DNA from it. The first to go online is the skull of Toxodon platensis, which Darwin found propped up against the fence in a Uruguayan farmer’s yard, where the local children competed to throw stones and knock out its teeth. Darwin bought it for a shilling and sixpence (equivalent to £6.40 today). Its curved teeth led Darwin and fellow scientists to wonder if it was an gigantic rodent, but it was eventually identified as a distant relative of a rhinoceros – and the last member of a group of South American mammals stretching back 60m years. As they arrived back in England, Darwin’s fossils were already becoming famous and making his reputation, when he still had years of the voyage ahead. One batch contained a missing section of a skeleton which had already been sent back by another collector – the creature whose skull Darwin had chipped out of the cliff face. They were the remains of Megatherium, a ground dwelling relative of modern tree dwelling sloths – but Megatherium was the size of a car, the largest and heaviest land mammal ever to live in South America. After the fossils were displayed at a science event in London, one friend wrote to Darwin: “From sending home the much desired bones of Megatherium your name is likely to be immortalised.” In fact, Megatherium and its relationship to modern animals was one of the observations which would set Darwin’s mind on the course which would make his name immortal, and the publication decades later of his great book. At the NHM, senior curator Pip Brewer and Adrian Lister, a research leader in the museum’s Earth Sciences department who has written a new book on Darwin’s fossils, share Darwin’s excitement over the hunt, having tracked down a chunk of fossil where it has been missing in plain sight for more than a century. They launched an international hunt for Darwin fossils as part of the project. Most came to their museum after the second world war from the Royal College of Surgeons – which in the 19th century had the best comparative anatomy collection, while Darwin was scathing about the British Museum’s displays of its natural history specimens. The huge skull remains with the RCS, and others went to Harvard in the 19th century with a Swiss scientist, a correspondent of Darwin’s. The missing slice of the skull which Darwin chipped out of the Argentinian cliff in 1832 turned up in his own home, Down House, now a museum run by English Heritage. “They told us they had a bit of tooth in the stores but they no idea what it was. When we got there they had had it laid out on a table and we recognised it as the missing piece of Megatherium in seconds,” Lister said. They later brought the fossil to the RCS, and could see instantly how perfectly the cut marks matched with the rest of the skull. “It wasn’t quite as dramatic as Darwin’s discovery of it – but it was still such a thrill,” Brewer added. The first of the digitised Darwin fossils goes online at the Natural History Museum site on 9 April.

No other manager has a record against Pep Guardiola anywhere near as good as that of Jürgen Klopp. Nobody else has beaten Guardiola seven times, or six, or even five. Only José Mourinho has come out on top four times against him. So why? What is it about the ferocity of Klopp’s sides that has so often presented a problem for Guardiola? In part it is that Klopp attacks. To sit back against a team such as City, Klopp has said, to aim to absorb pressure, is to look to win the lottery. You cannot stop them creating chances and so you are left hoping they will not convert any they do create. His way is to look to use Guardiola’s uncompromising belief in passing football against him by making his ball-playing defenders focus on the defending section of their job rather than the ball-playing part. It is a high-risk strategy, as the 5-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium in September demonstrated, but the rewards justify the gamble. Yet there was a sense on Wednesday that Guardiola was at least in part the architect of his own downfall at Anfield. The use of Ilkay Gündogan in a withdrawn role on the right, taking the place of Raheem Sterling, was presumably designed to help City keep the ball and thus control the game, to calm the fury and try to stop Liverpool building the momentum that brought three goals in nine minutes in January. But trying to squeeze Gündogan, Fernandinho, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva seems problematic. The four have started together only five times in the league, all last season. Only one of those games was won. Perhaps they are too similar, all neat passers who prefer to operate centrally and lack the unpredictability, pace and width of Sterling, whose introduction 11 minutes into the second half seemed an admission of error. Gündogan’s reluctance to advance meant that for long spells City’s only attacking option was a long diagonal pass out to Leroy Sané, with whom Liverpool’s Trent Alexander‑Arnold coped brilliantly. And while their attack was misfiring, City’s defence were exhibiting familiar signs of frailty. The doubt had been that City have a soft underbelly that is protected by their possession. This was exposed by Liverpool’s pace and directness, all three goals resulting from just the sort of rapid transitions Guardiola’s change in shape had seemingly been designed to avoid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/05/clear-discrimination-south-sudanese-react-to-exclusion-from-migration-program","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T02:00:35Z","webTitle":"'Clear discrimination': South Sudanese react to exclusion from migration program","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/clear-discrimination-south-sudanese-react-to-exclusion-from-migration-program","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/clear-discrimination-south-sudanese-react-to-exclusion-from-migration-program","fields":{"headline":"'Clear discrimination': South Sudanese react to exclusion from migration program","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"South Sudanese-Australians say they are being discriminated against after being told they will no longer be able to privately sponsor refugees to come to Australia. The Guardian revealed on Thursday morning that the Community Support Program (CSP), a minor element of Australia’s humanitarian migration program, was being essentially restricted to eight “priority resettlement” countries. Nationals of several other specific countries that were previously considered for supported resettlement, such as South Sudan, Somalia and Iran, are now excluded and will not be able to access the program. The Guardian understands the priority countries are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Bhutan, Syria and Iraq. The South Sudanese community leader Atem Jok has been seeking to sponsor his brother and sisters, who are displaced over the border in Kenya’s massive Kakuma refugee camp. They have been registered with the UNHCR. When the CSP was a pilot program, South Sudanese nationals were able to apply but they have since been removed. Jok said he has not been able to find out why South Sudan was removed, or how he can assist his family. “My family members meet all of the criteria for resettlement under the program, every one – except for the country of origin,” he said. “South Sudanese were able to access the program in previous years but I have spoken with many organisations and no one can tell me why South Sudan has been taken off.” Jok, an engineer in the Queensland city of Toowoomba, said his family members meet the CSP requirements of being aged between 18 and 50, having functional English (they hold postgraduate degrees) and have already been offered a job in Australia. The global special humanitarian visa is for people subject to substantial discrimination amounting to a gross violation of human rights in their home country, and from which they have fled. They also must be proposed by a person or organisation in Australia. “My family meets exactly that,” Jok said. “We don’t know what’s the reason, it seems absolute discrimination based around the African gangs issue in Melbourne, especially with South Sudanese being the target ethnic group. This is absolutely absurd to see my beloved country, Australia, making such decisions based around stereotyping instead of on the basis of those who are in need.” James Mayen, from Melbourne’s South Sudanese community, said the CSP’s pilot predecessor was a valuable program. He was able to sponsor family members to come to Australia, where they have rebuilt lives, including finding jobs, after years of displacement. “But we are now excluded; this is a very clear discrimination,” he said. “My disappointment is very great, because I have seen the benefits of this very good program. People have come to this country and contributed to the society. “This has made people feel that we don’t belong. We are Australian citizens; why should we be excluded?” Mayen said he would seek answers from the government. “We should have been consulted. Where do they want us to go?” The Community Support Program this year offers up to 1,000 places, taken from within the broader program of 16,250 places. It allows community groups, businesses, families or individuals to sponsor and support a refugee to come to Australia. But each place privately sponsored reduces by one the government’s resettlement commitment. The Department of Home Affairs says “applicants must reside in a priority resettlement country as determined by the Australian government”. A spokesman for the department told the Guardian that settlement priorities for Australia’s humanitarian program, including the Community Support Program, are determined each year by the government. “People in humanitarian situations from the Middle East, Africa and Asia continue to be a resettlement priority under Australia’s 2017-18 humanitarian program.” The program was previously the Community Proposal pilot, which began in 2013, but has faced criticism for being prohibitively expensive. To sponsor an individual refugee costs about $48,000, a family of five about $100,000. It has also been criticised for the “offset” of the government’s commitment. The offset has been criticised as failing to increase the sum of protection offered by Australia and as an abrogation of the government’s commitment to the resettlement of refugees in favour of outsourcing resettlement to private individuals or community groups. Jana Favero from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said the government should reconsider its exclusions of certain nationalities. “Eligibility for the Community Support Program should be based on whether someone is a refugee or not, full stop. Excluding certain refugee groups, even though they are fleeing war and persecution, takes us down a very dangerous path of discrimination.” Favero said a reworked and improved CSP had the potential to provide new pathways to protection for those around the world who needed it. “The community support program has the potential to be expanded, affordable and more inclusive, rather than this latest unexplained change which is exclusive and disturbing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/04/oklahoma-teachers-strike-march-school-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T21:35:51Z","webTitle":"Oklahoma teachers take school funding quest on the road for 110-mile march","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/04/oklahoma-teachers-strike-march-school-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/04/oklahoma-teachers-strike-march-school-funding","fields":{"headline":"Oklahoma teachers take school funding quest on the road for 110-mile march","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Teachers do not typically get to share top billing with the superstars of professional sport. But for a brief moment on Tuesday night at the Chesapeake Energy Stadium, Shantel O’Grady of Tecumseh middle school earned her place on the Jumbotron as Oklahoma City Thunder took on basketball’s reigning NBA champs, Golden State Warriors. During a break in the first quarter, as O’Grady appeared to get the Teacher of the Game award, clad in the red colors of striking teachers, the crowd cheered wildly as the announcer said O’Grady would be receiving free gift cards to purchase badly needed classroom supplies. For now, public support for striking teachers in Oklahoma appears high, but it is not clear how long that will last. “It worries me,” says Scott Harrison, a geometry teacher at Southeast high school, sitting behind me. “Some people view that as being greedy or unthankful [for the raise], but it’s more than a teacher raise we are looking for, it’s funding for our classrooms.” While the state legislature passed a $6,000 raise, the state approved only $50m of the $250m that teachers requested for additional classroom supplies. Harrison says he still has to teach personal finance classes using a textbook from 1995 that refers to ATMs as a “new technology”. On Monday, the lame-duck Republican Oklahoma governor, Mary Fallin, attempted to turn public sympathy against the striking teachers. In an interview with CBS Evening News, she accused teachers of being greedy and said the protests were backed by anti-fascist “antifa” groups. “Teachers want more,” Fallin told CBS News. “But it’s kind of like having a teenage kid that wants a better car.” Oklahoma teachers are going all out to rally support and put pressure on the legislature to pass another bill to increase spending on classroom resources. On Wednesday, more than 400 spandex-clad teachers, gathered in front of Daniel Webster high school in Tulsa to launch a six-day 110-mile hike from Tulsa to Oklahoma City. “If you can walk 100 miles then what can our legislators do here in Oklahoma,” said the National Education Association secretary-treasurer, Princess R Moss, as she began the march in front of Daniel Webster high school. “Hold them accountable and walk until you get what you need for our students and public education here in Oklahoma,” said Moss as the crowd gathered to head out on historic Route 66. The journey will be long and arduous across the plains of Oklahoma. Teachers estimate they will walk six hours a day. Churches and schools have offered to host the marching teachers. Tulsa Metropolitan Ministries and Muslims for Mercy have arranged food for the marchers along the way. “We are a very diverse group,” says hijab-clad Tulsa Metropolitan Ministries’ executive director, Aliye Shimi. The largely women-led group had been preparing for the march for weeks, including running seminars on how to physically prepare the women for 17 miles a day. The group also plans support vehicles so those that are unable to walk could join them. Special education teacher Patricia Mott, 66, said she hoped to do the entire march each day, but the battery on her electric wheelchair will only allow her to go 10 miles a day. “Sorry I get so emotional,” Mott said as she wiped away tears. “I just need to take care of my kids, I need to take care of my teachers. “I’m 66 years old and everyone says, ‘Why haven’t you retired?’ It’s because I am needed, still needed,” Mott said as she turned on her electric wheelchair and headed off on Route 66 for Oklahoma City."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T20:53:32Z","webTitle":"Liverpool’s stunning first-half salvo leaves Manchester City’s hopes on rocks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool’s stunning first-half salvo leaves Manchester City’s hopes on rocks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Everybody knew what Jürgen Klopp meant when he said, more than once, that the tie was still not over. Liverpool, he reminded us, had already lost by five goals at Manchester City earlier in the season. So, yes, it was easy to understand why the victorious manager wanted to sound a note of caution at the end of a thrilling night for the club depicted by one of the banners on the Kop proclaiming “European royalty.” All the same, it would be a remarkable feat of escapology if City were to save themselves now and if Klopp’s side can play like this again maybe the Liverpool supporters could be forgiven for wondering whether this will be the season to update all those others banners showing the various years – 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 – when the European Cup has resided inside Anfield’s trophy cabinet. OK, perhaps best not to get too carried away just yet but Liverpool could hardly have wished for a more emphatic victory. They swept aside City with a 19-minute blitz of first-half goals and, to put it into context, if Liverpool can score in the second leg it will mean Pep Guardiola’s team need five. One certainty is that Klopp will not see it as a night for conservatism and, judging by the way City defended here, the five-time winners should be confident about adding to their total when they head along the M62 next Tuesday night. Liverpool certainly kept to their promise that they would not be cowed by the fact their opponents, lest it be forgotten, are currently 18 points above them at the top of the Premier League. A more restrained team – not least some of the great Liverpool sides who have won this competition – might have tried to slow down the game once they had raced into a 2-0 lead inside the opening 20 minutes. Not Klopp’s team, though. Why put on the handbrake when everyone was having so much fun? Then Mohamed Salah clipped in a ball from the right and Sadio Mané headed in their third goal, with half an hour on the clock, and Liverpool still went searching for more. To hell with conservatism – this was the modern Liverpool, high on confidence, with a front three who could trouble any defence, let alone one looking as vulnerable as City’s. Klopp’s view was that the only way to take on the Premier League champions-in-waiting was to attack with pace and adventure, pin back the opposition full-backs and hope, perhaps, to catch Vincent Kompany and Nicolás Otamendi having a poor evening. After that, Klopp needed his players to be ruthless and he got all of that during the period of the game when Salah and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also scored. For City, that made the opening 30 minutes a calamity and Oxlade-Chamberlain certainly chose a good night to produce the outstanding moment of his Liverpool career to date. He struck his shot with the kind of power that might have reminded Liverpool fans about the way Terry McDermott used to drive through the middle and let fly from 25 yards. It was a tremendous finish but the chance would never have even presented itself were it not for James Milner dispossessing Ilkay Gündoğan inside his own half. Gündoğan was caught on the ball and that little snapshot felt typical of how the first half ran away from the team in blue. Guardiola had left out Raheem Sterling to involve Gündoğan, with Kevin De Bruyne starting in a more withdrawn role than usual, and Gabriel Jesus having to make do without the support in attack he might usually receive. Guardiola was entitled to think Sterling has played poorly on his previous returns to Anfield but perhaps City’s manager might have been better off sticking with his usual tactics. Jesus looked isolated at times, especially with Leroy Sané clinging to the left, and it was not a surprise when De Bruyne switched to a more attacking right-sided position in the second half. Sterling was brought on in the 56th minute, meaning De Bruyne then took up the No 10 role, and Salah’s withdrawal with an injury four minutes earlier also had an impact on how the rest of the second half took shape. For the first time, Liverpool started to look like a team whose priority was to ensure they kept a clean sheet rather than one trying to extend their lead. Even then, City seldom threatened to score and it was difficult to think of the last time they have looked so ineffective going forward. Guardiola’s players had plenty of the ball but Loris Karius, Liverpool’s goalkeeper, was seldom troubled. Liverpool will desperately hope Salah is available for the second leg and it is inconceivable City will be so vapid again. Yet the opening goal was also a reminder that it might suit Liverpool if they have to play on the counterattack. City had passed the ball with great elegance during the opening exchanges but the game slipped away from them as soon as Salah’s pass gave Roberto Firmino the first chance to test Ederson, the away team’s goalkeeper. The shot came back off Ederson and Kyle Walker could not adjust his feet. Firmino had Salah to his left and the Egyptian’s 38th goal of the season put Liverpool on their way to a raucous victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/06/slovakia-thousands-protest-against-business-as-usual-under-new-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T04:00:22Z","webTitle":"Slovakia: thousands protest against business-as-usual under new leaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/slovakia-thousands-protest-against-business-as-usual-under-new-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/06/slovakia-thousands-protest-against-business-as-usual-under-new-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Slovakia: thousands protest against business-as-usual under new leaders","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"First came the double murder of a journalist and his fiancee, shot dead at their home in a crime that shocked Slovakia. Then came something equally surprising: a movement triggered by the murder brought tens of thousands on to the streets for the biggest protests seen in the country since the Velvet Revolution. This led to the resignation of the prime minister, Robert Fico, who had dominated Slovakia’s political scene for over a decade, as well as the country’s interior minister. Now, five weeks after the killing of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová, many worry that the new leaders will return to business as usual and sweep corruption scandals under the carpet. Thousands of mainly young protesters rallied on a central Bratislava square again on Thursday afternoon in an effort to ensure this does not happen. The newspaper Denník N put the crowd at 45,000 people. From the stage, the main demand of the movement was aired: for the new interior minister to fire the chief of police, something he has so far refused to do. Juraj Šeliga, a 27-year-old PhD student who is taking time away from writing his dissertation on constitutional law to help organise the protests, said the movement had two basic demands: an independent investigation into the murder of Kuciak and his girlfriend, and a new “trustworthy” government. Slovakia, which was part of the eastern bloc state of Czechoslovakia, became independent in 1993 and joined the EU in 2004. Fico, who had been prime minister for 10 of the past 12 years, portrayed himself as a more reasonable figure than populist and nationalist forces in neighbouring Hungary and Poland, although at times he used populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, and once referred to journalists as “dirty anti-Slovak prostitutes”. Over the years, the government weathered a number of corruption scandals, partly due to public apathy. “Corruption has penetrated all levels of the state administration,” said Beata Balogová, editor-in-chief of the liberal newspaper SME. The murder of Kuciak triggered public anger. The 27-year-old journalist had been investigating links between Italian mafia figures and Slovak officials, including revelations that one of the prime minister’s closest aides was the business partner of an alleged Italian mafia clan member. In time, the protest movement broadened, under the banner of “For a Decent Slovakia”. As the protests gathered momentum last month, Fico took a leaf out of the playbook of Viktor Orbán in neighbouring Hungary, suggesting the demonstrations had been financed by the American philanthropist and financier George Soros, the favoured target of nativist and righwing governments across the world. “It was an act of despair. Instead of shouldering some of the responsibility for running a country where the mafia had got so close to the top offices of government, he began spreading conspiracy theories,” said Balogová. Fico severely underestimated the strength of feeling, and in mid-March, was forced to resign, although he was replaced by longstanding ally Peter Pellegrini, from his own Smer party. Two weeks ago, the organisers called off their planned protest. Even if Pellegrini was seen as Fico’s man, coming from the same party, it was time to “let the battlefield move to parliament,” said Šeliga. However, the protest organisers called a fresh rally on Thursday due to the refusal of the new interior minister to fire the controversial chief of police. “I trust the police but I don’t trust their bosses,” said Peter Bárdy, the editor-in-chief of news website Aktuality, where Kuciak worked. At the newsroom, one wall of the conference area is plastered with a spider’s web of connections between Slovak politicians and the mafia, and burly security guards keep watch outside, a new addition since the murders. The protests have drawn inevitable comparisons to the Velvet Revolution, the non-violent movement that heralded the end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. But while that revolution moved from one demand to the next with seeming inevitability, the next steps for the current movement are less clear, particularly given the potential alternatives. The political opposition is fragmented and made up of various groups polling around the 10% mark, ranging from a neo-Nazi grouping to a supposedly “pro-family” party whose leader has 10 children with nine different women. The organisers have been careful to insist that the movement is about civic engagement, not party politics, and politicians are banned from addressing the crowd at the rallies. “In 1989, we had a series of demands that were fulfilled one after the other,” said Martin Bútora, one of the founding members of Public Against Violence, a Slovak political movement founded during the Velvet Revolution. “With these girls and boys it’s more complicated. It’s not so easy to have clear-cut understandable demands.” There are some signs of a new public engagement with politics. Balogová said that in the weeks since Kuciak’s murder, her newspaper had seen a huge number of people getting in touch with leaks, tip-offs and documents relating to corruption. The focus for the protest movement now is on pushing young Slovaks to become socially and politically engaged, and perhaps to register for municipal elections in November, where candidates can run as independents, free of party affiliation. “We are not happy with the new government, but this is not Maidan in Ukraine,” said Šeliga. “We will protest only within the scope of the constitution. We’ve already achieved a lot. A month ago nobody would think it was possible that Fico would go. But decent people, who want to live in a decent country, have pushed him out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/04/augusta-national-leap-forward-womens-amateur-event-female-members","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T19:43:04Z","webTitle":"The pace things move around Augusta National, this is a leap forward | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/04/augusta-national-leap-forward-womens-amateur-event-female-members","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/04/augusta-national-leap-forward-womens-amateur-event-female-members","fields":{"headline":"The pace things move around Augusta National, this is a leap forward","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Progress came to Augusta National on Wednesday in the unlikely guise of a 65-year-old real estate lawyer from Tampa, Florida. Fred Ridley took over as chairman of Augusta National last August, and his first major initiative is a new tournament for the world’s best female amateurs. It starts next year, when it will be held on the Saturday before the Masters starts, 6 April. It will be the first women’s competition held at the course. It was only six years ago that the club finally allowed women to become members – now it is opening itself up to female players, too. Augusta National has finally made it to the 21st century, 18 years late. This isn’t equality. The club is not starting a women’s Masters. The competition is for amateurs rather than professionals, and only the last round will be held at Augusta National; the two before it will be at the nearby Champions Retreat. But change comes awful slow at Augusta. And by the pace things move around here, this is a leap forward. And there is more to come, too. Ridley also promised that there “will be more women members at Augusta National”. The club does not publish a membership list but in 2012, when it first allowed women in, it only had two female members. One was Condoleezza Rice, who says that the only bad experience she has had here was on her very first day playing, when all the members came out to watch her hit her first drive. Rice was delighted by Ridley’s idea. “I’ve said many times that our country’s is a story of great institutions evolving and becoming more inclusive over time, and this is one of our great institutions,” she said. “It’s going to be great for the women’s game and it’s going to be great for Augusta. I’m really proud. My first thought was excitement, not for me, but for the young women. I can already picture the smiles on their faces.” Ridley is the seventh chairman of Augusta National, but the club has only had one ruler, Clifford Roberts, who co-founded it with Bobby Jones in the early 1930s. Roberts served as chairman right through to 1976. He died in 1977, but no one has done anything here since without worrying about what his ghost would think of it. Which meant that until 2012 women were not welcome. It was only 15 years ago that one of Ridley’s predecessors as chairman, Hootie Johnson, found himself in a scrap over exactly that with Martha Burk, chair of the National Council of Women’s Organisations. Burk accused Augusta National of sexism. And with good reason. Johnson responded that the club would not be made to change its policies “at the point of a bayonet”. Two of Augusta National’s members resigned because they disagreed with his position. But Johnson was so bull-headed about it that he even decided the Masters would be broadcast without any TV commercials in both 2003 and 2004, just to protect its corporate sponsors from criticism. The club has so much money that it could afford to do without for a couple of years, just to make the point that it was not going to let Burk, or anyone else, tell it what to do. It was Johnson’s successor, Billy Payne, who finally relented in 2012, which is how Rice came to be a member. Payne also started the Drive, Chip, Putt championship, to try to increase youth participation. Ridley says his new tournament is “an extension of that same mission”. As he sees it, Roberts’s principle was that the club should “explore new and impactful ways to impact the game of golf”. Ridley is unusual, too, in that he was such a good player himself. He won the US Amateur, and is the first chairman of the club who actually played in the Masters himself, in 1976, 77, and 78. Which makes him well equipped to take on the other pressing problem facing the sport, how best to protect courses from the professional game’s big-hitters. The distance report recently published by the USGA and R&amp;A showed that the average drive across the seven worldwide tours had increased by another three yards since 2016. Which means that at Augusta the course just does not play the way Jones intended. Ridley was plain about that. “There’s a great quote from Bobby Jones dealing specifically with the 13th hole, which has been lengthened over time,” Ridley said. “He said that the decision to go for the green in two should be a momentous one. And I would have to say that our observations of these great players hitting middle and even short irons into that hole is not a momentous decision. “And so we think there is an issue, not only there, but in the game generally, that needs to be addressed.” Only no one agrees what the solution should be. Ridley said he did not think “that additional length should be the immediate or only reaction”, because “we do not want any action to be taken that’s going to make golf harder, we have an obligation to grow the game, and so we’re sensitive to that”. By Augusta National’s standards, Ridley sounds like a radical. “I hope with this announcement today you have a pretty good idea of part of what my mission is,” he said. “Golf’s a great game. Hopefully it’s blind to colour and it’s blind to gender.” It is not, and never has been, least of all around here. But it has just got a little closer to it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/05/morning-mail-murray-darling-system-in-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T20:53:53Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Murray-Darling system in crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/morning-mail-murray-darling-system-in-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/morning-mail-murray-darling-system-in-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Murray-Darling system in crisis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 5 April. Top stories More than five years and with $9bn spent since the basin plan began, the Murray-Darling river system is in crisis. As part of Guardian Australia’s Our Wide Brown Land series, we will be publishing a series of stories exploring what’s gone wrong. In an immersive feature Anne Davies looks at the problems, including water theft, a lack of planning and enforcement and ghost water, that have arisen under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. And our multimedia feature, featuring photos by Mike Bowers, explores the trouble spots along the Murray-Darling river system. Follow the 3,000km journey along the rivers, travelling from inland Queensland to the Murray mouth, to understand where the plan has failed those who live and work on this land. The Facebook data of up to 87 million people – 37 million more than previously reported – may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, the company has revealed. The larger figure was buried in the penultimate paragraph of a blogpost by the company’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, which also provided updates on the changes Facebook was making to better protect user information. The updates come two weeks after the Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump’s election team and the Brexit campaign acquired millions of profiles of US citizens and used it to build a software program to predict and influence voters. China has raised the stakes in the escalating trade showdown with the US, unveiling tariffs on a targeted list of American imports in response to levies on more than 1,300 Chinese goods put forward by Donald Trump. Sending a message to Washington that economic threats made by the White House would be matched with equal force, Beijing said it would impose additional tariffs of 25% on 106 American products from 14 categories, including soybeans, cars and chemical products. Wall Street slumped as global financial markets assessed the risk of tensions mounting further after the latest advance towards a full-blown trade war between the two nations that would have damaging consequences for the world economy. Humanitarian migrants from eight countries will be prioritised under one of Australia’s refugee resettlement programs, and other nationalities told their applications are highly unlikely to be accepted. Guardian Australia understands the priority countries are: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Bhutan, Syria and Iraq. Nationals of several other specific countries that were previously considered for resettlement, such as South Sudan, Somalia and Iran, are now excluded and will not be able to access the program. The resettlement scheme, known as the community support program, is one element of Australia’s broader humanitarian program. This year it offers up to 1,000 places within the broader program of 16,250 humanitarian places. The move has been condemned by some community leaders as “clear discrimination”. The woman who is believed to have opened fire at YouTube’s headquarters in a suburb of San Francisco yesterday, injuring three before killing herself, was apparently furious with the video website because it had stopped paying her for her clips. Police in California named the shooter as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, aged 39. San Bruno’s police chief, Ed Barberini, said Aghdam’s anger at the website appeared to the motivation for her shooting spree. Questions are now being raised about why police did not act on an earlier warning from her father about her hatred for the company. Aghdam’s online profile shows she was a vegan activist and ran a website where she posted about Persian culture and veganism, as well as long passages critical of YouTube. Sport The Commonwealth Games opening ceremony was held last night and included a speech read by Prince Charles and written by the Queen. Outside the stadium Indigenous Australian protesters chanted “No justice, no Games”, and many arrests took place, writes by Martha Kelner. With the Games under way, there are 10 questions to be answered over the next week and a half. Can Sally Pearson win a third consecutive hurdles title? Or will Indigenous protests force action on treaties and a national voice? And can Australia’a sporting pride be restored after a week of scandal? Thinking time For her book Perfect Imperfection, the Australian pet photographer Alex Cearns set out to capture the personalities of animals who adapt to their damaged or different bodies without complaint. “They push on, wanting to be included and involved in everything as much as they can,” the Perth-based photographer says. “These are the creatures who have lost a leg, been born without eyes, or are still showing the scars of former abuse.” You don’t have to be a climate science denier to join the Monash coal forum – but it helps, writes Graham Readfearn. Look no further than Tony Abbott, Eric Abetz, Kevin Andrews and George Christensen – four of 20 MPs that are members of the Monash Forum, which aims to promote the continued use of coal-fired energy. The Coalition’s backbench group of coal fans have a history of attacking climate science. And while it’s easy to be flippant about the role and impact of climate science denial on Australia’s climate policy, the undermining of scientific evidence has poisoned and politicised an issue that was urgent two decades ago. Do you suffer from phone boredom? From Twitter to Tumblr, swiping through your mobile’s apps is the new doing something while doing nothing at all. Is it simply a case of new technology, same old humans? Is trawling apps with little pleasure or engagement the new version of bouncing a ball repetitively against a wall? What’s he done now? Special counsel Robert Mueller has informed Donald Trump’s attorneys that the president is not currently considered a criminal target in the Russia investigation, according to reports in the Washington Post. Although Trump remains of interest, there is not enough evidence to bring charges against him. Media roundup Western Australians are Australia’s biggest users of methamphetamine, the West Australian reports, after waste water tests by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission found WA’s use of the drug is increasing and almost double the Australian average. The Conversation has a piece by a University of Sydney clinician arguing that not all vaginal mesh implants are a problem, and treating all of the products the same way puts women at risk. And the ABC reports that a parliamentary inquiry has been established to investigate Australia’s role in the ivory trade, and will examine how ivory is being passed off in the antique trade in this country. Coming up In the first competition day of the Commonwealth Games 19 medal events will be held across five sports: triathlon, weightlifting, gymnastics, track cycling and swimming. The defence minister, Marise Payne, will address the Lowy Institute in Canberra on the importance of stability in the Pacific to Australia.

English riders took six gold medals at the 2014 Games, including victory in the women’s road race through Lizzie Armitstead but the Yorkshirewoman has not travelled, nor has new mum Laura Kenny. England’s men’s track team is headed by Olympic champion Philip Hindes, while Team Scotland are led by Katie Archibald, whose brother John has also been selected. International Australian cyclists have been keeping their powder dry to race on home soil, looking to exceed the seven golds, out of a possible 13, they won on the track in Glasgow. Athletics Home nations Katarina Johnson-Thompson arrives fresh from becoming world indoor pentathlon champion and is favourite to win heptathlon gold, with Olympic champion Nafi Thiam of Belgium ineligible. Johnson-Thompson’s boyfriend Andrew Pozzi was also crowned world indoor champion in the 60m hurdles and is among the favourites to win over the 110m hurdles. Dina Asher‑Smith, Adam Gemili and Zharnel Hughes take on the might of Jamaica’s sprinters and all look in good early season form. International Sally Pearson is likely to get the biggest cheer of the week at the athletics venue, just 10 minutes drive from her house but is struggling to overcome an achilles injury. South Africa’s Caster Semenya is making her Games debut but is expected to do the 800m and 1500m double in Australia. She missed 2010 because of legal wranglings over her eligibility to compete. Swimming Home nations Adam Peaty is arguably England’s strongest gold medal hope in any sport, the biggest unknown being how quick he will go in the 100m breaststroke and whether he will attempt to break his world record. International England versus Australia in the pool is being billed as an Ashes rematch. The home team have the advantage of being familiar with the outdoor conditions of the Optic Aquatics Centre. Cate Campbell, who suffered a meltdown at the Rio Olympics and is seeking to put things right, is leading the female challenge. South Africa’s Chad Le Clos won six medals at the Games four years ago and will seek to defend his 100m and 200m butterfly titles. Boxing Home nations Twins Pat and Luke McCormack are part of the 12-strong England team and both have strong medal claims. England won five of 13 medals on offer in Glasgow and super heavyweight Frazer Clarke claims the team were inspired by the recent title fight victory of his occasional hitting partner Anthony Joshua. International Australia’s Taylah Robertson secured the first medal of the Games before they even began. She is guaranteed at least a bronze in the women’s 51-kg division after receiving a bye to the semis. Only seven boxers are competing in the category and both losing semi-finalists receive bronzes. But she is expected to fight for gold. Squash Home nations Despite years of campaigning, squash is yet to convince it is deserving of a spot in the Olympics, meaning these Games remain a key competition. England’s Nick Matthews is bidding for a third straight Commonwealth title but may have to overcome his compatriot and another former world No 1, James Willstrop. England’s Laura Massaro is also top seed. International Eight-times world champion and two-times Commonwealth champion Nicol David of Malaysia will be aiming to upset Massaro. Gymnastics Home nations Max Whitlock will be disappointed if he does not manage to retain his beam, pommel and floor titles. England’s women have been blighted by injury withdrawals with Claudia Fragapane, Ellie Downie and Amy Tinkler all absent, meaning 15-year-old Taeja James, Team England’s youngest member, received a late call. International There is very little strength in depth in Commonwealth gymnastics beyond the home nations. Only one male, non-British athlete from a Commonwealth nation – Canada’s Zachary Clay – made a final at last year’s world championships in Montreal, where he finished 21st in the all-around competition. The women fare slightly better with Canada’s Ellie Black having won a world medal. Diving Home nations Olympic champions Chris Mears and Jack Laugher will consider anything less than gold a disappointment as will poster boy Tom Daley. Team Scotland’s Grace Reid made her Commonwealth debut as a 13-year-old in Delhi in 2010 but at 21 is being jokingly called Grandma Grace. International Australian diver Taneka Kovchenko was forced to retire days before the start of the Games for health reasons with a decision yet to be made on who will partner Melissa Wu in the 10m synchronised event. Netball Home nations Team England arrive after some of the best results in their history and will be aiming to upset the Antipodean stranglehold. International Australia versus New Zealand is one of the most fierce rivalries in world sport with their matches at the Gold Coast Convention Centre sold out. Weightlifting Home nations Zoe Smith was forced to work in a cafe to fund training after a devastating shoulder injury and is on the comeback trail aiming to add to her three Commonwealth medals in the 58kg division. International Much of the focus will be on New Zealand’s transgender Laurel Hubbard (formerly Gavin), whose presence in the 90kg-plus division has been controversial. Table tennis Home nations Anna Hursey is an 11-year-old prodigy competing for Wales, while veteran Paul Drinkhall leads the English challenge. International Singapore is the powerhouse of Commonwealth table tennis, having won 44 medals at the last four Games. Basketball Home nations Both England’s men’s and women’s teams have chances of winning medals. International First included in the 2006 Melbourne Games, this time round Australia and New Zealand are likely to battle for gold with the home nation favourites. Beach volleyball Home nations England train in a chilly Dorset shed but 6ft 9in Chris Gregory and his partner Jake Sheaf are No 3 seeds for the inaugural Commonwealth tournament. International Beach volleyball is a new addition in favour of judo which was dropped after the Glasgow Games. It will be held on Coolangatta beach. Australia’s women’s duo Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar hope a home crowd can spur them to victory. Rugby sevens Home nations England’s squad includes seven members of Team GB, who picked up silver medals at the Rio Olympics. International Fiji’s win over Britain in the men’s sevens final at Rio 2016 means the Pacific Islanders come into the Games as favourites, but will face stiff competition from South Africa, England and New Zealand among others. Shooting Home nations Northern Ireland’s David Calvert competes in a record-extending 11th Games, seeking a fifth gold. International Australia’s Laetisha Scanlan is reigning champion and begins the her defence of her title on her 28th birthday. Lawn bowls Home nations England, Wales and Northern Ireland historically dominate but could be thrown by heavy rain, which will slow down the greens. International Carmelita Anderson, a 62-year-old from the Norfolk Islands nicknamed the Tiger Shark, will return for her fourth Games, 24 years after claiming the territory’s first and only medal with bronze in Victoria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/04/youtube-shooting-suspect-content-creator-censorship","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T22:32:17Z","webTitle":"YouTube shooting: apparent motive highlights tension with video 'creators'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/youtube-shooting-suspect-content-creator-censorship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/04/youtube-shooting-suspect-content-creator-censorship","fields":{"headline":"YouTube shooting: apparent motive highlights tension with video 'creators'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The apparent motive in Tuesday’s shooting at YouTube’s headquarters is shining a light on the video-sharing platform’s complicated relationship with its most dedicated users – so-called “creators” who earn a share of the advertising revenue for their videos. Nasim Najafi Aghdam travelled to the company’s Silicon Valley campus and opened fire, shooting three people before killing herself, because she was “upset with the policies and practices of YouTube,” police said Wednesday. Aghdam’s precise motivation for opening fire on innocent people will likely never be known. Information about her life and background is still scant beyond her social media presence. But a website that appears to have been maintained by Aghdam presents a portrait of a frustrated YouTube creator. She apparently maintained multiple YouTube channels, and screenshots of analytics suggest that her viewership had decreased over the course of 2016. One screenshot published on the site shows that one of Aghdam’s channels had been deemed ineligible for “monetization” – the practice whereby YouTube runs ads on user-generated content and shares a portion with creators. “There is no equal growth opportunity on YOUTUBE or any other video sharing site, your channel will grow if they want to!!!!!” the site reads, in a section that includes a quote from Adolf Hitler. “There is no free speech in real world &amp; you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system.” Older versions of the site, retrieved via the Internet Archive, include complaints that YouTube was censoring vegan activism and Google was suppressing search traffic to the website. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Creators who rely on the company for income but are not actually employed by YouTube have long complained about the company’s lack of transparency and unilateral changes to standards for advertiser-friendly content. The company faced backlash in 2016 when a number of high-profile YouTubers received emails notifying them that some of their videos had been demonetized. The company subsequently explained that it had been removing advertisements from some videos for years, but had decided to start notifying creators when a video was deemed not to be advertiser friendly. In January, the company – which has faced significant pressure from advertisers, the media and users to crack down on extremist content, misinformation and conspiracy mongering – announced new policies that restricted which channels can be monetized. The change required channels to have 1,000 subscribers and at least 4,000 hours of watch time on their videos over the past 12 months to be eligible for advertising revenue. The company also ramped up its efforts to police content by, among other things, hiring more moderators. The changes have fueled complaints of censorship from across the political spectrum. Backlash to perceived censorship by YouTube and other social media platforms has been particularly strong on the right, where the firing of the Google engineer James Damore over a controversial memo about gender prompted the establishment of a “free speech tech revolution” aimed at building alternative platforms free from Silicon Valley’s “SJW cultural marxist lunacy”. The most popular of the rightwing “alt-tech” sites is Gab, a Twitter-like platform where the most popular posts about the shooting include memes glorifying Aghdam. “Censorship kills,” wrote Andrew Torba, the chief executive of Gab, in a post Wednesday. “When you silence someone’s means of expression in the form of words, art, and other non-violent ways; many will inevitably become violent. More speech and more free expression are always the answer and preferred.” In October, the conservative YouTube channel PragerU filed a lawsuit against the platform alleging that its demonetization of certain videos – and age-restrictions of others – amounted to censorship of conservative views. A judge dismissed the suit in March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/04/adam-gemili-commonwealth-gold-100m","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T21:00:29Z","webTitle":"Adam Gemili out to break solo duck and bag Commonwealth Games 100m gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/04/adam-gemili-commonwealth-gold-100m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/04/adam-gemili-commonwealth-gold-100m","fields":{"headline":"Adam Gemili out to break solo duck and bag Commonwealth Games 100m gold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Adam Gemili enjoyed winning relay gold in what was one of the most thrilling races at last year’s London world championships but he is more interested in individual honours at the Commonwealth Games. Gemili was angry after being overlooked for a place in the 200m at London 2017 after he claims he was forced to contest the British trials despite asking for more time to recover from a hamstring injury. He still played a key part in the relay success, however, running a blistering second leg as they inflicted a surprise defeat on the USA and Jamaica, in Usain Bolt’s final race. But Gemili, who on Sunday and Monday will compete in the 100m against Jamaica’s former world champion Yohan Blake among others, is keen to establish himself as a champion in his own right. “After what happened last year it’s massively important to put down a marker,” the 24-year-old London-born sprinter said. “I’ve done OK individually in my career so far and last year was the first year I failed to do that. It was a tough time for me. “People know me as an individual athlete performing on a big stage. Obviously winning the relay last year was fantastic but the relay is a bonus and athletes should always be looking to compete as an individual first. “As soon as I knew I wasn’t running the 200m in London I made my peace with it and just tried to concentrate on running the relay. But I believe I’ve got myself into good shape this year and hopefully I can bounce back, challenge these guys and get myself in a medal position.” Winning silver in the 100m at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games four years ago is still considered as one of his best career achievements but Gemili is aiming for gold in Australia, which would be a first senior global title individually. “I’m not a young athlete any more. I’m not coming into championships to make up the numbers or fill the lanes. I’m here to win,” he said. “As a junior you go to championships and, if you do well, it’s a bonus. You never really expect that but as a senior athlete and someone who has now been to a lot of major championships I do feel like an elder statesman in the team – especially as the Commonwealth Games team is very young. I’m making sacrifices every day. I don’t do that just to fill a lane and make someone else look good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/04/mackintoshs-escape-to-floral-walberswick","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T17:37:45Z","webTitle":"Mackintosh’s escape to floral Walberswick | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/04/mackintoshs-escape-to-floral-walberswick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/04/mackintoshs-escape-to-floral-walberswick","fields":{"headline":"Mackintosh’s escape to floral Walberswick","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Will Self (Made in Walberswick, Review, 31 March) would surely feel some affinity with Charles Rennie Mackintosh who, disillusioned with architecture and struggling with alcoholism, hid away in Walberswick, where, in 1914, he turned to watercolour painting.

Since Trump became president, the Post and the New York Times have engaged in a thrilling, old-fashioned newspaper war, with each trading off, day after day, with deeply reported stories and scoops that hold the Trump administration to account. The Post has been relentless in investigating the Trump administration’s abuse of power and the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Bezos isn’t known for ideological fervor or partisanship. He gave donations to support gay marriage in his home state, the other Washington, but hasn’t had a high political profile. Since the 2016 campaign, when Trump began attacking him on Twitter, Bezos has displayed restraint. Despite the escalating bitterness of Trump’s tweets about him, Bezos has avoided being positioned as Trump’s nemesis. To maintain its newly recaptured global credibility, the Post can’t be seen as the opposition party. Of all of Trump’s attacks on Bezos, the most poisonous lie is that he uses the Post to lobby for Amazon. When Bezos bought the paper, he did so with personal funds, to keep the newspaper’s interests and mission completely separate from Amazon’s. The Grahams would not have found him a fit owner if they thought Bezos wanted to use the Post to wield influence. According to the many journalists who work there, Bezos has had a light touch as owner, focusing on areas in which he can make a difference, such as improving the paper’s technology. He has entrusted the running of the paper to Marty Baron, hired by the former publisher Katharine Weymouth, whose contributions to safeguarding her inheritance have been insufficiently credited and appreciated. If newspapers were originally foreign to Bezos, the Post’s special place in the history of American journalism has come to have great meaning for him, according to several close associates. In 2017, he purchased an antique clothes wringer, which is now displayed in a conference room at the Post’s downtown Washington DC headquarters that is dedicated to the Graham family. The significance of the wringer is known by any student of Watergate. Furious over the Post’s coverage of Richard Nixon’s criminal cover-up, the then attorney general, John Mitchell, threatened that “Katie Graham’s gonna get caught in a big fat wringer” if the Post continued publishing its Watergate stories. For years, Katharine Graham proudly wore a charm of a wringer on a necklace as the golden symbol of her defiance. Graham risked financial ruin by standing up to Nixon. Bezos, too, has much at risk. After a week of attacks from the president, Amazon saw its stock price drop sharply (though it later recovered somewhat). Bezos’s stratospheric net worth also took a hit. There is real reason to fear that Trump can win his war against the press. He has significant allies, including Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire and Sinclair Broadcasting, which controls local television stations across the country and is seeking to acquire more through a planned purchase of the Tribune Company. Fox and Sinclair are conservative propaganda machines, eager to amplify Trump’s lies and support him at the barricades. The chorus of Sinclair newscasters spouting the same, Trump-inspired attacks on reputable news providers as “fake news” was nothing short of chilling. A recent poll showed that a majority of Americans agree with the president’s rants about “fake news”, More than three in four among 803 American respondents, or 77%, said they believed major traditional television and newspaper media outlets report “fake news”, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday. It is the hour for Americans to stand up for the first amendment and to stand against the Foxes and Sinclairs. They should also stand with the Washington Post. The president has very real legal, regulatory and spending tools at his disposal to retaliate against Bezos and Amazon for the Post’s unflinching coverage. On the radical end of the spectrum, there are antitrust laws to unfurl to break up the tech retail giant, which Trump says is wiping out Mom-and-Pop stores across America. There are regulatory tools, including demanding stricter privacy rules. There are billions in government contracts for cloud computing that could disappear. Amazon is no angel, but Trump’s urge to punish it is for all the wrong reasons, triggered by his churlishness over the Post’s coverage of him and his administration. All of this could create a confrontation with the potential to be every bit as dramatic as Graham’s clashes with Nixon in the 70s. But as was true then, the president may end up being on the losing end of a White House war against the press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/04/trump-china-trade-war-concerns-import-taxes-stock-market","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T20:04:06Z","webTitle":"Trump plays down US-China trade war concerns: ‘When you’re $500bn down you can’t lose’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/trump-china-trade-war-concerns-import-taxes-stock-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/04/trump-china-trade-war-concerns-import-taxes-stock-market","fields":{"headline":"Trump plays down US-China trade war concerns: ‘When you’re $500bn down you can’t lose’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fears that Donald Trump is embroiling America in a global trade war intensified on Wednesday after China imposed tit-for-tat import taxes on the US and stock markets plunged. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped and then rallied after markets fell in Europe and Asia on worries of an intensifying trade conflict between the world’s two biggest economies – the latest example of Trump taking his appetite for disruption to the global stage. After Washington unveiled plans to impose tariffs on $50bn in Chinese imports Tuesday, China hit back with plans to tax a matching $50bn of US products, including beef, cars, planes, soybeans and whiskey. The US president has worn stock market success as a badge of honour and proof that, despite myriad controversies, the economy is booming under his presidency. But there are concerns that his aggressive tariffs and “America first” instincts could undermine confidence and cause a slowdown. Trump claimed last month that “trade wars are good, and easy to win”. China is the biggest market for US soy. The American Soybean Association, a lobbying group representing 21,000 producers, warned that China’s proposed 25% tariff on soybeans would be “devastating” to American farmers. It estimated that farmers lost an estimated $1.72bn on Wednesday morning alone as soybean futures tumbled. John Heisdorffer, an Iowa farmer and the president of the association, said: “That’s real money lost for farmers, and it is entirely preventable.” He called on the White House to scrap its proposed tariffs. The car makers Ford and General Motors also issued statements calling for continued dialogue to resolve the escalating trade tensions. On Wednesday, Trump moved to play down concerns over a damaging trade war. He protested on Twitter: “We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!” The president added: “When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can’t lose!” The US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, also urged calm. In an interview with CNBC, Ross said the tariffs announced by China amounted to a mere 0.3% of America’s gross domestic product. “So it’s hardly a life-threatening activity,” he said. Ross added that some US punitive action against Beijing has been “coming for a while” over China’s predatory behaviour involving technology. “What we’re talking about on both sides is a fraction of 1% of both economies,” Ross said. The tariffs will not take effect immediately. The US government is inviting public comment on its trade sanctions through 11 May and will hold a hearing on the plan on 15 May. China set no date for its 25% duties to take effect, saying it was waiting to see what Trump did. Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, the spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: “We’re going through the review period – we’re very lucky that we have the best negotiator at the table in the president.” She added: “China created this problem, not President Trump” and insisted: “We may have a little bit of short-term pain, but we’re going to have long-term success.” The departure of Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker and so-called “globalist”, as Trump’s top economic adviser, and the appointment of Larry Kudlow as his successor, has been interpreted by analysts as indicating a shift towards protectionist policies. Asked whether the US tariffs against China were a negotiating ploy, Kudlow told reporters: “Potentially. It’s part of the process. I would take the president seriously on this tariff issue. There are carrots and sticks in life ... Both sides benefit by positive solutions that lower barriers.” Kudlow said China should take Trump “seriously” on tariffs but that ultimately the president was a “free-trader”. He added: “Sometimes the path to this kind of growth is a little rocky. That’s the way the world works.” China ran a $375bn goods trade surplus with the US in 2017. Trump has demanded that the China cut the trade gap by $100bn. Beijing said it has made a “request for consultations” at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in response to the US tariffs, triggering that body’s dispute settlement mechanism. Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing that China’s door to dialogue with Washington remained open “but the US has missed the opportunity time and time again”. He said talks between the two countries required “mutual respect and equal treatment, instead of being coerced by one party unilaterally and condescendingly”. Economists have expressed concern that global economic activity might stall if other governments are prompted to raise their own import barriers. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told the Associated Press: “US companies at this point would like to see robust communication between the US government and the Chinese government and serious negotiation on both sides, hopefully to avoid a trade war. I can only hope that we solve our differences as soon as possible to avoid damage to the US economy, Chinese economy and to US companies.” Trump’s praise of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and his claim that they have a close personal relationship have not prevented the threat of tariffs. Similarly, Trump continues to say he will try to “get along” with Russian president Vladimir Putin even as relations between the two governments sour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/04/go-conquer-and-injured-as-de-mee-will-miss-grand-national","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T17:08:15Z","webTitle":"Grand National: Go Conquer and the injured As De Mee miss out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/04/go-conquer-and-injured-as-de-mee-will-miss-grand-national","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/04/go-conquer-and-injured-as-de-mee-will-miss-grand-national","fields":{"headline":"Grand National: Go Conquer and the injured As De Mee miss out","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two more slots have opened up in the field for the Grand National on 14 April with the withdrawal of Go Conquer and As De Mee. Go Conquer will be directed instead towards the Topham Chase while As De Mee is out for the rest of the season with a minor leg injury, depriving the Oscar-winning actress Judi Dench of the chance to own a National runner. The Rooney family, owners of Go Conquer, also have Beeves and The Last Samuri in the National and have therefore decided against asking Go Conquer to stretch out his stamina to four miles. His trainer, Jonjo O’Neill, confirmed the horse will once more tackle the Topham, in which his chance was ended by interference at the Canal Turn a year ago. O’Neill will content himself with a single National runner, Minella Rocco, who skipped the Cheltenham Gold Cup because of testing ground. “He’s in grand old form,” O’Neill said. “He didn’t run at Cheltenham, so he’s fresh and well. If he gets into a nice rhythm and everything goes according to plan for him for the first circuit, you’d be getting excited with him.” Six of the top 40 horses in the National field have been ruled out by connections and, provided there are no sudden changes of heart, that should mean Milansbar and Final Nudge will secure places in the race. Milansbar is to be schooled over Aintree-style fences in Lambourn on Thursday by his jockey, Bryony Frost. Final Nudge’s jockey has yet to be determined but it may very well end up being Aidan Coleman, who is owed a change of luck in the National. Coleman rode David Dennis’s horse to be third in the Welsh National and better ground might show Final Nudge in a still better light. Paul Nicholls said Vicente may still take his chance in the National if the ground dries up. If it looks as if the ground will be soft, the horse will skip Aintree in favour of the following week’s Scottish National. Charlie Longsdon’s Pendra is still being aimed at the National but it would be no surprise if connections opted to save him for Sandown’s Bet365 Chase at the end of the month, since he would be 5lb better off in the weights there. A healthy Irish contingent is expected for the National, as Valseur Lido, Alpha Des Obeaux, Tiger Roll and A Genie In Abottle are all expected to carry Michael O’Leary’s colours in the race he won two years ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/09/has-hollywood-warped-relationship-gaming","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T09:00:55Z","webTitle":"Video lame: has Hollywood’s warped relationship with gaming gone too far?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/09/has-hollywood-warped-relationship-gaming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/09/has-hollywood-warped-relationship-gaming","fields":{"headline":"Video lame: has Hollywood’s warped relationship with gaming gone too far?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As recent efforts – Tomb Raider, Assassin’s Creed, Warcraft – continue to show, video games rarely make great movies. If ever. Dwayne Johnson’s new epic Rampage might change all this, just as giant, genetically modified wolves might fly, but the source material was hardly that compelling to start with, partly because it was already a mish-mash of movie tropes. In the original Rampage arcade game, you could be King Kong, Godzilla or a werewolf and you basically had to re-enact a city-trashing scene out of a monster movie. Now, see the movie of the game of the movie! To turn it around, however, games already have taken over the movies. Look at Johnson’s last mega-hit, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It wasn’t based on an existing game(nor was it a feature-length Guns N’ Roses song, which was a disappointment to some), but Jumanji did involve characters being sucked into a video game world, for all manner of entertaining body-swap action-adventure. One of the reasons Jumanji worked so well was because it was structured like a game. The set-up was crystal-clear: to get back home, the characters had to go through various levels, collect clues and Get the Thing (in this case, the “Jaguar’s eye”). Furthermore, the characters had their avatar’s skills and three lives each. As a movie targeted at younger viewers, it worked a treat. You knew who the characters were, where they were going and what they had to do to “win”. So many family movies forget this – A Wrinkle in Time, for instance. When you look more closely, a lot of movies are essentially gamified stories like Jumanji. Spielberg’s Ready Player One, for example, is also a video game quest: win the challenges, get the three keys, follow the clues, Get the Thing, win the game. Even when you consider the forthcoming Avengers: Infinity War, the plot is basically a video game prologue: supervillain Thanos is trying to collect six infinity stones to activate his all-powerful Infinity Gauntlet – can you stop him? Choose your character! Let’s not forget that using games, tournaments and competitions as narrative devices goes all the way back to that ancient Greek action role-player The 12 Levels of Hercules. Even the most serious and high-minded of film-makers have not been above a little game action, most memorably Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, where Max von Sydow defers his big “game over” by challenging Death to a chess match. Admittedly, Bill and Ted’s parody deflated the seriousness somewhat: they realised that if you need to beat Death, the game to choose is Twister. But all these movies seemed to recognise what the makers of Rampage and co didn’t: if you want to make a decent game movie, start with the movie not the game. Rampage is in UK cinemas from 12 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/05/iea-accused-of-undermining-global-shift-from-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T09:43:18Z","webTitle":"IEA accused of undermining global shift from fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/iea-accused-of-undermining-global-shift-from-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/05/iea-accused-of-undermining-global-shift-from-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"IEA accused of undermining global shift from fossil fuels","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The global shift from fossil fuels to renewables is being undermined by the very organisation that ought to be leading the charge, according to a scathing new critique of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Governments across the world rely on IEA projections to set energy policies, but the agency’s figures – which are influenced by the oil industry – are pushing them off track to reach the targets of the Paris climate agreement, says the report. The study, released on Thursday by research and advocacy NGO Oil Change International, claims the agency’s investment projections remain massively skewed towards oil and gas, effectively encouraging governments to overshoot emissions targets and worsen climate damage. In its annual World Energy Outlook, the IEA provides a series of possible scenarios, each of which is dependent on the decisions taken by governments. Oil Change International says all of them would break the Paris targets to keep global temperature rises to well below 2C, or ideally 1.5C, by the end of the century. Under the most prominent and widely used of the IEA’s pathways – the “new policy scenario” – the world’s carbon budget for 1.5C would be exhausted by 2022, and for 2C by 2034, the report calculates. Even its most ambitious outlook – the “sustainable development scenario” – would bust the 2C budget by 2040, even though it assumes the deployment of as yet untried to extract carbon emissions from the atmosphere, it says. “The IEA provides an energy roadmap that is supposed to lead us to safety, but in fact it takes us over the cliff,” says Greg Muttitt, research director at Oil Change International. “Any government or financial institution that uses these scenarios as a basis for investments in oil and gas is getting seriously bad information. It’s shocking how far off the Paris agreement they are.” In a statement to the Guardian, the IEA said any suggestion its sustainable development scenario was unaligned with the Paris goals was incorrect because it envisaged a peaking of emissions before 2020, followed by a sharp decline. It said its new policies scenario was intended only as a reference that showed current and announced policies are “far from enough to avoid severe impacts of climate change” and will very quickly use up the global carbon budget. The IEA noted it has also outlined a “faster transition scenario” that illustrates how the Paris goals can be met using existing technologies. This will be updated in April. The Paris-based IEA was established in 1974 in the wake of an oil crisis with the goal of ensuring “reliable, affordable and clean energy” for its 30 members – states in the rich-nations club of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. More recently, it has tried to widen its focus to renewables and to encourage participation by emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil, which are now associate members. Oil Change International says, however, this key organisation remains closely wedded to the fossil fuel industry, pointing out that two of the authors of the most recent World Energy Outlook were on secondment – and receiving salaries – from Shell. It says the IEA also continues to put the interests of wealthy nations first because its forecast for 2040 suggests India would cut emissions by 46% while the European Union would trim by only 40% – in an apparent contradiction of the climate negotiation principle that rich nations should bear the bulk of the responsibility because they have contributed most of carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere. Muttitt said the IEA needed to catch up with changing priorities and to follow the example set by the World Bank, which in December announced it would cease upstream investment in oil and gas by 2019 in response to the threat posed by climate change. A spokesperson for the IEA said it was not beholden to any industry, that the two dozen authors – and several hundred reviewers – of the World Energy Outlook came from a wide range of fields and that the agency’s work benefits from input from governments, NGOs and a wide range of industries, including renewable companies. It also noted the most recent ministerial meeting backed a modernisation strategy to turn the IEA into a “global clean energy hub”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/05/chappaquiddick-film-ted-kennedy-mary-jo-kopechne","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:00:46Z","webTitle":"Chappaquiddick: the film that relives a damning moment for the Kennedys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/05/chappaquiddick-film-ted-kennedy-mary-jo-kopechne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/05/chappaquiddick-film-ted-kennedy-mary-jo-kopechne","fields":{"headline":"Chappaquiddick: the film that relives a damning moment for the Kennedys","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A powerful man with sights on the White House behaves atrociously, even criminally. He uses fixers and lawyers and his own charisma to contain the damage and spin the narrative. It works. People shrug off the scandal and vote for him. No, not Donald Trump, and not the Republicans. This was Edward Kennedy, the voters were Democrats and the scandal was called Chappaquiddick, after the island in Massachusetts where the young senator drove off a bridge one July night in 1969. His Oldsmobile flipped upside down into a pond. Kennedy swam to safety. His passenger, a 28-year-old aide named Mary Jo Kopechne, died inside the water-filled car. Kennedy did not seek help at the nearest house nor report the incident to authorities for 10 hours. The accident and its aftermath are the subject of a new film, Chappaquiddick, which revisits a dark corner of the Kennedy legacy many liberals would prefer to forget. The scandal wrecked the dream of Teddy becoming president, of carrying the mantle of his assassinated brothers, Jack and Robert, into the Oval Office. But the voters of Massachusetts forgave him, re-electing him to the Senate until his death in 2009, and the Democratic party establishment forgave him, anointing him conscience of the left, Lion of the Senate. The Kennedys are once again holding America in thrall. A new six-part CNN series, American Dynasties: The Kennedys, has topped cable ratings. A Netflix documentary about the 50th anniversary of Robert’s 1968 presidential run will unleash fresh nostalgia later this month. However Chappaquiddick, directed by John Curran and written by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, focuses not on glamour, martyrdom or Camelot mystique but a tawdry, boozy weekend gone tragically wrong. The screenplay, mixing historical detail and dramatic licence, holds up a harsh mirror to the youngest Kennedy brother, played by Jason Clarke, portraying a reckless, privileged princeling with a shaky moral core who pulled strings to escape jail. It ends with archive television news footage of voters largely exculpating him after the inquest in 1970. “The guy’s a good guy. I’m in favour of him,” says one young man. “There’s more to it than what we know but I actually would vote for him,” says a middle-aged woman. They were speaking long before Facebook information bubbles, hyper-polarisation and Trump’s boast as a presidential candidate that he could shoot someone and not lose votes. “In terms of blind loyalty to ‘my guy’ there is some level of similarity in the sense that there is a base of supporters who will follow Trump no matter what he does wrong,” said Thomas Maier, author of two books on the Kennedys. Trump’s supporters would point out that his transgressions – such as bragging about sexual assault – don’t include a dead body. Maier, for his part, points out that Kennedy’s behaviour on the fateful night should be put in context of a man who served the nation as a skilled, diligent legislator and was grieving for his murdered brothers when he made a terrible mistake. “Not to excuse it but when people go through such horrific things they resort to alcoholism and other things they may not otherwise have done. And there was a lot of fidelity to the Kennedys because they had broken through barriers.” The senator was 37 and eyeing a 1972 White House run when he went to Martha’s Vineyard for a sailing regatta and to party with male friends and the so-called “boiler room girls” – young women who worked on Kennedy campaigns. He left a party some time before midnight with Kopechne, took a wrong turn down a dirt track, drove off a small wooden bridge and flipped the car into Poucha Pond. Some details remain murky, prompting conspiracy theories about murder plots, but the widely held view is that Kennedy was drinking and panicked. At the inquest Kennedy said after escaping the car he called Kopechne’s name several times from the shore and tried to swim down to free her seven or eight times. He walked back to the party house – past other homes which he may or may not have seen – and with two friends returned to the submerged car and made fresh, unsuccessful recovery efforts. Kennedy then went to his hotel and collapsed in bed. Fishermen alerted police to the vehicle the next morning around 8.20am. A diver swiftly extracted Kopechne’s body. Kennedy was by then at a ferry crossing pay phone making calls to friends and fixers. He did not report to police until 10am. John Farrar, the diver, told the inquest Kopechne may have survived for three to four hours, using an air bubble, before suffocating. Kennedy escaped potential charges of manslaughter, perjury and driving to endanger. He pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of a crash causing personal injury and received a two-month suspended jail sentence. The scandal killed his White House hopes – he didn’t run in 1972 or 1976 and failed in a 1980 bid for the nomination - but enjoyed 40 more years as a senator, revered and, in the eyes of many supporters, redeemed. At Chappaquiddick’s premiere in Los Angeles last month, Ed Helms, who plays Kennedy’s confidant Joe Gargan, drew parallels with Trump evading consequences of his behaviour. “What’s really unnerving about the way Trump doesn’t take responsibility for things is that [it’s] hard to hold him accountable for those things.” At the same event Byron Allen, the comedian-turned-entertainment mogul whose company is releasing the film, hinted that Kennedy allies still sought to dim scrutiny half a century after the tragedy. “Unfortunately, there are some very powerful people who tried to put pressure on me not to release this movie. They went out of their way to try and influence me in a negative way. I made it very clear that I’m not about the right, I’m not about the left. I’m about the truth.” Chappaquiddick is released in US cinemas on 6 April with a UK date yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/05/which-names-250-fridges-and-freezers-that-pose-fire-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T05:01:39Z","webTitle":"Which? names 250 fridges and freezers that pose fire risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/05/which-names-250-fridges-and-freezers-that-pose-fire-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/05/which-names-250-fridges-and-freezers-that-pose-fire-risk","fields":{"headline":"Which? names 250 fridges and freezers that pose fire risk","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The consumer body Which? has described 250 of the most popular fridges and freezers on sale in the UK as “potentially unsafe”, adding that they could be putting lives at risk. The organisation demanded that retailers immediately stop selling the models it had identified after an investigation showed that the backing material on almost half of all the fridges, freezers and fridge-freezers tested was made of an unsafe plastic that posed a fire risk. Its list of the 250 “don’t buy” models includes appliances made by most if not all of the leading manufacturers, including AEG, Kenwood, Hotpoint, Smeg, Candy, Hotpoint, Zanussi, Indesit, Whirlpool, Hoover, Bush and Ikea. The Which? warning comes after the London fire brigade (LFB) said that even though there was on average one fridge or freezer fire a week in the capital, it believed most manufacturers were still dragging their heels on making fire safety improvements. The LFB said doors and side panels of most fridges and freezers were usually covered in metal but many still used a flammable plastic backing which offered very little protection against the highly flammable foam insulation contained within the appliance catching alight if a fire started. Which? said the industry-wide investigation – the largest of its kind in the UK – looked at more than 500 of the most popular products on the market, and said it was releasing its findings now because of “a lack of government action”. The organisation said it accepted that fires due to refrigeration faults were rare, with its own research showing that fridge-freezers, fridges or freezers were to blame in only 8% of fires caused by faulty appliances. It also said the plastic backing material did not in itself cause fires but rather accelerated them, which was why it was not demanding a product recall but for retailers to immediately stop selling these products. Asked whether a homeowner who had one of its “don’t buys” should unplug it, a spokeswoman said: “You can’t really do that with a fridge-freezer – it will ruin your food.” She said the advice to people who had such an appliance was “not to panic – the risk is low”. UK safety rules require refrigeration appliances to pass a glow wire test to assess their fire resistance. This involves putting a hot wire through a sample of the fridge or freezer backing material and seeing whether it catches alight. However, when conducting more stringent tests, Which? found that no plastic backing sample was able to withstand a flame for 30 seconds, indicating that, in the event of a fire, it would not sufficiently prevent the flame from reaching the flammable insulation inside. In similar testing of metal and aluminium laminate backed refrigeration products, none caught alight after the 30 seconds test. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: “Manufacturers selling white goods in the UK must meet some of the strictest safety laws in the world and we are working with Which? and other parties to see whether standards can be made even more stringent.” • Consumers can use Which?’s new tool to check the backing material of hundreds of the most popular fridges, freezers and fridge-freezers currently on the market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/20/faffing-stops-me-being-successful-im-sure-of-it-or-am-i","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T13:00:23Z","webTitle":"Faffing stops me being successful.

I dread to think what could have been achieved instead of the wasted minutes I spend at my sock drawer each morning, wondering if the two very similar black socks I’m holding are the original pair (“this one looks a little longer, I’m sure I can find the other one in here somewhere…”). Or at a bar when the hurried server asks me what I want to drink and I look at them blankly (“umm…”) despite having already been there for five minutes. The look of disdain on their face! But faff does not a successful adult make. I’m sure Barack Obama, during his daily briefings, did not say, “I’ll just check that on the internet” and then 15 minutes later find himself on the Wikipedia page of Saved By The Bell, Googling actors to find out where they are now. Truly the internet faff is the most sinister of them all. This pervasive productivity-stealer integrates seamlessly into your life and has wrought havoc on mine. My partner and I are already Lord and Lady of the Faff; throw Google into the mix and our life is brought to a standstill. Take choosing what to have for dinner: “What do you want for dinner?” “I don’t mind, what do you want?” “I don’t mind either. What do we have in?” “Eggs, carrots, chicken…” “I’ll have a look online for a recipe.” “I will too.” [Two hours later.] “I think we’ve left it too late to cook now.” Yum, another sandwich for dinner. It happens time and time again. “What shall we do this evening?” “Is there a good film on at the cinema?” “I’ll check the listings.” “I’ll check the reviews.” [Two hours later.] “We’ve missed everything in the cinema.” If I start to add up all the time wasted dithering and dilly-dallying, I am sure I’ll be in for a heartstopping surprise. So I’m going to organise my life. I’m going to plan everything well in advance, even simple things, and give myself time limits on how long I have to make the decision. And I’m going to wean myself off my mobile phone, though I need to figure out how exactly. I’ll just check that on the internet..."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/11/the-art-of-war-the-artist-who-sketches-under-cover-at-arms-fairs","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"The art of war: the artist who sketches under cover at arms fairs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/11/the-art-of-war-the-artist-who-sketches-under-cover-at-arms-fairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/11/the-art-of-war-the-artist-who-sketches-under-cover-at-arms-fairs","fields":{"headline":"The art of war: the artist who sketches under cover at arms fairs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Among the sea of pinstripes at international arms fairs, Jill Gibbon doesn’t stand out. In her dark skirt suit, cream silk blouse, glasses and pearls, she looks every bit the global security expert she claims to be on the accreditation form. Yet she is not at the expo to broker a deal, but to secretly draw those making them. Armed with a discreet notebook and pen, Gibbon aims to penetrate the “veneer of respectability” she says cloaks such events, revealing the vulnerabilities of those who make a living selling weapons of mass destruction. These include: the sales rep vomiting after starting on the champagne at 11am, the young woman in the tight dress bringing an incongruous glamour to a Scud missile stand, the string quartet serenading bomb-makers on the back of a military truck and the mannequins wearing gas masks. Gibbon has been sketching arms fairs since 2007, when she applied for a pass to DSEI, or Defence and Security Equipment International, which takes place every other year in London. She got in using her real name but gave her occupation as “war artist” and said she wanted to practise drawing military hardware. The trick worked for a few years until an unusually observant security guard noticed that she was sketching not tanks but arms dealers. She protested her innocence but he was having none of it. “If you’re a war artist why don’t you go to Iraq and draw?” he said, and escorted her to the exit. Unwilling to give up, she took the drastic measure of changing her name by deed poll to get back in. She also created a sham company and website to make her look legitimate. Her new fake identity was a passport to arms fairs all around the world until 2015, when her lanyard never arrived for DSEI. She tried to blag her way in, putting on her pearls and suit and playing the outraged businesswoman when she reached the front of the queue. Alas, her card had been marked. “The young lad looked me up on the computer and could barely keep a straight face as he told me my name had been associated with protest,” she says. It would be easier to slip in unnoticed if she were a man, she says with a sigh. “These events remain very, very male dominated and there tends to be this gender divide where the men are the ones doing business and the women are giving out champagne and free gifts.” Over the years she has amassed an impressive collection of arms-related freebies, including a trio of stress balls made up as tanks, bombs and grenades. All will be on display at an exhibition at Bradford’s Peace Museum later this month, alongside the sketches she makes in pocket-sized concertina notebooks, which open out like a tableau. Gibbon is careful not to break the law. She makes sure not to draw certain people present in an identifiable way. “I’d have no qualms about drawing the chairman of BAE Systems because he’s undoubtedly complicit,” she says. “But I know that there are others who just end up there: agency workers, people working for [security company] G4S.” Anyway, she says, any fraud on her part is appropriate since arms fairs perpetrate their own double-dealing: “There’s the deception that it’s just an ordinary business, when really it involves selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, who use them to carry out war crimes in Yemen.” She has been involved in the peace movement since moving to Leeds as a student and became radicalised visiting Greenham Common, the 80s anti-nuclear peace camp run by women outside a cruise missile station in Berkshire. Last month she began a petition that successfully forced BAE Systems to pull out of a deal to sponsor the government-backed Great Exhibition of the North, a summer-long celebration of the north of England’s “pioneering spirit” taking place in Newcastle and Gateshead. The Commoners Choir, a singing group from Leeds, was one of the first acts to refuse to perform if the arms firm was involved, kicking off a domino effect that prompted pop star Nadine Shah and others to follow. “The first the Commoners Choir knew about the sponsors was when they were on the train back from Newcastle after the launch and found a BAE mug in their goodie bag,” she says. “Now they have agreed to play the opening night of my exhibition in Bradford.” Gibbon was outraged when Jake Berry, the government minister responsible for the northern powerhouse, called her and other protesters “subsidy-addicted artists” and “snowflakes”. She started another petition demanding an apology, which has been less successful. “I’ve never received any public subsidies for my art,” she insists. “The people that are subsidy-addicted are in the arms industry.” For the last five years Gibbon has been teaching at Leeds Beckett University, but earlier funded her artistic endeavours with cleaning jobs and cafe work. She hopes to continue going to arms fairs, which is why she asked for her face not to be identifiable in the Guardian’s photos. We agreed for certain biographical details not to be included in this article either: her age, her place of birth, where exactly she lives in a lovely stone semi with turquoise floorboards. But if she’s so keen on going incognito, why give an interview at all? “Because there’s no point doing it if I keep it hidden. I have got so much material now that it’s time to disseminate it.” The Etiquette of the Arms Trade: Ten Years Drawing in Arms Fairs by Jill Gibbon runs 13 April to 28 June at the Peace Museum, Bradford."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/04/what-does-the-belfast-trial-tell-women-make-a-complaint-and-youll-be-vilified","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T16:54:30Z","webTitle":"What does the Belfast rape trial tell women?

Make a complaint and you'll be vilified","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What can I wear on a night out to ensure I have a good time and no one will give me a hard time later? Charlotte, by email Tricky question, Charlotte! What we first have to decide is what you mean by “night out”, “good” and even “I”, come to that. Apologies for the linguistic nitpicking, but these are the kinds of issues you really need to lock down, should your night out end, shall we say, badly. Last week, women got a reminder that if they say they were assaulted on a night out, they will almost certainly be blamed, from what they wore to the text messages they sent. This time, the reminder came courtesy of what the media have dubbed the Belfast rape trial, in which Irish rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding were cleared of raping a 19-year-old woman, and two of their friends, Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison, were cleared of indecent exposure and perverting the course of justice, respectively. Perhaps some of you have heard about this trial, in which a young woman went out to celebrate the end of her exams and came home crying in the back of a minicab and with vaginal bleeding. Perhaps you heard about the WhatsApp messages sent between the young men afterwards, including: “There was a lot of spit roast last night” (Jackson); “It was like a merry go round at the carnival” (Olding); and “Love Belfast sluts” (McIlroy). Perhaps you heard about the messages the woman sent the next day, including: “What happened was not consensual” and “I’m not going to the police. I’m not going up against Ulster Rugby. Yea because that’ll work.” But perhaps you have not heard some of the extraordinary questions the woman was asked during the trial, because, as invariably happens with these stories, she was the one who seemed on trial. It’s weird how this only really happens with alleged victims of rape, isn’t it? Imagine if your laptop was taken and everyone knew who now had it, but all inquiries focused on why you bandy your laptop so freely, why you claim someone took it when everyone knows you gave it ever so willingly, and how dare you own a laptop anyway when obviously someone will take it and who could blame them? Anyway, I digress. Among the issues raised during the trial were, why did the woman talk about her feelings in the second person as opposed to the first person, with the suggestion that she was repeating something she had read rather than relaying her own experiences; what is meant by using terms such as LOL and HAHA in text messages and: “Why didn’t she scream the house down? A lot of very middle-class girls were downstairs. They were not going to tolerate rape or anything like that.” Yeah, unlike those working-class lassies, who love a bit of rape. They barely notice it, really, what with it being part of their peasanty culture and all. Really, you think a WhatsApp group between rugby players shows you the nadir of misogyny – until their legal team starts talking. And then, of course, there were her bloodstained clothes: why were they not bloodier? Why were there fake tan marks inside them? On and on it went. And we all know how it ended. The woman knew even before it began. So, in short, what women have learned from millennia of this is that, if they leave the house and things go badly for them, they will be blamed. Bleeding from the vagina? You should be bleeding more. Did you smile at him? You asked for it. Did you not smile at him? You hurt his feelings. Were your clothes sexy? You’re a slut. Were they frumpy? You’re a frigid bitch. Did you ever send jokey text messages to your friends? Then you’re an untrustworthy bubblehead. Did you go to the doctor straight away? That’s suspiciously efficient for a crime victim. Did you not go to the doctor? That’s because you’re lying. Did you tell the police everything? You were coached. Did you not tell the police everything? You’re lying. So it seems, Charlotte, the only thing you can safely wear when you leave the house is an invisibility cloak. And even then, you’ll still be at fault somehow.

This sounds like an exaggeration, but it’s not, and while I don’t have a scientific explanation I swear it is the case. The way I feel about earrings is the way some women feel about lipstick. One morning at the last Paris fashion week, I was up early to write so I left my earrings (brass, enormous) to one side, intending to put them on just before I set off for the first show. And then, of course, I was in a rush and ran out of the room, and was halfway to the Chloé show before I realised I was bare-lobed and when I did, I felt my blood run cold. I sat tugging my hair down over cheeks to hide that I wasn’t wearing earrings. Which sounds pretty bizarre, now I write it down. So I am both the best and the worst person to tell you about earrings. The best because there is not a lot I haven’t considered; the worst because I probably overthink them. Still, I am definitely not alone in earring obsession. They are one of modern life’s great talking points. When you tell a woman that you like her dress or her hair – especially in front of other people – she is likely to get flustered and bat the compliment awkwardly away. But an earring compliment is cordial, rather than either intimate or fawning, and therefore easier to receive in a gracious fashion. Also, it marks out the person asking as someone observant, who notices the detail, not just the dress. Plus, she probably bought her earrings somewhere that she wants to tell you about, whether it’s the perfect market stall by the harbour on a Greek island last year (to make you jealous) or Tu by Sainsbury’s. It’s all good. Jewellery is often about sentiment or status, but earrings right now are all about style and chat. In fashion a “conversational” print, on a blouse or a dress, is one with recognisable elements – a watermelon, a flamingo – and conversational earrings are the same. (My current favourites are ceramic lemons I bought in Sicily and cacti from Freedom at Topshop.) Abstract ones, which hang like little Mirós, are a little more aloof, less chatty: a different vibe. Of course, you don’t need to stick to one style at a time. A mismatched pair adds extra fashion content, like wearing lace socks with sandals or tying a silk scarf to your handbag, but symmetry can have plenty of impact if the scale is right. By which I mean, if your earrings are big enough. Right now, the rule with earrings is go big, or go home. Literally, that is: if you haven’t got big earrings on, go home and get some. • Jess wears earrings, £19, finery.com. Dress, £42, warehouse.co.uk.

NHS England has written to all 207 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) to warn that they must deliver on a key NHS-wide funding pledge in order to meet the rising demand for help. Claire Murdoch, NHS England’s national mental health director, has ordered CCGs to ensure they boost spending on mental health by more than the size of their overall annual budget increase. CCGs are the local NHS bodies that hold the health budget for every area and pay hospital trusts to treat patients. All CCGs must meet the mental health investment standard (MHIS) during the new NHS financial year, Murdoch said. NHS bosses are using the policy to increase funding for psychological and psychiatric services after concern they have endured years of underinvestment. “This is a landmark moment for England’s mental health services,” Murdoch said in the letter to CCGs. “The requirement to increase mental health spending faster than overall growth in health spending is not only a crucial enabler of high-quality patient care, but a demonstration of the NHS’s commitment to putting mental and physical health on a level footing. “Currently the overwhelming majority of CCGs – 85% – meet the MHIS, but nearly nine in 10 is not enough.” Bosses of CCGs that do not comply face having to explain their failure to Murdoch or another senior NHS England official. “Where our data analysis suggests that an individual CCG is not on track to meet the standard, their financial director and operations director will be called directly by a member of [NHS England’s] mental health unit or myself, to seek assurances on local and regional plans to put this right,” Murdoch said. Emphasising her intention to personally check CCGs’ approach to meeting the MHIS, she added: “Further follow-up will be pursued through the national performance and delivery group as well as regional deep-dive meetings, which I will chair, reporting regularly to [NHS England chief executive] Simon Stevens.” Murdoch’s move comes amid complaints from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, charities and opposition MPs that extra money earmarked by NHS England to expand mental health provision is not always spent as intended. Theresa May, the prime minister, has made improving mental health support one of her key domestic policies, as part of her assault on the “burning injustices” in British society. An annual survey using freedom of information laws conducted by the MP Luciana Berger, the president of the Labour campaign for mental health, found that half of CCGs reduced their spending on mental health provision during 2017-18."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/09/artist-christo-uk-oil-barrells-sculpture","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T11:48:06Z","webTitle":"He has wrapped the Reichstag – now the artist Christo is heading to the UK with 7,506 barrels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/09/artist-christo-uk-oil-barrells-sculpture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/09/artist-christo-uk-oil-barrells-sculpture","fields":{"headline":"He has wrapped the Reichstag – now the artist Christo is heading to the UK with 7,506 barrels","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Christo is standing in the driving rain patiently surveying the site for his latest artwork, which will rise a whopping 20 metres from the currently choppy waters of the Serpentine lake. His white locks and quilted Issey Miyake coat are flapping about madly as the downpour sweeps through Hyde Park, but the 82-year-old artist looks happy enough. From our vantage point on the bridge over the lake, we can just about make out dogs romping round the Princess Diana memorial fountain. From June, I learn, this popular landmark will be overshadowed by Christo’s first large British artwork: a giant stack of 55-gallon barrels, numbering 7,506 in all, floating on the lake. The artist, born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Bulgaria, is best known for having wrapped the entire Reichstag in Berlin in a vast silvery curtain, but he did a similar thing to the Pont Neuf in Paris, too. He also stretched a pier across an Italian lake that made visitors feel they were walking on water. Then there was the erection of 7,503 gates hung with saffron-coloured fabric in New York’s Central Park. And now he’s going to float a 150-tonne sculpture on a lake on London. Is it an allegory of the west’s oil dependency, an indictment of how we’re polluting the planet, or both? Christo shakes his locks and smiles. “I have no reason to justify myself as an artist. I cannot explain my art. Everything I do professionally is irrational and useless.” This, he thinks, is exactly as it should be. “I make things that have no function – except maybe to make pleasure.” What he will supply in London is some easy-to-access irrational uselessness. “There will be no tickets,” he says, “no reservations and no owners. It will belong to everyone until it’s gone. It will be a landmark for a few months.” He and his wife Jeanne-Claude, with whom he collaborated for 35 years until her death in 2009, often worked with barrels because of their sculptural effect and low cost. One early work was a barricade across the Rue Visconti on Paris’s Left Bank. Critics were quick to seize on it as a topical response to the iron curtain, as well as a nod to Paris’s revolutionary tradition, though Christo declines such reductive interpretations. “What I remember is Jeanne-Claude doing a lot of explaining to the police to allow it to stay in place for a few hours. She was very forceful.” This new barrel sculpture will be called the Mastaba. The what? “The mastaba is a very ancient form,” Christo explains as he and his entourage chat to me over coffee in the nearby Serpentine Gallery. “It originated in Mesopotamia at the time humans moved from agricultural societies to urban ones. It became common as the shape of benches outside the first urban Mesopotamian homes. Later it became associated with pharaohs’ tombs.” It’s a trapezoidal prism, I understand, though not quite pyramidal? “That’s right. The walls are always 60 degrees from the horizontal.” As well as being 20 metres tall, the Mastaba will be 30 metres wide and 40 metres long. The barrels visible on the top and the two slanted walls will be painted red and white; while the ends of the barrels visible on the two vertical walls will be painted red, blue and purple. All very interesting, but can I still swim in the Serpentine? “Of course! In fact, that may well be the best place to see my sculpture from.” Assurances have already been given to the swimming club that the Mastaba won’t interfere with their dips. One can understand their worries: the sculpture will rest on a floating platform made of high-density polyethylene cubes anchored to the lakebed. Plus there’s its frame, made of steel beams. How could that not interfere with their bracing morning swims? Vladimir, Christo’s nephew and major-domo, reassured the swimmers that the sculpture would cover about 1% of the lake’s total surface area and that there was no question of the barrels rolling off. He also described the ecological investments Christo would make as part of the deal: creating new habitats for birds and bats on the island, as well as a water recycling system to protect the lake from algal bloom. “We will leave the Serpentine better than it was before,” promises Vladimir, who is used to dealing with doubters. “We negotiated for nearly a quarter of a century before we got the OK to wrap the Reichstag in 1995. Christo got death threats from the neo-fascists and from the ex-communists too.” They aren’t the only ones who have failed to appreciate Christo’s work. For many years, he and Jeanne-Claude planned a project called Over the River. This would involve suspending 10km of reflective, translucent panels over the Arkansas river on steel cables anchored to its banks. These would be so high that rafters could still navigate the river while savouring the sculpture (although looking up while you’re rafting does, to my mind, sound quite dangerous). Christo spent $6m testing fabrics, conducting environmental studies and negotiating with the authorities, despite some rafters comparing the project to “hanging pornography in a church”. Roar, a protest group whose initials stand for Rags Over Arkansas River, launched a lawsuit. “It was to be the biggest, maybe the most amazing work of art ever,” says a defiant Christo but, at the start of last year, he cancelled Over the River in protest at Donald Trump’s election. Why? “I don’t want to talk about that today,” he says. Last year, however, he told the New York Times: “The decision speaks for itself.” Except, really, it doesn’t. “My decision process,” he added, “was that, like many others, I never believed that Trump would be elected.” The looming Mastaba will not be the first work Christo has created in London. In 1963, he wrapped a journalist who’d turned up to do an interview (for the rest of our conversation, I eye Christo narrowly in case he tries to pull a similar stunt). One day, he and Jeanne-Claude visited the studio of photographer and socialite Anthony Haden-Guest. “I wanted to wrap a naked woman,” says Christo, “and Anthony helped me. She turned up to do an interview, not knowing what we wanted, not knowing she would be naked. Then that famous celebrity hairdresser arrived – you know the one?” Vidal Sassoon? “Yes, Sassoon. He did her hair, she took her clothes off and I wrapped her up. There is a lovely film of it that Anthony made. She was called Ruth – I can’t remember her surname.” So Ruth became the precursor of all these wrap works. If you are Ruth and want to tell your side of this story, please get in touch. Happily for Ruth, her translucent mummification didn’t last: in an age of incessant commodification and creating for posterity, Christo and Jeanne-Claude always produced temporary works. “Artists – and above all architects – seek permanence,” he says. “I don’t. I like leaving nothing. That takes courage.” It also takes something else: a disregard for his bank balance. “There’s nothing for collectors to buy,” he says, “nothing for them to collect.” Sometimes all that remains of Christo’s art is the documentary evidence of his trusty photographer Wolfgang Volz. And yet CVJ, Christo’s company, is flush with cash, which is all the more surprising because he never accepts commissions or sponsorship. Why? “I came from a communist country. Ever since I escaped through the woods from Czechoslovakia to Vienna in 1957, I have been free. I like to be totally free to do the things I want.” CVJ has long backed projects by selling preparatory drawings and collages in advance. “Do you know that there is now a course at Harvard Business School that uses three examples – Jobs, Gates and Christo – of how to succeed in business? I am a very successful capitalist.” And so was Jeanne-Claude: the pair have been hailed as virtuosos of the art business deal. “We have always been good at negotiating. And we needed to be, otherwise these projects would never have been realised. But we have always been very good at getting banks to supply lines of credit.” Christo studied art in Sofia and Prague before deciding, after the Soviet crushing of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, to go west. “I have never been back since. I have no desire to. Ever since 1973, I have been a citizen of America. That is my home.” Then he checks himself: “Not really a citizen of America. Jeanne-Claude used to say, ‘We are citizens of Manhattan, not America.’” He took a long time getting there though. After setting up in Vienna, he headed to Paris. “I washed cars and dishes to survive. Then I started painting portraits. I signed them Javacheff – which distinguishes the work I did for money from the work I do to be free.” One portrait commission was of Jeanne-Claude de Guillebon, daughter of a French general whose mother had been a resistance fighter in the war. He fell in love with her. “The painting is now in the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego.” In 1963, though, it became a work by Christo, not Javacheff, when he wrapped it in polyethylene and rope, thereby creating a new work. Wrapping became a feature of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s art, a technique that, according to critics, is all about aesthetic revelation through concealment. The pair’s little apartment on a Seine islet was filled with wrapped brown paper parcels, bottles and paint cans, as was their originally illegal loft space in Manhattan that became their studio from 1964 onwards. “She was born the same day as me: 13 June 1935.” I’ve read that Jeanne-Claude became an artist, she said, out of love for you and that, had you been a dentist, she would have become a dentist too. “All true. She dyed her hair red because I suggested it.” The couple collaborated so closely that they always took separate flights, so that if one died in a crash, the other could live on to continue their work. Despite this, for decades Christo got all the credit, a situation they tried to reverse in 1994 by retroactively crediting their creations to “Christo and Jeanne-Claude”. She died of a brain aneurysm and now he lives on to continue their work. Is the London Mastaba a joint project? “It is. The mastaba form is something we worked on for years.” At the Serpentine Gallery throughout the summer, there will be a show of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s drawings and collages, including those for their long-nurtured plan for an even bigger mastaba 100 miles outside Abu Dhabi. For this mastaba, which would comprise 410,000 barrels and be permanent, the couple negotiated with sheikhs and enlisted the help of French foreign ministers and former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright. So far it hasn’t got the go-ahead, but that doesn’t seem to stop Christo talking about it optimistically. “It will be 150 metres high,” he says.

This is our reality. Of course we want to be the top team in the Premier League but that is not realistic this season, so we must do all we can to secure second place because that is a big move forward from last season’s sixth-place finish.” So it is and, if United do finish second, they deserve to be congratulated on staying ahead of Liverpool and Tottenham, who have both had excellent seasons, not to mention Chelsea and Arsenal, who both finished in front of them last year. Mourinho is right: that is progress, even if the elephant in the room that is Manchester City running away with the league is likely to be standing on its hind legs doing circus tricks when United travel the short distance to the Etihad on Saturday. The thing to remember here is that Pep Guardiola has been in Manchester exactly the same length of time as Mourinho. In addition, City finished empty-handed last season, whereas United won the League Cup and the Europa League. Given that Mourinho has spent upwards of £250m in under two years at United, his plea for more time – which is essentially what claims of transitional periods boil down to – is not going to find favour with too many fans. Louis van Gaal was shoved out of the exit door for much the same reason. United are not the sort of club who want to hear about three‑year plans or gradual transitions, particularly when the football on the pitch is sending everyone to sleep. Mourinho is not yet guilty of that failing – at times against Swansea his side played with confidence and verve – but going down to Sevilla without much of a fight is something that his detractors are not prepared to forgive easily. Mourinho is looking forward to qualifying for next season’s Champions League, yet by his own admission United failed to emerge as genuine contenders this time. The manager offered a hostage to fortune when he claimed that the competition proper really starts only at the quarter-final stage and, if United found their route barred by a fairly ordinary Sevilla side, what guarantee can there be that they will be ready to take on Bayern Munich or Barcelona next year? Doubtless Mourinho intends to spend some more money between now and then, though in all probability City, Spurs and Liverpool will be doing the same, as will the usual suspects in Europe. Suddenly Mourinho’s track record with big-money signings, once so impressive, is under scrutiny. Nemanja Matic has been a great success, as anyone who saw him playing for Mourinho at Chelsea knew he would be. But, though Paul Pogba still has time on his side, his rehabilitation in Manchester has been far from seamless. While Romelu Lukaku has just about won over the doubters with his finishing, even if playing with a big man up front is being made to look primitive by the fluidity of the front lines City and Liverpool can field, Alexis Sánchez is still struggling to resemble the last piece of the attacking jigsaw his manager claims. Maybe next season, Mourinho has said. And maybe next season Marcus Rashford or Pogba will have had enough of trying to fit in around the Chilean, particularly if they have strong World Cups. There is no doubting Sánchez’s ability, though the suspicion remains that Mourinho moved for him in January principally to pique City, who would probably have used him more sparingly anyway. One of many subplots to what is likely to prove the coronation of City as champions on Saturday is Sánchez coming up against the club he could have joined – wanted to join, in fact. If he was dissatisfied with Arsenal’s lack of progress in the Champions League, what must he think of moving to Manchester just for a couple of appearances in the last 16? He probably thinks the same as everyone else, that casting your lot in with Mourinho’s projects nowadays is not the cast‑iron guarantee of achievement and improvement that it used to be. The main Saturday subplot was supposed to be Guardiola underlining this new reality by using the Manchester derby to win the league a couple of months early, though that was before City’s fourth and easily most emphatic defeat of the season, at Anfield. Now that there is considerable doubt over whether City’s serene progress in Europe can continue, it would not be surprising should some of the hesitation that cost them against Liverpool spill over into their next league game. Suddenly, winning the title by beating United seems relatively unimportant. City will have plenty more chances to wrap up the league, whereas they have only the one chance of Champions League redemption and a slim one at that. With the second leg coming up on Tuesday, Guardiola will do well to keep his players’ focus on the United game rather than the Liverpool one. There is hope for Mourinho yet, though in fact the events of the last few days will probably depress United fans rather than encourage them. The most Mourinho can aim for is to spoil Guardiola’s day. Liverpool, without even mentioning the word transition, have just put themselves in a position to spoil his entire summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/16/locals-guide-to-chicago-10-top-tips-music-bars-restaurants-lake-michigan","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T05:30:11Z","webTitle":"A local’s guide to Chicago: 10 top tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/16/locals-guide-to-chicago-10-top-tips-music-bars-restaurants-lake-michigan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/16/locals-guide-to-chicago-10-top-tips-music-bars-restaurants-lake-michigan","fields":{"headline":"A local’s guide to Chicago: 10 top tips","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Traditionally overshadowed by coastal powerhouses New York City and Los Angeles, Chicago is on the rise, with a record 55 million visitors in 2017 – and new direct flights from the UK with Norwegian and Wow making the US’s third-largest city more accessible. While visitors tend to congregate around the downtown and lakefront areas to admire the city’s world-renowned architecture, there’s a thriving music and bar scene that shouldn’t be missed. Al’s Italian Beef When it comes to eating in Chicago, there are three essential food groups: pizza, hotdogs and Italian beef. Pizza and hotdogs are well-known to most visitors, but the less-famous Italian beef sandwich is perhaps the quintessential Chicago creation. Thin slices of seasoned roast beef are served on a long Italian or French roll topped with peppers and drenched in jus, the sandwich started as a cheap way of feeding a large Italian wedding party in the early 1900s and was brought here by immigrants in the 1930s. Operating since 1938, Al’s stand in the Little Italy/University Village neighbourhood helped popularise the classic Chicago sandwich. While Al’s is now a chain, the original on Taylor Street remains a must-visit. It’s cash only and there are no seats, so grab one to go and pack extra napkins. • 1079 W Taylor Street, alsbeef.com Maria’s Packaged Goods One of the more unusual things about Chicago is its “slashies” (liquor store/bar combos), where you can drink at the bar and walk home with a six-pack of beer or bottle of whiskey under your arm. While most slashies are of the dive bar variety, Maria’s Packaged Goods in the Bridgeport neighbourhood is a slightly more clean-cut version that is popular with the community’s artists, musicians, and beer nerds. As well as offering more than 500 varieties of brew and a Korean/Polish street food project called Kimski, it hosts some of the best DJ nights in the city. The bar’s co-owner is a leading force behind popular, up-and-coming local brewery Marz Community Brewing, experimental art gallery/cultural centre Co-Prosperity Sphere, and broadcaster Lumpen Radio. • 960 W 31st Street, community-bar.com Humboldt Park Many of Chicago’s largest parks are connected through a system of historic leafy boulevards often overlooked by visitors, who often favour the lakefront. On the West Side, Humboldt Park is a massive green space to lie out on a blanket on the grass, stroll among peaceful lagoons or dine at the waterfront Boathouse cafe. A good way to explore the park is to take a short walk to it from the 606 urban hiking trail, a 2.7-mile elevated pathway on an abandoned railway line that connects several neighbourhoods. There are also many good bars and restaurants within a short walk of the trail, including Parson’s Chicken &amp; Fish (which unfurls a bustling outdoor patio in summer) and cool neighbourhood bars such as Best Intentions and Scofflaw. • chicagoparkdistrict.com Reckless Records Established in London’s Soho in 1984, Reckless Records also has three locations in Chicago, the most famous of which is in the Wicker Park neighbourhood, home of several music venues and other record stores. Here, a wide variety of cool tunes will soundtrack hours of crate digging in a recently expanded space a few blocks from its original Chicago home. It is also something of a gathering place for the city’s music community, hosting everything from in-store performances by local bands to drop-in visits from larger acts such as Franz Ferdinand and Jack White. • 1379 N Milwaukee Avenue, reckless.com Longman &amp; Eagle Most of the city’s more popular (and expensive) hotels are downtown, so good deals and more interesting places to stay can be found in the neighbourhoods. Longman &amp; Eagle has six boutique rooms above the restaurant of the same name in the Logan Square neighbourhood. They are artfully designed and have both modern and retro touches, such as vintage cassette tape consoles with accompanying mixtapes. The hip space also makes an excellent base for exploring the many bars and restaurants that have helped turn Logan Square into Chicago’s premier party district in recent years. The downstairs restaurant stocks 400 types of whiskey. • Doubles from $95 room-only, 2657 N Kedzie, longmanandeagle.com Montrose Beach Chicago’s lakefront beaches come alive in summer. The city’s buildings almost touch the sand at places like Oak Street Beach but venture further north and discover Montrose Beach, the city’s largest, in the Uptown neighbourhood. After a game of beach volleyball at the expansive public space – it also includes sand dunes and birding trails – go to the always happening bar The Dock at Montrose Beach, where live bands perform most nights in summer. Grab a vodka lemonade and a plate of fish tacos and watch the sunset for a true taste of Chicago summer. • 4400 N Lake Shore Drive, chicagoparkdistrict.com Empty Bottle This 400-capacity dive bar in the Ukrainian Village neighbourhood has little on the exterior to indicate its importance to the Chicago music scene, other than an old-fashioned beer sign and the words “Music Friendly Dancing” on its awning. Yet the rock history within its walls is unmistakable: it hosted bands from Arcade Fire to the White Stripes long before they became household names. It’s the kind of place where you can shoot pool with members of Interpol before seeing up-and-coming indie talent on a small stage surrounded by cool people and stiff drinks. Head next door to the BYO Bite Cafe for food or stop by sister venue Thalia Hall in the Pilsen neighbourhood, to see rock bands in a palatial 1800s building, which also houses Michelin-starred restaurant Dusek’s and lively downstairs bar Punch House. • 1035 N Western Avenue, emptybottle.com The Hideout In an out-of-the-way industrial part of town inside a late 1800s-era house, this beloved local institution has a small front bar and a back room performance space that hosts live bands, comedy acts, poetry open mics and late-night dance parties. With twinkling lights and a homey vibe, it’s also just a damn fine bar to drink any night of the year with a friendly crowd.

The popular hangout also boats one of the finest roof decks in the city: its 99-person‚ Reggie’s Trainwreck Rooftop Deck with TVs, games and picnic tables. The venue also holds events from art shows to crawfish boils, not to mention trips to local sports matches on its Halloween-style party buses. It also offers recording services for bands during live shows and if you’ve had too much to drink, not to worry – it has rooms at Reggie’s Hotel. • 2105 S State St, reggieslive.com Old Town Ale House When in Chicago, it is customary to close down a 4am bar (or go until 5am on Saturdays.)

As a long-running incubator of comedic talent that has launched the careers of a celebrities from Bill Murray to Stephen Colbert, Second City also sends plenty of thirsty off-duty comics through the doors of Old Town Ale House, where they commiserate with a diverse cross-section of revellers from tourists and young professionals to artists and grizzled old-timers.

Four Muslim MPs received it, including at least one copy being received in parliament, leading to a security alert. The letter boasted of horrific “rewards”, encouraging people to carry out attacks on Muslims, including torture, burning down mosques and throwing acid in Muslims’ faces. It is still not known who was behind them, although counter-terror police are investigating, Muslim women were picked out and slotted in a special category – as we’re used to – with points being offered to those who pulled off hijabs from women’s heads. There may not have been a major incident, but “Punish a Muslim Day” did what it was designed to do – strike fear in the hearts of individual Muslims and those already being impacted by hate crime and racism. The impact cannot be overestimated – especially on the mental health of Muslim women. I personally know of four women who refused to leave their homes yesterday, taking the day off work or changing their social plans. One told me that she had taken her daughter out of nursery for the day because she didn’t want to risk anything happening to her child or to her. Another friend, feisty, independent, and very visible in her community, sent me a WhatsApp message the night before, asking: “What do you think? This is a farce isn’t it and it should be ignored, right?” I understood that this was her checking in with me to show solidarity with me as much as it was to silence any niggling doubt that she was going to go ahead with her day as planned. Many argued that the best way to deal with “stunts” such as “Punish A Muslim Day” is to ignore them. Best not give oxygen to whoever is responsible for orchestrating this campaign of terror. But to me, that’s burying one’s head in the sand. We cannot avoid the fact that British Muslims are facing rising levels of Islamophobia, anti-Muslim hate and the mainstreaming of racism in our country on a daily basis. This “Punish a Muslim Day” is not a one-off day of hate targeting Muslims; for many it represents the daily structural Islamophobia we are up against and the increasingly poisonous rhetoric directed against Muslims in everyday life. Only last month the leaders of the far-right group Britain First were jailed for a series of hate crimes against Muslims. The group’s leaders, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, were found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment after being investigated for the distribution of leaflets and online hate material. A few weeks later, Paul Moore, 21, was convicted of attempted murder after running over a Muslim woman and trying to hit a 12-year-old girl with his car in Leicester as “revenge” for terrorist attacks in London. Moore targeted Zaynab Hussein with his car in September last year. She was thrown into the air. He then turned his car round and drove over her. Hussein, 47, was left with severe fractures to her pelvis and spine and a broken leg. She was in hospital for almost three months, and remains confined to a bed. Anti-Muslim hate can’t only be measured by the increased reported hate crimes and acts of terrorism such as that carried out against worshippers at Finsbury Park mosque last summer – Islamophobia is fully mainstream and is part of our daily public and political discourse. Take the research paper by academics in Portsmouth and Birmingham, which found that Muslim parents are homeschooling their children because of bullying. Or the carelessness displayed by our public figures including Bob Blackman, the Conservative MP for Harrow East, who a week ago expressed “regret” after sharing a Facebook post from an American anti-Muslim website. It wasn’t the first time Blackman had made such an apology. In 2016, Blackman retweeted far-right extremist Tommy Robinson, later saying he made an “error” and apologising. Blackman is not alone in making such “errors”; the voices and views of violent Islamophobes are commonly amplified on social media. To counter Islamophobia at its roots, we need a grounded and honest national conversation about the extent of the problem. We also need a prime minister and government that will lead by example and make it crystal clear that structural barriers impacting Muslims’ lives and the racism Muslim communities face will be tackled robustly. We also need a strong and diverse anti-racism movement willing to tackle the politics of bigotry and division head-on. “Love a Muslim Day” is a worthy gesture but most Muslims I know are not bothered about being loved – we just want to feel safe and secure in our country. We’d like the right to live with dignity, to be seen and valued as full human beings and citizens without having to prove how good or how British we are. • Shaista Aziz is a journalist, writer, standup comedian and former aid worker • This article was amended on 9 April 2018 to correct “cannot be underestimated” to “cannot be overestimated”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/12/the-brazilian-villagers-turning-plastic-pollution-into-profit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"The Brazilian villagers turning plastic pollution into profit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/the-brazilian-villagers-turning-plastic-pollution-into-profit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/12/the-brazilian-villagers-turning-plastic-pollution-into-profit","fields":{"headline":"The Brazilian villagers turning plastic pollution into profit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Maria das Gracas started collecting her plastic bottles after she saw the body of her neighbour floating past her house, carried along with the pollution that helped cause the deadly floods. She stores them by the front door of her one-story home, which sits on the litter-strewn banks of the Tejipió river in north-east Brazil. When she has enough she will take them to the local storage skip, where a litter collector will pay her two reals for 50 plastic bottles – about 40 pence. She’s not just doing it for the money. She’s doing it to stop the tide of plastic drowning this community. Every day Maria and other residents of Coqueiral, a poor neighbourhood in the city of Recife, feel the impact of the world’s plastic binge. It is visible in the waters of the river that once flowed freely through the area. Fifty years ago when Rildo Wandray was a boy, he would jump into the Tejipió and swim, while his friends fished beside him. Today the river is stagnant, obstructed at every tributary by a tide of plastic waste; Coca-Cola and Fanta bottles, water containers, crisp packets and wrappers. Globally, some 2 billion people live in communities with no rubbish collections. While international attention has focused recently on the marine plastic litter crisis, the devastating impact of plastic waste on the world’s poorest is no less destructive, causing flooding, disease, and hundreds of thousands of premature deaths from toxic fumes caused by the burning of waste. In Recife the plastic waste is exacerbating already devastating flooding from rising sea levels caused by climate change. And those living around the Tejipió have grown tired of waiting for the government to act. For das Gracas, the tipping point came when flooding took the life of one of her neighbours. “I was trapped inside my home with my son,” she said. “There was nothing we could do, the water came up and we could not get out. I looked out and saw a body float past. She was face down, I could see the hair. That night the flood nearly took me too. Ever since then I have collected my bottles, I wanted to try and do something to reduce the waste going into the river.” Organised and supported by the local baptist church through its project Instituto Solidare, local communities are mobilising: street protests, public meetings, awareness campaigns. They are also trying to build a network of entrepreneurs who can make a living out of collecting the waste, and turning it into products they can sell. The Recife campaign is supported by Tearfund, the international NGO which is lobbying for global development funding for waste projects to be increased from 0.3% to 3%; a move which would push waste higher up the international agenda, reduce global plastic littering, help cut marine litter and improve the environment and the lives of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. On Thursday – in advance of the Commonwealth Summit in London next week – international development secretary Penny Mordaunt is expected to address the need to increase UK funding globally to tackle plastic pollution, after lobbying from Tearfund and other bodies. In Recife, Evandro Alves, who leads Instituto Solidare, says the world’s poorest are suffering the most from the plastic waste crisis. “The situation here in this community, where life is already incredibly hard, has been getting worse,” he said. “We are are seeing more and more plastic being used and thrown away, and it stops here in their community. So we decided to mobilise.” The movement in Coqueiral, Alves believes, could be replicated across the developing world; taking the idea of a circular economy and localising it to empower the people to press for government action, but also to take advantage of the opportunities waste creates. “The waste is a problem but it is also an opportunity for people to earn a living, to create a circular economy for themselves,” he said. “This could be transformative and improve the quality of life for people in the poorest areas of the biggest cities. This is a battle for everyone and everyone needs to be part of it. We understand this is not a short fix, this is a long fight.” At public meetings, and marches through the streets residents hold placards aloft, demanding “Clean River, Healthy City,” and “Salve Orio Tejipió e suas communidades.” (Save the River Tejipió and our communities) Young people in Recife are at the forefront of the campaign, eliciting support and mobilising on social media. In one direct action, pupils whose school is on the riverside, removed some of the waste from the Tejipió; a sofa, plastic bottles, a TV, tables, plastic chairs and built a house on the banks which they called Casa Lixo – House of Trash. Another post saw children holding a fashion show from clothes created out of plastic bags and cups. Some women are involved in an enterprise making handbags, jewellery and toys out of the plastic and other waste collected from their communities. It provides them with employment and a small income – and in a small way builds the kind of circular economy which a 2010 Brazilian law promised but failed to create. Olga Gomes, one of the women who works in the group Seleta, said: “We are putting a lot of work into researching the market and looking at trends and trying to make sure we can make a business out of what we are doing. For me it is empowering – it has given me work and given me a social life.” Her optimism is shared by all the women, some of whom have been helped to flee violent relationships through the work provided and the social support of the Seleta project. For Gomes, the task for the future is clear. “I want to see my grandchildren swim in the river like I did and I want this work to take me across the ocean.” The movement is being adopted by some of the poorest communities across the world. In Jos in Nigeria and Maputo in Mozambique, other groups have formed. They are driven, as in Recife, by young people, who use their knowledge of digital media to spread the fight against waste across the globe. Naomi Foxwood, senior campaigner for Tearfund, said: “This crisis is growing as disposable items – plastic bottles, disposable nappies, single-use polystyrene containers – are increasingly being used in quickly urbanising low- and middle-income countries. “Young people, in particular, are at the forefront of this. They have energy, organising power, and a great sense of justice. For them it is a justice issue because often municipal waste is just dumped in the poorest communities, whereas it is collected from the more wealthy areas.” For those in Recife, there have been small victories. Last year the state government responded to the pressure and dug out the river upstream of Coqueiral to improve the river flow. The result is fewer floods so far this year. But the residents know the battle will be a long one. Carol Santos who lives on the banks of the river with her three children understands the need to take personal responsibility for the waste she creates. But she also believes her community has been abandoned by the state and that large multinationals like Coca-Cola – whose plastic bottles are clearly visible in the mass of waste blocking the Tejipió, could do more to clear up the pollution their products create. “The company could help to collect the waste and support the community to recycle it, but it doesn’t. We don’t see them,” she said. Her home is flooded several times a year. “When the rains come the flood destroys everything. It is a desperate situation – at least nine times a year I lose everything, my children get sick from diarrhoea when it floods, its awful for them. We live here because we have nowhere else to go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/04/getting-to-grips-with-learning-inside-and-out","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T17:45:02Z","webTitle":"Getting to grips with learning inside and out | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/04/getting-to-grips-with-learning-inside-and-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/04/getting-to-grips-with-learning-inside-and-out","fields":{"headline":"Getting to grips with learning inside and out","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tim Brighouse is right (Time for a new Butler act for the 21st century, 3 April). Of the five important issues he identifies, the most significant is that “Ministers exercise too much power and too little judgment”. A national education council is needed which can variously advise parliament, government, local authorities, academy trusts, schools, academies, teachers, governors, parents, professional bodies and the general public (with membership from these constituencies) on significant issues in educational practice and the relationship between education and future society. The immediate purpose should be to examine critically the state of national education and reflect on whether school standards, teachers’ morale, young people’s wellbeing and parents’ aspirations are being held back. If and wherever this is the case the council should propose ameliorating changes with the expectation that parliament would adopt them and ministers implement them. Thereafter the council, from time to time, should publish non-mandatory guidance on matters of curriculum and pedagogy, on the basis of research that it initiates; but it is schools themselves that should make educational decisions, in discussion with local communities, and from their professional knowledge of their pupils. Emeritus Professor Michael Bassey Newark, Nottinghamshire • Tim Brighouse makes a compelling case for a new settlement for education in England. Two particular further features should be addressed. First, it should be based on evidence, not politicians’ whims and prejudices. Second, it should reflect the fact that adolescents spend much of their time outside the classroom, and thus urgent attention needs to be paid to rebuilding the role of educational youth work for their leisure time. Tom Wylie Oxford • Your report on outdoor learning for under-fives in Scotland (Wild bunch: Benefits of outdoor learning take root, 3 April) has a hint of reinvention of the wheel for those of us who have been involved in outdoor education for many years. The value of outdoor experience, for young people of all ages, has long been recognised. Benefits have been proven not only for health – physical and mental – but also for social development, employability skills and social cohesion. However, outdoor provision for young people of school age is less rosy than your report might suggest. Many of the outdoor education centres that were established in the 1950s and 1960s have closed. Numbers of people gaining the national outdoor leadership awards have plummeted in recent years, threatening the very existence of groups such as ours. And availability of minibuses, a crucial means of getting young people into the outdoor environment, has also been reduced. If joined-up thinking still has a place in government, there would be a 10-year strategy to get every young person into some sort of outdoor activity. Key aspects would be a national programme of leader training, provision of minibuses for community group use in every area, and establishment of stores of loan equipment for outdoor use. The national lottery has never had a fund for outdoor education. Now is the time to launch one and make a real impact on young people. Chris Johnson Secretary, Bradford Expedition Leaders Association • What a remarkable article (Who’s a fast learner, then?, 3 April). In the 1960s and for the following 30 years we knew that teaching is learning from children and that a good teacher is a close observer. They are the curriculum. The piece mentions “the legendary Margy Whalley”. She was indeed an inspirational teacher and leader.

Age: Classic. Appearance: White, male. There are lots of white males. Can you narrow it down? Certainly. The most boiled-down, congealed essence of British manhood imaginable, scraped off the bottom of the pan and then further reduced to a crystalline powder of Lad Bible, Bring Back Clarkson petitions and Sergio Agüero bants. It’s the reboot kernel code stored at Porton Down in the event that every single white man is taken out by the Russians. Right. Got it. So what has Radio X done now? It recently asked listeners to vote on the 100 best British songs of all time. Said list featured, well, lots of white men. How many? Ballpark? Half a percent were women: Gillian Gilbert from New Order and Candida Doyle from Pulp. Oh, dear: well, Radio X is quite literally “targeted at men”. Yet curiously 39% of listeners are women. What about non-white people in this list? Does Gary, the drummer from the Libertines, count? Naturally. But surely diversity of ideas is the only diversity that counts? Well, then you’ll love a list where 16 songs by Oasis are in the top 100 (five in the top 20), Stone Roses tracks make up 8% of the total, the Beatles and Stereophonics have five songs each and the Who three. That doesn’t leave much space for Arctic Monkeys. They have nine. I guess that means even Flourescent Adolescent made it. Of course. Catfish and the Bottlemen? Two. Kasabian? Three. The Verve? Four. Well, thank God that must mathematically exclude Queen. They occupy another four slots, including the No 2: Bohemian Rhapsody. Is this the real life? If Live Forever is No 1, then string theory suggests we are in the best of all possible universes. And it is. Welcome to a Thousand Year Reich of Gallagher. Actually, even Noel is cackling behind his hands. He told poll voters: “You are also sadly THE MOST nostalgic demographic on Earth. Saying that … My children and my children’s children’s children will quaff in your general direction for many years to come.

We asked you to respond with your favourite decades, and have been watching discussion unfold in the comments. From the 1920s to today, here are a few of the most interesting recommendations for past decades, and the films you remember them by. 1960s – ‘Changed the face of Hollywood forever’ “The 60s for me, particularly because of Andrei Rublev, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Graduate. I believe Andrei Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev to be the most visually poetic film ever made. Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 stretched the cinematic envelope and Mike Nichols’s The Graduate is important because choosing a character actor as the ‘guy who gets the girl’ opened the door to Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss (and every other actor who didn’t look like Robert Redford) to become major players, changing the face of Hollywood forever. conedison ‘The gorgeous photography kept me hooked’ “There’s something about the cinematography and image quality of the 60s and early 70s that particularly appeals to me. For much of the first hour of the excellent Sam Spiegel film The Chase, for example, when the audience is pretty much in the dark about the plot, the gorgeous photography kept me hooked. Since Star Wars, this sort of thing’s been on a steep decline, and since Gollum [in the Lord of the Rings] I reckon many directors don’t worry about cinematography much any more. They figure, we’ll fix everything in edit.” freespeechoneach 1990s – ‘Until then, cinemas were a place of dumb, predictable blockbusters’ “The 90s keep a special place in my heart. Until then, cinemas were a place of dumb, predictable blockbusters. I barely noticed who was directing the films and I didn’t even bother to watch films on TV. Everything changed when, out of complete luck, I happened to see in a short period Reservoir Dogs, Barton Fink, Miller’s Crossing and Bad Lieutenant at a local cinema that held a US indie week at the occasion of the release of Abel Ferrara’s masterpiece. I had no idea that films could be so exciting and different from all the bland soup I was used to, it was a revelation that beyond the box office there was a place for me.” bf_silvertown ‘A trend away from boorish blockbusters’ “I’m a child of the 90s, so that’s the decade that gets my vote as an era when cinema made something of a leap, with new, important voices coming to the fore, new technology pushing the boundaries, and a trend away from the boorish blockbusters of the 80s towards comparatively more exciting, [sometimes] dangerous movies including Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park, Schindler’s List and Saving Private Ryan.” Skoolyad 1920s – ‘Perhaps the ultimate decade for horror’ “Now you’re talking. Two of the most magical times I’ve had in a cinema were watching Murnau’s Sunrise and Browning/Chaney’s The Unknown. Perhaps the ultimate decade for horror, which has the peculiarly narcotic feel of dreams, like The Man Who Laughed. Nosferatu stands alone among the versions of the Dracula story. It’s like a stone tape and the memory of it is evocative of something that might perhaps have happened. It was the great decade of physical comedy, with Lloyd and Keaton remaining its peak. But the sadness of 20s film is that so much of it has been lost. How frustrating it is that 4 Devils no longer exists.” MildredPlotka ‘When cinema came of age’ “Silent film of the 20s is when cinema came of age. DW Griffith formulated the alphabet of film in the 1910s, but the Soviets created the syntax of cinema language still used today. There would be no Apocalypse Now (the Kurtz assassination intercut with the water buffalo sacrifice) without Eisenstein’s Strike (“The Carnage” chapter), there would be no Godfather baptism sequence, and hundreds of Potemkin “Odessa steps” references … Soviet montage proved that by image association you can convey complex emotions and engage the viewer intellectually. All that without a single word spoken. Cinema at its purest (albeit propaganda).” Karlos_Nagasaki 2000s – ‘It was all about epic sagas’ “I was born in 1995 so this is the decade I remember best. It was all about epic sagas, and the trilogy was the big thing: The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, [Christopher] Nolan’s Batman, Tobey Maguire-era Spider-Man, Pirates of the Caribbean, and more. Even memorable standalone films such as Gangs of New York, Gladiator, District 9, Avatar and Slumdog Millionaire had a kind of epic scope to them. I think Hollywood has descended into a quagmire of sequels, spin-offs and reboots, fuelled by little more than nostalgia to keep it going.” ChristianRound 1980s – ‘Nothing else beats blast of nostalgia and feeling of escapism’ “Nothing gives me that blast of nostalgia and feeling of escapism like a great 80s movie (I’m 42 now). It’s not just the films themselves but the times that surround them. And the music is like a soundtrack to your childhood. The Beverly Hills Cop theme tune and Eye of the Tiger from Rocky. Not to mention the great John Williams soundtracks. The likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Back to the Future are classics in any era, they just take you on a thrill ride and are just perfect examples of a great script, casting and pacing. They definitely don’t make films like that anymore.” McnultyDJW ‘Ridiculous – but it holds up’ “While the 80s will always be regarded as ridiculous after the sublime heights of the 70s, it actually holds up – probably because of its proximity to the 70s. Lots of films from the 80s that were little-regarded then and are little-remembered now hold up surprisingly well. I’m thinking of films like 48 Hours, Beverley Hills Cop, First Blood, Lethal Weapon, Robocop, They Live, Terminator – considered lowbrow then, but in 2018 seeming gritty, gripping and really well-crafted. Ironically, even the bad films were elevated by the high standards that they represented a decline from.” GRANFALLOON 1930s – ‘When pretty much everything we see on screen today was first attempted’ “The more I see films from the 30s, 40s and 50s the more I’m aware that those decades are when pretty much everything we see on screen today was first attempted and, in many cases, perfected. Not just in Hollywood, but all over the world.” alexito “Hadley Freeman wrote that no other decade has made fun movies as brilliantly as the 80s? Try the 1930s, which is basically where every film style covered in her article is sourced from. Lucas, Zemeckis, Hughes, Spielberg etc were obsessed with recreating the decade’s approach to Hollywood entertainment. And they were by no means alone. Check out films from WC Fields, the Marx Brothers, Wheeler and Woolsey, Zazu Pitts and Thelma Todd, the more upmarket screwball comedies (social commentary being central to most of them), Capra’s films, all those action adventure comedies – and then have a look at their 80s stylistic copies.” Splatgadget 1950s – ‘Wonderfully cynical and dark’ “How can you discuss the 50s and not mention Ealing Studios? Two of my favourites are The Lady Killers and Kind Hearts and Coronets. If you want to dismiss Ealing films as fluffy, middle-class nostalgia pieces, watch these films. They are wonderfully cynical and dark. Kind Hearts is great social satire. The lead is an awful person but you still feel a pang a sympathy towards him because the way society – and his racist, snobbish family – has screwed him over. Alec Guinness is wonderful in both, playing a demented criminal in the first and seven parts in the second” 1940s – ‘Film-makers had to work with a limited palette and vocabulary’ “One of the things I like about the 40s, pressed between the Hays Office, the need for war propaganda, and the impending McCarthy years, is that film-makers had to work with a limited palette and vocabulary. Rather than coming out and saying something, they had to hint, or concoct allegories. When I was younger, I saw these films in literal terms. Now, it is all innuendo and double entendre.” TomC49 “The 40s for me too! Spent a most enjoyable couple of hours last night watching Mildred Pierce for the umpteenth time. It’s been great to be able to collect films I watched for the first time on the BBC years ago. I’ve finally got hold of Beyond the Forest, the film which drove Bette Davis to finally break with Warner Bros: ‘What a dump!’” eileanmor Click here to look back at the full series and read more of your contributions"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2018/apr/04/teenage-flicks-how-phone-boredom-became-gen-zs-answer-to-passing-the-time","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T16:26:37Z","webTitle":"Teenage flicks: how 'phone boredom' became Gen Z's answer to passing the time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/apr/04/teenage-flicks-how-phone-boredom-became-gen-zs-answer-to-passing-the-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/apr/04/teenage-flicks-how-phone-boredom-became-gen-zs-answer-to-passing-the-time","fields":{"headline":"Teenage flicks: how 'phone boredom' became Gen Z's answer to passing the time","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Horizontal. Phone propped less than 10cm away from your face: minimum hand muscles engaged. Twitter: meme (it’s funny, but you don’t laugh). Instagram: cat picture (it’s cute, but you don’t smile). Facebook: acquaintance complaining (it’s sad, but you don’t frown). Tumblr. Snapchat. Back to Twitter. Repeat for an hour or two, until bodily functions force you to get up – and even then, wait until you are in actual physical pain before going to the loo, so deep are you in your trance-like state. No, this isn’t an extract from the diary of a depressive. This is how we members of Generation Z, the name given to those dull young things born between (roughly) 1998 and 2010, spend much of our free time, locked in “phone boredom”. The Daily Beast reports that this involves being on your phone, but largely just opening and closing up to 20-30 apps and finding nothing that interests you. Doing something, while doing nothing at all: technology has created a new way for Generation Z, to go out of their minds with boredom. I can’t even argue with my dad’s favourite adage: “Only boring people get bored”, as I send countless snapchats to my friends of my blank expression, captioned “bored”, and receive the same in return; surely we are boring if, with the whole of the internet at our fingertips, this is what we are choosing to do? However, there is no need to bemoan the state of today’s youth. This is a case of new technology, same old humans. There is a reason why bouncing a ball against a wall in boredom is a movie cliche: something about the repetitive movement and satisfying action fills the mind just enough to relax, but not enough to be entertained, making it an activity that epitomises ennui. This translates directly into flicking through apps: we have a new way to be bored, but the feeling is identical. And just like pre-smartphone teenage boredom forced creativity and innovation – inventing a new game, exploring somewhere new – the phone-bored can also scroll their way into productivity, stumbling upon an incredible new Instagram artist, for example, or seeing a tweet that inspires a blogpost. My dad is right, then, but everyone is boring at some point or another. If you are exasperated with phone boredom, don’t worry: one day it will be replaced by something new, and equally unexciting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/27/uk-website-age-checks-create-facebook-porn-critics-warn","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T13:21:45Z","webTitle":"UK website age checks could create Facebook of porn, critics warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/27/uk-website-age-checks-create-facebook-porn-critics-warn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/27/uk-website-age-checks-create-facebook-porn-critics-warn","fields":{"headline":"UK website age checks could create Facebook of porn, critics warn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Draft rules for age verification on pornographic websites could put users’ privacy at risk and give the world’s biggest porn publisher a power similar to that of Facebook and Twitter, critics have said. The guidance, which comes after the government passed a law last year forcing pornography sites to use age checks or face being blocked, states there is no legal requirement for sites to offer visitors a choice of age verification services. MindGeek, the company that controls most of the world’s online traffic for pornography, has introduced its own age verification service, which critics say could allow it to corner the market, allowing it to become the “Facebook of porn” and collect vast amounts of data on users’ porn viewing habits. The draft rules, published by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), the newly appointed age verification regulator, pass all responsibility for regulating the privacy and security of the services to the Information Commissioner’s Office, with no specific security rules to be applied in the sector. The BBFC has invited submissions to a consultation on how it should police age verification for online porn, which was legislated for in last year’s Digital Economy Act. Age checks had been due to go live next month, but the implementation of the law has been delayed until the end of the year. Jim Killock, the executive director of the campaign body Open Rights Group, and Myles Jackman, a lawyer who specialises in obscenity cases, both said the draft guidance “absolutely” gave MindGeek the opportunity to establish a monopoly. “These are the two key points,” Killock said. “There is no requirement for user choice and there is no requirement for any privacy to be higher than the General Data Protection Regulation. Basically, they are washing their hands and hoping the market will sort it out. They even said they hope the market will provide, but that’s not how digital markets work, digital markets work as a monopoly, like Facebook, like Twitter.” Jackman said he believed existing data protection rules – which will also apply to age verification – were not strong enough to securesensitive data that could potentially be collected by a service policing adults’ pornographic viewing habits. He tweeted an annotated copy of the draft guidance, which he said showed that many specific requirements for data protection were qualified by “should”, which he argued showed the toothlessness of the BBFC as regulator. MindGeek owns free-to-view streaming sites including Pornhub, YouPorn, RedTube, Tube8 and SpankWire, which between them are said to account for most of the porn viewed on the internet. It also owns premium sites including Brazzers, Reality Kings, Mofos, and Bromo. James Clark, a spokesman for MindGeek’s AgeID product, said the company saw its AgeID product as one of many age verification platforms and that “many sites, including those owned by MindGeek, [would be] implementing multiple solutions”. “It’s important that users have the option to select the age verification platform that suits their needs best and offers a seamless experience,” he said, adding that the company expected about 20-25 million users to sign up to age verification. Warren Russell, the chief executive of AV Yourself, another company preparing to compete for the age verification market, agreed the guidance could in theory hand MindGeek’s AgeID product a monopoly, but he said he did not believe that would happen. “What solution the MindGeek brands choose to use is their decision at the end of the day,” Russell said. “But lots of the merchants we have spoken to, including MindGeek brands, have shown interest in using more than one. “It’s high-volume traffic they are dealing with. What they are interested in is disaster recovery: you don’t want all your traffic going through one product because if that breaks you lose all your traffic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/mar/31/civil-servants-environment-precious-little-gets-done","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T08:57:08Z","webTitle":"Civil servants work in a toxic environment where precious little gets done","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/mar/31/civil-servants-environment-precious-little-gets-done","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/mar/31/civil-servants-environment-precious-little-gets-done","fields":{"headline":"Civil servants work in a toxic environment where precious little gets done","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There is no finer feeling as a civil servant working in policy than making changes that have a positive impact on people’s lives. But it’s safe to assume I’ll not be doing any of that in the foreseeable future. The job of the civil service is to support the government of the day. Part of that responsibility is to have difficult conversations with politicians, to say we are the experts here and to advise politicians on what they do and don’t do. Right now those conversations are simply not happening. On 13 July 2016, Theresa May, in her first public address as prime minister, said: “If you’re from an ordinary working-class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise … If you’re one of those families, if you’re just managing, I want to address you directly ... the government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours.” Bold words. Two years on and what has really been done to set the country on this path or heal the rifts that the Brexit vote laid bare? The answer is precious little. The current government will point to the impossible challenge of removing the UK from the European Union coupled with a parliamentary arithmetic that means they can’t really do anything that requires controversial legislation. What this amounts to is a government that can’t govern. Westminster is as inward looking as ever, and it is not only politicians who are to blame. Senior leaders within the civil service are just as focused on their own agendas and ambitions, even as most departments face severe restrictions on their finances. Headcounts have been reduced, civil servants are being encouraged to work outside the office to reduce costs and in some cases we are relying on recent graduates with no previous policy experience to deliver key government objectives. Small policy changes that make little material difference are lauded as a triumph, while proper reform to help vulnerable people is completely absent. Changes don’t happen unless the policy makes a saving or there’s a challenge in the courts. The policy response to an existing problem is “let’s review it”. That is not the right response and that attitude can’t continue. This is a toxic environment where every criticism is a crisis, where constant cabinet reshuffles mean civil servants have to start work on policies all over again. Fear is everywhere, and the default position is to “hold the line” and maintain everything is working as it should. Special advisers lurk around every corner. Recently, I had to sit in front of a room full of some of the country’s most senior public servants and be shouted at by ministers as a result of defending current policy – their policy. “Official bashing” is a favourite tactic of this current set of ministers when faced with a hostile room. Despite the stalemate, the demands placed on my time are excessive. I regularly work 60-hour weeks and at weekends. I take calls at the crack of dawn and late into the night. It’s no coincidence that my department now has massive mental health drives and “mindfulness” workshops. Enjoying a proper work life balance is a distant memory. And this is all in pursuit of maintaining the status quo; this is not governing in the interests of the people.This series gives a voice to the staff behind the public services that are hit by mounting cuts and rising demand, and so often denigrated by the press, politicians and public.

He is, according to an anonymous source in the Sun, “reshaping his sound so it is more in line with the church’s values and beliefs”. It could be a risky move, but perhaps not as risky as it might once have been. “We’re reaching a point where, especially with North American artists, less so with UK ones, it’s fine to talk about your faith, especially from a Christian perspective,” says Tshepo Mokoena, UK editor of Noisey, Vice’s music site. “A good example is Chance the Rapper who is hugely successful, isn’t afraid to put [his faith] in his music or talk about it on social media. “I think because musicians now have a much more direct route to communicating with their fans, they don’t have to hide elements of themselves if it fits into their brand. With Chance the Rapper it does – he’s all about positivity, loving people, lots of things that the way Americans view religion really fits.” Bieber might benefit in the same way. “In December, he shared a really passionate Instagram post [with] a #Jesus. It seems a bit corny but I’m sure for someone like him, with much younger fans, it could end up feeling quite inspiring,” adds Mokoena. In the past, a Christian faith was something to be hidden away or ridiculed. For those embracing a newfound faith, it seemed safer if you had already built your credibility – Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash and Alice Cooper all weathered the born-again tag. For artists starting out, it still seems to be something to be buried, especially in the UK. “It definitely has negative connotations,” the rapper Guvna B told the Radio 2 faith show Good Morning Sunday at the weekend, adding there were radio stations that didn’t play his music because of it. He pointed to artists such as Stormzy and Kendrick Lamar as people whose Christian faith hasn’t held them back. “They’re not branded as Christian artists, so I guess it’s more acceptable.” “The idea of what is considered cool and uncool is framed so much more now by believing in who you are and if being religious is part of that, then it subverts the whole idea,” says Mokoena. Previously the idea of what makes a rock star was very defined, she says, but the music industry has moved away from that. “Now the definition is so broad – it’s all about how you handle your popularity rather than being a white guy in a leather jacket who takes loads of drugs every night.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/27/treasury-inquiry-tax-havens-stain-britain-cleanup","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Tax havens are a stain on Britain – the cleanup starts now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/treasury-inquiry-tax-havens-stain-britain-cleanup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/treasury-inquiry-tax-havens-stain-britain-cleanup","fields":{"headline":"Tax havens are a stain on Britain – the cleanup starts now","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Guardian’s Panama and Paradise Papers investigations confirmed what had long been rumoured: tax havens, and the rules of financial secrecy that underpin them, have enabled the world’s financial elite to hide their cash away from public scrutiny, to the detriment of us all. Yet we in Britain cannot claim to be innocent bystanders. Though we have long led the way on international efforts to clamp down on money laundering and cross-border crime, half of the 240,000 shell companies used by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca to help the wealthy dodge tax were incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. This overseas territory proudly flies the union jack as part of its flag, boasting as its motto Vigilante (“Be vigilant”). Yet it appears to have looked the other way as the world’s financial elite used its legal structures to hide their wealth from prying eyes. The BVI are far from alone. Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are on the EU greylist of uncooperative tax jurisdictions. If they do not cooperate further, they may be placed on the blacklist. We should regard it as a matter of national shame that the crown dependencies and overseas territories that fly our flag give shelter to the wealth of the world’s financial elite. But we should be angry. HMRC’s figures from 2015-16 showed that 6% of tax due in Britain went uncollected – a whopping £34bn. About £1.7bn of this came from avoiding tax by taking legal steps to minimise one’s liability and an estimated £5.2bn came from evading tax illegally. With our public finances strained, it is an insult to diligent taxpayers that multinational firms and high-net-worth individuals can use a complex myriad of loopholes and accounting gymnastics to minimise their tax bill. That’s why parliament – and government – need to get a serious handle on this problem. Over the next six months, I will be chairing a Treasury subcommittee inquiry into avoidance and evasion, aiming to unpick the failures of policy and resourcing that have allowed the tax base to be undermined. We need to be sure that HMRC attracts the best and the brightest, who will be dogged and determined in making sure everyone pays what they owe, and has the resources it needs from government. We’ll be pressing government hard, too. Ministers need to account for the holes in the tax system. They also need to explain how the relationship with crown dependencies and overseas territories works, and how they can clamp down. I want to hear from the dependencies and territories themselves. It was the great Labour prime minister Clement Attlee who wrote: “If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly.” Never has that been more true than today. • John Mann is Labour MP for Bassetlaw and chair of the Treasury subcommittee"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/26/vote-leave-brexit-funding-democracy-sovereignty-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T17:45:38Z","webTitle":"Rules matter, and if Vote Leave cheated, that’s a scandal | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/vote-leave-brexit-funding-democracy-sovereignty-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/vote-leave-brexit-funding-democracy-sovereignty-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Rules matter, and if Vote Leave cheated, that’s a scandal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"So far, we know that the Vote Leave campaign reached its spending limit before it reached the end of its money, and funnelled £625,000 into BeLeave, as well as £100,000 into Veterans for Britain. We have been told, thanks to the testimony of Shahmir Sanni, that this money didn’t even touch the bank account of BeLeave. One piquant detail is that Sanni had been working as a volunteer, first for Vote Leave, then for BeLeave, and had hoped that this last-minute cash influx might pay for his train fares, only to find that it went straight to AggregateIQ, the data firm with links to Cambridge Analytica. If there’s a more poignant vignette about the exploited millennial – first they use his free labour, then they out him in public, then they contradict him, and they wouldn’t even stand him a Pret a Manger sandwich and a travelcard in the process – I can’t think of it.

In his rebuttal, Stephen Parkinson (once Vote Leave, now working for Theresa May) released an official statement from No 10 saying that he had met Sanni through a mutual friend at university – a claim disproved by the email trail in which Sanni introduces himself through the whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Parkinson also said, in another official statement that has now been removed, that any advice given to BeLeave was in his capacity as Sanni’s “date”. It’s a cliche, it’s been on The West Wing, everybody knows it and yet that doesn’t dent its wisdom: when a scandal breaks, the only thing to do is tell the truth, tell all of it, tell it straight away. In real life, though, this is not what happens. Instead the scandal is dismissed, the dismissals fall apart, the scandal begins to look more serious, the tone plummets, and by the time you know exactly what happened, the event has become a carrier issue for a broader debate: what kind of person are you? Are you a privacy and transparency kind of person, or a win-any-way-you-can kind? Are you the kind who thinks we’re all being controlled by new media we can’t hope to understand, and the turbulence of the world is merely a reflection of this new wild west? Or are you the kind who thinks a few bob here and there couldn’t possibly make a difference to a result, that people aren’t idiots, and if everyone believed everything they read on Facebook, we’d all have a pair of Mahabis slippers and wake up every morning making a list of the things we’re grateful for? Those fault lines, as vital as they are for the heating up of divisions that make our current politics so spicy, are diversionary. The use of personal data, its ethics and efficacy, is fascinating but separate. The immediate importance of this story is whether or not electoral spending limits were breached. The harmonised chorus telling investigators – including the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr, Channel 4, Jolyon Maugham’s Good Law Project – to stop digging has many melodies: that no breach occurred; that no amount of money could have bought this “overwhelming” result; that the electorate is bored of talking about the referendum and just wants done with it; that the Electoral Commission has already investigated twice. There is truth to every argument, in amounts varying from absolute-but-irrelevant to homeopathic, but none makes any difference to the substantive case. If we believe that democracy is made meaningful not by aerated statements in its praise but by the rules that govern its execution, and if we believe there’s a chance that those rules have been broken, it would be incurious not to check. We can guess the shape of the next argument because it will be exactly the shape of the argument over every other hurdle to Brexit: Northern Irish border? The people have spoken (but … but what about Irish people?) Freedom of movement? The people have spoken. The referendum was an earthquake, a revolution, a surge of anger against the establishment by an honest and passionate populace. Defy them on a technicality? There’ll be blood on the streets if you do. With a regularity that should be breathtaking but of course, being regular, no longer is, rules and laws are portrayed as the nefarious and opaque means of returning power to the hands of the authorities, whence “society” successfully wrested it 21 months ago. Yet a lawless discursive terrain, one in which rules can be fuzzed away with a deeper appeal to feelings, is nothing more than inept, early-stage authoritarianism. Yesterday, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, gave a speech in Birmingham that was like a mirage of coherent analysis in a desert of nonsensical assertion; as unusual as it was, in that its arguments were supported and their evidence verifiable, its true distinction was practical. Starmer means to introduce an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill: should the government be defeated on the deal it brings back in October, it must then be for parliament to decide what happens next. The coming 20 years are too important to be decided by an executive that can’t even make its mind up about fish. The current choice – vote with the government or crash out of Europe, or, to give it its full Noel Edmonds title, deal or no deal – fails to meet any basic standards. It is, paradoxically, both dry and terrifying to see politics reach this pitch, where the future of so many can rest on the success or failure of an amendment. That, ultimately, is the nature of the rule of law: like a seatbelt, it’s not interesting until you need it. Disasters aren’t averted by equally passionate forces hurtling from the other direction; rather, by the sober measures put in place in calmer times, to ensure that heady rhetoric and base cash at least undergo the scrutiny and challenge of representative democracy before they carry the day. All parliamentarians, leave and remain, need to ask themselves what it means if Vote Leave broke the electoral rules: on what grounds would the result remain valid? And if invalid, is there any alternative to a second referendum? All of them, leave and remain, need to ask searching questions about the role of parliamentarians if it is not to shape the coming negotiations with Europe, when May and her team run out of the ideas that are already flimsy and mutable. The first step towards healing the national divisions that everyone acknowledges is neither to heap sarcastic love upon our opponents, Boris Johnson-style, nor to harp constantly on about the will of the winners. The way back to any kind of consensus is to insist upon a parliamentary democracy with its rules and principles intact. This is what sovereignty means: building the rules together, not changing them unless it’s together, and playing by them together. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/the-cult-of-being-kind","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"The cult of being kind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/the-cult-of-being-kind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/the-cult-of-being-kind","fields":{"headline":"The cult of being kind","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"One cold morning in Bristol, a man named Gavyn Emery tied a scarf to a lamppost, and on a cardboard tag wrote: “I am not lost.” It was 2016, and rough sleeping in Bristol had risen by more than 800% in seven years. As temperatures plummeted, more people were inspired to do the same, wrapping trees in coats, sticking hats on bollards, warmth for anybody who needed it. Scarves started appearing in Cornwall, Glasgow, London, Cambridge; across the UK through this very long winter it was possible to see a blossoming compassion, visible in wool. Kindness is not new. It’s old, pretty old. Aristotle said: “It is the characteristic of the magnanimous man to ask no favour but to be ready to do kindness to others.” Kindness is mankind’s “greatest delight,” said Roman philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius. And yet, for a long time it has been seen as sort of… suspicious. As religion’s hold on our culture has weakened, and with it the insistence upon loving thy neighbour, a certain selfishness has come to be expected. To be kind is also to be weak, unfocused on achievement. Unsuccessful. Kindness is seen as a nostalgic throwback to simpler times, or worse, a con. A man who throws his coat over the puddle is a man who onlookers suspect must be protecting something valuable in the mud. To go out of one’s way to be kind suggests an ulterior motive – who has time to look up from their phone, let alone expose themselves to the discomfort of empathising with a stranger? When Britain had just voted to leave the EU, the author Rachel Cusk wrote an essay about rudeness which she felt was “rampant”. “People treat one another with a contempt that they do not trouble to conceal,” she said. At the airport, she noticed strangers looking “suspiciously at one another, not sure what to expect of this new, unscripted reality, wondering which side the other person is on”. But as our new “reality” has bedded in, something is changing. Today, kindness is not only fashionable, appearing in a flood of news stories about everyday heroism, but it’s profitable. Online, hashtags highlight small acts of kindness witnessed in public, and GoFundMe campaigns raise thousands for people in need. The publishing industry is calling the trend for kindness “up lit” – as in, illuminated from below, to expose one’s best angles. After a year of dark thrillers, today they’re investing in feelgood stories of empathy and care. Christie Watson’s The Language of Kindness comes out in May. A memoir about her career as a nurse, it sparked a 14-way bidding war and is being turned into a TV drama by the producers of Poldark. “If the way we treat our most vulnerable is a measure of our society,” she writes, “then the act of nursing itself is a measure of our humanity.” Through stories about her experiences with patients, she reminds readers that we will all, eventually, come to rely on the kindness of strangers. Ahead of the launch of Jaime Thurston’s book, Kindness: The Little Thing That Matters Most, HarperCollins ran a campaign encouraging acts of kindness because, said Carolyn Thorne, editorial director: “Kindness is not just a book we are publishing but a chance to change cultural attitudes... When kindness is shared, it grows.” It grows. Literary agent Juliet Mushens, whose business partner Robert Caskie just sold debut author Libby Page’s novel The Lido for a fortune, twice – a story about a community, where a young woman befriends an 86-year-old widow to save a swimming pool – welcomes this move towards hopeful stories. “My feeling is that given the constant depressing news cycle, people are looking for a way to escape into fiction, and into more hopeful narratives.” She adds: “I would argue that these stories can be political in their own way. They can inspire the audience to fight for change on a personal level, and remind us that the individual choices we make can have a wider impact.” When Piers Wenger became the controller of BBC drama commissioning in 2016, he announced his intention to bring a lightness back to entertainment. “I think there is an awful lot of very dark drama across all channels and I’d love to see some more inspiring stories,” he explained. “I would love a Sunday night show which examines heroism and what it means to be a hero.” Note the preface “super” is missing. To be a hero today is simply to be a person who leans into the vulnerability that comes with seeing other people’s problems. It is to tie a scarf around a tree. Being a hero today requires no expert skills, no powers of flying or invisibility – in fact, one of the things that has helped devalue kindness over the past 30 or so years is the fact that we all know how to do it, we have done since we were children, but as a mark of our power and importance, choose not to. Being a hero today is to not look away. Heroic storytelling extends to the news media, too. Open the New York Times and, since December, you will have found a column called The Week in Good News, right there on page two. A supercolony of penguins found near Antarctica, a SpongeBob musical, drugs that could delay prostate cancer… “The intention,” explains columnist Des Shoe, “is to provide an antidote to what can seem like an endlessly heavy news cycle.” Her column presents a curated selection of good news, including regular stories about “average people doing good work for others”. “I think people are yearning for good news because in the age of push notifications, the crush of stories about tragic things happening in the world can seem overwhelming.” We want a reminder that, despite the swamp of death and poverty we scroll through, all is not lost. This “yearning” means there’s a market for more. “People want good news. They spend time on good news, they seek it out and they look for more. Our readers have asked for much more of this type of coverage.” And stories of kindness lead to clicks. The move towards kindness mirrors the rise of “happiness” pursuits earlier this decade, when a political interest in the value of happiness coincided with academic studies, a self-help movement towards joy, and the relentless counting of one’s blessings. In his book The Happiness Industry, William Davies reported that a growing number of corporations were employing chief happiness officers, while Google had its own “jolly good fellow”. Soon, happiness as a movement began to be questioned. It was pointed out that the political push for happiness grew as cuts in benefits and healthcare deepened. It coincided with a huge rise in prescribed antidepressants. Notions of happiness relied on a fuzzy vagueness: there was the suggestion that this noisy push for happiness was a way to displace attention from the causes of unhappiness itself. But while happiness and kindness are undoubtedly linked, the difference is that happiness is passive, while kindness is active. At Springwell, for instance, a special school in Barnsley, where many students have suffered abuse, neglect or poverty, teachers have vowed to approach every child with what they call “unconditional positive regard” – or, as the principal Dave Whitaker says, they “batter the children with kindness”, and it seems to be working. Like happiness, kindness is difficult to quantify – we have no way of knowing whether people are becoming kinder, no apps to mine for data, few scarves to photograph – but we can count the stories of kindness that proliferate, often in tandem with those of the effects of austerity. A class of kids singing Happy Birthday to a stranger on the train; the ‘Pay it Forward’ movement; the “book fairies” hiding novels around Cornwall. In the US this month, in the wake of teachers reporting higher anxiety in the classroom, a survey aimed to discover what children thought about kindness in the era of Trump. Only 14% “strongly agreed” their nation’s leaders “model how to treat people with kindness”. But researchers also noted an upward trend in social and emotional skills. While almost two-thirds said they had been bullied at some time, 8 in 10 said they’d gone out of their way to do something kind for another child, and nearly half said they have done so “many times”. Which is cheering, really, in the same way that Bristol’s scarves are – cheering with the lemon sourness of melancholy. Cheering, in that times have got so dark, with so many people in trouble, that we are finding new reservoirs of kindness and a new appetite for generosity. The concern is that children, with their easy kindness, still wet with lessons about “how to be nice”, soon grow up. Kindness – “not sexuality, not violence, not money – has become our forbidden pleasure”, historian Barbara Taylor and psychoanalyst Adam Phillips wrote in their 2009 essay On Kindness. “Kindness is not just camouflaged egoism,” they insist. “To this old suspicion, modern post-Freudian society has added two more: that kindness is a disguised form of sexuality, and that kindness is a disguised form of aggression – both of which again reduce kindness to a covert selfishness.” They make the case that, due to these suspicions, we are all battling against our innate kindness. It was 2013 and Jaime Thurston was scrolling through a second-hand furniture website when she came across a wanted ad: a single mother looking for a rug to cover her broken floor so her children wouldn’t cut their feet. Thurston, sensing desperation, called her and learned more about the situation she’d fled. It led to her starting a charity called 52 Lives, where people nominate “someone in need of kindness”. “We are living in a strange world,” she says, “a virtual world, full of comparison and isolation. We spend so long staring at our phones and avoiding real contact with people, and it ultimately makes us unhappier and lonelier. So I think people are searching for something fulfilling. I think kindness unlocks something deep within people.” Does reading about kindness perform a similar function? Or, today are we seeking out stories of kindness in order to practise the action in our head before performing it – seeing these people in need, stretching the muscle memory required to offer a hand? By all accounts, we have got to this point through desperation. It was no longer viable to walk on by. “Kindness has so many benefits,” insists Thurston. “When we are kind to someone, it doesn’t just help that person, it is scientifically proven to improve our own physical and mental health as well. So at a time when rates of depression and anxiety seem to be skyrocketing, kindness could be a very simple but powerful antidote.” In June, psychotherapist Padraig O’Morain publishes Kindfulness. He’s found that: “People who practise self-compassion, which is kindness towards oneself, are good at taking on challenges… It is often our own condemnation that we most fear.” Rather than random acts of kindness to others, O’Morain focuses on an inward-looking kindness. “It’s saying, ‘Look, even though you’ll never run a marathon before you go to work every day, or polish off your entire to-do list to universal applause by 11am, or become a tech billionaire before you’re 25, you’re OK, you’re fine, relax.’” Kindness then, to service the self. Perhaps this is the key to the new wave of kindness. We perform kindnesses in response to darkness and, in turn, our lives are improved. Which means that rather than old-fashioned or altruistic, kindness is as modern as it gets. Is it rising not just because in cold times we’re compelled to offer scarves to those shivering, but because taking part makes us feel more successful? Well. Small steps, gently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/27/why-im-suing-over-my-dream-internship","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Why I’m suing over my dream internship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/27/why-im-suing-over-my-dream-internship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/27/why-im-suing-over-my-dream-internship","fields":{"headline":"Why I’m suing over my dream internship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The first time I encountered a digital toilet seat was at the central London headquarters of Monocle, the self-consciously chic monthly magazine and 24-hour digital radio station for those who enjoy their geopolitics served with a side of artisanal Swiss sunglasses. The futuristic commode offered a spa function and heated up automatically on contact, which was odd; a warm toilet seat feels as if the previous occupant is still lurking. The effect was heightened because, as the intern on the morning shift, I got in at 5.30am, and besides a security guard doing the rounds and a studio manager on a different floor, I was entirely on my own. My job was to help Monocle 24 prepare for its 7am radio show. Throughout each shift, I wrote detailed research briefings for producers on topics as varied as North Korea, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Finnish literary stars; ferried mail across three floors; fact-checked senior journalists’ raw copy, and transcribed interviews. On any given day, I might greet former diplomats, columnists, artists, designers and the guy who wrote the song Wichita Lineman and usher them into the studio to be interviewed on air. Occasionally, interns would also be called upon to double as human FedEx boxes; one was flown to Milan to hand-deliver a selection of books and magazines to Tyler “I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing purple” Brûlé, Monocle’s jet-setting founder and editor-in-chief, who was visiting the city for fashion week. It was a canny shipping method: for every nine-hour shift, Monocle interns are paid £30. Sure, £30 a day works out at around the same hourly rate as an illegally exploited UK garment factory worker, but when I was accepted last year, I was thrilled. As one of five interns on a two-month editorial post, I had elbowed out dozens of other young hopefuls to take my ergonomic seat at Monocle’s blond-wood workbenches. I couldn’t wait to join the multilingual staff, who – almost without exception – donned statement spectacles and box-fresh trainers teamed with rolled-up jeans. During my interview, the managing editor made it clear that while I would be encouraged to pitch and write articles, anything published during the internship would be unpaid. I would, however, get to know the section editors, so after the internship I would be able to pitch at a rate of 80p per word – unheard of for a young freelance writer. I was told that several of the top section editors started as interns. On my first day, I inhaled the contents of Monocle’s intern handbook, an 18-page document that every intern – roughly 30 each year – is given when they start. It covered everything from what to wear (“Important people are often touring our offices and it is necessary for everyone to look put-together and professional”), to where to eat (never at your desk), to where to hang your coat (in the cupboard – Tyler believes “in a tidy ship. No jackets on the backs of chairs”). “Monocle’s interns are given a lot of responsibility, and there will often be several demands on your time at once,” the handbook counselled. “Don’t panic! Ask which task is the most urgent and focus on that one first … ” In practice, this meant that, from day one, you are up and running – often literally. Shuttling between floors carting a heavy mailbag, clearing up the studios, straightening display books, manning reception. You could be in the middle of transcribing a two-hour interview or research briefing for a senior editor, then be asked to take a 20-person coffee order for a delegation of advertisers from Turkish Airlines. Sometimes I ended up finishing a transcription on my lunch break or on the bus home, or asking another intern for help. If a staff member needs an intern to do something, they send an email asking “all interns” to pick up the task. It’s then a race to be the first of the five to answer. We all wanted to be first, because being first meant being noticed. And this meant having a chance of being thought of as special enough to eventually make it as a full-time Monocle employee. Monocle is special. While every other newspaper and magazine seems to be having fire sales, handing out P45s, going online-only or resorting to clickbait, Monocle does the opposite. It is well-known for standing firm in its commitment to print. And, confounding many naysayers, it is profitable, with a value in 2017 of $47m (£33m). It is not uncommon for Brûlé to extol his company’s bottom line: “[Print is] the cash cow … I would say we are one of the strong performers of the UK newsstand.” It is not hard to see why scores of hopeful writers, critics, podcasters, commentators and “influencers” cram Monocle’s inbox with CVs, and don’t hesitate when offered the chance to take up an internship for a daily wage that amounts to little more than a cinema ticket, a pint and a packet of fags. Halfway through my internship, I landed my first front-page piece for Monocle’s Summer Weekly newspaper. It was a personal coup, but after 20 hours of research and writing – done in my own time – the thrill of a byline paled against the glaring fact that I was not being paid for the story. The privilege of working for almost nothing no longer seemed like a viable way to get ahead. A few months later, I would start proceedings against Monocle for unpaid wages. * * * If you have an MP, watch films, read magazines, wear clothes or enjoy anything vaguely cultural, chances are you have enjoyed the fruits of an unpaid intern’s labour. Britain is addicted to internships. The most recent figures suggest there are at least 70,000 interns, around a third of whom are unpaid. Most work in politics, journalism, fashion and other creative fields. Eight-hour working days, paid at the £7.05 minimum wage, for 23,000-odd graduate-age interns, comes to more than £1.3m a day. Unpaid interns – or those, like me, paid well below the minimum wage, often on an “expenses only” basis – present a tidy saving for British industry. Since the financial crash, the number of internships in the UK has exploded, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). As the economy stumbled around 2007, free labour became an attractive way to cut budgets while keeping the coffee percolating, the mail circulating and the website copy uploading. At the same time, culturally elite industries were flooded with young talent, who had little option but to work for free: although more and more people have been going to university in the past decade or more, the contraction in the economy meant that there were fewer and fewer jobs for them to take up once they graduated. IPPR calls these out-of-college, out-of-work graduates “the inbetweeners”. At the beginning, most internships only lasted “about two weeks”, I was told by Tanya De Grunwald of Graduate Fog, a website dedicated to the fair treatment of graduates. But by 2010, internships were thoroughly entrenched in the creative industries, politics and the media, and De Grunwald started hearing about “eternal interns” who were working for a year for no money. That same year, Luciana Berger, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, found that 467 unpaid interns were working in 34 organisations funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Even as the state of the economy began to improve, companies found they couldn’t shake their reliance on free labour; it was too easy to skimp by relying on a steady stream of unpaid drudges. A phrasebook of euphemisms for such work soon appeared in job ads: “placements”, “work shadowing opportunities” and “voluntary positions”. Today, firms have access to even sometimes highly skilled workers for low or no pay, while insecure positions and interns have come to replace a whole strata of entry-level paid jobs. The National Union of Journalists reports that 82% of new entrants into journalism undertake internships, which average at seven weeks, and nearly all of these – 92% – are unpaid. In the past couple months, for example, you could have joined Vivienne Westwood, one of the UK’s most celebrated fashion houses, as an unpaid “product development intern” – you just needed Photoshop, InDesign and Excel skills, and to be free “approximately five days a week between 10am and 6pm”. If you secured a “French Connection PR and marketing placement”, you would compile trend reports and product mailers, manage and update the media database, monitor daily press clippings and compile weekly internal press coverage reports, among other duties. The gig lasts nine months, with the “option to extend to 12”. The pay: a zone 1-6 travelcard, and lunch money – as long as you provide receipts. The House of Commons is also “rife” with unpaid interns, according to Alec Shelbrooke, the Conservative MP for Elmet and Rothwell. “I see it all around,” he told me. Housing minister Dominic Raab recently came under scrutiny for advertising an expenses-only “volunteer” position within his office on the job site W4MP, just before the government announced a crackdown on minimum-wage violations, which included unpaid internships. Shelbrooke pays his own intern according to parliamentary standards for entry-level work, which includes research, diary management and policy briefings – a salary of £21,960. But other interns with the same educational profile, working for other MPs, don’t get paid. Those MPs use workarounds such as a stipulation that the hours and tasks are voluntary – but with “suggested hours”, so there is a tacit understanding of what is expected. Meanwhile, the inbetweeners have come to see internships as an essential stepping stone to full-time work. In one of the few academic papers looking into the practice of UK unpaid internships, researchers Sabina Siebert and Fiona Wilson from the University of Glasgow found that six in 10 agreed that the work they undertook was exploitative. They complained of the expense of working for free, getting treated like “dogsbodies” and getting few opportunities to engage in complex tasks. But, despite all this, 71% saw their hours, days and months of uncompensated toil as the “legitimate way to find work”. “I don’t know of anyone who has got a job without a work placement,” one of the respondents said. They believed that by working for free they would acquire access to information channels and contacts that would eventually lead to paid work. Social theorists call this “cultural capital”, and acquiring it often means foregoing actual capital, at least for a while. Siebert and Wilson found that “to get ahead”, prospective interns were prepared to work up to a 1,000 hours for free. One thousand hours is around six months. The Sutton Trust estimates that the bare minimum it costs to live in London, where up to 85% of all internships in sectors such as the arts and journalism are based, is £1,019 a month (and when they say “minimum”, they mean it; £1,000 in the capital would likely secure you a month’s rent in a shared house and a zone 1-3 tube fare, leaving you with the princely sum of around £1 per meal). Now you can even pay to be an intern. A company called Global Experiences arranges summer internships averaging eight weeks in a variety of fields – including journalism in London at a “leading political magazine” – for $10,000. If a six-month internship effectively costs the intern £6,000, then we are limiting this opportunity to gain experience, and to participate in some key areas of public life, to those who can afford it. What happens when the only way our aspiring reporters, editors, policy researchers and curators can climb up the ladder is to work for free? What happens to equal opportunity and representation when only the privileged can make it on to the first rung? * * * The genius of Monocle having at least five interns at any given time – besides saving on wages for full-time admin assistants, production assistants and junior researchers – is that those interns compete to make the best impression on the editors. Many interns feel that it’s not good enough just to complete your daily tasks; their aim is to stand out. And the best way to do that is to pitch story ideas. So when an email marked for the attention of “All interns” arrived, calling for design or cultural pitches for the Summer Weekly newspaper, it was game on. The 48-page broadsheet was a new Monocle venture for 2017, printed every week throughout August, with a cover price of £5. It was packed with stories about Japanese startups, Kuwaiti media trends and Balkan business ideas, and the likes of Rolex, Chanel and Acqua di Parma took out full-page ads, which go for as much as $20,000. I found a story about the inaugural exhibition of the Palestinian Museum in the West Bank, and got myself a commission. On a sunny Saturday afternoon in late August, I was sitting in a park having lunch with my friends when an “urgent” email came in from a fact-checker asking me to clarify a few points in my article. Print deadlines were tight, and it was usual for fact-checkers to work over the weekend. I rushed home to my computer and looked up the answers. But as I sat typing, while my partner and friends were having lunch, it dawned on me that everyone else – the fact-checker who was emailing me, the subeditor, the features editor, the photographer, the picture editor, the printers, the people who supplied ink and paper to the printers – was being paid to work on this story. I had taken home £150 for a the week, and my byline had a monetary value of zero. This was the moment I fell out of love with my internship. You can only shrug off being paid in change if you’ve got somebody else picking up the tab. If my partner hadn’t had a well-paid job, I would not have had the money to eat that week, or any of the other weeks I worked at Monocle. My “job” was basically a hobby that someone else was funding. One of the other interns in my cohort juggled a second job at a ramen shop, but most had parents who subsidised their rent, bills, travel and food. Journalism has shifted to a greater degree of social exclusivity than any other profession, according to Alan Milburn, the former Independent Reviewer on Social Mobility and Child Poverty. In a report published in 2012 headlined “Fair access to professional careers”, he found that 49% of journalism students come from the top three socio-economic groups, and just 14% from the bottom three. The hard, ugly truth was that my byline was snatched away from hundreds – if not thousands – of qualified freelance and unemployed journalists who can’t afford to not get paid. A friend of mine who did his journalism MA with me – he graduated with a distinction, and speaks fluent French – was working full-time shuffling tourists in and out of the ferris-wheel pods at the London Eye, earning a little over the minimum wage. He would have loved the experience of working at Monocle, but couldn’t live for two months on £30 a day. When my piece came out, it made the front page of the paper, and was the lead article in the culture section. I was heartily thanked and congratulated by the editor and culture editor. My intern buddy came over excitedly waving the paper in front of me: “Duuude! You’ve legit got a front page article! Incredible!” While I was hardly in line for a Pulitzer, my work, if it was good enough to publish, should have had some monetary value – and of course, it did, to Monocle. Working that Saturday afternoon for free to help a $47m publishing company make its deadlines, I became convinced that something had to be done. * * * Cultural institutions, film and television, fashion and the media shape our hopes and dreams, and our stereotypes, and give us access to vital information. Imagine if poor, innercity kids never became star polo players, Ross Perlin writes in Intern Nation, his landmark book on internships in the US – it might be a loss for polo, but its impact on wider society would be limited. However, with the industries that feed on interns, the case is often very different. These professions affect the form our broader society takes. In the US, it’s easier for a working-class kid to enter business or the military than to penetrate the cultural elite, heavily concentrated in the “internship-crazy” professions, the anthropologist David Graeber observes. “A mechanic from Nebraska knows it is highly unlikely that his son or daughter will ever become an Enron executive, but it is possible,” Graeber writes. “But there is virtually no chance that his child, no matter how talented, will ever become a human rights lawyer or a drama critic for the New York Times.” And indeed, the system is designed this way. “The upper-middle classes find a way of moving goal posts,” said Lee Elliot Major, the CEO of the Sutton Trust. “Every time you expand an opportunity or education area, they find another way to create another barrier for those from other backgrounds.” First it was university, then it was expensive one-year masters’ programmes, and now it’s unpaid internships. Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a US thinktank, calls this “opportunity hoarding” – winning not by being better, but by rigging the competition in your favour. Erecting economic barriers to employment via the high cost of taking an internship is just one more way to reserve the highest-status jobs for the elite. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that the law is falling short. There isn’t even a legal definition of what an intern is, or what they should and should not be expected to do. According to the UK’s tax authority, HMRC, a person is generally classed as a “worker” and entitled to the minimum wage if: they have to turn up for work even if they don’t want to; they can’t send someone else in to do their work; and they have a contract, which doesn’t have to be written, or other arrangement to do work. Fixed hours, set days and obligatory tasks all make the minimum wage mandatory. But companies routinely choose to see the law as more of a suggestion. “Most people, when they hear the word ‘internship’ think ‘work experience’, but what they should really think is: ‘starter job’,” Reeves said. And all jobs, starter or otherwise, call at least for the minimum wage. After four years in parliament, Alec Shelbrooke had seen and heard enough to feel that something had to be done. In 2014, he sponsored a private member’s bill on the “prohibition of unpaid internships”, which sought to end the practice of employers using internships to avoid paying the minimum wage. But it was “talked out” and blocked during its first reading in parliament. “I knew it would be,” Shelbrooke said. “[Then prime minister David] Cameron didn’t support the idea. He didn’t get it, said it ‘reduced opportunity’.” A 2011 YouGov report found that around 40% of internships are turned down because people can’t afford to do them. “It’s laughable that anyone can say this will reduce opportunity,” said Shelbrooke. “It will only get rid of the bad opportunities.” Shelbrooke proposed another bill on the subject in 2016. It sparked a fierce debate, but was blocked by other Conservative MPs. Their argument was that the bill could undermine existing employment law: if interns met the legal definition of workers, they were already entitled to the minimum wage. However, by the end of 2017, tens of thousands of young people were still working for free. “It is clear that the law isn’t working,” Peter Lampl, the founder and chair of the Sutton Trust, said last month. Last year saw the publication of a report called Good Work: the Taylor Review of Modern Working Practices, which examined how new forms of work affect workers’ rights and employers’ obligations. It recommended that the government “clarifies” the interpretation of the law and encourages enforcement action by HMRC. Five-hundred and fifty letters have been sent to businesses in recent months, warning them against violating the minimum-wage law. The penalty is payment of arrears to the worker, a fine of 200% of those arrears, and the company being named on the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy’s list of shame, alongside Primark and SportsDirect, and dozens of other businesses including hotels, hairdressers, employment agencies and more. Tanya De Grunwald believes that interns speaking up and making an example of businesses is a necessary step towards ending this practice. “Publicly ‘squaring up’ to employers, in real time, is one of the most effective tactics we have in the fight for fairly paid internships,” she said. “But, for obvious reasons, very few interns feel brave enough to do this.” This might also have something to do with a chilling piece of evidence that Siebert and Wilson uncovered: people working for free who complained about lack of pay “quickly became unemployable”. This creates a culture where the fear of victimisation in the labour market normalises the expectation of unpaid work. De Grunwald said that, as a result of continued pressure from Graduate Fog and others, such as Intern Aware, many sectors have shifted their “relaxed” views about unpaid work. Many of the bigger, more high-profile companies, she said, such as the “big four consultancies” have largely stopped the practice. Unpaid internships in journalism, politics and the arts, however, persist. * * * As long as the applications roll in and the participants remain keen and competent, it is in neither the employers’ or many of the interns’ interests to make a fuss – if you’re desperate enough to accept payment in experience and contacts, you’re perhaps unlikely to voice concern. One Conservative peer has made it his mission to speak up for them. “Britain was built on key, fundamental ‘small-L liberal’ values: fairness, dignity and the rule of law,” said Chris Holmes, a former paralympic swimming gold medallist. “Having people working for two months, four months, a year, more than that, for no pay – that doesn’t sit with any British value that I’m aware of,” he said. Holmes and I sat down in his office in the House of Lords in September last year, and he described his fight for his own private member’s bill to pass. It would, he said, set out employers’ obligations to pay the minimum wage to anyone who is working for more than four weeks – “no ifs, no buts”. (The Guardian has an editorial work experience scheme for students and aspiring journalists. These placements are unpaid, do not last longer than two weeks, and focus on learning about life in the newsroom.) The Sutton Trust has lent its support to this bill, arguing that failure to tackle unpaid internships prevents young people from low- and moderate-income backgrounds from accessing jobs in some of the most desirable sectors. The bill passed the committee stage without amendment earlier this month, and is awaiting a date for its third reading in the Lords, after which it will be passed to the House of Commons for further debate. Holmes has consulted widely in the business community, and believes that the four-week ceiling will mean true work shadowing and work experience opportunities will not be lost, but beyond four weeks, “if somebody is doing work, as a worker, no matter what role you label it, they won’t need to pluck up the courage to ask for minimum wage, or cite the law, or call HMRC – they will automatically get paid”. If the vote goes his way, he expects it to be passed sometime in the spring. We had been talking for an hour, and his guide dog was having a snooze, but Holmes was just getting fired up. “We’ve got a choice, all of us,” he said. “We can know things, and pretend we don’t know them, see or hear things and look the other way, or we can come across things, and in our own small way, try to make things better.” I knew exactly what I needed to do. De Grunwald put me in touch with Jo Maugham QC, founder of the Good Law Project, a non-profit organisation that uses legal expertise to help vulnerable workers assert their rights. He listened to my story. I told him about my fears about speaking out, and my worries about the cost to my career that asserting my rights could incur, but also about my desire to hold employers to account, to help stop this eternal carousel of free labour and, perhaps, to make journalism a tiny bit more accessible. “You are in a better position than most interns,” he said. “It’s what people mean when they say ‘check your privilege’.” In Monocle’s 10th anniversary edition, the editors paid tribute to their interns: “We have a short, sharp internship programme, which means that we get to meet a lot of people every year who are starting out on their careers. But a good intern is more than just someone who is here to learn: they have a lot to tell us too … ” So Monocle, since you’re listening, I have taken the first step in legal proceedings to claim my unpaid wages. I would also like you to start paying all of your current and future interns the statutory national minimum wage – and ideally the voluntary London living wage – so people like me can be paid fairly. But more than that, I would like you to do it so people unlike me – who can’t feed, clothe and house themselves for little more than £3 an hour – can have a fair crack at joining one of the most competitive and socially exclusive industries in this country. Monocle declined to comment for this article. By Monocle’s account, my internship was a success. On my last day, the editor said that the other departing intern and I had been “the best ever”. He presented me with a Monocle-branded tote bag and Monocle’s How to Make a Nation guide book (estimated value: £40). One of the interns replacing me, a Cambridge graduate, expressed delight that she was being paid at all. “Thirty quid a day is brilliant, I can even save,” she said. It turned out that she would be living with her parents in central London. I then left Monocle for the last time. I walked through reception – resisting the urge to straighten an errant book about Stockholm’s best bars on a display shelf – as streams of natural light gave all that they touched the gentle glow of an Instagram filter. One guest was sipping an espresso, served by an intern.

Around 50 students had been staging a lecture hall sit-in at the southern French university on Thursday to protest against the French president’s tightening of university entrance requirements when a group of men in black, many of them wearing balaclavas and masks, began beating the protesters and forcing them out. Video footage showed students screaming as masked men hit students with bits of wood. “They began hitting people,” said one student, who claimed the men also had stunguns. Several students lodged complaints to police. A legal investigation into “armed group violence” has been opened by the local prosecutor to determine the identities of the men. The French universities minister has demanded an inquiry and Montpellier University has opened its own investigation. Students in Lille called for a nationwide demonstration on Wednesday against Macron’s university reforms and what they called the heavy-handed treatment of student demonstrators. The Montpellier law and political sciences faculty remained closed on Monday, as student both for and against sit-in protests demonstrated outside. The law faculty dean, Philippe Pétel, at first told French media that he was in support of the lecture hall being evacuated. But he swiftly resigned last week. Philippe Augé, the Montpellier university head, told local radio the masked assault was “indescribable”, “shocking” and “showed an extreme violence.” He said he wanted to secure and reopen the university as soon as possible. Macron’s government has argued changes to university entrance procedure are essential. Every student in France who passes the baccalaureate high-school exam has the right to go to university in their home area, which has led to popular subjects such as law and psychology being heavily oversubscribed and prompted the introduction of an unpopular lottery system where demand is highest. Under Macron’s plans, the lottery system would be wound down and the hardest-pressed universities would be allowed to select students on merit. The government argued that a lack of specialisation at high school and the inability to select students had lead to a high university dropout rate. Around 60% of students in France do not finish their first year of university. The new law stops short of blanket selection, but some students argue it threatens France’s tradition of university education for all. Tension spilled on to the streets of Montpellier at the weekend as around 30 far-right demonstrators from the Ligue de Midi wearing red, white and blue masks engaged in a standoff with around 200 anti-fascist protesters. The anti-facist demonstrators included students who said far-right extremists were among the masked men who broke up the sit-in. Police struggled to keep the two groups apart amid stone-throwing and shouting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/26/divided-over-corbyns-decision-to-sack-owen-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T17:12:23Z","webTitle":"Divided over Corbyn’s decision to sack Owen Smith | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/26/divided-over-corbyns-decision-to-sack-owen-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/26/divided-over-corbyns-decision-to-sack-owen-smith","fields":{"headline":"Divided over Corbyn’s decision to sack Owen Smith","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Owen Smith was sacked (Report, 24 March) from the shadow cabinet not because he disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn, but because he publicly flouted the discipline of cabinet consensus. If he were honorable, he would have resigned in order to express his beliefs publicly. Instead he forced Corbyn to sack him, in order to play the martyr. This is one of the first of such shenanigans. From now until the local elections in May, we can look forward to a wearisome series of resignations, provocations leading to sackings, and other assorted manufactured controversies within the Labour party. Antisemitism, bullying, sexism, being “soft” on Russia, as well as alternative views on Brexit – all grist to the mill when it comes to confecting issues to undermine the party going into the elections. All this on top of the relentless media denigration of anything Corbyn tries to do. All those people throughout the country who are suffering as a result of the policies of this lamentable and vindictive government are being let down by the plotters on the right of the Labour party, who would rather see the party lose seats than work for success under Corbyn. And if the membership, tired of their antics, attempts to remove them from their lucrative jobs representing them, the media will immediately trumpet: “Takeover by hard left”. No! We just want policies that will benefit the majority of the populace, instead of benefiting those who have got rich at the expense of the rest of us. Hazel Davies Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside • Jeremy Corbyn’s arbitrary decision to sack Owen Smith from the shadow cabinet is deeply shocking and comes badly from a leader who has always claimed that party policy should be determined by the views of the rank and file. In the recent ICM poll, published in the Guardian, 77% of Labour voters called for a referendum on the exit terms, and 68% said they would vote to remain. Let the party conference decide. Last year Corbyn prevented any debate at all on Brexit. This year I would urge constituency Labour parties to bombard the conference with resolutions demanding a referendum and insist that they be voted on. Dick Leonard Party member since 1945 and former MP • The last time the Labour party conference discussed Brexit, in the autumn of 2016, it backed a motion stating that it “believes that unless the final settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining EU membership should be retained … The final settlement should therefore be subject to approval, through parliament and potentially through a general election or a referendum.” Good to see that Momentum’s drive to make the party more democratic is proving so successful.

The joint committee on human rights (JCHR), chaired by Harriet Harman, said its inquiry had not uncovered wholesale censorship of debate on university campuses as some media reporting had suggested, but warned there were nevertheless factors at work that actively limited free speech in universities. While some of these involved attempts by students to prevent debate of contested issues, the report also blamed university bureaucracy imposed on those organising events and restrictive guidance to student unions regarding freedom of speech on campuses. The committee’s report, published on Tuesday, said that although the problem was not pervasive, intolerant attitudes – often incorrectly using the banner of no-platforming and safe space policies – were nevertheless interfering with free speech on campus. It said safe-space policies, originally intended to ensure that minority or vulnerable groups felt secure, were being used by some people to seek to prevent the free speech of others whose views they disagreed with. The committee, which is made up of MPs and peers, identified problems with overly cautious student unions worried about breaking the rules; unduly complicated guidance from the Charity Commission, which regulates student unions as registered charities; and fear and confusion surrounding the government’s anti-terrorism Prevent strategy. The report concluded: “Any inhibition on lawful free speech is serious, and there have been such incursions, but we did not find the wholesale censorship of debate in universities which media coverage has suggested. “There are real problems which act as disincentives for students to put on challenging events and whilst most student union officers who responded to our survey [comprising 33 responses in all] say they are confident that they and their companions can speak freely, such disincentives could be having a wider chilling effect, which is hard to measure.” The inquiry was launched amid repeated claims from ministers, MPs and some sections of the media that freedom of speech in universities was under attack, blaming student attitudes for actively undermining free speech. Among those voices was the former universities minister Jo Johnson, who threatened to fine institutions who failed to uphold free speech. After hearing evidence from 34 witness and reading 109 written submissions, the committee concluded that much of the concern centred on a small number of incidents that had been widely reported. It said many of the incidents in which free speech was restricted revolved around discussion of a small number of key divisive issues, including abortion, transgender issues, Islamophobia and the Israel-Palestine conflict. Harman said: “Freedom of speech within the law should mean just that, and it is vital in universities. Evidence to the joint committee on human rights showed that there is a problem of inhibition of free speech in universities. “While media reporting has focused on students inhibiting free speech – and in our report we urge universities to take action to prevent that – free speech is also inhibited by university bureaucracy and restrictive guidance from the Charity Commission.” Publishing its own guidance for students and universities, the committee called for an independent review of the Prevent policy to assess what impact it was having on free speech in universities. It also called for the Charity Commission to review its guidance to student unions to ensure its actions did not unnecessarily limit free speech. The JCHR said student societies had the right to protest but should not try to stop events arranged by other student societies, and that groups or individuals holding unpopular opinions that were nevertheless within the law should not be shut down or subject to additional scrutiny by student unions or universities. Humanists UK’s chief executive, Andrew Copson, who gave evidence during the inquiry, said: ‘We are delighted that the joint committee on human rights has published comprehensive guidance to address the creep of censorship and intolerance in our universities. “We believe that this will go a long way in preventing the illegitimate shutting down of debate and activities on campus which has affected many universities in recent years, including several humanist students’ societies.” Responding to the report, the Charity Commission said: “What we expect of student unions’ trustees – as is expected of all charity trustees in accordance with charity law – is that when carrying out activities, they consider and take reasonable steps to assess and manage any associated undue risks to their charity and people who come into contact with it. “We recognise that the regulatory framework in this area can be difficult for student unions to navigate. Going forward we will continue to work closely with the Office for Students, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and other key stakeholders including the Department of Education, the National Union of Students and Universities UK to ensure that each of our respective regulatory roles and approaches are clearer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/from-the-archive-what-the-butler-saw-1971","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"From the archive: What the butler saw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/from-the-archive-what-the-butler-saw-1971","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/from-the-archive-what-the-butler-saw-1971","fields":{"headline":"From the archive: What the butler saw","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In 1971, being a gentleman’s butler was still a revered if endangered profession, and the Observer Magazine tracked down one of the last of his kind. Edward Howes, butler to Sir Michael Duff, Her Majesty’s Lord Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire, was exactly what you’d imagine a butler to be like – basically Carson from Downton Abbey but balder. When our journalist met Edward, he was dressed in pinstriped trousers, black tails and shoes so polished they could probably damage a retina if the sun reflected off them. Edward had just retired after a lifetime’s service to Sir Michael, whom he counted as a close friend. ‘We’ve had arguments and discussions, but never a row,’ says Edward, and after 30 years of darning someone’s underwear that is no mean feat. Darning aside, being a butler sounds more fun than one would imagine. Edward recounts ‘with a chuckle’ the debauchery that often occurred downstairs when Sir Michael was out of town: ‘The master hardly had his back turned before there was a party in the house. Footmen, valets and maids from round about came and pushed back the drawing room furniture and danced to the early hours.’ The servants also had access to an unlimited supply of beer. ‘The royal servants were always the biggest culprits,’ says Edward. ‘I like a beer myself, but I don’t care to be awash with it – I’m more serious about wine.’ Beer and house parties? Butlering sounds all right. And if those weren’t perks enough, Edward was given his own small pile, Howes Hall, in the grounds of the Vaynol Estate, which he shared with his wife, a former housemaid. When asked whether he would miss his butlering days, our journalist notes that: ‘Edward looks into the middle distance – like a man who once saw the Grail,’ before concluding, ‘I prefer retirement.’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/26/being-outed-by-downing-street-is-breathtakingly-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T14:29:06Z","webTitle":"Being outed by Downing Street is breathtakingly wrong | Hannah Jane Parkinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/being-outed-by-downing-street-is-breathtakingly-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/being-outed-by-downing-street-is-breathtakingly-wrong","fields":{"headline":"Being outed by Downing Street is breathtakingly wrong","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is quite something when it’s 2018 and the government is attempting to undermine people because they are gay, and not just that, but outing them. I never thought I’d see an official statement from No 10 outing an individual for political ends. But here we are, as the government’s rhetoric sinks ever lower. A Downing Street spokesperson, on behalf of the leave campaigner and Theresa May’s special adviser Stephen Parkinson, said of the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni: “Shahmir became an occasional volunteer for Vote Leave and other leave campaigns, and we began a personal relationship. We subsequently dated for 18 months, splitting up – I thought amicably – in September 2017.” The statement was the same as had been earlier published on the website of Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaign director. Sanni’s sexuality has absolutely nothing to do with his volunteering for Vote Leave, or the revelations he disclosed to the Observer. The implication of Parkinson’s statement, and Downing Street’s, is that Sanni’s whistleblowing was a revenge-of-the-ex move. Or as Sanni put it in an interview over the weekend: “The only reason that this was brought to light was just to make it seem that this was a vendetta, when it is not about me.” And that’s where Parkinson’s phrase “I thought amicably” comes in – as though Sanni was speaking out in spite, not because he was genuinely troubled by the practices of Vote Leave. The statement has since been removed from Cummings’ website after a letter from Sanni’s lawyers. Sanni was not publicly out. This carries extra import for him, because he is of Pakistani heritage, a country with a culture that is conservative when it comes to LGBT matters. Sanni’s mother did not know about his sexuality, and in Pakistan, certain homosexual acts are illegal, although laws aren’t always enforced. Since Sanni was outed, it has been reported that his family in Pakistan has had to have security put in place. I believe that LGBT people, where possible, have a responsibility to come out and be open about their sexuality. However, I also know that for some this either isn’t feasible or is incredibly difficult, whether because of external dangers or internal struggle. I would never condone the outing of anybody. I readily admit that in certain situations I would skirt the issue myself, either for safety fears or to avoid hassle. But the practice of being outed can never be supported: outing is often weaponised and always ignores the agency of the individual. To have one’s government, the body that is responsible for upholding the rights of its citizens or residents, to do so is quite breathtaking. One of the reasons Sanni said he spoke out on his experiences of Vote Leave’s campaigning was because of his admiration for Britain’s sense of decency – imagine his opinion on Britain’s sense of decency now. This isn’t the first time, of course, that people have been outed for political reasons. In 1975, the American Oliver Sipple helped prevent the shooting of President Gerald Ford when he grabbed the arm of an assailant. He was outed by the gay politician Harvey Milk, who felt Sipple’s heroics would reflect well on LGBT people, and help in the struggle for equal rights. Unfortunately, Sipple suffered a backlash, both public and personal. For years his mother refused to speak to him. After Sipple’s sexuality was revealed, he received just a cursory note of thanks from the White House, despite the fact he had probably saved the president’s life. In 2017, former Scottish Labour Party leader Kezia Dugdale said she was “outed against her will” when her sexuality was included in an article in the Fabian Review. The magazine disputed that account, but Dugdale’s comments speak to how important it is for people to come out on their own terms. If someone’s sexuality is not part of a public interest news story (Keith Vaz’s deception over male sex workers, for instance) then it is frankly nobody’s business. Even then, Vaz’s sexual preferences should not have been the focus of that story. It beggars belief that a government that is supposedly an ally of LGBT people (the prime minister appeared at the PinkNews awards last winter, “vowing to support LGBT rights”) would think it appropriate to announce an individual’s sexuality without their consent and to imply somehow that it was part of a deception (Theresa May, by the way, defended the statement outing Sanni). Stephen Parkinson should know how painful it is to be outed against one’s will, when something similar happened to him during his 2010 parliamentary campaign (something Nick Timothy pointed out to me on Twitter, though in defence of Parkinson). Parkinson felt pressured to come out after criticism of his stance on Section 28, elements of which he is on record as supporting – which is rather different. The media, too, should not be emphasising the sexuality of an individual where it has no relevance. Who could forget the Mail’s “Enemies of the People” front page in which it was pointedly mentioned in the online headline that one of the high court judges was “openly gay”. If we can’t trust the government to uphold our human rights (note: it’s Section 8, the “right to privacy and family life” under the European Convention on Human Rights) then what does that say about the country we live in? As Sanni puts it: “[Parkinson] knew the danger it would cause, and that’s why he did it. My coming out should have happened at a moment of my choosing – not his or the government’s. Some things are more important than politics and I hope that one day he agrees.” Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/26/why-labour-continues-to-struggle-with-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T14:44:04Z","webTitle":"Why Labour continues to struggle with antisemitism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/26/why-labour-continues-to-struggle-with-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/26/why-labour-continues-to-struggle-with-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Why Labour continues to struggle with antisemitism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn’s period at the head of Labour has been punctuated by a series of rows about antisemitic episodes, a toxic subject that has continued to trouble the party leadership despite an internal inquiry, numerous suspensions and repeated apologies. The disputes are often fuelled via social media, or by trawling through postings from years ago – and made especially potent because the subject is frequently seen through an internal left-right prism, of loyalty or otherwise to the man who has led the party since 2015. Against that backdrop, Corbyn’s Sunday night statement that the discriminatory sentiment has existed “in pockets within the Labour party” is significant, even though it was made after it emerged that he had appeared to condone an antisemitic mural in a Facebook posting from 2012. It was not meant to be like this. A debilitating period of antisemitic rows had prompted Corbyn to ask Shami Chakrabarti to conduct a party inquiry in the spring of 2016 in an attempt to draw a line under the issue at a time when over a dozen members had been suspended. One of those was Naz Shah, the MP for Bradford, who had suggested relocating Israel to the US in a Facebook posting made in 2014 before her election to parliament. Soon afterwards, Ken Livingstone waded in, repeatedly and stubbornly arguing that “Hitler supported Zionism” at the time the Nazi leader rose to power. Shah subsequently apologised for her postings and her suspension was lifted – but Livingstone, who was once a Corbyn ally, remains suspended. The former London mayor is one of many members who have spent more than a year awaiting an expulsion hearing, many of whom come from the party’s left and have historic links with Corbyn or the pro-Palestinian movement long supported by the party leader. His suspension, which had been due to end in April, was extended this month after Labour announced a fresh investigation over separate complaints. Corbyn’s critics view the Chakrabarti inquiry as a missed opportunity. When it concluded, Corbyn spoke in terms that failed to persuade those concerned about antisemitism that he was sufficiently conciliatory, and made an unnecessary semi-equivalence. “Our Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the Netanyahu government than our Muslim friends are for those of various self-styled Islamic states or organisations,” he said in a pre-prepared speech. Corbyn’s team later clarified that in his remarks he had been referring to states of an Islamic character, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran or Hamas in Gaza. But the Board of Deputies said it heard something different, voicing unhappiness that the party leader had established “some sort of equivalence” between Israel and Islamic State. In her report, Chakrabarti concluded that Labour “is not overrun by antisemitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism”. She did acknowledge that “I have heard too many Jewish voices express concern that antisemitism has not been taken seriously enough” and said that there was “an occasionally toxic atmosphere”. One example emerged on the day Chakrabarti’s report was launched. Ruth Smeeth, a Jewish Labour MP, walked out after a party activist Marc Wadsworth accused her of working with rightwing media to attack Corbyn. She tried to complain at the time and said she received no response from the leader’s office, although Wadsworth was suspended. (Wadsworth denies antisemitic behaviour and a party disciplinary hearing is due next month.) Since then Smeeth said she had experienced more than 25,000 instances of abuse following that episode from the public at large, including being called a “yid cunt”. In evidence supplied to the home affairs select committee, she said that she had had to employ security at the party conference in 2016. Wadsworth, meanwhile, is fighting his suspension, and a support page dated January this year says he is a “victim of the ongoing civil war in the party” and “his ‘crime’ was to call out Ruth Smeeth”. The subject was then given fresh impetus by activist journalist David Collier, who discovered earlier this month that Corbyn had been a member of a Facebook group called Palestine Live between 2013 and 2015, either shortly before or after he became party leader. Some of the postings in the group were controversial, including links to Holocaust denial, allegations of Israeli involvement in 9/11 and 7/7 terror attacks and conspiracy theories involving the Rothschild family. Labour’s leader said he didn’t trawl through the group’s postings and said that had he seen any of them “I’d have challenged it straight away”. However, with Corbyn’s social media back catalogue in focus, party backbencher Luciana Berger went back to an old story first published by the Jewish Chronicle in 2015. Her inquiry to the leader’s office for an explanation about his concerned reaction to the planned destruction of a clearly antisemitic mural in east London featuring obvious caricatures of Jewish bankers, came at a time when internal party tensions were heightened following criticisms of the leader’s response to the poisoning of the Skripals by some on the right. Once again the leadership struggled to offer an unqualified statement. The first response to Berger’s call for an explanation was to say he was defending freedom of speech before saying the mural was offensive; a second statement said: “I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image.” By then the subject of antisemitism was once again dominating coverage of Labour. • This article was amended on 29 March 2018 to add that Marc Wadsworth denies antisemitic behaviour and that a Labour disciplinary hearing is due next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/27/section-28-protesters-30-years-on-we-were-arrested-and-put-in-a-cell-up-by-big-ben","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Section 28 protesters 30 years on: ‘We were arrested and put in a cell up by Big Ben’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/section-28-protesters-30-years-on-we-were-arrested-and-put-in-a-cell-up-by-big-ben","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/27/section-28-protesters-30-years-on-we-were-arrested-and-put-in-a-cell-up-by-big-ben","fields":{"headline":"Section 28 protesters 30 years on: ‘We were arrested and put in a cell up by Big Ben’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lesbians stormed the BBC to protest about it. Twenty thousand Mancunians took to the city streets to march against it. Ian McKellen came out as gay to fight it. It inspired songs by Boy George and Chumbawamba, and an apology from David Cameron. You would be hard pressed to find a recent British law more controversial and more reviled than section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988. In the late 80s, the gay and lesbian people of the UK were loudly demanding equality, much to the chagrin of traditionalists. Section 28 was the Conservative government’s response; Margaret Thatcher’s answer to those who believed “they have an inalienable right to be gay”. The vaguely worded law prohibited local authorities and schools from “promoting” homosexuality and prevented councils from funding much-needed lesbian and gay initiatives. At a time when gay people were struggling to cope with the Aids epidemic, it was a callous attempt to suppress an already marginalised group. For Conservative politicians, section 28 was an easy, short-term win. It was an obvious populist gambit to solidify support among the 75% of the population who thought that homosexual activity was “always or mostly wrong”. What section 28’s supporters failed to foresee was that it would inspire one of the most rapidly successful civil rights movements in modern British history. Paul Fairweather In the days before social media, the Mancunian Paul Fairweather had to spread the word about a protest against section 28. On 20 February 1988, the march took place through Manchester city centre. It was one of the largest LGBT demonstrations ever held in the UK. At the time that section 28 was being discussed in parliament, I was one of Manchester city council’s gay men’s officers, working on issues such as employment, service delivery and developing community groups. I had also helped to set up the North West Campaign for Lesbian and Gay Equality, the group responsible for orchestrating the Manchester demonstration. We had a secret office in the town hall attic where more than 100 people would meet every week. We were in a local government office, organising a demonstration against the government to try to stop legislation being presented. What we were doing was completely illegal. No one in the group had organised such a large event before, but a core group had been very active in the gay movement since the early 1970s. The gay scene was quite small and I knew the owners of the local venues well. We went to the gay bars and clubs – such as New Union, Rembrandt, the Thompsons Arms and Napoleon – where the owners agreed to stop the music so that we could speak about the march and section 28. We would make a night of it. When we stopped the music, there was some grumbling from people, but once they had heard us speak most were positive. There was a sense that the whole community was under threat. There were also lots of questions about section 28’s possible impact on gay bars and clubs, as well as concerns about the attitude of the police force. Under the then chief constable of Greater Manchester, James Anderton, the police were very hostile and were raiding gay bars and clubs. I had experienced some harassment on the street and in the gay village, but no one would report hate crimes because of the attitude of the police. We certainly felt they were becoming more aggressive, encouraged by section 28. Police hostility didn’t put people off on the day, though. Twenty thousand turned up for the march, and it revitalised the gay movement in the city. Booan Temple On 23 May 1988, the evening before section 28 came into force, lesbian activists stormed the BBC News studio where Sue Lawley was midway through the Six O’Clock News. Booan Temple was one of the protesters. The LGBT community had been getting more vociferous in the 80s. We were starting to demand more rights, not least of which was the right to live in safety. I, and many of my loved ones, had been attacked in the street. There was an atmosphere that “the other” needed to be eradicated and I think the LGBT community was seen as a threat to the institution of the family. Section 28 was part of that. I was engaged with a lesbian feminist network, but the campaign against section 28 was not an organised campaign in the traditional sense. Many women and mothers felt duty-bound to protect themselves, their families and their friends. They chained themselves to the railings at Buckingham Palace like the suffragettes did, and there were massive marches in Manchester and in London. Lots of women came up with loads of very innovative protests, but none of it got reported. We couldn’t get our arguments out there. So a small group of us decided to go into the Six O’Clock News studio. By getting on the news, we would be the news. Once in the BBC building, we waited until the “live” light came on and ran into the studio wearing T-shirts saying “Stop the Clause”. One woman handcuffed herself to a camera, and one to the news desk, where Nicholas Witchell held her down very aggressively. He has since apologised for his heavy-handed behaviour. I was rugby-tackled to the ground and dragged away. We were held in an office until we were arrested and taken to Shepherd’s Bush police station. I believe the BBC and others had a meeting and decided not to press charges, so we were released without charge and made our way to the Houses of Parliament to join the protesters there, as section 28 passed in to law at midnight. Michael Cashman Now a Labour politician, in 1988 Michael Cashman was in his second year on EastEnders, where he played Colin, one of the first gay characters in a national soap. He later helped to form the LGBT rights organisation Stonewall. I clearly remember reading about section 28 in January 1988 in the weekly paper Capital Gay. I was dumbfounded. It had the date of the London march against it and I knew that, as a gay man playing another on television, I had to be there or I could never look at myself in the mirror again. I attended on my own. I didn’t consult anyone, and didn’t even tell my late husband. I just knew I had to keep it to myself and get there. June Brown, who played Dot Cotton, helped me get the time off rehearsals. When I told her I was going, she said: “OK, Mike, but don’t get arrested, dear.” When I got to the march, people pushed me towards the front, then an actor grabbed me and said: “No, you’ve got to be with the arts lobby.” But then a member of the arts lobby sent me back to the front again. Suddenly, there I was at the front of the march, clutching a banner. As soon as I grabbed the banner, a bevy of television cameras focused in on me and someone was interviewing me. That was the start of helping to lead the campaign against section 28. I linked up with Ian McKellen there, and, along with many others, became a spokesman for the campaign. We went on that amazing march in Manchester, where Ian and I addressed the crowds. I also lobbied within the Labour party to make sure it opposed section 28 because initially, when the bill was introduced, there was some confusion as to what it meant. What was so incredible was the political opportunism. Section 28 had been brought in on the back of the stigmatisation and discrimination suffered by gay men; in particular those dealing with Aids and HIV. Some people were facing the most appalling deaths, and this was designed to kick us firmly underground. Looking back, if we had won the battle of section 28, Stonewall would probably never have been founded. I don’t think we would have progressed to equality as far as we have now. The fact that we lost meant we had to make sure another section 28 didn’t happen again. Maybe if we had won, we would have all sat back, glowed, then lived in inequality for decades after. Sally Francis In one of the most memorable protests against section 28, a group of lesbian activists abseiled into the House of Lords after peers voted in favour of the bill. Sally Francis helped orchestrate the action. We had done lots of actions, lots of blockades and breaking into places. But this was different. The day before, one of my friends was in the chamber of the House of Lords wondering what we could do there. She had the idea of swinging from the microphones hanging from the ceiling. We thought they were probably not strong enough. In the end, we bought a washing line in Clapham market and knotted it up on the bus on the way up – it was pretty low-tech stuff. I smuggled the rope in under my donkey jacket and didn’t set off any alarms. Ten of us set off for the action, but only six of us got into the Lords, four as guests of one of the peers. Those of us in the public seats would try to block the security from getting to the other women on the balcony. We waited till the vote went for the clause. If they had voted against it, we weren’t going to do it. But they voted for it. When the vote finished, we were all looking at each other; the other group was going: “Oh, God, we can’t do it,” and we were going: “Don’t fucking do it.” Then, all of a sudden, two of them went over. The security panicked. The women who had gone over the balcony with the washing line were thrown out of the House of Lords. The rest of us were arrested and put in a cell up by Big Ben. They didn’t know what to do with us. After about six hours, we were released and met up with the women who had been thrown out. They had spoken to the press, but the press didn’t believe they had done it because they didn’t understand why they hadn’t been arrested. When we were all reunited, we went to the pub by the bridge on Whitehall – a real press haunt. There were a lot of journalists there and I remember us telling them: “If you all buy us a drink, we’ll tell you what happened and what we did.” I remember it feeling really special. Michael Dance Schools were one of section 28’s main targets, with the bill prohibiting the promotion or “acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”. When it was introduced in 1987, Michael Dance was training to be an English teacher. While I didn’t hide my sexuality from my colleagues, being open with the students was more problematic. I was careful at first because I did not trust the management of my secondary school to support me. I also felt potentially vulnerable to attack by parents. It didn’t help that where I taught there were few visible out teachers and section 28 made it much more unlikely that would change. The effect was isolating. What was brilliant, though, was that my school turned out to be 100% supportive and that I had the support of straight teachers and the Haringey branch of the National Union of Teachers, which always stood up for gay teachers nationally. After section 28 came in, there was certainly a difference in school environments. A lot of teachers did not want to deal with the subject out of fear. Bigoted teachers were emboldened. A lot of schools pretended that homosexuality did not exist and it allowed a lot of misinformation, prejudice and abuse to go unchallenged. And, of course, it had a terrible effect on young people: students suffered homophobic abuse in silence and teachers and schools did nothing about it. While section 28 made me more cautious, however, it didn’t stop me from taking up issues to do with sexual liberation or equality. If students were homophobic, I always challenged them. I remember a lot of students sitting around my desk talking about how sick and tired they were that no one talked about teenage sexuality and that there was no openness about sexuality in the curriculum. I started to encourage this discussion, about texts, in English lessons, and the students enjoyed it. I remember one student doing a presentation on the difference between HIV and Aids to dispel the myths about the idea it was a “gay plague”, which caused major interest among the students. I fought against section 28 all the way, undermining it everywhere I could in my teaching and personal life. When it was abolished, it allowed me to do all the things I had wanted to do when I was younger, such as developing LGBT support groups in schools. History has vindicated those who fought against this legislation that enshrined bigotry and prejudice. Lisa Power Founded in 1987, the weekly Pink Paper helped to mobilise lesbian and gay readers against section 28. Lisa Power was one of its co-editors, as well as an activist with the Organisation for Lesbian and Gay Action. A lot of lesbians and gay men in the 80s weren’t political; they just went out to bars and clubs. The politicised group was much smaller. But one of the things section 28 did was bring what we called the scene queens together with the political. I still find it interesting when people talk about section 28 as if we won because they remember the abseiling and protests. Those didn’t make a blind bit of difference to the passage through parliament: we lost the battle on section 28. But this did make people think much more strategically about how we should go about getting lesbian and gay rights to win the war. What we had at the time was a gay movement that was very good at fighting among itself and very good at debating political points – but with no history of making allies with the wider world and no effective lobbying mechanism. After section 28 happened, some of us quietly went away and began working on what would become Stonewall. Some people in the gay movement were angry that we had started something that acted like a straight lobby group, but we were convinced it needed doing. And I think it’s the strongest example in the entire world of a successful LGBT lobbying group changing a country’s mind about some of its citizens. Section 28 was repealed in Scotland in 2000 and in the rest of the UK three years later. In 2009, the then Tory leader, David Cameron, who had previously backed the law, apologised for its introduction and described it as a “mistake” that was “offensive to gay people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/russian-spy-assassins-the-salisbury-attack-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T22:05:01Z","webTitle":"Russian Spy Assassins: The Salisbury Attack review – as stunning as a le Carré thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/russian-spy-assassins-the-salisbury-attack-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/russian-spy-assassins-the-salisbury-attack-review","fields":{"headline":"Russian Spy Assassins: The Salisbury Attack review – as stunning as a le Carré thriller","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You’re so tied up in Cambridge Analytica that you’ve let your attention slip from the other Big Story for March? Well it’s OK, Dispatches and Matt Frei are here to remind and rekindle. It is “straight out of the explosive pages of a political spy thriller,” says Matt, inevitably, though it is hard to disagree. There is a quick catch-up first on Sergei Skripal: child of the cold war, paratrooper, FSB, recruitment by MI6, capture, prison, spy swap. He moved to Salisbury for a quiet life, but he and his daughter Yulia ended up slumped on a bench, catatonic, after their bodies were attacked by a nerve agent. The police moved in with their blue and white tape, and eerie biohazard suits. “When you see them all in these suit things, you think, ‘Oh gosh’,” says a Wiltshire lady. Matt is in town, asking questions and seeking answers. He suddenly freezes in black and white as the sound of an SLR shutter goes off in the background: he too is being spied on, it seems, in the cold war. Tinker tailor soldier journalist. Was Sergei still working for the British or someone else? Who was the man he used to have lunch with in Salisbury? His former MI6 handler? That would be unusual behaviour, says Sir Andrew Wood, formerly our man in Moscow. He - Sir Andrew - is good value. Matt later asks him if it would be too unfair to describe Russia as a mafia state. “Yeah, I think it’s a bit unfair,” says Sir Andrew. “On the mafia.” It must be such a relief when you stop being an ambassador and you can suddenly be a little less ambassadorial. You can finally put down the diplomatic Ferrero Rochers and hurl a few about instead. Actually don’t touch them, the Ferreros, they might be poisonous. Monsieur, with zis novi chocs you are really killing us … It’s also important to remember that it is not a joke or a spy thriller, but an assassination attempt. The attack, using a deadly nerve agent in a sleepy (inevitably) English cathedral town, has left two people very seriously ill and a nation confused. It almost certainly originated in Russia, says the chemical weapons expert. Of course it wasn’t the Russians, says the former Kremlin adviser, not getting the “former” thing where you can say what you actually think. Or perhaps he’s scared. It probably came from the military research centre at Porton Down, say the Russians. The scariest, most disturbing thing here is the archive of a goat being exposed to a nerve agent. There’s a small explosion, then a cloud passes over the animal which is tethered downwind. It shakes, falls over, writhes and dies. Matt goes to Russia, so he can be filmed walking around Moscow; and photographed again, in black and white, in 1958; and watching Russian television. Guess what, they are reporting it differently there. We go inside Putin’s head, a man who doesn’t tolerate betrayal. And look at the context of the election. Was it a message of strength to Russia and the world? In London, Matt talks to Marina Litvinenko, wife of Alexander, the last FSB defector to be poisoned in this country. And to Michelle Young, whose ex-husband Scot Young, who worked with the exiled oligarch Boris Berezovsky, died when he fell on to and was impaled on the railings outside his London flat. He looks at the 14 other suspicious deaths on British soil, all with potential links to Russia. And he speaks to people terrified it will happen to them. Like Yevgeny Chichvarkin, who has a wine shop in Mayfair (don’t bother, the wines cost up to £250,000 a bottle), who says he has been told many times that he too will be poisoned. This Dispatches documentary looks beyond the Salisbury bench and the Skripals, back to the mother country and the man who has just very easily won another term there. All the right questions are asked, of all the right people, even if they are not all answered. It is thorough and – like the best explosive spy thrillers – absolutely gripping. All it needs now is a final chapter. Right, what’s going on with Cambridge Analytica. There’s some crossover in The Queen: Her Commonwealth Story (BBC One) with The Crown. The Queen’s first big tour of the Commonwealth, soon after her coronation in 1953, for example, though her right royal barney with Philip doesn’t feature, sadly. Probably because the spineless Aussie film crew who caught it, then dutifully handed it over to their head of state – well, that’s how it goes in The Crown. George Alagiah’s film is a more serious look at the relationship between the Commonwealth and its head. Less juicy. It makes you wonder if reality itself was less fun than The Crown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/shortcuts/2018/mar/26/how-to-survive-an-ultra-long-haul-flight","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T15:18:00Z","webTitle":"How to survive an ultra-long haul flight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/shortcuts/2018/mar/26/how-to-survive-an-ultra-long-haul-flight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/shortcuts/2018/mar/26/how-to-survive-an-ultra-long-haul-flight","fields":{"headline":"How to survive an ultra-long haul flight","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ultra-long haul is the new long-haul. Yesterday, Qantas completed its first non-stop flight from Perth, Australia, to Heathrow – 9,240 miles – in just over 17 hours. It’s a remarkably long time to be crammed into an airline seat. It’s also potentially dangerous, as being immobile for prolonged periods can lead to blood clots forming in your legs. Here, then, are some things you can do to make your flight more bearable – and safer. Move! “Sitting is the new smoking,” says stretching expert Suzanne Wylde. “Our bodies depend on movement just to function normally, so I believe that the worst aspect of flying is that it is hard to stretch out or move much at all to get our blood circulating.” Wylde advises you should stretch before, during and after your flight. The charity Thrombosis UK advises that travellers should “try and move about every 90 minutes. If it’s not possible to get up and move about, do seated exercises such as ankle rotations and foot flexes.” Drink! (Not booze) There’s a lot of dry air in an aircraft cabin. The British Heart Foundation advises passengers should “keep well hydrated by drinking plenty of water and avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine during the flight”. Also, if you’re drinking loads of water, you will solve the immobility problem due to the number of times you will need to go to the lavatory. Time travel To avoid jet lag, try adjusting your watch or phone to the time zone of your destination. And then try and sleep. Maybe not for the whole 17 hours. Be comfortable, not numb It’s not a fashion show up there, and even if you look fantastic in skinny jeans, you won’t care after you have had your top button dig into your abdomen for 17 hours.

I don’t need a lot of sleep; my wife always says I’m like a Duracell battery. If I sleep for a long time I actually feel worse, but I am also the master of the power nap. I can lie down, close my eyes, wake up three minutes later and feel like a new person. It stems from being a young chef in London and Paris; working in these great restaurants for such long hours. At certain times, all the chefs would lie like sardines on a stone floor in a cellar and have a quick nap – sometimes we even slept on park benches. I’ve learned to deal with the stress of being a chef over a long time. It’s really hard finding a balance and learning to be truthful with yourself. It’s only over the past four years that I’ve probably successfully started juggling family life and work. Cooking is my life: I think about it every single day, every morning – even on my days off – it’s always about food. I’m so lucky to have a job that has me waking in the morning and thinking: ‘I really want to go to work today.’ When I was younger I used to play a lot of sport, but I could also eat and drink whatever I wanted. I’d go out and drink tonnes and wouldn’t think about it. But then you hit 40 and, before you know it, you’re suddenly getting a bit of a belly. I had to take a calculated decision. The way I live now I’m working as hard as ever but now I think I’ve got my lifestyle under control. Exercise is vital because the busier your head gets, the more you have to find relief, and that is the key to everything.

It’s the greatest trick Facebook ever pulled","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Unlike the rest of you mere mortals, I am immune to advertising. The billions of dollars, all the creativity poured into making me want certain things, it just doesn’t work on me. It is the same with politics. Nothing anyone says could change my mind; I will not waver from my innate good sense. In any survey I undertake, I am never a “don’t know”; I always know for sure. I am unseducible. This is clearly nonsense, but this position is being taken by many over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Friends on Facebook boast of their impenetrability. They see themselves targeted and laugh. Plus, they are not losers who would buy any old thing online, so they will not be deleting this app. As I am 105 on Facebook and live in Kyrgyzstan – I was on to the robot detectives years ago – the ads I get are mostly for incontinence pads, funerals and jerk chicken. Is jerk chicken big in Kyrgyzstan? But I see lately how well they know me from my ticks and clicks. They know I am always on the lookout for bargain holidays and modernist mansions. They know I can’t resist the idea of losing weight by actually eating more. They know I dream of strange-looking shoes. The ads I get will be different to yours, just as my Twitter timeline is different to yours. It is absolutely this fragmentation of advertising, so that it feels like a personalised experience, that somehow has the effect of circumventing awareness of its power. There can be very little collective discussion of it because we are having totally different experiences. Think of the collective reaction to big campaigns by Nike, Apple – or even the daft ones. Remember Barry Scott of Cillit Bang, silly watercooler ads for VIPoo (to get rid of the smell of your “devil’s donuts”) or the ads that are said to raise consciousness, showing blood instead of blue liquid in ads for sanitary towels, or the big-spend ads that go nowhere, such as the $33m (£23m) spent on Baz Lurhmann’s ad of Nicole Kidman pretending to not like being famous for Chanel No 5. We see how they work and how they don’t, although obviously if we are talking about them, they already have. Certain clever ads appear to eat themselves, deconstructing capitalism while selling us more stuff – notably Spike Jonze’s 2005 Gap ad, in which a Gap store is literally dismantled. Indeed, many leftfield directors make ads – Michel Gondry, Darren Aronofsky, David Lynch, whose ad for Clear Blu pregnancy tests is surprisingingly straight-up. This industry is still worth billions. But with the move from print and TV to digital, something else is happening. As TV revenues go down, the cheap, almost amateur quality of many commercials is plain to see. Still, it is undeniable that advertising is an ever-present backdrop. When it is not there, we miss it. I remember being shocked at the absence of adverts in Cuba. With political advertising, we notice it more when we disagree with its message. Negative campaigning works because we tend to believe negative things about others. If Facebook apps harvest, via quizzes, psychographic profiles of users then their fears can be played too. When this is done collectively and publicly, as in Zac Goldsmith’s appalling racist campaign against Sadiq Khan, many are utterly repulsed. How such a campaign might work through digital microtargeting is scary. I don’t know if this has happened. I don’t know who is susceptible to this. I don’t think that the referendum or the election of Donald Trump was brought about directly by such methods. But this I do know: advertising works. I believe minds can be changed – why, otherwise, would I write? What are the long-term effects of personalised digital advertising? None of us yet know. That is why we are all ultimately persuadable. The leave Jeremy alone stance will get Labour nowhere To say that the Labour party leadership has a problem with antisemitism is, as I have experienced, to be called a rightwing smear merchant. I feel for the huge number of Labour members who are not antisemitic, or who have never encountered it and wish simply for a Labour government. But we are where we are, and you reap what you sow. Woven into the worldview of some old men on the left, such as those formerly close to Corbyn, George Galloway and Ken Livingstone – the latter suspended from the Labour party following his comments that Adolf Hitler was a supporter of Zionism before “going mad and killing 6 million Jews”– is a particular view of the connection of Jewish people to a satanic Israel, weaponised by imperialist America. Corbyn may not be personally antisemitic, but this is actually the problem. It ends up with the “leave Jeremy alone” stance, where he is always the victim of persecution. The last ludicrous investigation into these issues ended up with Shami Chakrabarti being given a peerage. For her sins, she now has to function as Corbyn’s clean-up woman, frequently popping up to tell us what he did or didn’t mean. Either Corbyn won’t get it, or doesn’t get it. Either he is too convinced of his own virtue, or he is not intelligent enough to understand the situation. It’s not unfamiliar. Whenever racism or sexism is called out, the victims are usually told it is all in their minds. They are not believed. Maybe just listen to what Jewish people are saying instead of telling them they are wrong? This would be a small start. A libel trial taught me about ball-tampering This column is a sport-free zone, but I have to say I love a bit of ball-tampering. Amazingly, I know something about it, since I attended the most brilliant libel trial of Imran Khan v Ian Botham. Botham and Allan Lamb had sued Khan over two articles in which they claimed Khan called them racists and accused them of ball-tampering (Khan claimed his words had been taken out of context). The trial included much discussion of Pakistani cricketers rubbing the ball after fixing their hair, which would be full of hair oil. This, on the seam, would change the spin. It was mesmerising, with the legendary George Carman QC in full flow, Botham in the witness box holding a cricket ball as though he was going to lob it, and the beautiful people, Imran and Jemima, who, the jury decided, succeeded in the end. Pakistan emerged with honour and all the eminent Pakistani journalists partied like mad. It was brilliant. I knew nothing about cricket, but learned a lot about libel. And balls. Don’t mess with either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/26/time-for-spurs-repair-relationship-fans-tickets","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T14:17:38Z","webTitle":"There is still time for Spurs to repair relationship with fans over tickets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/26/time-for-spurs-repair-relationship-fans-tickets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/26/time-for-spurs-repair-relationship-fans-tickets","fields":{"headline":"There is still time for Spurs to repair relationship with fans over tickets","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Tottenham Hotspur had set out to create a modern parable showing all that is wrong with football, they could not have done better. Details of the eagerly awaited new stadium were revealed last week, with season ticket price rises of up to 70%. The glossy brochure boasting of sumptuous facilities looks decadent now the ticket prices are known. Instead of welcoming an improved new “home”, many fans are saying that European oak finishes and brushed steel on the food court worksurfaces are not the reason they come to the match. And the placing of over 1,000 premium-lite exclusive membership club tickets costing £2,200 across the centre of the vaunted single-tier home end looks like a calculated insult. Impervious as ever to fan criticism, the club at first denied there were any complaints, then ludicrously claimed prices had not risen because the product was not comparable. After the Supporters’ Trust dug deep into the figures and highlighted the implications for many fans, the club put out a statement containing the claim that there were more tickets at £995 available than there were season tickets at the old ground. That is supposed to be a good thing. The spirit of Marie Antoinette lives on. Those who would respond that this is the commercial reality of modern football should think again. As should the club. The income from these prices will do very little to boost player wages – something that is in any case less of a priority for a fan base energised by seeing a successful team being coached rather than bought. And in any case there is no commitment from the club to break its wage cap. The stadium is financed, like all major builds, on debt and that must be paid off. The banks have been persuaded by the projected loyalty of the club’s support. Build it and they will come, goes the theory, and when they do they will create an atmosphere that helps sell the product to global TV for high sums. That might be true for one season at a new stadium, or until the team hits a dip in form. But what then? Having priced out some of its most loyal fans and turned one of the most atmospheric crowds in the country into just another set of customers consuming, rather than creating, the product, how valuable will Brand Spurs be? The old saying about knowing the price of everything but the value of nothing is apposite. All fans are passionate about their club, but Spurs fans have maintained a passion that has drawn admiration, if only grudging, from elsewhere through lean times. There have been feelings that the club has lost its way before, but the last few years under Mauricio Pochettino have led to the strengthening of a bond between fans and club and a new feeling of shared identity. The club looked to have recognised that, with its dignified and moving handling of the last months at White Hart Lane and its talk of putting atmosphere and the supporters “front and centre” of the new stadium. How foolish we were to believe that. The many hundreds of fans who have contacted us since the price announcement have used words such as disgusted, betrayed, exploited, let down. It seems the measure of our support is the money we are prepared to fork out, nothing else. Some will not renew, not because they do not want to but because they have been priced out. Many more are saying they will give it a year and see. At these prices there is no room for sentiment. Which is ironic, because sentiment is what makes the business so valuable. The Spurs board can still repair the fractured relationship with its fans. It can rethink the pricing before the 16 May deadline. It can rethink its flawed concessions policy. It can restore cup vouchers to season tickets. It can offer discounts on cup games. It can offer discounts on tickets for future years. It can commit to a price freeze for a set period or it can commit to dropping prices when the debt is paid off. And it can take what a large section of its supporter base is saying seriously, rather than dismissing it. Or it could carry on regardless, changing the nature of the product. Spurs could end up just another high street destination rather than a unique brand with a living history. The current board could be remembered as the visionaries they want to be. Or they could be remembered as the builders of a monument to the folly of modern football. Martin Cloake is co-chair of the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust.

The biggest gardening weekend of the year, when the UK wakes and thinks again about growing and mowing. It’s time to open the seed drawer or shed and scream at spiders (though maybe that’s just my kid). April is when we start to think about restocking window boxes and outdoor plants, though I would caution to still wait a while. The watchword is to watch the weather. There is, however, early summer stuff to sow, though it is safest to stick to your windowsill, at least for the first few days. It is a tricky month, April, safer to grow outside in the south than the north. You are looking for soil temperatures to have reached at least 7C (10C is better). The easiest way to tell is to see how the weed seedlings are doing. If in doubt, start inside with seed trays or small pots. For flowers, I am currently obsessed with grandiflora sweet peas. Scented Spencers are also reliable. I have a friend growing me seedlings in her greenhouse. You can start off any favourite hardy annual bedding flowers, too (think calendula, cosmos and cornflowers). Though I’d maybe wait until May to sow a cut flowerbed in situ. If you have space for a vegetable plot, Easter is the traditional time to plant maincrop potatoes and ‘second earlies’ as well as earth up any earlies you may have planted last month. April is also the time to sort bean poles and pea sticks. Get your hands on hazel if you can. I have begged some from a farmer friend and will be taking cuttings from the hedge around our site. You can sow beetroot in a sunny spot, but find somewhere shadier for a further sowing in May. Any spinach, though, has to be sown now as it suffers in midsummer.

Concurrently, the legal battle between Daniels and Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, grew fiercer. Speaking from the podium of the White House press briefing room on Monday afternoon, administration spokesman Raj Shah said: “With respect to that interview, I will say the president strongly, clearly has consistently denied these underlying claims. The only person who’s been inconsistent is the one making the claims.” Shah did not mention Daniels by name. Trump “denied the claims she made last night” he said. “He has been consistent in doing so, she has not”. Shah spoke hours after Cohen’s own lawyer, Brent Blakely, wrote to Daniels’ attorney to say she had made false and defamatory comments, “namely that [Cohen] was responsible for an alleged thug who supposedly visited” and threatened her. “In truth, Mr Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,” Blakely said in the letter, according to Reuters. In response, Daniels – whose real name is Stephanie Clifford – added Cohen to a lawsuit previously filed against Trump, saying he had defamed her by claiming she lied about her relationship with the president. In a court document, Daniels said “it was reasonably understood Mr Cohen meant to convey that Ms Clifford is a liar, someone who should not be trusted, and that her claims about her relationship with Mr Trump is ‘something [that] isn’t true’.” In the CBS 60 Minutes interview broadcast on Sunday, Daniels said she was threatened with physical violence after she first attempted to go public with the story. She was on her way to a fitness class with her infant daughter in Las Vegas in 2011, she said, when she was accosted in a parking lot. “A guy walked up on me,” she said, “and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.’ And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.’ And then he was gone.” Daniels said she did not know who the man was and did not link him to Cohen. Later, however, when explaining why she signed a document in 2016 that denied any affair with Trump, she said she was told that if she did not, “they can make your life hell in many different ways”. Asked who “they” were, Daniels said: “I’m not exactly sure who they were. I believe it to be Michael Cohen.” The interview attracted 22 million viewers, 60 Minutes’ highest ratings in a decade. Shah declined to say if Trump watched. “I’m not going to get into what the president may or may not have seen,” he told reporters. Early on Monday morning, Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, the president’s wife, slammed the media for enjoying “speculation &amp; salacious gossip” and added: “I’d like to remind people there’s a minor child who’s [sic] name should be kept out of news stories when at all possible.” Melania was not with Trump when the show aired. The White House announced that she would spend the week in Florida with their son, “as is their tradition for spring break”. Trump stayed silent, other than a tweet about “so much Fake News”. “Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate,” the president wrote. “But through it all, our country is doing great!” Representatives for the president have denied any sexual relationship with Daniels, despite Cohen’s admission that he paid $130,000 to buy her silence. Cohen claims to have paid that sum out of his own pocket. Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, called that “ludicrous” during the CBS broadcast. On Monday, Avenatti said he would not yet reveal what he implied was additional evidence to back up Daniels’ claims. “We’re not going to get into the details of everything we have at this time, and there’s a reason for that,” he said on NBC’s Today show. “We understand the American people want all the information right now, immediately. It would make no sense for us to play our hand as to this issue and we’re not going to do it right now.” He also said the unidentified man Daniels said threatened her in 2011 must have been linked to Trump. The allegation that someone threatened Daniels takes the dispute between the president and the porn star to a new level. Until now the issue has been her claim of a sexual relationship – although Daniels told CBS they had sex only once, in 2006 – and Trump’s denials, as well as a legalistic argument over whether the non-disclosure agreement signed by Daniels 11 days before the 2016 election is binding. Daniels’ claim of an affair in 2006 bears striking similarities to an account given last week by a former Playboy model. Karen McDougal told CNN she had an intense relationship with Trump in 2006 and 2007, and that he once took her to his Manhattan home. Both McDougal and Daniels allege that their encounters occurred within months of the birth of Barron, Trump’s son with Melania. A large number of women have accused Trump of sexual assault. He denies the claims."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/27/world-cup-stunning-moments-luis-suarez-bites-giorgio-chiellini-in-2014","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T10:21:54Z","webTitle":"World Cup stunning moments: Luis Suárez bites Giorgio Chiellini in 2014 | Nick Miller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/27/world-cup-stunning-moments-luis-suarez-bites-giorgio-chiellini-in-2014","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/27/world-cup-stunning-moments-luis-suarez-bites-giorgio-chiellini-in-2014","fields":{"headline":"World Cup stunning moments: Luis Suárez bites Giorgio Chiellini in 2014","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the first half of Uruguay’s final group game against Italy at the 2014 World Cup, Luis Suárez launched a late, clumsy challenge on Andrea Pirlo, upending the playmaker with the subtlety of a man taking down a tree with a blunt axe. As Pirlo tumbled, a flailing forearm struck Suárez around the ear. Suárez, assuming the role of the wronged man, held his head, stared at Pirlo, looking hurt and shocked – shocked! – that anyone could do such a thing. Around 40 minutes later, the score still 0-0, Suárez did similar. But this time the catalyst was something more unusual. Add Giorgio Chiellini’s name to the list with Otman Bakkal and Branislav Ivanovic: for the third time in his career, Suárez had bitten an opponent during a match. Before that tournament he was on a PR campaign. This was a new Luis Suárez. Not the one who racially abused Patrice Evra, or bit Ivanovic and Bakkal, or punched Dominic Adiyiah’s header off the line against Ghana. “I want to change the bad boy image that has stuck for a bit because I don’t think I am at all how I have been portrayed,” Suárez told Sports Illustrated. Warming to the theme, he also said: “Obviously, it’s not the most attractive image that I can have for myself. But that’s not what I want to be remembered for. I want to do things right. I really, really do.” Pre-tournament knee surgery meant he wasn’t fit enough to play in Uruguay’s opener, a defeat by Costa Rica, but in their second game he scored twice against England to knock them out. Uruguay had to beat Italy to go through but the game was stodgy, both teams toiling in the Natal heat: Suárez looked like a man playing with weights on his legs. On 66 minutes, the ball broke to him, through on goal, but Gigi Buffon dived to save his jabbed shot. According to Suárez, this was the seed of what followed. He explained in his autobiography that in both previous incidents, frustration caused his dental outbursts. He bit Bakkal while playing for Ajax when “we were on a bad run that would lead to our manager Martin Jol getting the sack”, while the Ivanovic incident came after “I gave away a stupid penalty”. And so it was again. “If I had scored that goal,” he wrote, “then what followed would never have happened. I would not have done anything. Nothing.” So it was all Buffon’s fault, really. On 79 minutes, Chiellini half headed away the ball and, as it bobbled out to the left, Suárez steamed in. The two jostled, then fell to the floor. Nobody nearby seemed to react. Matteo Di Sciglio, five yards away, protested vaguely only after seeing how outraged and bemused his team-mate was. You can’t blame him. Referee Marco Rodríguez – serendipitously nicknamed Chiquidrácula – gave a free-kick to Italy. Since he didn’t even book Suárez, what infraction he thought he saw is unclear. A livid Chiellini chased Rodríguez, pulling aside his shirt to show the teeth marks. In a misguided act, Gaston Ramírez attempted to cover the shoulder as if that would make it go away. Suárez sat on the floor holding his teeth. In his previous biting episodes he’d targeted fleshier areas. Chiellini, a man who looks as if he was chiselled rather than born, would have been altogether tougher. In the stands, it was unclear what had happened. Some thought it was a mere headbutt but within a couple of minutes realisation dawned. Journalists looked at each other in disbelief: oh my god, he’s done it again. Even those with access to replays weren’t convinced, including Jan Åge Fjørtoft, now a TV journalist. As proof of his scepticism, he bit his hand then compared the marks, tweeting the results. Twitter can be awful but when a former Swindon striker chews part of his body and posts the picture to indicate a footballer hasn’t bitten another, you remember why you log on. Chiellini, obviously, was more certain. “It was ridiculous not to send Suárez off,” he said. “Suárez is a sneak and he gets away with it because Fifa want their stars to play in the World Cup. I’d love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence. The referee saw the bite mark, too, but he did nothing.” As for Suárez, butter refused to melt. “These are just things that happen out on the pitch that you shouldn’t make such a big deal out of,” he shrugged. Suárez was so deep in denial he even pleaded innocence to his wife. When Diego Godín scored the winner, he didn’t celebrate with his usual gusto. “I was already thinking about the aftermath,” he said recently. The aftermath began quickly: that night, Brazilian TV played Suárez’s bite trifecta on a loop. Two days later, despite sticking to his story (“I lost my balance … hit my face against [Chiellini], leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth”), Fifa banned him for nine internationals, all football for four months and fined him 100,000 Swiss francs. The Uruguayans cried fake news. “You couldn’t have seen it today because nothing happened,” captain Diego Lugano said. “You have to be stupid to think that mark on Chiellini is from today.” Coach Óscar Tabárez opted for a proverb: “As we say in Uruguay, there are people who are hiding behind a tree waiting for someone to make a mistake.” A Uruguayan TV station accused English journalists of whipping things up. “It would be good if these Englishmen,” they intoned, “remember how they won the World Cup in 1966 with a ball which was not a goal.” The Uruguayan federation appealed (unsuccessfully), Suárez’s lawyer claimed a “European-based” campaign and the country’s president declared Fifa were “fascists” and “a bunch of old sons of bitches”. The ban was served, a Suárez-less Uruguay lost 2-0 to Colombia and he wouldn’t play again until October. Even Chiellini thought the ban was excessive and Suárez said he would never attend another Fifa gala. He has, though, apologised to Chiellini. Four years on, there is temptation to thoughtfully reappraise the incident. “I don’t think I have ever actually injured a fellow professional,” he wrote. “I know biting appals a lot of people but it’s relatively harmless … None of the bites have been like Mike Tyson on Evander Holyfield’s ear.” But then the urge subsides and you’re left only with the initial reaction: biting is something children do but rapidly learn is weird. If you’re still on the fence, then let the final word go to someone we should listen to. “Biting has no place in sports,” Bruce Springsteen said after he was inexplicably asked about the incident. If the Boss says biting has no place in sports, then biting has no place in sports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/04/how-london-southall-became-little-punjab-","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T06:30:17Z","webTitle":"How London's Southall became 'Little Punjab'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/04/how-london-southall-became-little-punjab-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/04/how-london-southall-became-little-punjab-","fields":{"headline":"How London's Southall became 'Little Punjab'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When he opened for business in 1954, Pritam Singh Sangha could never have envisaged that he was kickstarting a consumer revolution that would establish the Asian corner shop in the British landscape, nor that Southall would become the country’s premier Asian town, dubbed Chota Punjab – Little Punjab. A gregarious man, Sangha (pictured below) was a well-known and popular figure. Not only did he own the only Indian shop in Southall, west London – and probably the country at the time – but he was also one of the first Punjabis to make the area his home, in 1951. When a shipment of provisions arrived from India, Sangha would dispatch his daughter Guddi to spread the good news. Scurrying from house to house, her arrival was always greeted with delight because it meant that larders could be replenished with food staples that doubled as a reminder of home. c1958: Pritam Singh Sangha’s daughter, Guddi (left), and mother outside the family shop.

All photographs courtesy of Panjabis of Southall project The shelves emptied as rapidly as they had been stocked with spices, chapatti flour, lentils and other products not available anywhere else: Britain’s love affair with curry was still several years away. Sangha’s story forms part of Panjabis of Southall, a Heritage Lottery Fund project. It tells the history of the largest Punjabi (or Panjabi, the more traditional spelling) community outside India and the pivotal role it played in shaping the destiny of millions of other Asians who came to Britain. Researchers have gathered rare photographs and oral testimonies, and are working on a film. Left: Punjabi families arrive in Southall in the late 60s. Right: The opening of one of the area’s first textile stores, c1970 Balraj Purewal, project director and lifelong resident who knew the Sangha family, said: “When Southall sneezed, the rest of the British Asian community caught a cold. We were at the forefront of the fight against racism and led the way in many other areas. This project is about documenting and commemorating an iconic, trailblazing community which influenced British Asian life.” 1967: Members of the National Front march through Southall By the time my own father arrived in 1960, local authority records show that there were approximately 1,000 Punjabis living in Southall, nearly all men. He would joke that one of the reasons why they settled here was because of its proximity to Heathrow airport, only three miles away, and “if the gooras [whites] ever kicked us out, it would be easy to get on a plane and return home”. It was a light-hearted reference to the uncertainty that was generated by the chronic racism of the time. 1979: Southall Youth Movement march It was the R Woolf rubber factory in neighbouring Hayes that attracted Punjabis to Southall – the general manager had served with Sikh soldiers during the second world war and was only too happy to recruit them. The initial arrivals settled around Aldgate, east London, but began renting rooms closer to work – and Southall was the most affordable nearby area. Punjab was partitioned by the British in 1947; part of it fell within Pakistan with the remainder in India. Punjabis can be Sikh, Hindu or Muslim, and while all three demographics settled in this outpost of west London, it was the Sikhs who came in the largest numbers and gave Southall its distinct identity. Left: Residents protest against bussing children to schools out of their local area. Right: Children waiting for the school bus, c1977 Faced with discrimination and unable to secure accommodation easily, they lived in cramped, squalid conditions with anything up to 20 men sharing a terraced home. Meals were prepared and eaten communally, and beds sharing rotated between those who worked day and night shifts. Women and children arrived several years later. The response to racism came quickly, with the formation of the Indian Workers Association (IWA) in 1956 by a cadre of locals affiliated to the Communist party of India. Top: An early meeting of the Indian Workers Association in 1958. Bottom: The IWA leadership meeting the Indian PM Indira Gandhi (left) and Labour politician Dennis Healey (right) The IWA soon established itself as Britain’s most powerful Asian political organisation, running campaigns for workers’ rights and other equality issues, such as the bussing of mainly Asian and Afro-Caribbean children to schools out of their local areas. High-profile politicians from both Britain and India regularly met with its leadership, and at its peak it had a membership of more than 20,000. 1976: Southall residents riot following the murder of Gurdip Singh Chaggar. Photograph: Peter Arkell/reportdigital.co.uk The summer of 1976 saw a major schism develop as the younger generation became increasingly frustrated with the IWA’s “old guard” and their perceived reluctance to confront racism head on. There was widespread rioting in Southall in response to the racist murder of local youth Gurdip Singh Chaggar. Many still refer to it is as the “first uprising”. It led to the formation of the Southall Youth Movement (SYM), by Purewal and others, which took to the streets to fight racist gangs. The SYM played a pivotal role in subsequent “uprisings” – in 1979, when hundreds were arrested while protesting against the National Front, and in 1981, in retaliation to an attack by skinheads. It also inspired other Asian youth movements across the rest of the country to organise along similar lines in the fight against racism. 1981: Hambrough Tavern, Southall, ablaze following rioting against skinhead attacks For those making new lives in west London, however, it was not all about overcoming adversity. In 1968, Britain’s first all-Asian football team was formed in Southall by Kessar Singh Bhatti, who had played the game at state level for Punjab. It prompted the birth of Asian football and other sports tournaments across the rest of the country, which remain popular today. Britain’s first all-Asian football team, formed by Kessar Singh Bhatti (back row, third from left) The IWA-owned Dominion Cinema, which showed Bollywood films, was a mainstay of the British Asian community in its heyday, attracting leading actors from India and more than 8,000 cinemagoers each week. There were also packed houses for its boxing, wrestling and cultural nights. The IWA-owned Dominion Cinema, which attracted more than 8,000 cinemagoers a week for its Bollywood film screenings At Little Punjab’s peak, Punjabis made up almost 70% of Southall’s population of 70,000; that figure is now estimated to be just over half. Many of their descendants have prospered and moved to wealthier pastures, replaced by new communities from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia. At its heart, though, this corner of west London remains an indelibly Punjabi town.

The Guardian reported earlier this month on the threat industrial krill fishing poses to animals like penguins, whales and seals. Last week one of the UK’s biggest health retailers, Holland and Barrett, agreed to remove krill-based products like Omega 3 supplements from its shelves. Now campaigners are calling on other high street stores, including Boots, to follow suit. Louisa Casson, of Greenpeace UK’s Protect the Antarctic campaign, said: “Boots’s stated mission is to be the UK’s most socially responsible retailer in the health and beauty market. But the question has to be asked, how can customers trust Boots when it’s profiting from a fishing industry which is threatening the health of Antarctic wildlife like penguins, seals and whales?” A Boots spokeswoman said “caring for the environment” had always been an integral part of its brand. She added: “The Marine Stewardship Council has stated that its krill products come from a certified fishery that is subject to yearly checks by independent inspectors. We are committed to traceability and transparency and support the continued collection of data to support the up-to-date understanding of the krill stock.” She said the company was engaging with NGOs, including the Marine Stewardship Council, to ensure that the krill population remains sustainable, adding: “We welcome a conversation with Greenpeace on how we further our common objective of delivering sustainable oceans.” Last month the Guardian reported how researchers and environmental campaigners feared a combination of climate change and industrial-scale fishing was threatening the krill population in Antarctic waters, with a potentially disastrous impact on larger predators – particularly penguins, whose numbers could drop by a third by the end of the century, according to one study. In a sign of the growing opposition to krill fishing in the Antarctic, Greenpeace protesters last week climbed onto a Ukrainian krill trawler, occupying a survival pod which they attached to the anchor chain of the ship and rolling out a banner reading Protect the Antarctic. Last week Holland and Barrett Holland bowed to pressure from Greenpeace and agreed to remove krill products from its shelves. Activists had bombarded its CEO with 40,000 emails in 24 hours and labelled krill products with stickers about their impact on the environment in stores across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/28/charity-calls-for-15m-fund-to-tackle-uk-hunger-by-preventing-food-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T05:01:12Z","webTitle":"Charity calls for £15m fund to tackle UK hunger by preventing food waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/28/charity-calls-for-15m-fund-to-tackle-uk-hunger-by-preventing-food-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/28/charity-calls-for-15m-fund-to-tackle-uk-hunger-by-preventing-food-waste","fields":{"headline":"Charity calls for £15m fund to tackle UK hunger by preventing food waste","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government is being urged to introduce a £15m fund to tackle hunger by preventing food which could be eaten from going straight into landfill, animal feed or anaerobic digestion. New figures from the UK’s largest food redistribution charity, FareShare, reveal that just 17,000 tonnes of the 270,000 tonnes of edible surplus food in the supply chain is redistributed annually to charities. FareShare wants ministers to create a level playing field for food waste, ending the inequality of the current system where producers and farmers bear the costs of sorting and transporting surplus food for human consumption. The public is being asked to support FareShare’s new Feed People First campaign by signing a parliamentary petition calling on the government to introduce a £15m fund to cover transport and storage costs for surplus food. At 100,000 signatures, the subject will be considered for debate in parliament. FareShare currently redistributes about 13,500 tonnes of surplus food every year to nearly 7,000 charities including hospices, homeless shelters, care homes and women’s refuges (including a record amount last Christmas) but its annual target is 100,000 tonnes. Demand for surplus food has soared against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness in the UK. FareShare says it has the capacity – and a waiting list of charities wanting help – but needs access to more food. Its solution is a government fund that would cover the costs of storage and transport. Available to any charity or producer that incurs the costs of redistributing food, it would also save charities and other beneficiaries £150m by making free food available to them. “It’s completely wrong that we have a situation where it’s cheaper to send thousands of tonnes of good edible food to anaerobic digestion plants or to animal feed when there are millions of people experiencing food insecurity and regularly skipping meals across the UK right now,” said FareShare chief executive, Lindsay Boswell. The bulk of food waste in the UK comes from households, making up 71% of the total. But manufacturing contributes 17% and hospitality and food service 9%. Seasonal weather fluctuations, order cancellations and overstocking – all unpredictable – create surplus food which manufacturers, distributors and farms were not always in a position to redistribute. Environment ministers are understood to have held informal discussions about giving farmers and food producers financial incentives to encourage them to get waste food onto tables. But FareShare says these need to lead to a level playing field so it’s not cheaper to waste food or turn it into animal feed or energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/09/how-to-find-a-mentor-bossing-it-sharmadean-reid","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"How do I find a career mentor?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/09/how-to-find-a-mentor-bossing-it-sharmadean-reid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/09/how-to-find-a-mentor-bossing-it-sharmadean-reid","fields":{"headline":"How do I find a career mentor?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I enjoy sharing my knowledge, but being a leader is about continual learning, and we all need support to thrive. Look for someone in your field who is four to seven years ahead of you: someone you admire, someone who has clearly used a specific strategy to get ahead. It may be a well-known person, or it may be someone at your workplace. Get in touch ask if they have time for coffee and to tell you their story. Prep your meeting by identifying some key areas in your work with which you are struggling, and drop your concerns into the conversation. Do they become animated and excited to help and share, or do they furrow their brow at the pain of having to be of service? I recently met an incredible ex-newspaper editor and now business adviser, and I wanted to be around her again to learn more. She was forthcoming with her advice, and although she hadn’t built a startup herself, she was passionate about technology. I was sold. When you find your mentor, let them know clearly what you want, because they are busy. “I’d love you to mentor me, and that means an hour over coffee every other month, so I can share where I am and hear your feedback.” Make it as easy as possible for them. Schedule three meetings in advance, go to wherever they are and turn up prepared. Mentors are usually a progressive bunch and there’s a satisfaction in seeing a younger version of themself in someone and helping to water the seeds of change. Mentees can bring them fresh energy and ideas. My best mentees update me with what they’re up to, and when I give advice, they do the work and come back with progress. Mentoring someone is a joy when you can see them flourish. Be a good mentee, and one day you’ll be a great mentor. • Sharmadean Reid is the founder of WAH Nails and beautystack.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/26/the-fiver-russia-ethics-world-cup-brazil","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T14:54:27Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Indecipherable yelps and the gnawing sound of a hungry shredder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/26/the-fiver-russia-ethics-world-cup-brazil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/26/the-fiver-russia-ethics-world-cup-brazil","fields":{"headline":"Indecipherable yelps and the gnawing sound of a hungry shredder","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"FROM RUSSIA WITH, ERM With only three months left until the big Ethics World Cup kick-off, The Fiver thought it was high time we checked in with our Stolichnaya-drinking, Cossack-dancing, Lada-driving, interweb-hacking, alleged-election-meddling, former Gulag-dwelling Russian cousin, Valery Aleksandr Rasputin Fiverski, to see how the hosts are shaping up. We couldn’t get through to him so tried his former PE teacher, who works at the Russian embassy, but all we got there were the indecipherable and stressed yelps of a secretary and the distant gnawing sound of a hungry shredder. So it was with a heavy heart that we did our own research instead. Russia’s form since last June reads: LLWDLDL. And that W only came courtesy of South Korea’s Kim Ju-young slipping on a pair of clown shoes and bundling in two own goals in three second-half minutes to give Russia a 4-2 win last October. It’s the kind of form Derby County’s class of 2008 would be proud of. In Russia’s latest outing they were walloped 3-0 by a cigar-toting Brazil team kitted out in velvet smoking jackets and slippers. And if it wasn’t for Igor Akinfeev’s octopus heroics in goal, that scoreline could have been approaching double figures. Still, at least that defeat will have helped the host nation’s scary-looking boss, Stanislav Cherchesov, get a little closer to working out what his best team is. Wouldn’t it? “We are starting everything from scratch again,” he sniffed before Tuesday’s friendly against France. Ah. You see, for the past 78 years Russia have had a defence built on the Berezutsky twins and Sergei Ignashevich, all of whom began their careers when Charlie Chaplin was a global superstar. And when Russia almost made as much of a show of themselves at Euro 2016 as England did, the defensive trio decided to call it a day. They have since been replaced by a collection of young defenders so calamitous they make Titus Bramble look like Franco Baresi. The Berezutskys even had to go public this month to re-confirm their retirement when a few fans’ panicked calls for their return grew to a full-on clamour. “With three months remaining until the World Cup, it is time to state clearly that myself and my brother have retired from the national team. Our health doesn’t leave us any other option,” they croaked. Ten years after Russia lit up the Euros with their free-flowing football it looks like the Class of 2018 are going to leave a bigger stink this summer than Weird Uncle Fiver did at Jongleurs with his 70s redux collection of jokes. It’s a desperate situation for the hosts but it does have the potential to be very funny, especially when the camera cuts to Vladimir Putin’s non-plussed mush after a 1-0 defeat by footballing powerhouse Saudi Arabia in the tournament opener. And still, at least it will be a well-attended, brilliantly organised festival of bonhomie, progressive views and a shared belief in sport as a vehicle for betterment and change, eh? Eh?

Over 100 Russian diplomats alleged to be spies in western countries are being told to return to Moscow, in a coordinated response to the use of a chemical weapon in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence official, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March. In a sombre statement in the House of Commons, Theresa May welcomed what she said was “the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history”. “I have found great solidarity from our friends and partners in the EU, North America, Nato and beyond over the past three weeks as we have confronted the aftermath of the Salisbury incident,” the prime minister said. “And together we have sent a message that we will not tolerate Russia’s continued attempts to flout international law and undermine our values.” She added: “If the Kremlin’s goal is to divide and intimidate the western alliance, then their efforts have spectacularly backfired.” The Russian government called the expulsions “a provocative gesture” and said it would retaliate in kind, raising the prospect of further tit-for-tat expulsions, as the US and Europe left the door open for additional measures. The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin would make the final decision, and the Russian embassy in the US launched a poll on Twitter asking which US consulate in Russia should be closed. The US has ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian officials who Washington says are spies, including a dozen based at the United Nations, and told Moscow to shut down its consulate in Seattle, which would end Russian diplomatic representation on the west coast. The EU members Germany, France and Poland are each to expel four Russian diplomats with intelligence agency backgrounds. Lithuania and the Czech Republic said they would expel three, and Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands two each. Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Sweden and Romania each expelled one Russian. Iceland announced it would not be sending officials to the World Cup in Russia. Ukraine, which is not an EU member, is to expel 13 Russian diplomats, while Albania, an EU candidate member, ordered the departure of two Russians from the embassy in Tirana. Macedonia, another EU candidate, expelled one Russian official. Canada announced it was expelling four diplomatic staff serving in Ottawa and Montreal who the Canadian government said were spies. A pending application from Moscow for three more diplomatic posts in Canada is being denied. Australia confirmed that it too would expel two Russian diplomats who were in the country as undeclared intelligence officers, giving them seven days to leave. Raj Shah, a White House spokesperson, told reporters Monday that the US expulsions were part of “a coordinated effort”. He added that Donald Trump “spoke with many foreign leaders, European allies and others and encouraged them to join with the United States in this announcement”. Shah described the expulsions as “an important message to send to Russia and significant to degrading their intelligence capabilities”. By the close of the day a small “coalition of the unwilling” inside the EU had indicated to the UK Foreign Office that they were not prepared to expel any Russian diplomats in solidarity with the UK. The eight countries were Portugal, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Slovenia and Luxembourg. Belgium and Ireland made no announcements but have indicated action will be taken after cabinet meetings. The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats in the wake of the poisoning, and Russia responded by ejecting the same number of British diplomats. The Russian foreign ministry issued a statement denouncing the expulsions as “an unfriendly step” based on alliances rather than evidence. “The provocative gesture of the so-called solidarity of these countries with London, which blindly followed the British authorities in the so-called Skripal case and which never got around to sort out the circumstances of the incident, is a continuation of the confrontational policy to escalate the situation,” the statement said. The UK has refused to provide a sample of the nerve agent to Russia but has supplied one to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is conducting its own investigation. A senior US official said the expulsions and the Seattle consulate closure were in response to “a reckless attempt by the [Russian] government to murder a British citizen and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent”. A second official said the measures were also intended as a response to a “steady drumbeat of destabilising and aggressive actions” by Moscow against the US and its allies. The alleged spies being expelled from the US include 48 in the Russian embassy in Washington and 12 at the Russian mission at the UN, who the US says are engaged in “aggressive collection here in the US”. US officials said the spies at the UN were abusing their residence privileges under the UN headquarters agreement. They said there were more than 100 Russian spies in the US and the expulsions would significantly reduce Russian espionage capabilities in the country. The expelled Russians have seven days to leave the country. Mark Simakovsky, a former Russia desk director at the Pentagon, said the mass expulsions by such a large number of countries acting in concert were unprecedented, but Moscow still had plenty of ways to spy on the west. “Most Russian intelligence operations are not being done by agents acting under cover of diplomatic protocols,” said Simakovsky, now a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council. “Most likely, the poisoning of the Skripals was not done by anyone in an embassy or consulate.” Daniel Fried, a former state department sanctions coordinator, said the only measures likely to have real effect on Putin’s behaviour would be sanctions aimed at Russian money in the west. “This is impressive but it is still the standard playbook,” Fried said. “If we are serious about this, we ought to think outside the box. I would start going after the money, and make clear that Russia is not going to find the west a convenient place to do business. That means going after London real estate, and you can’t do that without getting Miami and New York involved.” The White House issued a statement saying the US was acting to “make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences”. Trump did not comment on Twitter, his usual form of expression on issues he feels strongly about. While other members of his administration have spoken out strongly against Russia, in particular for its interference in the 2016 US election, Trump has avoided saying or tweeting anything critical of the Kremlin, and last week defied his advisers in congratulating Putin on winning an election generally seen as closed and unfair. A senior US official said on Monday that the nature of the Russian response to UK allegations had helped convince the administration that the Kremlin was culpable. “Russia has had nearly a month to respond but instead of explaining has engaged in the usual obfuscation we have seen in the past,” a US official said, noting that Moscow had put out a series of conflicting stories and attempted to put the blame on others, including the US. EU heads of state concluded last week that it was highly likely the Russian state was responsible for the attack. The EU is also looking at coordinated steps to rein back Russian hybrid warfare."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/26/childrens-book-praising-hitler-as-amazing-leader-pulled-by-indian-publisher","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T12:58:08Z","webTitle":"Children's book praising Hitler as 'amazing leader' pulled by Indian publisher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/26/childrens-book-praising-hitler-as-amazing-leader-pulled-by-indian-publisher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/26/childrens-book-praising-hitler-as-amazing-leader-pulled-by-indian-publisher","fields":{"headline":"Children's book praising Hitler as 'amazing leader' pulled by Indian publisher","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An Indian publisher has withdrawn a book for children which included Adolf Hitler on a list of “amazing leaders … who have devoted their lives [to] the betterment of their country and people”. Pegasus, the children’s books imprint of India’s B Jain Publishing Group, confirmed to the Guardian on 26 March that its title Leaders was no longer on sale, following widespread, criticism of its decision to feature Hitler in the book, alongside the likes of Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela. Published in 2016, the non-fiction title, aimed at children, provided biographies of 11 “amazing leaders”. According to Pegasus’s description of the book, which also featured Napoleon Bonaparte, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi and Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi, “some are famous, others little known, but all of them energise their followers and try to make the world better”. Hitler was also included on the book’s cover. The withdrawal of the book follows worldwide outrage, including from Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in the US, who said the description of Hitler as “dedicated to the betterment of countries and people” would “bring tears of joy to the Nazis and their racist neo-Nazi heirs”. “Adolf Hitler was a visionary – his vision almost destroyed our planet; started the second world war, which left tens of millions dead and mass-murdered six million Jews during the Nazi Holocaust,” said Cooper. “Placing Hitler alongside truly great political and humanitarian leaders is an abomination that is made worse as it targets young people with little or no knowledge of world history and ethics.” Pegasus’s publishing director Annshu Juneja told the New York Times earlier this month, when the book was still on sale, that there had been no previous complaints about it. He said Hitler was included in the book because “his leadership skills and speeches influenced masses”. “We are not talking about his conduct or his views or whether he was a good leader or a bad leader but simply portraying how powerful he was as a leader,” Juneja said in the interview."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/pendleton-somerby-halfords-ebike-flick-of-power-is-addictive-review-martin-love","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Pendleton Somerby ebike: ‘That flick of power is addictive’ | Martin Love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/pendleton-somerby-halfords-ebike-flick-of-power-is-addictive-review-martin-love","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/pendleton-somerby-halfords-ebike-flick-of-power-is-addictive-review-martin-love","fields":{"headline":"Pendleton Somerby ebike: ‘That flick of power is addictive’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Pendleton Somerby ebike Price £600, halfords.com Frame Aluminium Gears 8 speed Battery 40-50 miles after 5-hour recharge Most of us know Victoria Pendleton for her exploits in the velodrome. As a track cyclist she represented Britain for more than a decade and utterly dominated the sport between 2005 and 2012. In all she won nine world titles, including a record six in the individual sprint competition. She’s an Olympic, European and Commonwealth champion. So what’s she doing riding an electric bike around a dining table in a hotel in Soho? Wearing a neat black suit (“I love bespoke tailoring,” she says), Victoria whoops and laughs as she dodges diners and swoops round waiters carrying trays of champagne glasses. She’s used to going round and round a track, so this must be a doddle for her. But she isn’t just showing off her bike-handling skills, we’re here for the launch of her ebike range. For the past few years she has been working with Halfords on a line-up that has nothing to do with flat-out speed cycling and everything to do with a relaxing ride into town, possibly for a coffee and some light shopping before drifting home. Her Somerby model, complete with mudguards and rack, starts at just £224 – it is easily Halfords’ bestselling women’s bike. There are also hybrids and children’s bikes in the range. Now the Somerby has gone electric. Ebikes are the fastest-growing sector of the bike market. Last year more than 33m ebikes were sold in Asia, and sales in western Europe are set to follow the trend. Elsewhere throttle-twist bikes are popular, but here in the UK, we are limited to pedal-assist motors with a top speed of 15mph. But why would one of Britain’s greatest cyclists want to ride a sensible town bike with a little electric motor? “You are right,” laughs Victoria.” I am an Olympian cyclist after all. So riding an ebike does seem crazy. All my career it’s been about hard work and effort on the bike. But that little flick of power is very addictive. I first rode an ebike a few years ago and straight away I thought: ‘Yup, that’s for me.’” The clever people who predict future trends in these matters believe ebikes are not so much about cycling but about an alternate means of navigating the cities we live in. Halfords isn’t hoping to lure hardened cyclists on to their ebikes – they’re targeting people who’d normally regard anything with two wheels with deep suspicion. If you’ve never considered cycling before (or can no longer be bothered to battle that last incline on your way home) you’ll find the electric-powered version of the Somerby a welcome surprise. It has a motor with three power levels to take the strain out of pedalling uphill, and eight gears to make riding easier on the flat. The battery has a range of up to 50 miles. The low step-through frame makes getting on and off simple. It also comes with built-in mudguards and a chain guard to protect your clothes from oily muck, and it comes with a luggage rack and a sprung saddle to ameliorate the worst of the pot holes. Give one a go! Victoria is only 37, but seems to have led nine lives already. Having conquered the cycling world, she’s now swapped two wheels for four legs and races as a professional jockey. And next month she joins Ben Fogle as the pair attempt to climb Mount Everest. Why on earth would you do that, I ask? She looks a bit perplexed. “Why? Because I like a challenge, of course!” Her idea of a challenge isn’t quite what the rest of us think it is. A gentle ride on an electric bike will do perfectly well, thank you.

He spent most of his career at Sedbergh school, in Cumbria, teaching French, German, English literature and religious studies before going into semi-retirement and entering the priesthood. In his funeral address the current vicar of St Andrew’s church in Sedbergh, where Bill was a priest after being ordained, pointed out that he had christened, married, buried and listened to almost everyone in the area. He completed 34 years at the church, and at the age of 96 delivered his last sermon, on the occasion of the Sedbergh music festival. He was born Edward Percy Eades Long in Sydenham, Kent, the son of Harold and Maud (nee Eades), five months after the outbreak of the first world war, and was one of four siblings. His father worked for the Mersey Docks and Harbour board and was in charge of port warehouses during the second world war. Bill grew up on Merseyside, attending Rock Ferry high school, and studied French at Liverpool University, where he went on to gain an MA. In 1938 he went to the Sorbonne in Paris to study for a doctorate. There he met Helen (nee Prenter), who was working for the British Council. But after the Germans invaded the city in June 1940, Bill and Helen faced several difficult years. Shortages, separation and eventually internment in camps 50 miles apart were tempered only by their marriage in 1941 – they were only allowed to be together from 1942 – and the birth of their son, Robin. Finally, in 1944 they were repatriated, reaching Liverpool via Portugal. They settled in Sedbergh, but Robin died the day after his fourth birthday. Bill taught at Sedbergh school until 1973, the year he was ordained. Apart from a brief spell at Newcastle University, Bill remained in Sedbergh for the rest of his life. Helen died in 1972. He continued in education, visiting local state schools, telling stories with a religious aspect. Whether Bill’s relentless positivity came from his religious convictions or were an innate part of his character we will never know, but his strong beliefs were integral to his relaxed approach. He was always supportive, with a lack of criticism complemented by a strong sense of irony. He will be remembered by all who knew him for his humanity and generosity of spirit. He is survived by me and my sister, Felicity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/flatbread-fantasies-and-a-tantalising-glimpse-of-home","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Flatbread fantasies and a tantalising glimpse of home | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/flatbread-fantasies-and-a-tantalising-glimpse-of-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/flatbread-fantasies-and-a-tantalising-glimpse-of-home","fields":{"headline":"Flatbread fantasies and a tantalising glimpse of home","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"She opens the door, tuts and asks: “Can I help you?” She says it so aggressively that I know she is not really interested in my needs. I have no clue how to answer the question. Can she help me? Well, yes. I’ve been standing in front of her restaurant for 15 minutes waiting for it to open. I’ve been craving paratha rolls for a few weeks. I haven’t been back to see my family. I don’t have any frozen parathas in the freezer. I’m working from home, trying to get stuff done and all I can think about is a delicious paratha roll stuffed with paneer. I remember an Indian street food restaurant up the road. Whenever I pass it, the shutters are down, but they advertise, in bad graffiti, Indian street eats. Something about it is saying to me, come here, eat. Bristol doesn’t have many decent Indian food spots. When I look up the opening times, I glance at the menu. It opens at midday and it sells paratha rolls. Sold, I head up the road and arrive dead on midday. The shutters are up for once. I can see inside for the first time. It looks like a standard café, but all the tables have sari material on them. There’s something very gap year about the typography of the “Aum” symbol that adorns most surfaces. I’m almost turned off, but I read the menu in the window, debating how many paratha rolls are too many. I shift from foot to foot, mentally deciding that today would be a day to forget to put stuff into my calorie counter app. I am impatient. Hungry. Desperate for paratha rolls. Ten minutes later, and they still haven’t opened the restaurant. I can see the owner in the window. She’s in the kitchen, washing pans. I worry that maybe those pans have been sitting out all night, dirty, and she is now shamefully washing them before opening. Very hygienic. Five minutes later and she still hasn’t noticed she has a customer. I am freezing and I am hungry so, in desperation, I call the restaurant number. I think, if she answers, I’ll ask what time they’re opening. There is no answer. I decide to go. I’ll get a sandwich at home. But then I notice she’s approaching. Finally, I think. She’s ready to open. Those paratha rolls are mine. One chicken, one paneer, one lamb. Maybe a second paneer one. Four paratha rolls. That’s not too many. She opens the door and I step forward to go inside. “Can I help you?” she asks. I’m taken aback. Yes, I think. I want paratha rolls and warmth. I’ve been thinking about visiting this place for so long. I’ve been dreaming about kaki’s [my aunt’s] parathas recently. I have this vivid memory of watching her dip a tablespoon in a steel container of ghee and rubbing the underside all over the surface of a paratha before serving it to me. I didn’t need to eat it with anything else. I want to tell this woman all this. Yes – yes you can help me. Help me eat my way back home. You can definitely help me. You can help me feel like all those things I took for granted as a child, as a teenager, as an adult, are available to me here so far away from home. Yes, I think, you can definitely help me. You can change the menu so it doesn’t say masala chai tea. Chai means tea. Chai tea means tea tea. You can definitely help me be warm and fed. But mainly you can help me with three different kinds of paratha roll. Because I need them in my stomach right now. “Yes,” I say, “I want some food.” “But we’re not open,” she replies. She is very confused. “It says you open at midday,” I say, pointing to the sign above my head. She steps out of the restaurant and stares up at her sign. I’m really confused now. Does she even work here? “No,” she says. “We’re not open until much later.” “Oh,” I say. On cue, my stomach rumbles angrily. “OK, well, what time do you?” “Look,” she says, stepping back into the restaurant. “Our chef hasn’t even showed up for work today.” She shuts the door and walks back to the kitchen. I head home for a sandwich."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/16/manchester-residents-lobby-to-name-street-after-emirati-activist-ahmed-mansoor","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T13:05:08Z","webTitle":"Manchester campaigners want street named after Emirati activist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/manchester-residents-lobby-to-name-street-after-emirati-activist-ahmed-mansoor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/manchester-residents-lobby-to-name-street-after-emirati-activist-ahmed-mansoor","fields":{"headline":"Manchester campaigners want street named after Emirati activist","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A group of Manchester residents has launched a campaign to name a new street after a jailed Emirati human rights activist in a bid to highlight human rights abuses by the United Arab Emirates, which has invested billions of pounds in the city and its title-winning football club. Ahmed Mansoor was arrested after a dozen Emirati security officers stormed his home in Ajman in the early hours of 20 March 2017. The UAE’s official news agency, WAM, claimed Mansoor had been detained for using social media to “publish false and misleading information” that would harm national unity and the country’s reputation. The Abu Dhabi United group, owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the country’s deputy prime minister and member of the ruling royal family, entered a £1bn housing deal with Manchester city council in 2014, six years after it bought Manchester City football club. Campaigners have criticised the city’s authorities for failing to use their influence to put pressure on the country to improve its human rights record. In a letter from campaigners calling on the city’s councillors, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, and the MP for Manchester Central, Lucy Powell, to back the “Ahmed Mansoor St’ campaign, the group argued it would be “a fitting honour to bestow upon an individual who embodies so many of the qualities that the city and the wider region celebrates as a key part of its history”. The leader of Manchester city council, Richard Leese, responded to the letter from the group, saying: “Street naming is not my department, but long-standing policy is to not name streets after anybody still living or with no connection to the city.” Lucy Powell responded to the group saying that she had written to the council asking it to consider the proposal. In their letter, campaigners acknowledged that this was council policy, but called on councillors to back an amendment to that rule. In April 2017, Manchester City FC named a street outside the club’s Ethihad stadium after the former council chief executive Howard Bernstein, who facilitated the UAE’s investment in Manchester. Sir Howard Bernstein Way is a private street and so not subject to council rules on street naming. In the letter to councillors, the group said: “We believe that Manchester could and should stand in support of outstanding individuals who are being subjected to serious human rights abuses as a direct result of principled stances on issues that Manchester celebrates as part of its heritage, especially when there is a clear link to the city. “Trade and investment are important, but, as its history demonstrates, Manchester has always used new relations with different parts of the world to argue for the values of human rights and dignity that are so important to many in the city.” Since Mansoor’s arrest a year ago, the Manchester Amnesty International group has been staging monthly vigils outside the council’s chambers to raise awareness of his situation. It is thought he is being held in solitary confinement and has not seen a lawyer. Last month, a report by Dr Jonathan Silver of the University of Sheffield, commissioned by Greater Manchester Housing Action, found that none of the 15,000 recently built homes in Manchester city centre was classed as “affordable”. “As the city becomes re-established in new global networks of finance and trade the people of Manchester will want to know that these international relations are predicated not just on a focus on investment,” said Silver, one of the letter’s signatories. “Rather, drawing on our history of solidarity and radical action alongside recognition of the important role (both positive and negative) the city has played in global history, issues of human rights must be at the fore of these new relations. To be an international city is not just about how many millions of pounds are flowing in but how we remain true to our shared ideals of respect, dignity and justice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/apr/05/horror-anthology-films-ghost-stories-jeremy-dyson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T11:50:50Z","webTitle":"Beasts at the box office: why the horror anthology refuses to die","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/05/horror-anthology-films-ghost-stories-jeremy-dyson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/05/horror-anthology-films-ghost-stories-jeremy-dyson","fields":{"headline":"Beasts at the box office: why the horror anthology refuses to die","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘Do you want to see something really scary …” The horror anthology movie is a peculiar – some might think – imperfect beast. It’s been with us for well over 70 years and is close to the heart of many fans, not least my own. In fact, it was one of the key influences on Ghost Stories, which I co-wrote and co-directed with Andy Nyman. But what makes these pictures so endlessly fascinating and appealing? Though there are examples from all over the world, this body rests on two sturdy British legs. One is the Ealing horror film Dead of Night, released in 1945; the other is the output of a small UK-based studio called Amicus, who were active throughout the 60s and 70s. The Ealing film was more obviously artistic and noble in its intention, while the Amicus titles were – on the surface at least – more shamelessly commercial. And the tussle between those two impulses gives us a big clue as to the enduring appeal of these curious films. Anthology movies, sometimes known as portmanteau films, predate Dead of Night of course. Hollywood had produced a couple of notable successes in the early 40s. In 1942, 20th Century Fox released Tales of Manhattan, an all-star, multi-story piece about a tailcoat that is passed from one owner to another, while the following year saw Universal’s Flesh and Fantasy, which had a vaguely supernatural air without ever touching on anything horrific. Both films were inspired by the French movie Un Carnet de Bal (1937), directed by Julien Duvivier, who was then hired to work on Flesh and Fantasy. Ealing Studios picked up the baton in 1944 with The Halfway House, another quasi-supernatural drama in which a miscellaneous group of people find themselves at a mysterious Welsh hotel – unaware it was destroyed by a bomb the previous year. Its success persuaded Ealing boss Michael Balcon to make another film in the same vein the following year. Reflecting on it in his autobiography, Balcon said: “We decided it would be a good idea to make a series of ghost stories joined by a suitable central thread, which would display the all-round talents of the creative team we had built up.” And it’s fair to say they had quite a team. Dead of Night has four directors: Basil Dearden, Charles Crichton, Alberto Cavalcanti and Robert Hamer. Cavalcanti was a feted documentary-maker who had also made the wartime classic Went the Day Well?; Crichton would go on to direct The Lavender Hill Mob and A Fish Called Wanda; Hamer would helm the brilliant Kind Hearts and Coronets, and Dearden gave us The Blue Lamp and The League of Gentlemen (the 1960 black-comedy thriller from which a certain comedy group thieved their name). The stories in Dead of Night were a combination of adaptations (two from EF Benson, one from HG Wells) and original stories by Ealing staff writers. One of these, the through-line story that binds the others together, is Dead of Night’s secret weapon: it’s the best of the lot. An anxious architect (brilliantly played by an increasingly sweaty Mervyn Johns) is troubled by recurring dreams. His wife recommends he take up an invitation to a country house – only for him to get there and be hit by a terrible sense of deja vu. In an attempt to calm him down, the other guests tell him stories of their own supernatural experiences. But each time we come back to him, things get weirder and weirder. Dead of Night still packs a wallop. There is a third element to the film’s success: it was made by lovers of horror. Cavalcanti in particular was a huge admirer of Val Lewton’s groundbreaking B pictures being produced for RKO at the time – literate supernatural fantasies that relied on suggestion and atmosphere for their scares. Dead of Night was a moderate success on its release, but it didn’t lead to any revolution in movie-making in the UK. No particular strand of intelligent, well-made supernatural horror films appeared in its wake. In fact, Dead of Night’s real impact was not to be felt for another two decades. Amicus was famously a studio without walls, cobbling together productions on a film-by-film basis. It was founded by two New Yorkers of contrasting temperaments, dynamic grifter Max J Rosenberg and bookish scriptwriter Milton Subotsky, who were drawn to the UK by the Eady Levy, a government sponsored film production scheme. (Matt Hancock, take note.) Their first movie, Dr Terror’s House of Horrors (1965) just happened to be a portmanteau horror film. As well as Dead of Night, it was inspired by the recent success of the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation Tales of Terror and Black Sabbath (adaptations of Chekhov and Tolstoy). Dr Terror had to make do with Subotsky as its writer, but this was no bad thing. Subotsky was a massive fan of the genre and had a deep love of SF and horror, yet it was Rosenberg’s business smarts that lit the fuse. He realised that an anthology had a cost advantage: a conventional narrative required actors to be booked for several weeks of production and paid accordingly, but each individual story could be shot in a few days. This meant Amicus could afford to punch well above its weight, attracting big marquee turns with a reasonable daily rate, then have their names on the poster to market the movie for a fraction of what it would normally cost to employ them. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were snared in this way, and later productions would boast the likes of Jack Palance, Herbert Lom, David Warner and Donald Pleasence. This ethos extended behind the camera, and Subotsky and Rosenberg thought big when it came to creative talent. Dr Terror director Freddie Francis was an A-list cinematographer who had shot Room at the Top, Sons and Lovers and Innocents. Roy Ward Baker was an industry veteran who’d made the original Titanic drama A Night to Remember. New talent would also be promoted – such as Kevin Connor, a gifted visual stylist who was still in his 30s when he directed From Beyond the Grave. Crucially, the films were made with love and care. If the budgets were low, the aspirations were high, and this attitude paid off on screen. Amicus were also enterprising in their source material, turning to Psycho author Robert Bloch for Torture Garden, British ghost story writer Ronald Chetwynd-Hayes for From Beyond the Grave, and in a particular stroke of genius the infamous EC horror comics of the 50s for Tales from the Crypt and The Vault of Horror. By 1975, the cycle ground to a halt – along with the rest of the British film industry – after a productive decade. Subotsky attempted a revival with The Monster Club (1981), but the old magic was gone. However, the work done lingered in the imagination of a generation of genre fans, and the form became a fixture that is still with us today. The 80s saw Creepshow, Twilight Zone: The Movie, Cat’s Eye and VHS-only gem Screamtime. In the 90s, we got Tales from the Darkside: The Movie, Body Bag and Tales from the Hood. And it’s still going strong with the V/H/S/ franchise, The ABCs of Death and the soon to be released The Field Guide to Evil. And the secret of their enduring appeal? For me it’s two-fold. It’s partly to do with that fusion of the highbrow and lowbrow in the best examples of the anthology horror, which is deeply entertaining. But there’s something older, too, something primal lurking in there, a connection to our most ancient form of storytelling. There’s an atavistic yearning deep inside us to be back round that flickering fire, keeping the terrors of the night at bay, as the yarn-spinner holds us bewitched: “You liked that one? Well, I’ve got another for you – but be warned, this one is really scary …” • Ghost Stories is released on 6 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/26/child-exploitation-drives-record-increase-in-number-of-british-slavery-cases","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T13:39:58Z","webTitle":"Child exploitation drives steep rise in number of UK slavery cases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/26/child-exploitation-drives-record-increase-in-number-of-british-slavery-cases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/26/child-exploitation-drives-record-increase-in-number-of-british-slavery-cases","fields":{"headline":"Child exploitation drives steep rise in number of UK slavery cases","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 5,000 potential victims of trafficking and modern slavery were reported to UK authorities last year, the highest number on record. For the first time, British citizens made up the highest number of potential victims, a shift driven by an increase in the use of child drug mules by criminal gangs. Overall, the number of possible child victims grew by two-thirds compared with 2016. Will Kerr, the director of the National Crime Agency, said the figures were likely to underestimate the scale of the problem, and that the government was facing an evolving threat. “The criminals involved in these types of exploitation are going into online spaces, particularly adult services websites, to enable their criminality,” said Kerr. The rise in the number of young people being exploited for sexual purposes or drug trafficking was a concern, he said. Almost half of the 5,145 cases reported – 41% – involved the possible exploitation of a child aged under 18. The figures show the number of reports made to the national referral mechanism, the system for identifying victims of trafficking. Last year, 819 potential British victims were referred to the NRM, up from 326 in 2016, according to the National Crime Agency. The increase is due to a rise in city-based gangs using children to transport drugs to rural areas, allowing them to expand their operations. Albania was the second largest national group recorded, followed by Vietnam, China, Nigeria and Romania. Albanian and Nigerian cases most commonly involved sexual exploitation, while the majority of Vietnamese cases involved labour exploitation. The referrals included possible victims from 116 countries. A total of 2,352 cases, almost half of those reported, involved potential forced labour. A third of cases, 1,744, involved suspected sexual exploitation. The NRM was also alerted to three possible cases of organ harvesting. Kerr said authorities had seen greater crossovers between slavery and organised immigration crime outside the UK. “Often the same criminal networks are involved in transportation, and migrants themselves are vulnerable to labour and sexual exploitation during their journeys and after,” he said. Overall, the number of referrals grew by more than a third, from 3,804 in 2016 to 5,145 in 2017. Last year, about 10% of individuals referred to the NRM were assessed to be modern slavery victims, while the majority of cases are still pending. Of the cases involving people from outside the EU, less than 3% of individuals were assessed to be modern slavery victims. While cases involving EU or British individuals are dealt with by the NCA’s modern slavery human trafficking unit, non-EU cases are handled by the Home Office. Patrick Burland, the senior project officer for the ‎UN Migration Agency IOM, warned of a “potential bias against recognising people as victims of trafficking if they are from countries where their right to residency in the UK is not pre-established”. The government recently announced that UK visas and immigration will no longer make decisions on trafficking cases, with responsibility handed to a new expert body within the Home Office. But Burland warned there was still a potential conflict of interest. “The most effective way for the UK government to build an effective firewall between victim identification and immigration concerns is to move this process outside of the Home Office,” he said. Victoria Atkins, the minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, said the government was “leading the world in our response to this horrendous crime”, but added: “We know there is more to do, and we are working to improve the system for identifying victims and supporting them to leave situations of exploitation and begin to recover and rebuild their lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/31/ex-uber-boss-was-paid-4m-by-investor-that-acquired-175-stake","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Ex-Uber boss was paid $4m by investor that acquired 17.5% stake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/31/ex-uber-boss-was-paid-4m-by-investor-that-acquired-175-stake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/31/ex-uber-boss-was-paid-4m-by-investor-that-acquired-175-stake","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Uber boss was paid $4m by investor that acquired 17.5% stake","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A controversial former Uber boss, who was one of the ride-hailing service’s most senior executives when it was engulfed in crisis last year, was paid $4m (£2.8m) in consultancy fees by the venture capital firm brought in to revive the company’s fortunes. Emil Michael received the payment for advice given to the technology investor SoftBank as it acquired a 17.5% stake in Uber at the turn of the year. The SoftBank investment was billed as a fresh start for Uber, after it had been swamped by allegations of sexual harassment, theft of trade secrets and data breaches during 2017. Michael, who was a senior vice-president before leaving Uber in June, was reportedly a key ally of its founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick, whose influence on the board was diminished after SoftBank took its stake. Kalanick resigned from his executive role in June, amid efforts to bring about wholesale change of Uber’s corporate culture. In January he sold about a third of his 10% Uber stake to SoftBank, while retaining a seat on the company’s board. SoftBank declined to comment on why it had hired such a high-profile member of Kalanick’s so-called “A-Team”, but a spokesman added: “As is common practice in corporate transactions, SoftBank occasionally appoints individual consultants to advise on complex matters. Emil played a helpful consultancy role in the Uber transaction.” While there is no suggestion that Michael was involved in any of the historical allegations of illegal behaviour at Uber, he has been portrayed as a polarising figure. In 2014 Michael apologised after suggesting at a private dinner that Uber might hire a team of researchers to dig up compromising material on critical journalists. A firsthand report of the event by BuzzFeed said he specifically cited Sarah Lacy, the editor of the technology website PandoDaily, who had accused Uber of sexism and misogyny and said she would be deleting Uber’s app from her phone. Michael said he had been criticising Lacy for suggesting taxis were a safer option for women than Uber. He added that the suggestion Uber might dig up dirt on its critics was “hypothetical”. The incident became newsworthy again last year as a former Uber engineer plunged the company into crisis by detailing a series of allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination, claiming that management repeatedly dismissed her complaints, protected a repeat offender and threatened to fire her for raising concerns. Michael’s name also emerged in a separate row after he and Kalanick visited an escort/karaoke bar in South Korea several years ago as part of a business trip, which led to a complaint to human resources. Michael’s lawyers, Schillings, said the businessman was one of 12 executives at his level at Uber and that he was only responsible for 2% of the company’s staff. Schillings added: “It is false to say that he held part responsibility for the alleged corporate culture at Uber … Our client had no involvement in allegations of sexual harassment, trade secret violations or data breaches.” The news about Michael’s consultancy fee comes as the Guardian has also established that SoftBank’s separate $100bn Vision Fund – which is backed by the likes of Apple and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund – is barred from holding a stake in Uber despite it being set up specifically to invest in technology companies. A little-known clause buried in the fund’s rule book prevents it from taking stakes in “P2P ride sharing”, which rules out investments in Uber and its competitors. SoftBank declined to comment on the restriction or explain why the clause had been inserted into the rule book."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/23/scotland-costa-rica-international-friendly-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T21:49:32Z","webTitle":"Marco Ureña keeps up Scotland’s miserable record against Costa Rica","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/23/scotland-costa-rica-international-friendly-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/23/scotland-costa-rica-international-friendly-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Marco Ureña keeps up Scotland’s miserable record against Costa Rica","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If this was Alex McLeish’s attempt to dispel the sense of indifference that had come with his underwhelming appointment as Scotland manager last month, then not all went to plan. His was the archetypal international football hiring, and this was the archetypal international friendly, with not much to rouse the smattering of fans inside Hampden beyond the novel sight of a few new faces in the dark blue shirt. Of course, Costa Rica are off to the World Cup this summer, and so this fixture at least had some tangible purpose for them as they go through their final preparations before heading to Russia. But for Scotland this was about kick-starting a new cycle which, they hope, will lead them to a major tournament not far down the line. McLeish’s experimental lineup included places for the Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna, while Kevin McDonald partnered the newly Scottish Scott McTominay in midfield. The enigmatic but unproven Oli McBurnie led the line, providing a source of curiosity for those who had not seen a professional footballer play with socks around his ankles since the 1970s. With so many making their debuts it was little wonder that Scotland looked disjointed from the start, falling behind after only 14 minutes when Bryan Oviedo’s pulled-back cross from the left was guided home by Marco Ureña. Callum Paterson threatened a reply moments later, but saw his glancing header from a Matt Ritchie cross flash just past the far post. The decision to play a back three, with Paterson and Andrew Robertson as the wing-backs, was designed to allow Scotland to go down the outside of the opposition, but there was little sign of that until Robertson drilled a low ball into the box after 34 minutes. While at Liverpool Robertson so frequently finds Roberto Firmino or Mohamed Salah on the end of his deliveries, there was nobody in dark blue to turn home this one. With José Mourinho watching McTominay from the stands, the Manchester United midfielder struggled to get a grip of the game, getting caught out by the bounce of a ball at the start of the second half, allowing Costa Rica to break forward in numbers. Bryan Ruiz appeared to have been forced wide enough, but easily beat Robertson to cut inside at the byline and ping a strike off the Scotland crossbar from a tight angle. There was some nice passing from Scotland in the middle of the pitch, but all too rarely did it lead to anything in the final third. Tom Cairney is one of the many talents many believe Gordon Strachan should have been called up to the Scotland squad long ago, but the Fulham attacker did little to justify that claim here. Ritchie was handy from set pieces, but he still does not have the kind of influence on this Scotland team that he enjoys at Newcastle. With just under an hour played, Cairney and McTominay were withdrawn for Stuart Armstrong and Callum McGregor, with the Celtic pair immediately injecting some life into a stagnant affair. While there has been much excitement north of the border over McTominay’s rise at Old Trafford, he is not one to dominate a match, doing well enough on his international debut but not shining. He will grow into his surroundings in Scotland over time, just as he has in Manchester. McGregor nearly created the equaliser on the 65 minute mark, bursting through midfield before threading a pass for Ritchie, who had peeled away from his marker. But the Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas was equal to the shot from 16 yards. Scotland forged another opening soon after, with Robertson getting down the left to fizz a ball across the face of goal. McBurnie failed to make the connection. Scotland travel to Budapest next week to take on Hungary, perhaps explaining why McLeish decided against making the plethora of second half substitutions that often come with these sort of games. The likes of Ryan Christie, Barry Douglas, Jason Cummings and Jack Hendry may be granted their chance to impress there, as the new manager tests all options before the start of Euro 2020 qualification and the Nations League later this year. McBurnie was replaced by Matt Phillips with just over 10 minutes left, having put in a lot of effort as the lone frontman but failing to provide a much-needed cutting edge. Phillips was deployed in an unfamiliar centre-forward role, hinting once again at McLeish’s experimental mindset. The late introduction of the midfielder John McGinn for the central defender Charlie Mulgrew also showed that this game was being used as a try-out. A typical friendly with the typical footnote that the result didn’t matter all that much."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/24/proactiva-open-arms-rescue-boat-saved-218-from-drowning-mediterranean-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T20:01:09Z","webTitle":"‘My crew saved 218 migrants from drowning – so why are we the enemy?’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/24/proactiva-open-arms-rescue-boat-saved-218-from-drowning-mediterranean-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/24/proactiva-open-arms-rescue-boat-saved-218-from-drowning-mediterranean-migrants","fields":{"headline":"‘My crew saved 218 migrants from drowning – so why are we the enemy?’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Captain Marc Reig does not look like a man at the centre of a storm.

In the last three years, more than 5,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean onboard the ship run by the NGO, which patrols an area outside Libyan waters. But what happened next was anything but routine. As the ship docked in Pozzallo, dozens of police closed in. As soon as the human cargo disembarked, the ship was seized and three members of its crew put under investigation. The chief prosecutor of Catania, Carmelo Zuccaro, has accused them of refusing to hand the migrants over to Libyan coastguards, and so enabling illegal immigration. The 37-metre boat has remained moored in Pozzallo, awaiting a judge’s verdict on its fate, while Italians who no longer want their country to provide a refuge to migrants are celebrating its seizure. The Proactiva ship seems to have become a political hostage in a country where immigrants are perceived by many as invaders and parasites, and where the issue of migration has become toxic in the wake of this month’s election, which saw a surge in support for anti-immigrant parties. On 3 February, a neo-fascist shot and injured six Africans in the city of Macerata, and a few days later, rightwing parties vowed to kick 600,000 migrants out of the country if elected. In this context, anyone who helps migrants is considered an enemy, responsible for helping human traffickers. This is the crime of which the Spanish captain of the Open Arms is accused. Of his 19 crew members, more than half have returned home. Reig, 42, who now spends most of the time locked in his cabin, is haunted by the events of that dramatic night a week ago, when his ship picked up the migrants from their raft – and immediately faced a challenge from Libyan coastguards, who he says threatened to kill the crew if they didn’t hand the migrants over. “It all happened in the space of a few minutes. We had just rescued 218 people, when we saw the Libyan coastguard ship arrive,” he tells the Observer. “They said we had to give them back the migrants, or they would shoot us.” The Italian authorities called the Open Arms’ crew and advised them to leave the migrants to the Libyans, because they said Tripoli was in charge of the save-and-rescue zone in that area of the sea. But Reig says this is not true – the Libyan SAR zone was unilaterally declared by Italy and Libya around Christmas, but a notification by the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) has not been issued. Moreover, the rescue took place in international waters and so the orders of the Libyan coastguard were not binding. The law of the sea is clear: the responsibility lies with whoever rescues the boat first. “At that precise moment I thought about the dozens of empty boats we found at sea in recent months,” says Reig. “The migrants who were on board had been captured by the Libyans and deported back to Tripoli. The refugees we saved spoke of unimaginable torture. They say they would rather die than go back to Libya.’’ With Libyan rifles still pointed at his crew, Reig turned north towards Sicily. “If we had abandoned them to the Libyans, we would never have forgiven ourselves,’’ says Anabel Montes, coordinator of the rescue mission. “We were victims of an armed attack, but we are the ones on trial,” says Riccardo Gatti, head of the Open Arms mission. “And all this happens a week after the elections and the triumph of the rightwing parties in Italy. It does not seem a mere coincidence.’’ The morning after the standoff, Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right Northern League, tweeted: “Finally an Italian prosecutor is blocking the human trafficking.” Salvini, who ran an election campaign promising tougher laws against migrants, won almost 18% of the vote, becoming the undisputed leader of the centre-right. But Italy’s intolerant attitude began way before his rise. After the shipwreck of 3 October 2013, when 368 people died after a fire broke out on their boat a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa, Italy declared war on human traffickers. The goal was to capture the smugglers who organise the crossings and protect the migrants. This is how the year-long naval and air operation Mare Nostrum was born. During the mission, 150,000 migrants arrived safely in Italy, before moving on to destinations across Europe. Unfortunately, the operation angered some countries, above all France, Austria and Switzerland, who began to repel migrants and return them to the Italian authorities. The refugees rescued at sea found themselves stuck in Italy, and reception centres from north to south began collapsing. Italians started to complain about the thousands of migrants trapped in their cities. “In 2015, Italy’s approach starts to change,” explains Fulvio Vassallo, asylum law expert at the University of Palermo. “The Mare Nostrum operation was replaced by the more authoritarian Frontex, whose main objective is not saving lives but border control. The hunt for human traffickers began to lose its humanitarian purpose, replaced by feelings of intolerance.” In short, human traffickers had to be captured, not to put an end to the abuses perpetrated on refugees, but to stop the flow of people. Charity boats continued to run sea rescues, and picked up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore in 2017, compared with less than 1% in 2014. But then Italy’s minister of the interior, Marco Minniti, fearing that the NGOs were helping people smugglers from North Africa, proposed a code of conduct for the charities, including the commitment to take armed police officers onboard, which many considered unethical. “The message was clear,” says Vassallo. “NGOs had become a problem for European countries. [They] not only continued to deliver migrants, but also witnessed the injustices perpetrated by Libyan authorities. Linking them to the traffickers was a pretext to get rid of them.” Last August, Italian police impounded the Iuventa, a boat operated by German NGO Jugend Rettet, and dispatched a navy patrol boat to Libya as part of an attempt to end the refugee crisis. According to a police statement “the Iuventa was used for activities facilitating illegal immigration”. The ongoing investigation has found no real evidence against the NGO. But since then, charity efforts to save lives at sea have become increasingly difficult. Five aid groups that operate migrant-rescue boats in the Mediterranean have refused to sign up to the Italian government’s code of conduct, but three others have backed the new rules. Among those three is Proactiva Open Arms, which has seen donations fall by 40% in the last year. But if one part of Italy rejoices at the boat’s seizure, another celebrates the deeds of Captain Reig, sending him messages of support. But he rejects any description of himself as a hero. ‘‘The real heroes are those who cross the desert for years, enduring torture and persecution,” he says. “Those who, in order to get to Europe and not go back to Libya, throw themselves into a sea in which they cannot even swim.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/25/i-can-only-imagine-christian-faith-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"Faith films challenge Hollywood at box office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/25/i-can-only-imagine-christian-faith-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/25/i-can-only-imagine-christian-faith-film","fields":{"headline":"Faith films challenge Hollywood at box office","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"As Hollywood struggles with sexual harassment scandals and box-office woes, it could do worse than turn to God. For while religious movies have traditionally been considered a niche phenomenon, that assessment may need to be revised. Last weekend I Can Only Imagine, a Christian-themed independent biopic, beat a series of studio-backed films to win the number three spot behind Black Panther and Tomb Raider. And as Easter approaches, films with Christian messages are experiencing an upswing not seen since Mel Gibson’s 2004 crucifixion drama The Passion of Christ. I Can Only Imagine stars Dennis Quaid and was produced and directed by brothers Jon and Andy Erwin, the duo behind other faith-based hits such as Woodlawn, the story of a spiritual awakening among an Alabama high-school football team, starring Jon Voight and Sean Astin, and October Baby, an anti-abortion drama. The Erwins’ latest film tells the story of an abusive father (Quaid) who inspires his son to write the song I Can Only Imagine, based loosely on their relationship. In reality it was written by Bart Millard, lead singer of the band MercyMe who, at the age of 14, witnessed his dying father’s transformation. “I went from seeing my father go from a monster to a man who was desperately in love with Jesus,” Millard told the Christian Broadcast Network last week. He wrote the song in 1998; five years later it went on to become the bestselling Christian single of all time. That did not impress film executives. Jon Erwin says he was told there “was no audience for a Christian music movie ... But everybody I knew – in the Christian world that we live in – knew and loved the song, so we just believed that there was an audience for this movie and that they would show up”. I Can Only Imagine was ultimately picked up by Roadside Attractions, maker of Manchester By The Sea, and Lionsgate. The distributors agreed to promote it as a general audience production. With a $25m box-office take so far, it is also showing Hollywood that Christians can make consistent, repeat filmgoers. Audience polling found that 79% said they planned to pay to see the movie again. The faith-based genre is showing Hollywood that age and diversity are not necessarily antithetical to box-office success, and offer starring roles to actors who may no longer be at the top of casting directors’ call-in lists. “In last year’s hit The Shack, God was played by a black woman, an Asian woman played the Holy Spirit and Jesus was played by an Israeli,” says Peter Chattaway, reviewer for the faith-based film site, Patheos. A 10-part mini-series, The Bible, cast Samson as black; in the follow-up series, AD: The Bible Continues, several apostles were black and Mary Magdalene was part black, part Chinese. “Churches are increasingly diverse and that is being reflected in the films that are being made for their congregations,” says Chattaway. Other recent successes include Heaven Is for Real, the story of a boy who briefly dies, which grossed $91m in the US. Fireproof, about a porn-addicted fireman, made $33m from a $500,000 budget. God’s Not Dead, which follows a college student whose faith is challenged by a philosophy professor, made twice that. “Movies like God’s Not Dead are a lot more tribalistic and play to an us-versus-them mindset,” Chattaway says. In the first of the series, the atheist villain is knocked down by a car and converts as he is dying. The second sequel, Chattaway says, is more conciliatory. “It almost seems like an apology. It says we’ve got to get past our divisions.” This week sees the release of Paul, Apostle of Christ, starring Joanne Whalley, and the broadcast of an NBC television staging of Jesus Christ Superstar, the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice classic, with R&amp;B singer John Legend as Jesus and rock star Alice Cooper as King Herod. Increasingly, Chattaway says, filmmakers are looking to other corners of the Bible for material. Three years ago there was Killing Jesus, which focused on Johanna in Luke’s gospel. “She was one of patrons of the Jesus movement along with Mary Magdelene. She supported the movement with her own money. It also says that her husband worked for King Herod. That raises all sorts of questions. Why was the wife of one of Herod’s top servants hanging out with the Jesus movement?” But not all faith-based films thrive. Last week saw the release (outside the US) of Mary Magdalene, starring Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix. One reviewer described it as a “portentous and lugubrious revision ... the dreariest story ever told”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/23/ryan-giggs-tells-gareth-bale-to-snub-jose-mourinho-and-stay-at-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T22:30:06Z","webTitle":"Ryan Giggs tells Gareth Bale to snub José Mourinho and stay at Real Madrid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/23/ryan-giggs-tells-gareth-bale-to-snub-jose-mourinho-and-stay-at-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/23/ryan-giggs-tells-gareth-bale-to-snub-jose-mourinho-and-stay-at-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Ryan Giggs tells Gareth Bale to snub José Mourinho and stay at Real Madrid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ryan Giggs has urged Gareth Bale to resist any overtures from Manchester United and stay with Real Madrid. Giggs spent his whole playing career at United, making a record 963 appearances, and José Mourinho retains a strong interest in Bale. But the Wales manager does not believe the forward – who this week became his country’s leading scorer – should leave the Bernabéu. “It’s Real Madrid – there are only a handful of clubs who have got that aura,” Giggs said. “Of course you would want to stay there. What’s Gareth won, three Champions League titles? The proof is in that. When you are at clubs like that, you are always going to win things. Gareth has the ability to score every type of goal and there are similarities with Cristiano Ronaldo. They both started out as wingers and they are now goalscorers.” Giggs’s spell as Wales manager started with a 6-0 win over China, inspired by a Bale hat-trick, but he acknowledges he has plenty to learn and has said he tried to pick the brains of Chelsea’s Antonio Conte and the England rugby union head coach, Eddie Jones. “I spoke to a lot of managers in the time I was out of the game,” said Giggs. “I was busy and always watch other sports. I was in between Conte and Eddie at a charity dinner and I was constantly trying to talk to them. That was a nightmare actually as Eddie was trying to ask me questions about Sir Alex Ferguson and I wanted to get everything out of him.” Giggs had four games in interim charge of Manchester United after David Moyes was sacked and found it an enlightening experience. “I learned a lot about how lonely it was when I was United manager,” he said. “When you shut the door of your office and everyone else has gone home, you’re on your own. “It’s good to have people around and you want those people to be the ones you trust, but it can still be a lonely place. Ultimately you’re the boss and you have to make the decisions.” Asked where he could get better as a manager, Giggs said: “I am not a naturally outgoing person. Everything just comes with that little bit of experience.” Wales will face Uruguay in the China Cup final here on Monday. Uruguay beat the Czech Republic 2-0 on Friday with goals from Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/01/mirren-acting-sdrama-schools-teaching-students-alberge","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T23:51:03Z","webTitle":"Drama school rejects ‘often the best’, says Mirren","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/01/mirren-acting-sdrama-schools-teaching-students-alberge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/01/mirren-acting-sdrama-schools-teaching-students-alberge","fields":{"headline":"Drama school rejects ‘often the best’, says Mirren","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Helen Mirren, the Oscar-winning actor, has criticised drama schools for “stifling” the natural instincts of young actors. The star, who appears in a series of online acting masterclasses, told the Observer: “I’m very ambivalent about drama teachers and the classes that people go to. I think people’s instincts are crushed by bad drama teaching. I’ve watched it happen.” While acknowledging that people “can be really opened” by drama training, she said that others suffer because “individuality is stifled”. “It’s so often that the people who are actually the best are the ones who are thrown out of drama school because they’re idiosyncratic. They’re peculiar. They don’t fit any nicely tied-up box. In fact, they are the most interesting artists,” she said. “I’ve known people who were thrown out of drama school for not conforming to what the school felt was going to be a viable option in the profession.” Rupert Everett, who attracted rave reviews for his recent portrayal of Oscar Wilde in The Happy Prince, is among the acclaimed British actors who were expelled from drama school, in his case for alleged bad behaviour. Mirren’s awards include an Oscar in 2007 for her portrayal of Elizabeth II in The Queen. Although Mirren did not attend drama school, she learned her craft with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Partly because of her reservations about training, she has always turned down requests to teach or publicly discuss her acting. She finally agreed to a series of online masterclasses because they were to be directed by her husband, Taylor Hackford: “He’s lived with me for 30 years. He’s watched me prepare roles … He’s a director, so he understands the nature of the beast. So at least he can guide me by asking the right questions.” Mirren is the latest figure to take part in MasterClass, which offers online classes “taught by the world’s best”, including Oscar-winning film-makers such as Martin Scorseseand .Ron Howard. Over four days, unscripted, Mirren talked to camera, sharing the tips of her trade with an audience.Before filming the classes, she bought books on acting: “I thought I’ve got to at least know something about the theory of acting. But the weird thing was I sat down and it just poured out of me. It was really strange. I had no idea that I knew any of this stuff.” Ultimately, she jokes, the best advice she can give is “to be on time and don’t be an asshole”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/not-welcome-in-colombia-indigenous-migrants-stuck-at-border-after-fleeing-venezuela","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Not welcome in Colombia, indigenous migrants stuck at border after fleeing Venezuela","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/not-welcome-in-colombia-indigenous-migrants-stuck-at-border-after-fleeing-venezuela","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/not-welcome-in-colombia-indigenous-migrants-stuck-at-border-after-fleeing-venezuela","fields":{"headline":"Not welcome in Colombia, indigenous migrants stuck at border after fleeing Venezuela","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late last year, 12-year-old Betania heard talk among her neighbors that there was a city not far away where they could find food. “My mother said: ‘Betania, go away from here, because we are suffering hunger. Look how your siblings are; they don’t have anything in their bellies,’” she recalled. So Betania bid farewell to her family, left their remote village in the mountains of western Venezuela and walked 300km (186 miles) to the Colombian border city of Cúcuta. Camped on the far bank of the Táchira river, she found hundreds of fellow members of the Yukpa indigenous community who had also fled starvation and sickness in Venezuela, where scarcity caused by a spiraling economic collapse has penetrated even rural indigenous communities. The Yukpa are a tiny handful compared to the hundreds of thousands Venezuelans who have crossed the border in recent years to escape hyperinflation, spiraling crime and a seemingly endless political crisis at home. But unlike the other migrants, this indigenous group has been deported twice. Both times, they walked back to Colombia, where they set up camp again on the riverbank. Now, they are stuck: unwilling to go back to Venezuela, unwelcome to move forward in Colombia. “You know why I came here? Because I can’t stay back there without food, without money, without clothes, without anything,” said Anteli Romero, 28, a Yukpa artesan from the mountains outside the city of Machiques. “Now they’re saying that they don’t want the Yukpa here – they’re saying we came here for nothing.” Around 500 members of the group are camped out by the river, including several dozen pregnant women. Members of the group sleep in the open or in shelters assembled from recycled material. In the evening, a dozen small fires flicker in the woods as those with food cook white rice or corn cakes. While the masses of other Venezuelan migrants have dispersed into cities across Colombia, the Yukpa’s concentrated presence on the border has irritated local authorities. Members of the group have repeatedly clashed with Colombian border officials, and even threatened them with bows and arrows. Relations between Colombia and Venezuela have been tetchy for several years, but in January, authorities on the two countries cooperated to clear the riverbank encampment and return about 500 Yukpa to their lands outside the city of Machiques. The Yukpa said they was still no food or medicine there, so they walked back. In March, authorities in Cúcuta deported the Yukpa again. But many returned, and more keep arriving. “Back in Venezuela, we sometimes go the entire day without food. That’s why everyone is coming here,” said Arbelei Landino, another Yukpa migrant. When the current migration crisis erupted two years ago, Colombia initially responded by granting legal residence for working Venezuelans. In February it withdrew those privileges and deployed 3,000 troops to the border. But the tide of migrants over the open border has proven impossible to stop. Activists say the government must invest in a proper response before the situation becomes unmanageable. “The government has no idea how to handle this situation,” said Father Francesko Bortignon, who runs a migrant safe house in Cúcuta. The Yukpa, whose ancestral territories straddle the border and predate both Colombia and Venezuela, have tried to invoke their rights as a bi-national tribe. In theory, Colombia’s constitution recognizes the right to citizenship to members of such groups and extends special protections to preserve indigenous communities, but Yukpa leaders say the 15,000-member tribe have not received any of those protections. Colombia’s interior ministry has said it must take a census of the Yukpa to certify their indigenous identity. Until then, they’ll be regarded as Venezuelans living illegally in Cúcuta. “The attitude of the government is: ‘Hide the poor, they look ugly,’” said Andres Berona, legal adviser for the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC). “These actions are motivated by racism against the indigenous people.” Facing a complicated humanitarian and diplomatic crisis, Colombia authorities – local and national – simply took the easiest option, he said. The Cúcuta mayor’s office did not respond to requests, but previously told local media that the Yukpa were becoming involved in the smuggling across the border. Barona with ONIC said the government should give the Yukpa space to live and guarantee them access to food, clean water and latrines while it figures out a plan. Amid a humanitarian crisis which has already overwhelmed government and international aid, indigenous groups have often been neglected said Deborah Hines, Colombia director of the World Food Program. “We focus on indigenous communities because they tend to be the most vulnerable people,” she said. But many in the Yukpa camp said that life by the river was better than back home. At least here, a few coins can buy a bag of rice. In Venezuela, there is no rice to be found. “We got tired of suffering so much hunger. So we came here,” said Angel Romero, 32. “We hope they will help us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/04/antigua-barracuda-barbuda-losing-season-usl","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T13:00:10Z","webTitle":"Played 26, lost 26: The story of Antigua Barracuda's record-breaking season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/04/antigua-barracuda-barbuda-losing-season-usl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/04/antigua-barracuda-barbuda-losing-season-usl","fields":{"headline":"Played 26, lost 26: The story of Antigua Barracuda's record-breaking season","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Football, as the saying goes, is a results business and teams are prepared to rip up blueprints and burn through personnel in order to get them. Losing runs can act like a virus, stripping confidence and cohesion from even the most stable side, but one way or another they end eventually – most of the time. In 2013 Antigua Barracuda played 26 matches in the United Soccer League (USL) – then the third tier in the US – and lost them all. It was the club’s third and last full season, fleeting even by the standards of North America’s unstable development leagues. They are one of only a handful of professional sides to finish a season without a single point but, more than anything else, theirs is a tale of wasted potential. The “Cudas” were Antigua and Barbuda’s first full-time professional team, founded by the Caribbean nation’s FA with the aim of developing national team players and bringing crowds back to the Sticky Wicket, the stadium forever associated with the infamous fraudster Allen Stanford. In their first season the team won nine games and Gordon Derrick, then head of the FA, warned visiting fans they “may not want to return home – after all, Antigua is the last stop before heaven”. In 2012 the ambitious project was brought crashing to earth. The team won five league games and were left isolated as sister teams to Sevilla and River Plate, based in Puerto Rico, fell by the wayside. Opponents were no longer willing to travel thousands of miles to play in front of dwindling crowds. The USL proposed a drastic course of action – the team would relocate to the mainland and play all of the next season’s matches away from home. By the time Adrian Whitbread took over as manager in June 2013, midway through the summertime season, they were pointless, penniless and fighting to complete their fixtures. Whitbread, a former Premier League player with Swindon and West Ham, sensed problems at his first training session when none of the players knew who he was. It turned out to be one of the team’s better days – at least they had somewhere to train. The team had no home, save for a modest hotel in Tampa, Florida. The new manager had to lean on his own contacts, and upcoming opponents, to find training facilities. When there were no other options the squad would resort to a kickabout in the hotel car park. This was in a division that included Orlando City, a team who would join MLS and sign Kaká a year later. The Barracuda put a season-high two goals past them in an early fixture – but conceded seven. Before his first fixture in charge, at the Richmond Kickers, Whitbread found out his team would not be flying to Virginia. Instead the team’s entire personnel – 18 players and four backroom staff – squeezed into minivans for the 10-hour journey. They lost 4-0, climbed back into the minivans and drove through the night to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After waiting for hours at the hotel to check in they lost their next game 3-1, reaching the halfway point in the season without a point. Beyond these extraordinary day‑to-day challenges the long-term outlook was bleak. “The players hadn’t been paid for God knows how many months,” Whitbread says. “Some left because they needed to send money back to their families. I tried to get new players in but a lot of them didn’t like what they saw straight away.” Even the team physio walked away, while in one particularly embarrassing episode the squad had to walk from their hotel to a game in LA when they couldn’t afford hire cars. “After a while,” Whitbread admits, “you want a home game just so you can sleep in your own bed. I knew there was no way the team was going to survive.” The coach tried to embrace the challenge regardless but often had to dip into his own pocket to cover costs and ended up joining the players in waiting patiently to be reimbursed. The Barracuda players, physically exhausted after a season of long road trips and unsure if they would ever get paid, would have been forgiven for losing interest in results, but George Dublin, the captain, insists that was never an issue. “As a player, every game you go into you want to get a win. There were games we thought we should have won – competing, ahead after 80-something minutes, but by the 90th minute we had lost.” Dublin accepts that off-field issues meant the team were fighting a losing battle. “We were on the road all the time, sleeping in hotels, driving for hours,” he says. “Plus we had families to support. We all tried to win and wanted to win games but you get to a point – 16, 17 losses in a row – you realise it’s not ever going to go right.” The team never got the necessary result to avoid an unwanted place in history but two weeks before their final fixture Whitbread and his players finally got paid. It was a happy ending of sorts and, looking back nearly five years later, both the coach and captain are philosophical. “I will never take it as a negative,” says Whitbread, who is now working at Barnet in League Two. “Going through those struggles has made me stronger and wiser.” The side’s sense of togetherness helped the margins of defeat grow slimmer and earned their opponents’ admiration and respect. “The players stuck together and wanted to better themselves. Their spirit was unquestionable,” Whitbread adds. “When word got around about what was going on, the other teams couldn’t believe the spirit we had. After a game in Arizona [a 1-0 defeat to Phoenix FC] the home fans even invited the players to have a beer with them.” The project at least achieved one objective: improving the national team. In 2012 Antigua and Barbuda progressed to the second round of Concacaf World Cup qualifying, narrowly lost their first competitive matches against the USA and broke into the world’s top 100. For a nation with a population similar to Andorra it was a striking achievement. That legacy has sadly been overshadowed by Derrick’s six-year suspension from football, handed down by Fifa’s ethics committee last September. When asked to explain Antigua Barracuda’s nosedive into the history books, Dublin and Whitbread pinpoint the financial restraints that so often affect sport in the Caribbean. “A lot of these teams really do run on a shoestring budget,” Whitbread says. As part of the national team that broke new ground Dublin had hoped sponsors would move in to back the club side financially. Instead they were left high and dry – but there are lessons to be learned from their slow decline. “It was definitely difficult,” says Dublin. “But it’s something we all learned from – something that was meant to happen. There is nothing that’s perfect in the world. I still think the team was a good idea but when people invest in Caribbean football they want instant results.” They are not the only ones."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/24/march-for-our-lives-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T14:00:25Z","webTitle":"Today's the day: 500,000 to rally in Washington for March for Our Lives | The Resistance Now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/march-for-our-lives-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/march-for-our-lives-washington","fields":{"headline":"Today's the day: 500,000 to rally in Washington for March for Our Lives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Resistance Now is a weekly update on the people, action and ideas driving the protest movement in the US.

So right now, when you have large numbers of young people all across this country who are saying to the leaders of this country, ‘When we go to school we want to feel safe,’ that will have an impact, absolutely, to my mind.” The Guardian will have live coverage of the more than 800 separate rallies taking place on Saturday, with contributors from the Eagle Eye as well as our own reporters across the country. March for Our Lives has a tool to find your nearest march here. Unions come to aid of undocumented workers Some US unions are stepping in to protect their undocumented members, creating a new battlefront between the Republican party and organized labor, Mike Elk reported for the Guardian this week. The leadership of North America’s Building Trades Unions has traditionally been one of the whitest sectors of the labor movement. Civil rights groups have repeatedly sued construction unions to admit African Americans, and for decades, unions like the Carpenters would call immigration authorities to deport undocumented workers. However, over the last two decades as construction unions sought to organize larger numbers of undocumented workers, the attitude of labor has changed. Now, in the era of Trump, many labor leaders see an opportunity to accelerate those changes. “Has the Trump era accelerated our efforts? Absolutely,” said the Painters Union president, Ken Rigmaiden. “There are too many reasons to mention but one, in particular, is forcing 11 million immigrants back into the dark side of the construction economy, where wage theft and intimidation thrive.” What we’re reading • While hailing the success of the anti-gun movement that has led to Saturday’s March for Our Lives, some activists are urging that that momentum should also be used to tackle gun violence in poor and minority communities, the Guardian reported this week. Community organizers from around the US met in Atlanta, Georgia on Thursday to discuss how the current enthusiasm can be channelled into stopping gun violence in inner cities. • After months of rumors, Sex and the City actor Cynthia Nixon entered the race for New York governor this week. Nixon will be taking on the incumbent Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, and early indications are she is planning to run to the left of the centrist Cuomo. But can she win? According to CNN analyst and polling expert Harry Enten: “The answer is yes.” (Although it currently seems unlikely.)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/24/gkn-unprotected-melrose-hostile-takeover-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T16:00:06Z","webTitle":"Unprotected GKN left to brave the cold corporate winds alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/24/gkn-unprotected-melrose-hostile-takeover-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/24/gkn-unprotected-melrose-hostile-takeover-alone","fields":{"headline":"Unprotected GKN left to brave the cold corporate winds alone","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is a company that dates back to Britain’s industrial revolution: an ironworks in south Wales that started in 1759 and supplied the tracks for Brunel’s Great Western Railway. It has become, as GKN, a global engineering giant supplying car and aerospace parts, employing 60,000 around the world and 6,000 in the UK. But now corporate raiders loom in the form of a controversial £7.8bn hostile bid – in which Theresa May’s government has been sidelined, despite its aspiration to develop a new UK industrial strategy. Bidder Melrose has set a deadline of 1pm on Thursday for GKN shareholders to accept or reject its largely paper-based bid. Insiders describe the situation as finely balanced. Melrose, which is about the fifth of the size, says GKN has lost its way, repeatedly missing profit targets; it says its approach of buying underperforming businesses, restructuring them and selling them on in three to five years will generate far more value. As of Friday, just under 10% of GKN shareholders were backing the Melrose bid, broadly in line with the 9% support for the GKN board. GKN, which earned £658m last year on sales of £9.7bn, says that Melrose has not offered enough with a bid worth approximately 457p against a GKN share price of 428p. GKN proposes its own restructuring, merging its West Midlands car parts business with US group Dana. GKN warns that jobs around the UK will be at risk, from its headquarters in Redditch through to its aerospace components operations in and around Bristol. Meanwhile, a string of politicians, from both the Conservative and Labour parties, as well as trade union Unite, accuse Melrose of operating a short-term model that will damage Britain’s industrial base. They would like Greg Clark, the business secretary, to intervene. But few observers believe he has the legal power to do so. Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said: “Our takeover law is simply inadequate when it comes to protecting British businesses. What happens in this country would not be allowed to happen in France, Holland or Germany.” Melrose critics say the company has a poor record as a long-term owner of businesses, when it has been unable to sell them on. They point to Brush, a supplier of generators to the oil and gas industry based in Loughborough, which Melrose has owned since 2008. Last month Melrose said 270 UK jobs were at risk at a firm that employs 790 in the country. It said that Brush was the victim of an industry-wide downturn, but GKN supporters argue that a long-term investment strategy might have seen Brush invest in an attempt to diversify into the more promising area of renewables. “Last year GKN spent £262m on R&amp;D; Melrose spent £223m over five years,” said one source close to the company. Meanwhile Airbus, GKN’s most important customer, has warned that it expects whoever wins the takeover battle to continue to invest in R&amp;D. Earlier this month, it warned against a short-term ownership approach. Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus’s commercial aircraft division, said: “It would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such an ownership model when we don’t know who will be the long-term investor.” Professor Chris Carr from Edinburgh University, who once worked at GKN, said: “If you look at this company, these industries operate on 50-year perspectives.” Melrose is run by a group of executives, led by executive chairman Christopher Miller, who are among the best-paid public company bosses in the UK. Last year Miller and three other top executives shared in a bonus payout of £160m worth of shares, after a five-year incentive plan paid out. A previous plan matured in 2012, paying £126m in shares, largely to the same top executives. Earlier this month Simon Peckham, Melrose’s chief executive, defended the pay of the company’s bosses in front of MPs on the business committee: “I appreciate that this is a difficult subject, but let me put the other side of the equation, which is that, other than to pay those tax levies we have just talked about, in the 15 years I have worked for Melrose, I have never sold a single share in it.” A Unite official, Steve Turner, also giving evidence, said Melrose bosses had “trousered over £400m” in the past decade, during which time GKN has invested £500m in UK manufacturing. Competition regulators can block or impose conditions on a merger, but Melrose has no meaningful overlap with GKN. Clark can only intervene in a takeover – and so force it to be considered by the Competition and Markets Authority – on grounds of national security, media plurality or financial stability. GKN has a modest defence parts business and its work is not critical to defending the nation. However, this has not stopped Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, from writing to Clark to raise concern because GKN supplies parts for F-35 fighters, A400M military transport planes and the Ajax armoured vehicles used by British armed forces. He is not the only Conservative to be concerned, demonstrating that the desire for a more assertive industrial policy has gone across the party divide. Rachel Maclean, Tory MP for Redditch, where GKN is headquartered, worries that 260 staff at the head office will lose their jobs if the takeover goes through, and while she would like Clark to intervene, she acknowledges that, under current law, “he only has a narrow remit”. Citing Airbus, she said that “there are so many things pointing to a takeover not being a good idea” and hoped that “shareholders would think very carefully about the implications of their decision on the economy as a whole”. The MP acknowledges that sentiment in her party is shifting, because “as the economy becomes ever more globalised, policy and thinking has to evolve”. In November May unveiled an industrial strategy white paper that she said would create “the conditions in which successful business can emerge” and “identify the industries that are of strategic value”. Its approach, however, was focused on investment and tax breaks in a range of key areas, including automotive, rather than takeover protection. Earlier this month Unilever decided to shift its HQ from London to Rotterdam, where Dutch law offers greater protections against takeovers. Unite highlights alternative options which would help protect companies like it and GKN. One is to give long-term investors extra voting rights to protect from short-term takeovers. Carr warns: “You do wonder what industrial companies we will be left with in a global world, post-Brexit.” Troublesome takeovers Proposed takeovers of British industrial firms rarely pass without comment and a number of deals in recent years have faced concerted opposition. Here are some of the most contentious transactions. Kraft and Cadbury, 2010 Kraft, the US food giant, was ultimately successful in its £12bn pursuit of Cadbury, one of the most venerable names in British industry. But the process was marked by stiff political and trade union opposition. The then business secretary, Lord Mandelson, warned Kraft against attempting to make a “fast buck” out of the Creme Egg maker, while unions warned that up to 30,000 jobs could be at risk. Kraft prevailed but immediately damaged its reputation by closing a Cadbury factory in Keynsham, near Bristol, despite indicating previously that it might keep the site open. Not only did 400 workers lose their jobs, but the example of Keynsham is still used by unions to warn about takeovers of British industrial firms. BAE Systems and EADS, 2012 The proposed €35bn (£31bn) merger of Britain’s biggest defence manufacturer and the Franco-German owner of Airbus foundered in the face of political, union and media opposition. The British, German and French governments could not reach agreement on the corporate structure of the business, which would have combined two of the most politically sensitive companies in Europe. Angela Merkel, in particular, harboured the deepest concerns about the deal, for which she saw no strategic logic. Chastened by the experience, neither business has pursued a transformative deal since. Pfizer and AstraZeneca, 2014 When US drugs giant Pfizer attempted to buy the Anglo-Swedish drugs maker for £69bn, it was attacked on both sides of the Atlantic for admitting that tax savings were a key factor in its bid. David Cameron, then the PM, said he was neutral about the bid, but MPs and trade unions raised concerns over the offer, suspecting that Pfizer would strip out R&amp;D jobs. However, AstraZeneca was also adamant that Pfizer’s approach – at £55 a share – undervalued the company and Pfizer walked away. AstraZeneca is trading at around £48 currently. Kraft Heinz and Unilever, 2017 Heinz’s £115bn approach for Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group behind Marmite and Magnum ice-cream, fell apart rapidly in the wake of strong opposition from the bid target. Kraft Heinz, the US maker of Philadelphia cream cheese, abandoned its interest after Unilever, which employs 7,000 people in the UK, made clear it had no interest in a deal. Political and trade union disquiet over the proposed transaction had barely started to be heard. But Unilever’s determination to protect itself more adequately against further overtures led to it choosing Rotterdam over London as its main HQ this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/24/austin-bombings-mark-conditt-texas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"Austin bombings: how they unfolded, and what they revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/austin-bombings-mark-conditt-texas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/24/austin-bombings-mark-conditt-texas","fields":{"headline":"Austin bombings: how they unfolded, and what they revealed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just before 7am on a slightly chilly morning, Anthony Stephan House walked on to the front porch of his home in north-east Austin and picked up a package. It exploded, killing the 39-year-old, who was getting ready to take his eight-year-old daughter to school. Police quickly developed theories. Perhaps the intended target was a nearby drug dealer and the attacker got the wrong address. Maybe House was blown up by a device he made himself. “Based on what we know right now, we have no reason to believe this is anything beyond an isolated incident that took place at this residence and in no way this is linked to a terroristic attack,” Brian Manley, the interim police chief in the Texan capital city, told reporters on 2 March, the day of House’s death. This proved horribly wrong. Over 19 days, five more bombs would detonate and another device was made safe. Austin would soon discover it was in the grip of a serial bomber whose actions were as frightening as they were mystifying. The apparently random terror campaign drew comparisons with one of the most notorious American criminals of the last century, the Unabomber. Ted Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 over a period of 17 years, though. Mark Conditt, an unemployed 23-year-old from a Christian family in the quiet, conservative suburb of Pflugerville, worked on a more accelerated timeline. The second package bomb blew up in the kitchen of an east Austin home on 12 March, killing Draylen Mason, 17, a popular student and gifted musician. His mother was seriously hurt. Later that morning, in another residential neighbourhood a couple of miles away, a 75-year-old visiting her mother’s home, Esperanza Herrera, was critically injured when she picked up a package that exploded. An everyday activity in the internet shopping era, especially – collecting a cardboard box left on a doorstep – was now cause for anxiety. The timing was striking: residents in mundane suburbs targeted as, in the shadow of downtown’s glassy, sky-scraping new apartment blocks and offices, thousands of visitors descended on the city for the annual South by Southwest festival, a symbol of Austin’s swift evolution from a quiet university town into an internationally renowned destination for young, tech-minded liberals. The danger amplified long-standing inequities. Amid community anger, police apologized for implying that House might have killed himself. Austin has a reputation as America’s most politically progressive big city away from the east and west coasts, a quirky cultural oasis deep in the heart of Republican Texas. But, perhaps less obvious to outsiders, it has never escaped the familiar scourges of entrenched racism and police brutality scandals. Two days after the first bomb, Traffic Stop, an HBO documentary about the violent 2015 arrest of a black Austin school teacher, was in contention for an Oscar at the Academy Awards. The locations and identities of the bomb victims raised the possibility of a racial motive. The two who died were African American, while Herrera is Hispanic. “We lost two very prominent and talented people in our community,” Nelson Linder, the president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), told the Guardian. All three explosions were east of Interstate 35, the north-south freeway that slices through downtown and has long acted as a de facto segregation line between wealthy, mainly white west Austin and the less prosperous, though now gentrifying, largely black and Hispanic east side; a legacy of structural racism designed by city leaders in the 1920s. The authorities declined to define the attacks as terrorism, attracting criticism from those who detected a double standard based on the likely skin color of the perpetrator. Donald Trump, in the past quick to seize on potentially Islamic State-inspired attacks to advance his immigration agenda, merely said the suspect was “very sick”. The next bomb deepened the mystery. On the evening of 18 March, two twentysomething white men, walking through an affluent, mainly white part of south-west Austin, were badly injured. Not by a package, but from a bomb set off in the dark by a tripwire in the street. Different area, different races, different type of device. “Whatever his motive is, he’s certainly put fear into the city of Austin,” local resident Lynn Hanson said the next day, out for a walk along a leafy route in Travis Country on a splendidly sunny afternoon. Steps from where she stood the road was blocked by a police barricade and federal agents in head-to-toe white forensics suits gathered evidence. “It’s certainly a sad state of affairs that you don’t even feel like you can walk down your own street without worrying,” Hanson said. “It’s much more devastating than using a gun, to me, it just seems like the next level up. You kind of get used to weapons.” The authorities appeared baffled, but then another tactical shift prompted mistakes that gave vital clues. At about 12:30am on 20 March a package bomb went off on a conveyor belt at a FedEx warehouse. Then an unexploded package was found at another FedEx facility. CCTV footage showed they had been dropped off at a store in Austin by a man wearing pink gloves, a baseball cap and a blond wig. The suspect had parked within view of a surveillance camera, a Texas politician told CNN, allowing police to read his license plate and then to pinpoint the location of his cellphone. The general public knew no details of his being tracked, although Conditt may have suspected the authorities were closing in. Then, in the early hours of 21 March, a Swat team hunted Conditt down in his car outside a hotel in the Austin suburb of Round Rock. As an officer fired a shot, the suspect deployed his last bomb inside the vehicle, and claimed the final casualty in his short but horrific reign of terror: himself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/04/shakespeares-originality-john-kerrigan-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T06:30:17Z","webTitle":"Shakespeare’s Originality by John Kerrigan review – what the Bard pilfered and changed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/04/shakespeares-originality-john-kerrigan-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/04/shakespeares-originality-john-kerrigan-review","fields":{"headline":"Shakespeare’s Originality by John Kerrigan review – what the Bard pilfered and changed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For a long time, the sedulous student who wants to see Shakespeare in the act of creation has been able to go to the extracts contained in the eight fat volumes of Geoffrey Bullough’s Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare. Here you can find the stories that he pilfered and changed. You can see how he twisted two completely separate tales together to make The Merchant of Venice, for example, or decided to kill Lear and Cordelia at the end of King Lear when in his chronicle source both survived, or made Othello Desdemona’s murderer, when in Cinthio’s original Italian story, it is Iago who does the deed. The volumes give a dizzying sense of the playwright’s narrative dexterity as you see him extracting and welding together the elements from others’ narratives. Read John Kerrigan’s intense, condensed account of the playwright’s creative borrowing and the dizziness only increases. Focusing on a handful of plays, Kerrigan, one of the world’s leading Shakespeare scholars, shows that Bullough has recorded only the more obvious half of it. Kerrigan takes us beyond Shakespeare’s primary sources into the deeper texture of his allusions and passages of imitation. His originality, by this account, was largely a gift for the alchemical transformation of what he had read, heard recited, or remembered from his days on a hard bench at Stratford grammar school. Kerrigan’s introduction ruminates about the meanings of originality, a concept unknown to critics before the later 18th century. Shakespeare inhabited a literary culture in which imitation of earlier models was applauded. Rhetoric (the Renaissance version of creative writing) approved of “invention”, but specified that this meant the clever combination of inherited elements. Yet Shakespeare is also different from his contemporaries: he is not showing off his literary knowledge but adapting narrative patterns and fragments of dialogue lodged in his memory. Kerrigan quotes Emerson observing that “All minds quote”; yet most of Shakespeare’s quotations – or inventive misquotations – would not have been spotted by his first audiences. A chapter devoted to Much Ado About Nothing reveals a play that is “pieced and patched and recycled” out of various Italian tales, its radical novelty a matter of the “piecemeal superflux” of reused materials. You will have to read slowly – and maybe Google – to understand the variety of materials (Ariosto, Matteo Bandello, Luigi Pasqualigo) that go into this nearly tragic comedy. The reward is a vivid sense of how original it was to borrow. Traditional assurances that Shakespeare knew next to nothing of Greek tragedy are upended in an analysis of King Lear and its relationship to Sophocles’s two Oedipus plays. Shakespeare had access to these via widely available Greek/Latin parallel texts (we should take with a pinch of salt Ben Jonson’s aspersions about his “small Latin and less Greek”). In particular, he found his way back to Greek tragedy via Seneca’s Latin versions of Greek originals. The scene on Dover Cliff, where the blind Gloucester thinks he has been led by Edgar, the son he does not recognise, has its “original” in Seneca’s Phoenissae, where Antigone leads Oedipus in search of a convenient precipice. “Layers of imitation resonate back to antiquity.” In his final chapter, Kerrigan tackles one of the few Shakespeare plays supposed to have no specific source, The Tempest. He finds here not only echoes of contemporary writing about the colonisation of Virginia and Bermuda, but also the reuse of sentiments culled from Virgil’s celebration of the powers of agriculture, his Georgics. Where Shakespeare is supposed most natural he is in fact most literary. The book is unrepentantly erudite, but the erudition is as diverting as it can be daunting. There are digressions into men’s hairstyles in Renaissance England (essential to some of the jokes in Much Ado), contemporary agricultural experiments (ditto The Tempest), or manners of walking on the stage (where actors strutted or “jetted” or jigged or “tripped” or – like Richard III – balefully limped). The chapter on Much Ado, a play in which a servant almost triggers a tragedy by dressing up as her mistress, traces its reliance on contemporary publications about fashionable dress. Elizabethan England still had sumptuary laws, placing stern limits on the wearing of luxurious apparel. “Actors were an affront to these rules,” elaborate costuming being one of drama’s essential resources. How exciting it was to see someone flagrantly dressed in the wrong clothes! The four main chapters began as lectures, and Kerrigan clearly expected his listeners to concentrate hard. He is confident he can use words such as “sticomythic” and “haruspication” without further explanation, that Euripides and Virgil are our familiars, and that the plot details of Shakespeare’s plays are hardwired in our heads. The text bristles with endnote numbers, taking the reader – if he or she wishes – to a compendium of Shakespearean lore at the back of the book. But the trust in our literary curiosity is intoxicating. Who wants Shakespeare to be made easy when he was so beautifully and originally complex? • Shakespeare’s Originality is published by Oxford.

The remarks by Vladimir Uglev, a Soviet chemical weapons scientist, contradict official Russian denials that the country had any chemical weapons programme tied to the name novichok, with the formal codename foliant. “If you’re asking who made the substances that poisoned the Skripals, his name and his country, it’s possible it was made by my hands,” Uglev wrote to the Guardian. “But we’re unlikely to find out about that, at least according to the information I have at the moment.” Uglev is one of three Russian scientists to confirm the existence of the top secret chemical weapons programme since the Salisbury attack. His remarks were sent to a handful of journalists on Friday, and he answered follow up questions for the Guardian. Uglev on Friday said he had been questioned by police immediately after the grisly 1995 murders of banker Ivan Kivelidi and his secretary in an apparent poisoning, and recognised a nerve agent synthesised by his own working group at a closed state laboratory near the Volga river. “Immediately after Kivelidi’s telephone was analysed, the investigator in my case asked me a number of questions as the substance was synthesised in our group,” Uglev wrote to journalists. He first went public on Wednesday. Court documents first reported by Reuters and later published by the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said that a member of Uglev’s lab, Leonid Rink, had been jailed briefly after admitting to selling a small amount of a deadly nerve agent developed under Russia’s so-called foliant programme. That programme has become famous in the west in recent days as novichok, identified by British authorities as the Soviet-era nerve agent used in Salisbury earlier this month. The likely sale of the nerve agent to a criminal group in the 1990s will raise questions about Theresa May’s assurances that only a state could have ordered the attack on Skripal. But nerve agents typically deteriorate quickly. And a binary, which increases shelf life by storing the future nerve agent in two stable precursors, was never achieved at his laboratory, Uglev said. Nevertheless, he speculated it could remain potent for some time. “If properly stored, I imagine it could poison someone even 50 years later,” he wrote. Uglev worked in the State Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology in the city of Shikhany, Saratov region, from 1972 until 1993. He said he handled foliant nerve agents for the last time in 1990. They were not on the list of chemical weapons submitted by Russia as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention signed in 1993. In follow-up remarks to the Guardian, Uglev said he knew of three people who had died as a result of accidents while developing novichok: a scientist named Andrei Zheleznyakov and “two officers who held tests on our testing range”. Asked by the Guardian about what the chances are that British investigators might be able to tie the novichok to a specific country or lab, he said “probably close to zero”. “They have the footprint of the substance in Salisbury … but no data about the substance (its fingerprint) in the database, so how can they say where it is from,” he wrote. That could change, he added, if they are able to gather earlier samples from Soviet and Russian labs. Russian police, he noted, were able to identify him quickly after the death of Kivelidi, the businessman, in 1995. The poisons he helped develop in the 1970s and 1980s were especially lethal, he added. “If any of these four substances” were used to poison the Skripals, he wrote, referring to several chemicals he helped developed, then “their chances are nil”. “But medicine doesn’t stay in one place, and perhaps in the last 30 years, during which I’ve been out of the system, something has changed for the better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/25/bevin-boys-art-wartime-britain-mining-museum-exhibition-","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Deep, dark art of the Bevin Boys who powered wartime Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/25/bevin-boys-art-wartime-britain-mining-museum-exhibition-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/25/bevin-boys-art-wartime-britain-mining-museum-exhibition-","fields":{"headline":"Deep, dark art of the Bevin Boys who powered wartime Britain","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The soot-black testimony of a forgotten band of brothers – the so-called Bevin Boys, who served in Britain’s coalmines during and after the second world war – is to go on display in Bishop Auckland on 28 March in a stark illustration of the vital national work they carried out. Powerful artwork created by four former Bevin Boys will form the core of War’s Forgotten Workforce, an exhibition at Britain’s new Mining Art Gallery, which hopes to remind visitors of the conscripted miners’ wartime efforts. It is also timed to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the controversial government scheme that put them down the mines. The striking art of Ted Holloway, Tom McGuinness, David McClure and John Tipton was created in response to their life-changing experiences in the mining industry. Each artist drew or painted an underground world unlike anything they had seen before and which, for many of their fellow conscripts, was second choice to a place on the frontline. In 1943, four years into the second world war, the British government had to face up to the damaging loss of 36,000 miners who had been drafted into the armed forces. Coal supplies had dwindled and it was estimated they might not last beyond three weeks. Yet the public had failed to respond to a call from Ernest Bevin, the minister for labour, for volunteers to sign up at the coalface. So compulsory conscription began. Each month Bevin’s secretary drew a series of numbers from his homburg hat. If they matched the last digit of a man’s national service number, he was destined for the mines. By 1948, 48,000 young men had been sent to serve in British coalmines. They worked alongside “optants” who had volunteered for work in the pit, and 41 conscientious objectors, but mining was not generally a popular choice. Four out of every 10 men appealed against their fate, with some going to prison in protest. Holloway, from rural Hampshire, was sent 300 miles north to live in a prefabricated hut in Annfield Plain, County Durham, after his number was picked from Bevin’s hat. His sketches were made between 1983 and 1987 and they record his awe at the strength of his fellow miners. McGuinness was also sent for training in Annfield Plain and was then assigned to Fishburn Colliery, where he took up formal art tuition, eventually enrolling in art classes at Darlington School of Art and joining a sketching club at the Spennymoor Settlement arts community. His etchings and oil paintings feature hunched, distorted figures. Drawing alongside McGuinness at Darlington School of Art was his fellow miner Tipton, who went on to work as a graphic artist at the Observer. Based at Dean and Chapter Colliery in Ferryhill, he trained new Bevin Boys and spent his spare time sketching and painting the surrounding countryside, as well as landmarks such as Durham Cathedral. The fourth artist on show, Glasgow University student McClure, was forced to swap his mortar board for a standard issue pressed cardboard pit helmet in 1944. Training at Townhill Colliery in Dunfermline, Scotland, he quickly learned that getting the right quota of coal was the top priority. He also once had to spend a shift alone in the dark, pumping water from the pit. The selection of his pen-and-wash drawings on show follow on from earlier works he submitted in his application portfolio to Edinburgh College of Art, where he went on to study. Bevin Boys were not demobilised until 1948 due to the continuing coal shortage. Their work was largely unrecognised until a national campaign finally made their case in 2008.

Further draconian policies follow: laws against the disposal of fertilised embryos and the Every Child Needs Two act, which forbids adoption by single parents. These are intended to imprison women in outgrown roles, but they are hardly impossible to imagine in the America of 2018. The new laws affect the four women who narrate Red Clocks in different ways, but all of them feel the pinch. Risky, to try to out-Atwood Atwood, but the book on which this models itself is The Robber Bride. Like that novel, Red Clocks is far more driven by characterisation, and its exploration of the bonds between women, than by its plot, which comes down to relatively predictable binary choices. Roberta is a single woman trying to conceive, and many clocks are ticking against her; Mattie, her teenage student, has an unwanted baby in her womb; Gin, an unabashed witch, finds herself on trial for a crime she did not commit; and Susan, a former lawyer, feels trapped in her marriage and lost in motherhood. They are weird, passionate, unforgettable characters. In a place that is neither mind nor heart, or both at once, she wants an ashy line down the center of a round belly; she wants nausea [...] spider veins at the knee backs, loose stomach skin, lowered breasts. Affronts to vanity worn as badges of the ultimate accomplishment. [...] does the desire come from some creaturely place, pre-civilised, some biological throb that floods her bloodways with the message Make more of yourself! To repeat, not to improve. The dialogue is so quick and multilayered as to take one’s breath away. The rank uselessness of the men who appear in this novel crystallises in their words, in the way they contradict their words with their actions. The powerlessness and fury of women find an outlet in their spoken protests, their pleas to be heard by idiotic doctors, husbands who cannot see their marriages unravelling. Zumas elucidates, in virtuosic prose, the struggle to be valued running like a power line under every incarnation of feminism. Her talent is electric. Get ready for a shock.

What impresses me as I observe the unfolding Trumptacular is the opposite: how familiar it sometimes is. By a coincidence that of course isn’t a coincidence at all, the Trump administration now features as the chair of its Council of Economic Advisers one Kevin Hassett, an economist who in 1999 co-authored an infamous declaration that the Dow Jones Industrial Average deserved to be at 36,000. To direct his National Economic Council, meanwhile, Trump has nominated Larry Kudlow, who also proposed a wildly optimistic take on stock prices back then, in his case a prediction that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would go to 50,000 by 2020. One coincidence more: the two future Trump appointees made their hallucinatory calls back to back, in the pages of the Wall Street Journal on 16 and 17 March 1999. I still keep yellowing copies of their op-eds in a file in my office; that’s how astounding they seemed to me at the time. Then again, that sort of thing was in the air in those days. The Dow was approaching the awesome figure of 10,000, and business sections everywhere were aflame with a kind of free-market Pentecost, a capitalist rapture. Every bubble seems to bring the same euphoric visions: prosperity onward and upward, forever and ever, amen. Unfortunately, about a year after the two men’s predictions appeared, the dotcom bubble burst and the dreams of a stock market soaring from gravity’s grip burst with them. Kudlow, the more interesting of Trump’s Dow dreamers, didn’t seem to be chastened by this experience; he went on to a career as a TV business commentator, delivering an amazing series of bum steers as the years rolled by. And now, as if in recognition of his dreadful lifetime achievements, he is to be appointed director of the National Economic Council. He has failed about as far as one can fail. What could our success-worshiping president possibly see in such a man? Does Trump actively want to get bad advice? Is Kudlow’s flattery worth that much? Maybe, but I think there’s more to it than that. Business itself may be a matter of hard numbers, but business commentary is often a thing of soaring ideological fancy. And the ideology in Kudlow’s case is a powerful form of populism. By cheering for the stock market, one cheered for the common man: this is what Kudlow seemed to believe in the days when I followed him. Markets were arenas of primal Jeffersonian democracy, and the stories the business pages told were really tales of a vast, ongoing confrontation in which the common people – “the shareholders, farmers, seniors, homeowners, website operators, venture capitalists, small-business men and others,” as Kudlow once described them – squared off against the arrogant and destructive tribe Kudlow loved to revile as the “economic establishment”. Who was this establishment? They were university professors, Kudlow wrote, intellectuals “who had wrapped themselves in the comfortable and smug self-knowledge that economics could only be managed by distinguished university dons; free-markets and the unfettered actions of ordinary people in commerce, trade and finance was a dangerous thing, something that must be tightly controlled …” As a description of the discipline of economics this was ridiculous. As part of the age-old campaign to make big business seem like your beloved pal – to make the big shots on Wall Street appear to be men of the people – it was kind of ingenious. The idea was that markets speak with the people’s voice; that those who would regulate, tax, supervise, break up monopolies or organize unions are snobs, university big-shots who longed to keep “ordinary people” in their place. Fantasizing about the vicimization of venture capitalists isn’t what got Donald Trump elected in 2016. But by appointing Kudlow, the president seems to be betting that the substance of the populist narrative doesn’t matter as much as does the superficial rhetoric of the thing. And so, before our eyes, the bitter blue-collar gripes of the Steve Bannon era are being exchanged for the sunny supply-side credo of Larry Kudlow. One form of populism growls darkly about “American carnage”, the other burbles about the day big business is liberated from arrogant regulators, but both pretend to despise elites, and maybe that’s all that matters. The real danger in elevating Kudlow to a position of such great public authority, I think, is not that he will continue to misapprehend the world (though of course he will), but that he will be in a position to put his destructive ideology into effect. When Kudlow predicted that the Dow would hit 50,000, for example, he wrote that it would happen by the year 2020 – a time when he himself may well be directing the National Economic Council. How might Kudlow contrive to make his prediction come true? His own writings from the bubble days suggest the answer: more tax cuts, of course; plenty of deregulation; and maybe even what Kudlow once coyly called “individual ownership of social security contributions”. So the old shell game plays out once more. In 2016 millions of average Americans enthusiastically signed up for a war on elites; with boisterous hurrahs they climbed aboard the Trump train; and after a few years’ journey they are going to find themselves deposited right back where they started, with inequality growing, more monopolies springing up, and Wall Street ideologues running everything. In the meantime, the Don and Larry show is just getting started. Replace the “failed and corrupt establishment”, shouts Don. Yes, “overthrow the establishment,” agrees Larry. How the elites must tremble at the prospect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/03/astrid-lindgren-woman-behind-pippi-longstocking-jens-andersen-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Astrid Lindgren: The Woman Behind Pippi Longstocking by Jens Andersen – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/03/astrid-lindgren-woman-behind-pippi-longstocking-jens-andersen-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/03/astrid-lindgren-woman-behind-pippi-longstocking-jens-andersen-review","fields":{"headline":"Astrid Lindgren: The Woman Behind Pippi Longstocking by Jens Andersen – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Once upon a time, in the middle decades of the war-torn 20th century, there lived an Australian-born British theosophist and mystic, a respectable English woman hiding behind a man’s name, a gay and depressive Finnish Swede who lived half her life on a tiny island, and the firebrand daughter of a respectable Swedish farmer. These four women radically changed the landscape of children’s literature, making it wilder, stranger, more anarchic, and, crucially, more centred in the dreamy and unfettered imagination of the child. PL Travers created Mary Poppins, whose sour magic Disney tried to tame. Richmal Crompton unleashed irrepressible Just William on to an unsuspecting conformist society. Tove Jansson beautifully gave us the mysterious outsider’s world of the Moomins. And from Astrid Lindgren bounded fabulous Pippi Longstocking, the strongest girl in the world with her carrot-coloured pigtails and her freckles, her pet monkey, her mismatched stockings, her good-humoured disregard of authority, her spirit of misrule and joy. Her roots were in the war (the first book, Pippi Longstocking, was published in 1945) and a decade of fear, but Pippi was a cheerfully outspoken, brave-hearted pacifist who protected the weak and stood her ground against bullies. Her soil was a country of deep conformity and regulation, but she had a glorious disregard for dull bureaucracy and decorum. Hers was a world turned upside down: she slept with her feet on her pillows, blew her nose on her clothes, danced on the church pews, mocked the stiff and dreary grownup ways of being. She (literally) played with fire and she exploded into the world like a glorious catherine wheel. Some adults were shocked at her transgressive impudence, calling her depraved, dangerous, mentally ill, psychotic. But children loved her because she was theirs, on their side, an adult-free zone and a path to freedom. And all over the world, generation after generation, they still love her. Lindgren was born in 1907; she died in 2002, aged 94. She lived the 20th century – and what a life it was, what a journey she made from a farmer’s daughter in rural south Sweden to single mother, internationally bestselling author, political activist, environmentalist, feminist, astute businesswoman, humanist, global brand, member of the establishment and fighter against it, whose funeral (on International Women’s Day) was attended by the Swedish royal family, the country’s prime minister and thousands of Swedes who lined the streets to say goodbye. As a girl, she worked every day on the farm. She was a clever student who loved books and jazz and dancing, nature and adventure. She fizzed with energy – one friend talks of “sparks coming off her”. In defiance of the times, she wore slacks and jackets and her blond hair was cut à la garçonne (a photo of her at 16 shows her and her friends cross-dressing, scandalising the small town she came from). She left school early to work for a local newspaper. By 17, she was pregnant by the paper’s 50-year-old, married proprietor. By 18, she was a single mother working as a stenographer in Stockholm, though her son, Lars, lived with a foster family in Copenhagen for three years before his mother could reclaim him. These hard years in Stockholm (her “promenade through hell”) are in many ways the heart of Jens Andersen’s fine and thoughtful biography, and the source of Lindgren’s writing life. Lindgren’s exile from her childhood home, her grim struggle with Lars’s coercive father, her determination to remain independent of him, the secret birth, her head-over-heels love for her little son, her long and anguished separation from him (though she went to visit as often as she could scrape together the money), her enduring guilt at not being with him and then her guilt at plucking him from the only family he had ever known – all these things find their way into her writing. As Andersen comments, her stories are full of parentless children, of abandoned boys and girls. Under the exuberance lies a darker story of loneliness and loss. In 1931, she married her employer, Sture Lindgren, and was able to bring Lars home at last; three years later, she had a daughter, Karin. Now they were a neat, nuclear, prosperous Swedish family. During the war, she worked as a mail inspector for Swedish Intelligence (a self-titled “dirty” job) and at night her stories of Pippi’s exploits were told to her children. In 1945 she found a publisher. Her editor, Elsa Olenius, just happened to be a judge in the prestigious literary prize that her new author went on to win. (Lindgren had many strong female friendships and Andersen’s book is full of powerful, independent women.) Lindgren rocketed to fame and to fortune. She sold in Sweden, then Denmark, then all over the world. She got a part-time job as an editor (later, she was actually her own editor). She wrote dozens of books. She wrote TV scripts. She wrote diaries. She wrote thousands of long and attentive letters to readers. She took part in TV and radio shows, quick-witted and unafraid. She travelled all over the world, giving talks, signing books, accepting prizes. She was elected to De Nio (the Nine), a prestigious literary academy promoting literature, peace and women’s rights. She campaigned (very effectively) in multiple causes: against seal hunting, against a sclerotic tax system that meant one year her income tax bill was 102%, against house shortages, library closures, racism, child pornography… She earned a lot of money and then gave a lot away. She had a finger in every pie. She survived (but never recovered from) the death of Lars in 1986, the death of her husband, the death of her siblings, her friends, of her first generation of readers. But new readers came and still they come. Although Lindgren was a media-savvy and shrewd businesswoman, organised, dynamic and phenomenally energetic, part of her was always Pippi: the rule-flouter, the freedom lover, steadfastly opposed to all demagoguery and hypocrisy, who at 70 was still climbing trees and who refused, in the face of her fear, to be afraid, and insisted, in the face of her depression, on joy. And Pippi was a loner, someone who had learned to rely only on herself, and to stand on her own ground. The last sight the reader has of her in the final Pippi Longstocking story, she is sitting alone, pensive, before leaning forward to blow out the candle and disappear into the darkness. • Astrid Lindgren: The Woman Behind Pippi Longstocking by Jens Andersen is published by Yale University Press (£25).

After it was intercepted off the Greek coast in 2014 it was claimed that more than two tonnes of heroin and 18 tonnes of illegal fuel had been smuggled on it. There has long been speculation linking Evangelos Marinakis – one of Greece’s most powerful men, and owner of Olympiakos and Nottingham Forest – to that ship and on Friday the Greek public prosecutor, having conducted a preliminary investigation into allegations of drug trafficking made against him, has referred those allegations to an investigating judge. The accusations – which Marinakis strongly rejects – are the latest development in a remarkable season, signifying a wider struggle in Greek football and beyond. In 2015, he was acquitted of complicity in a match-fixing network across seven countries. The magnate, who bought Forest in a £50m takeover, attributed those charges to jealous critics bent on blighting his Greek team’s winning streak. “Of course I cannot stop our opponents talking or bad‑mouthing,” he said. Marinakis has a Pavarotti-like heft to match his growing power in football, business and politics. But now he is at odds with the government and rivals scent blood. The 50-year-old shipping magnate and media tycoon was born in Piraeus, a largely working‑class city, known for its vast port and being home to Olympiakos, Greece’s most successful, best‑supported club. Fabulously wealthy ship owners do not tend to be popular in crisis-hit Greece and few people had heard of Marinakis before buying the club in 2010. He is now one of Greece’s best-known figures. Thanos Sarris, editor-in-chief of sports website Gazzetta says the big four – AEK Athens, Olympiakos, Panathinaikos, and Paok Thessaloniki – usually come with an army of support for successful owners, who can harness their fanaticism to support causes beyond the sport . “Here, most of the time, it is not about football but other things: about politics, about the backstage,” he adds. Olympiakos have won the Greek Super League every season under Marinakis’s ownership. In 2014, several figures linked to the club leveraged their popularity to take control of Piraeus municipality. Marinakis became a councillor and sidekick Yiannis Moralis, Olympiakos’s vice‑president, became mayor under the independent ticket “Piraeus, Winner”. “The great reversal starts from this port,” bellowed Marinakis during campaign rallies full of football rhetoric and Olympiakos flags. This is what Tasos Alevras, who made the documentary What Politica about Olympiakos, refers to as the “footballisation of politics”. Football and politics were always linked in Greece, says Alevras, but it was subtler: “Nowadays it’s very obvious, there is no separation.” Christos Charalampopoulos, a football journalist and academic, says it is likely Marinakis’s main aim is to boost his business interests and wield influence over politics: “He does not want to be a politician – he wants to be the one who says who is going to be the next leader.” Two decades of success have endowed Olympiakos with a large Champions League dividend, while most Greek clubs are mired in financial strife. But allegations of widespread corruption and match-fixing are rife and in the past two decades there has been a common belief among rival fans that Olympiakos were favoured by authorities – from the stadium secured from the 2004 Olympic bid to the perception that the football federation was long under its sway. Marinakis was named as a key suspect in the 2011 Koriopolis scandal, which implicated him in masterminding disciplinary penalties, refereeing decisions, and results. Marinakis vehemently denies all charges, but the scandal has dogged him since. In June 2015, he was banned from all football activity after being investigated for match-fixing, fraud, extortion, running a criminal organisation and involvement in blowing up a bakery owned by a referee. But by early 2017 all the charges had been dropped and he had been acquitted of match fixing. In May, Marinakis passed the Football League’s fit and proper persons test and completed his Forest takeover. The owners of Greece’s other big three clubs are not only rivals in football, but men with huge portfolios that include shipping companies, who also own or influence media outlets, and have strong connections to politicians. Paok’s Greek-Russian owner, Ivan Savvidis, has invested heavily and turned it into a title contender, earning devotion while steadily buying up swathes of real estate, resorts, media outlets and industrial companies in the city. Savvidis is rumoured to be close to the Syriza government while Marinakis has strong personal connections to the opposition centre-right New Democracy party and has railed against Syriza. There are claims that a government- and Fifa-directed drive for reform has led to the election of a Greek football federation president supported by Paok’s owner. Fifa intervened in the federation in October 2016 and effectively ran it through a “normalisation committee” until last summer’s elections for a new president and executive board. Georgios Antonopoulos, a criminologist at Teesside University, believes the reforms have produced a more competitive season. “The Syriza government does not provide any support to [Olympiakos] in the same way another government would,” he says. But many Olympiakos fans feel as if they are the victims of a conspiracy. “In the last election I voted for Syriza, but now it has turned against Olympiakos I will never vote for them again,” said one, Maniatis Lambros. In November, two days after it was announced Marinakis again faced further accusations, a banner at an Olympiakos basketball match addressed Syriza: “Olympiakos was, is and will be forever the state.” Olympiakos’s press office said neither Marinakis nor Moralis were available for an interview: “The situation in Greek football is far too tense right now.” With the stakes so high for owners it is no wonder Greek football is so combustible. A crunch match between Paok and Olympiakos in February was abandoned before kick-off after Olympiakos’s coach, Óscar García, was struck by a cashier roll thrown from the stands. García was hospitalised while Paok accused him of faking injuries. This month’s match between Paok and AEK was abandoned after Savvidis stormed on the pitch while armed with a holstered gun and attempted to confront the referee, who had disallowed his team a late goal. The government responded by suspending the Super League indefinitely. If this season is resumed, Paok will likely face a hefty points deduction – as could AEK for walking off – making a previously unlikely eighth consecutive Olympiakos league title under Marinakis a distinct possibility. While this season could be settled in the courts so too could Marinakis’s fate. Although 58 people were sentenced for their involvement in the Koriopolis scandal this month, there was a widespread sense Marinakis was too powerful to be brought down, but the Noor 1 accusations have ramped up the pressure. Marinakis has released a defiant statement of denial, claiming the latest accusations are politically motivated. Five people were sentenced to life imprisonment over Noor 1 in 2016. But the Greek legal process is often convoluted, lengthy and fraught. “The sure thing is that [Marinakis] is in a war with the government now,” said Alevras, speaking before the latest accusations. “But he has all the support from the anti-government political parties.” • This article was edited on 28 March to remove references to charges. Under Greek criminal procedure, for serious offences, before a case can be referred to trial, a preliminary investigation is followed by a main investigation, conducted by an investigating judge. After that investigation has concluded, the judge reports their conclusion to the public prosecutor, who recommends either referral to trial or acquittal to a separate judicial body (the Judicial Council). The Judicial Council makes the final decision as to whether to refer a case for trial or acquit.

The health and social care secretary has told NHS trusts they do not need to meet standards that require them to treat 95% of A&amp;E patients within four hours and 92% of people awaiting non-urgent care within 18 weeks. Hunt axed the targets earlier this week in the 2018-19 edition of the mandate (pdf), which is the set of priorities and instructions he gives the NHS every year. He said he made the decision because “a number of hospitals [are] struggling to meet these core performance standards overall”. His abandonment of the NHS’s two most totemic targets will force patients to suffer in pain as they face longer delays for treatment and could jeopardise their recovery, the Patients Association warned. “Patients will have to endure greater periods of pain and discomfort while they wait for surgery or battle to access care, and run greater risks of poor outcomes. In A&amp;E departments some patients will be waiting longer for admission to a ward in corridors with loss of their dignity and privacy, and risks to their safety. The risks for patient safety and poorer outcomes is completely needless, and unacceptable in a wealthy nation,” said Rachel Power, the charity’s chief executive. Hospitals have not met the four-hour A&amp;E target since July 2015. And the number of people on the waiting list for treatment within 18 weeks, for example for a cataract removal or hip or knee replacement, has crept up to more than 4 million in recent months. Patients are the losers from what is a decisive move away from their supposed rights under the NHS constitution, said Jeremy Taylor, the chief executive of National Voices, which represents more than 150 charities. “The government is easing pressure on health and care services by putting pressure on patients. Rather than meeting the funding needs of the NHS and social care, it is diminishing service standards. “The losers will be the many more thousands of people waiting for treatment in pain, discomfort and frustration – and with their health put at risk by further delay.” The change had been made secretly, with no public consultation or public debate, Taylor complained. Delays will accelerate the already growing numbers of NHS patients who feel obliged to pay for private treatment, Labour warned. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “Not only will [Hunt’s decision] mean people waiting longer and longer in pain for operations, not only does it breach legal guarantees contained in the NHS constitution, but fundamentally it risks the very future of our universal health system if it means forcing more to reluctantly flee the NHS for private provision instead.” Hospital bosses want to meet the targets because they guarantee patients timely care, but cannot due to underfunding and understaffing, said Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts. “This is not something trust leaders are comfortable with, particularly having worked so hard over a long period to achieve those standards by the late 2000s. They want the funding and the staff they need to carry on delivering those standards rather than see them slip away, however hard they work.” Bosses fear that benefits in patients’ access that hospitals have delivered since targets were imposed in the 2000s are now being lost, Cordery added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/26/labour-reveals-plans-to-put-reducing-global-inequality-at-core-of-uk-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T09:49:56Z","webTitle":"Labour pledges to put women at heart of British aid efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/26/labour-reveals-plans-to-put-reducing-global-inequality-at-core-of-uk-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/26/labour-reveals-plans-to-put-reducing-global-inequality-at-core-of-uk-aid","fields":{"headline":"Labour pledges to put women at heart of British aid efforts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Measures to cut global inequality will be put at the heart of British aid policy under new plans unveiled by Labour. The party’s green paper said a Labour government would introduce Britain’s first explicitly feminist international development policy, with a threefold increase in funding for grassroots women’s groups. Under the plans, which follow recent revelations of abuses within the aid sector, civil society and grassroots groups and communities will be favoured over large aid organisations. In the paper’s foreword, Jeremy Corbyn accused the Conservative party of “reducing aid to a matter of charity, rather than one of power and social justice”. “This sets out our vision to build a world for the many, not the few, and to make sure everything we do tackles inequality,” he said. “International development budgets can do more than just reduce the worst symptoms of an unfair world. We don’t have to accept the world that global elites are building for us. “Let’s help people around the world be more powerful and make their societies fairer – and in the process make our planet more safe, more just and more sustainable.” In 2018, the Department for International Development (DfID) spent 13.88% of its budget on disaster relief, the largest amount for any single issue. In addition, 11.39% was spent on health, 5.9% on government and civil society, 5.04% on education and 3.97% on banking and financial services in developing countries. Speaking to the Guardian before the launch, Kate Osamor, Labour’s shadow minister for international development, said Britain needed to get its “moral compass back” in terms of aid spending. She said the UK needed to be “a bit more honest” about who it was leaving behind. “We are looking at a feminist policy, because women are often the people who bear the brunt, who get paid the least amount, especially in developing countries. They are bearing the brunt of wars. We’ve seen this in the #MeToo campaign, this is happening more so in developing countries.” Entitled “A world for the many, not the few”, the paper will be launched on Monday in parliament, when Osamor will say: “We cannot rely any longer on the myth that trickle-down economics will somehow solve poverty. That bubble has finally burst. “Equal societies fare better on social indicators, are happier and more harmonious, and enable more sustainable economies. Yet we forge ahead with channelling wealth into the hands of an elite few. It is little surprise that in almost every city in the world extreme wealth and poverty now coexist.” Reducing inequality is enshrined in the global goals, which UN member states, including Britain, signed up to in 2015, but is not currently an explicit aim of DfID aid funding. Labour announced 34 specific actions, including helping countries that receive British aid to halve the income gap between the top-earning 10% and the poorest 40% by 2030, stepping up support for climate change and ending DfID’s investment in fossil fuels. The paper also proposed an end to the “opaque and controversial” conflict, stability and security fund, and to support for the privatisation of public services overseas. Labour accused the government of undermining positive work through “incoherent policies”, such as selling arms to the Saudi-led coalition while sending aid to Yemen. Alex Thier, executive director of the Overseas Development Institute, welcomed Labour’s proposals. “Inequality has risen up the global agenda as a fundamental factor in terms of poverty reduction,” said Thier. “What we have increasingly realised is that adding inequality is fundamental to long-term transformation, and that is why we think it’s so important to call it out explicitly as a goal. That is true in the UK as well as across the world.” However, the TaxPayers’ Alliance described the proposals as “pernicious” and badly thought out. Alex Wild, the campaign group’s research director, , said: “There are legitimate criticisms of the government’s approach to aid spending, not least the fact that they appear more motivated by inputs rather than outcomes. “But aiming for arbitrary inequality targets isn’t going to do much to help the poorest people in the world. If aid spending is based around inequality, taxpayers are going to end up seeing their money heading to places like Singapore and the US.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/23/suing-cambridge-analytica-data-rights-regulators-silicon-valley-tech","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:28:14Z","webTitle":"We’re taking on Cambridge Analytica in a legal fight for data rights | Ravi Naik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/suing-cambridge-analytica-data-rights-regulators-silicon-valley-tech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/suing-cambridge-analytica-data-rights-regulators-silicon-valley-tech","fields":{"headline":"We’re taking on Cambridge Analytica in a legal fight for data rights","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The movement for data rights has hit a landmark moment. In early 2017, I was instructed by a number of individuals who were concerned about the way their data was being used. They feared their personal data had been compiled and amalgamated into profiles based some on their most personal beliefs – their political opinions. Those profiles were processed by the notorious Cambridge Analytica, and seemingly by its parent company, SCL. We have now filed a claim in the British courts on behalf of a US citizen, David Carroll, to seek full disclosure of the data held by Cambridge Analytica and SCL. This will be the first case against these companies and will shed further light on what they were doing. Our clients are seeking to understand the extent of the data held about them without their knowledge or consent, and to know whether that data was subsequently manipulated, and if so, in what way and for what purpose. They also hope to discover the breadth of information needed to make sophisticated predictions about political beliefs – a revelation that will be of wide interest, not just to our clients. The case will also determine something more fundamental: the boundaries of permissible use of personal political data. And in turn, our clients will seek to ensure that such sensitive personal information is in future better protected. While it is increasingly accepted in the digital age that individuals enter into a bargain with their data in using the internet, the true costs of this exchange are only now becoming clear. In the context of revelations about what appears to be the untrammelled use of data in political campaigns, our clients’ case will set the first train of accountability in motion. This case – and the movement behind it – is about more than just holding companies like Cambridge Analytica and SCL to account. It seeks to demonstrate the importance of data rights, and how steps can be taken to control the use of our own information. For too long, those rights have been ignored in the name of innovation. . This is a critical time in ensuring that individuals have a say in how their online worlds are governed. It is now apparent that some information is too precious, too personal, to be left without personal control. After the claim was issued the Observer, the New York Times and Channel 4 News ran stories that have shown that our clients’ concerns may be well placed. The whistleblower Christopher Wiley has revealed that Cambridge Analytica retained huge data sets on individuals, including data alleged to have been harvested from Facebook. Cambridge Analytica’s own advertising claims that it possesses a unique set of 5,000 individual data points on each adult in America. That data was said to have been used to influence the US electorate through “psychographic” algorithms. Cambridge Analytica boasted that this algorithm had carried Donald Trump to victory. The ultimate parent company of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, openly states that it has “conducted behavioural change programmes in over 60 countries”. It also claims to conduct “military influence campaigns” using “alternative narratives and credible perspectives”. The suggestion is that these companies could create a political consensus by influencing behaviour. Algorithms and machine-learning software are the new “weapons” of political change. The internet is now full of algorithms that can analyse and predict human behaviour, even when information is incomplete. This has been achieved through the development of opaque software that, in the words of the Artificial Intelligence expert François Chollet, determines “which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get”. Those who control algorithms have great power. In particular, decisions on what is promoted to the top of a newsfeed can have tremendous influence. The feeds people are shown on social media sites are highly personal. What you see in your feed is algorithmically tailored to your identity and your interaction history with the site. This is a potent tool for targeting individuals, exemplified by the revelations concerning Cambridge Analytica. The idea that these platforms could evolve to affect politics goes against the idea of “apolitical” technology cherished by those in Silicon Valley. Indeed, it is only belatedly, and after the 2016 US presidential election, that the tech giants have revealed the extent of the manipulation of their use. Facebook initially labelled it “crazy” that its platform could have any influence on the election. It eventually confirmed that it was able to identify 80,000 posts on its platform that it believes were linked to Russia, which were viewed by up to 126 million people during the campaign. The recent revelations about the extent to which Facebook data was seemingly abused by private companies has served to aggravate these concerns. The internet giants have been too slow to react when data breaches have been brought to their attention. The latest events should at least be an awakening for these companies to put data rights at the forefront of their platforms. While regulatory and legislative developments such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may enhance individual protection over data, they represent an evolution in personal rights rather than a revolution. The revolution will come only when people can access and take control over their data and assert their rights to privacy, as our clients have done in their case against Cambridge Analytica and SCL. As our lives increasingly translate into electronic media and data, the question of who controls our data and what rights we have over it is not just for regulators or to be to technology companies. It is becoming as fundamental to us as any other human right. • Ravi Naik is a solicitor and partner at Irvine Thanvi Natas Solicitors, where he heads the public law department"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/24/gender-pay-gap-figures-inequality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Sorry, chaps, but denial won’t fix the gender pay gap | Tania Branigan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/24/gender-pay-gap-figures-inequality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/24/gender-pay-gap-figures-inequality","fields":{"headline":"Sorry, chaps, but denial won’t fix the gender pay gap","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Knife-crime injuries are on the rise because people are being stabbed more often. It’s not much of an explanation: any police chief would be ridiculed for it. It certainly doesn’t justify the rise, or point towards possible solutions. It basically restates the issue in a slightly different way. Yet when it comes to gender pay gaps, exposed by new requirements to publish the difference between average male and female hourly rates, employers are giving us just this kind of response. The reason for the hefty divides, they say, is that senior roles are dominated by men. That does not explain the problem; that is the problem. They are not recruiting or promoting women to top jobs, and in many cases are relying on them to do the lowest-paid work. If employers were in genuine ignorance as to how they treated their workers, these figures were an opportunity to educate themselves. Instead, many seem in denial. Several bleat that they pay men and women the same for equivalent work. This has been the law for almost 50 years, though it’s still not met in full. It’s like expecting praise for paying their tax or filing yearly accounts. In fairness, these firms are doing better than most just by revealing their gaps. Organisations with more than 250 employees must publish the information annually – but two-thirds have yet to do so, with the first deadline less than a fortnight away. They include many FTSE 100 companies. Perhaps they don’t see it as important. Perhaps they hope their results will go unnoticed among all the last-minute filings. Perhaps they don’t plan to file the figures at all. Executives are worrying the numbers look bad. I’m afraid it’s worse than that, chaps: they are bad. And the attempts to account for them are pretty terrible too. Company statements provide compelling evidence of a new law of physics. Call it Eve’s principle: the greater the pay gap, the greater the mental resistance. So the British Heart Foundation, which slightly favours women in median terms, sets out a plan to reduce its mean gap of 7.7%. The University of Cambridge, where the median gap is 15% (still below the national average of 18.1%), says it is not closing the divide fast enough and needs to do more. Now compare with Phase Eight – a womenswear firm, of all things – where the 44 men among its 1,754 employees are so heavily concentrated at the top that the mean gap stands at 64.8%, and median at 54.5%. “While on first glance our published gender pay gap figures suggest the average man has a higher hourly rate of pay than the average female, this is misleading and does not reflect the true story and culture within the Phase Eight business,” says the CEO. The pay gap figures do not suggest this. They prove it – however many times you look. If that doesn’t truly reflect Phase Eight’s culture, maybe it should do more to close the divide. Implicit in explaining away these findings is the idea that this is all society’s fault, as if society is not composed of individuals and institutions making choices every day, and as if wild variations across the same sectors are born of the unique, unshiftable requirements of one particular firm. That surely can’t explain how easyJet and Tui have median gaps of more than 45%, but British Airways only around 10%. Social change will be part of the solution. Supporting fathers better, including through improved paternal leave rights, would allow more women to take a step up in the workplace. But there are plenty of things that companies can do by themselves. And some of them are already doing so. The easyJet and Tui pay gaps exist in large part because almost all their pilots are male. But Tui, where only 5% of pilots are female, makes vague promises of improvements in its statement – while easyJet, which had 4% two years ago, is already on course to a 13% target and aims for 20% by 2020. So implement and promote family-friendly policies. Give managers unconscious bias training. (Phase Eight does, at least, do or promise to do both of these.) Recognise that not every job must be done a certain way just because it always has been: the gap across full-time workers is far smaller than when part-time workers are included. Use blind CVs and balance interview panels. Set clear and fair criteria for success. Reach out to diverse candidates – from across ethnic and class backgrounds too – and promote your industry in schools and communities; BA’s programmes encourage girls to think about training as a pilot or an engineer. Try “reverse mentoring”, as Ernst &amp; Young does, with young women helping to shift bosses’ attitudes. While you’re at it, ask yourself if your top staff should be earning so much and other workers so little. In many cases, the gender pay gap reflects the absurd and unhealthy gulf that has opened up between those at the top and bottom of companies. None of these is a solution in itself; all of them would help. They should not be beyond the wit of all these highly paid executives. But if they prove too challenging, let’s offer some outside help. That means punishing those who fail to comply, and shaming those with the worst records. The equalities watchdog should publish sectoral and regional breakdowns, and ask the worst offenders for clear, enforceable action plans with numerical targets. Some bosses hope these figures are the end of the story. The smart ones understand that they should be the start. Enough excuses. Get working on the solutions. • Tania Branigan is a Guardian leader writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/25/karren-brady-ive-never-walked-away-from-anything-and-im-not-going-to-start-now","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T13:00:02Z","webTitle":"Karren Brady: ‘I’ve never walked away from anything – and I’m not going to start now’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/25/karren-brady-ive-never-walked-away-from-anything-and-im-not-going-to-start-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/25/karren-brady-ive-never-walked-away-from-anything-and-im-not-going-to-start-now","fields":{"headline":"Karren Brady: ‘I’ve never walked away from anything – and I’m not going to start now’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Karren Brady is immaculate – navy dress, navy tights, navy shoes and Chanel belt, her hair perfectly coiffed, exuding warmth and confidence. She directs me to her equally immaculate office at West Ham United, the football club where she is the vice-chairman. Brady sits behind the desk, a Warholesque print of West Ham legend Bobby Moore above her, a laptop in front, and a huge flatscreen TV with rolling news on the wall. Her world seems perfectly composed. You would never guess Brady’s football club is in meltdown and fans are calling for her head. At 48, and a quarter of a century after becoming Birmingham City’s CEO, she is still known as “the first lady of football”. But, of course, there is much more to Brady than football – numerous business interests (last July, she became chair of Philip Green’s Taveta retail empire); her position as a Tory peer in the House of Lords; an outspoken column for the Sun; aide to Lord Sugar on The Apprentice; mother of two grown children; and champion of women in the workplace. It is in this last capacity that we meet. Brady has just made a timely TV programme about the gender pay gap. She examines the nature of unconscious bias (how primary schoolchildren distinguish between women’s jobs and men’s jobs, and how employers tend to choose men over women even when they have the same CVs), why women are often paid less for work of equal value, why women can’t ask for more money but men can, and, perhaps most importantly, how working mothers are discriminated against. Before we start, Brady reaches for her iPhone. “Can I send my daughter a text? She wants me to give her a call. I think she’s had a promotion at work.” She taps away at supersonic speed, then looks up. “Right. So. Have you seen the programme? What did you think of it?” She reminds me of Max Clifford, another supreme self-brander. Clifford would always start interviews by “receiving” phone calls from, say, Simon Cowell or Beyoncé, thanking him for everything he had done for them. Brady’s narrative is different – this is the woman who has everything: brilliant businesswoman, TV star and supermum. She glances at her huge gold watch. I sense the timer is running. It’s no surprise she has made this programme. After all, on The Apprentice she often pulls up contestants for throwaway sexist remarks, or signals her disapproval with a killer arched eyebrow. What makes her career so fascinating is that, at the same time as championing women’s rights, she has been associated most closely with some of industry’s great unreconstructed dinosaurs – Sugar, Green and the former pornographer David Sullivan, owner of Birmingham City and now West Ham. The programme is a powerful exploration of gender inequality at work, and makes me wonder how she challenges some of the male attitudes she comes across in the boardroom. One of her missions in the documentary is to teach women how to ask for a pay rise – she tells viewers she only agreed to appear on The Apprentice so long as nobody was paid more than her. It’s amazing you get paid as much as Sugar, I say, seeing as it’s basically his show. She looks embarrassed. “No, no. I think that came across completely wrong. I did point that out to the makers, actually. Alan is obviously the main person on the show. I meant the roles that are equal to mine – I wouldn’t accept being paid less.” There’s similar public confusion over her personal wealth, which has been estimated at £85m. “That’s complete rubbish, I’m not worth anything like that,” she says. “That’s Wikipedia. There’s not much I can do about that.” But the beauty of Wikipedia is that you can ask for information to be corrected. In the documentary, Brady is constantly left “open-mouthed” or “speechless” at her discoveries. For example, she says that even though it’s illegal to ask women in an interview if they have children, 46% of employers think this is fine, and 41% think working mothers are a burden on the team. It’s strange she was shocked by this finding. After all, Sugar famously said that if he couldn’t ask women whether they had children, the solution was not to hire them. Has she challenged him on this? She looks surprised. “Well, I have never heard the quote you’ve just put to me, so I’ve never tackled him about it. I don’t know if you’ve ever worked in business, but you don’t go around going raaaah [she roars], having these massive confrontations.” In 2010, I say, you were was asked about his comment in the Guardian. “God, I don’t remember!” she says. “Putting him to one side, my view is that the inference, by asking, is that those women are not as dedicated or hardworking or ambitious. I know myself, from being a working woman, that is not the case.” Brady grew up in Edmonton, north London. Her Irish father Terry was a self-made, Rolls-Royce driving millionaire, who made his fortune in property and printing. Her Italian mother, Rita, was a full-time mum. She was sent to an all-girls Catholic boarding school, which she hated. “You do what you’re told, you wear what you’re told, you eat what you’re told, you go to bed when you’re told.” It made her ambitious for a different life, she says. “I was sick of being told what to do. The one thing I wanted was independence. And I realised to have that independence, you needed financial independence.” After passing nine O-levels, she left to join the sixth form of a former all-boys school – one of only six girls. She left with four A-levels, but decided she wanted to make money rather than go to university. She joined Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at 18, then went to work for LBC, where she targeted her father’s client, David Sullivan, to advertise with the radio station. He placed £2m worth of advertising with LBC. Before long, Sullivan headhunted her, bought Birmingham City at her instigation, and, when she was 23, made her CEO. Sullivan bought the club for £700,000 in 1993, and sold it in 2009 for £82m. Much of Brady’s wealth is thought to date back to the sale of the club. By the time she left, 75% of senior management were women. Sullivan and Brady remain umbilically tied. In 2010, he bought West Ham United (with former Birmingham co-owner David Gold). Again, Brady was given the job of running the commercial side of the club – though her title was now vice-chairman rather than CEO.The stories of sexism she has faced in football are legion. At her first game as CEO she asked directions to the boardroom and was told “directors’ wives go this way”. When opposition fans chanted “Karren Brady is a whore”, she had to tell her grandmother they were singing “Karren Brady is 24”. Then there is the story of the player who said to her: “I can see your tits in that top.” She is said to have replied: “Well, don’t worry – when I sell you to Crewe, you won’t be able to see them from there.” Is that true? She smiles. “Yeah. Three days later when I sold him, it was the best deal I ever did.” Who was the player? “I can’t tell you. Only because he happens to be a friend of my husband, and he is so embarrassed about what he did that I’ve promised I would never reveal who it was.” She also sold her husband, former footballer Paul Peschisolido, twice, making a profit on him both times. She is at her best telling these stories – funny, lively, a natural performer. I wonder if she’s ever torn a strip off Sullivan over his views on women. What did she say, for example, when she discovered that he had been a patron of the Presidents Club – the men-only charitable trust that held galas where businessmen were recently caught groping female hostesses who had been asked, in advance, to sign non-disclosure agreements? She looks aghast. “I don’t think he was a patron,” she says. “Absolutely not. No, absolutely not. He attended many, many years ago, but he didn’t like it and never went again.” Are you sure? “100%.” She asked him? “No, he just mentioned it in passing.” She answers with such conviction that I assume I have got it wrong. But later I check the Presidents Club brochure that emerged after the event. Sure enough, Sullivan is named as a patron. Although it is true he did not attend this year’s gala, his son Jack – managing director of West Ham Ladies – did. In the documentary, Brady says the most difficult obstacle facing women at work is returning after maternity leave. After the birth of her first child, she took only three days’ leave. Although many women regard her as a fantastic role model, some would say she succeeded not by championing women’s rights and needs but by hurdling them. Did she feel she had to “man-up” to stand a chance? “It’s not language that I would use. I just felt this overwhelming sense of responsibility that I had to be there, and I couldn’t let people down and I had to bring up a child. And it just manifested itelf in very little maternity leave. It’s something I deeply regret. It’s not something I would ever encourage.” A few years ago she said she would never take a year’s maternity leave – the amount women are legally entitled to – and that “There would be no CEO, I think, that would take a year off.” Have her views changed since then? “No, because I could not take a year off. I wish I’d taken more time than I did, but not a year.” Does she still believe that no CEO would ever take a year off? She insists she does not remember saying that, and that it is up to the individual. I look at the Bobby Moore painting above her head. It must be a pretty awful time at West Ham – the threat of relegation, the lack of quality transfers, widespread unhappiness with their new ground in what was the 2012 London Olympics stadium (Brady negotiated a bargain rent of £2.5m a year, but fans have complained it was not built for football). There is unhappiness, too, with the manager David Moyes and, perhaps most of all, with the three people at the top of the club – owners Sullivan and Gold, and Brady, whose annual salary is £868,000. Earlier this month, there was a violent pitch invasion and coins were thrown at the directors’ box. What was even more shaming was that the match marked the 25th anniversary of Moore’s death, and was supposed to celebrate the club icon. It must have been horrifying, I say. “I don’t want to talk about West Ham,” says Brady, “because this [the TV show] is something that is really important to me, and I don’t want to cloud the two issues. This is something I’ve done on my Sundays and days off to shine a light on the equality issues for women and I would like to focus on that.” But, I say, the subjects are not unrelated. Some of the attacks target you particularly as a woman. “I disagree. I’ve never heard anybody shout at me. I obviously get social media comments, but I think everybody does in the public eye and you just have to live with that. A lot of the aggression has been channelled at the two chairmen, the two owners.” She looks at her laptop, and says it is time for her to get on with the rest of her day. Shortly before selling Birmingham City, Sullivan said he had lost the support of the fans and when that happens it is time to walk away. Has that time not come at West Ham? “I’ve never walked away from anything I’ve done, and I’m not going to start now. I genuinely believe the move we made to the stadium is the right one. That’s why we had 52,000 season ticket holders, and why 90% of those renewed.” Again, she says, we are not here to talk about West Ham. I say I have one more question related to women at work. Last year, after a post-match interview, the then Sunderland manager Moyes told BBC reporter Vicki Sparks that she “might get a slap, even though you’re a woman” because she was being “a wee bit naughty”. Moyes was fined £30,000 by the FA. In her column in the Sun, Brady wrote: “Hopefully the penny has dropped for him that it’s not OK to patronise, intimidate and threaten women and treat them as if they are impostors in a man’s world. End. Of.” Seven months later he was appointed West Ham manager. I can’t begin to understand how she agreed to hiring him. Did you have no qualms, I begin to say. She cuts me off. “I know what you’re going to say. Can we just concentrate on the programme.” Let me at least ask the question, I say. Again, she cuts me off. “I’ve already made a comment about that, and I don’t want to go there. If you want to talk about the programme, I’m really, really happy to, but I really don’t feel this is an interview about West Ham or talking about my manager or talking about the troubles my chairmen face. I’ve agreed to see you today because it’s a serious issue.” But this issue is about just that – treating women equally at work. “So far you’ve used this programme to attack my chairmen, to attack Lord Sugar, attack David Moyes,” she says. I’m not attacking them, I say. I’m just asking how you hold men with clout to account when they treat women unfairly. “Whatever ...” she mutters. The smile has gone. Suddenly the room feels very cold. I change the subject. But wherever I head we run into trouble. In the documentary, she bemoans the lack of legislation to ensure women are paid equally for doing jobs of equal worth. I ask what she plans to do about this as a peer. “Well, obviously in the Lords we review legislation so all we can do is keep campaigning for these issues to be pushed higher and higher up the agenda. But I don’t really have any political activities.” How can you say that when you’re a Tory peer? She doesn’t answer. So we return to the safe territory of Brady’s brilliant career. Yes, she says, she is proud of herself. “When I left school at 18 with no qualifications,” – she seems to have forgotten her nine O-levels and four A-levels – “I didn’t really know what I was going to do with my life. I’ve taken every opportunity, pushed myself in ways I’m not sure I knew were even possible, I’ve made the best of my life and career. So yes, I do feel proud of myself.” Despite her inconsistencies and selective memory, Brady should be proud of herself. Hers is a remarkable story. She has let nothing hold her back, not even a life-threatening brain aneurysm in 2006. She says this simply made her realise how short life is, and redouble her efforts. She looks at the time again. What ambitions are still unfulfilled? “I don’t know. The toughest thing about being a success is you’ve got to keep on being a success. You have to do the things you’re passionate about, that you love. Who the hell wants to get to 48 and think: ‘I wish I would have, I should have … I could have done this, I might have done that.’ You don’t really do much in life unless you take risks, push yourself and find your passion.” At times, it is hard to know what Brady’s passion is. She doesn’t seem mad about football, despite running two clubs for half her life; nor about politics, despite being a Conservative peer. But there is undeniably passion. You can see it in her face, her drive, her hunger to achieve. It’s passion for family, for business, for leading from the front, for being Karren Brady. I get up to go. She is thinking about the future – what’s left to conquer. “I’m not looking to be a Cabinet minister. I don’t want to be an MP, I don’t want to be mayor of London.” Why not mayor? “Because at the moment I have too much on.” She pauses. There’s a twinkle in her eye, and the warmth has returned. “Maybe that’s an ambition for the future,” she says.

One evening, as a young man studying art at college in Leeds, he spotted a troupe of performers setting up. Five decades of work has followed that chance encounter, as the Yorkshire miner’s son from Wakefield has attempted to capture the visual chemistry of the circus; the sawdust, the sequins, the dirt and the face paint. “The whole thing happened by chance a very long time ago,” Lavery, 70, told the Observer this weekend as Circus Work, the book of his photographs, which are currently on show in Nottinghamshire, was published. “I was doing different projects as part of my course when I walked by Queens Hall and saw Winship’s Minicircus. I thought it would be a great subject,” he said. Lavery progressed via Leeds College of Art to the Royal College of Art in London, where he studied photography and went on to establish himself as a leading commercial photographer, well known for his stylish images of products, from cars to jeans. Less well known is his life on the road, often sleeping rough and following the circus caravan. The lure of the circus ring, and of big tops on every scale, has never been a mystery to Lavery. He says he knows exactly why he was continually drawn back to the spectacle. “I have spent the rest of my career going around the world with my camera doing various advertising assignments and, if you accept that life, then you are just doing a job for someone else, to solve their problem,” he said. “So after a long advertising shoot I would need to just go off to find a circus to take some pictures. And I started to enjoy the contrast.” Lavery also found he was fascinated by the idea of conjuring up images that had an element of performance or artifice in them and he loved the more formal discipline of using an old-fashioned black-and-white plate camera. “I study the shape of the pictures more when I am using a plate. I think of the frame as a theatre or a stage set around an image,” he said. His efforts to portray the essence of circus life were summed up only recently, he said, in a conversation with an Irish circus performer. “‘We are all about illusion’, she said to me as I was taking a shot of her in her sequined costume, standing in the mud next to her caravan with her boots on,” recalled Lavery. “What I have been trying to do, and am still trying to do all these years later, is to put the same kind of magic into my images that they put into what they do. And of course you see far more than just the exoticism of the ring if you bring in the backstage world.” Lavery’s book, which was launched on Thursday, also serves to mark the 250th anniversary of circus as popular entertainment. In 1768 it was the impresario and horse riding star Philip Astley who first pulled together a motley selection of jugglers, acrobats and clowns and set up a show by simply drawing a circle on an abandoned patch of land near Vauxhall Gardens, south London. Last week Kate Hoey, MP for Vauxhall, agreed to support a finale for Lavery’s touring exhibition near the site of the first circus. The veteran photographer, who sets out on his travels these days from his home on a Wiltshire farm, now takes colour shots of the circus as well as black and white, but that is not the only thing that has changed. Circus itself has undergone a revival. “When I started out circus life was not really looked at as being a great thing at all. Gerry Cottle was doing some quite advanced stuff in that early period, but it really did seem as if that whole world was about to die out,” he said. Many of the smaller outfits Lavery once knew have since fallen by the wayside, including Winship’s Minicircus, his initial inspiration. “But I love the new vintage-style circuses that have come along now, like Giffords. Nell Gifford has featured in a few of my pictures. And Billy Smart’s circus may have gone, but his granddaughter Yasmine now works as a ring mistress with Giffords. “Circus families seem to operate like one big family over time. Zippos is still going, and there is Peter Jolly’s circus. I stick with these more traditional circuses, the bigger, foreign-style of circus is not for me.” Circus Work, The Harley Gallery, Welbeck, Nottinghamshire, until 15 April, and the National Centre for Craft and Design, Sleaford, Lincolnshire, from 28 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/23/john-bolton-north-korea-iran-iraq-who-is-he-what-does-he-believe","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T18:53:26Z","webTitle":"Bombs away: John Bolton's most hawkish views on Iran, Iraq and North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/john-bolton-north-korea-iran-iraq-who-is-he-what-does-he-believe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/john-bolton-north-korea-iran-iraq-who-is-he-what-does-he-believe","fields":{"headline":"Bombs away: John Bolton's most hawkish views on Iran, Iraq and North Korea","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fifteen years ago to the week, the US began its invasion and occupation of Iraq. Among the war’s many architects and cheerleaders was John Bolton, at the time a senior adviser to George W Bush on issues of arms control and international security. And while many early invasion supporters have, in the clear view of hindsight, conceded that the decade-plus long odyssey was at least misguided, Bolton has reached no such conclusion. Even in the war-happy neoconservative Bush administration, Bolton stood out - a hawk among hawks - and his post-Bush career as a public commentator certainly didn’t see those leanings tempered. He has advocated, to various degrees, pre-emptive strikes and wars against North Korea and Iran, and overall an aggressive military interventionist programme around the world, coupled with staunch anti-immigration rhetoric. Late Thursday, Bolton, who is scheduled to takeover for HR McMaster as Trump’s national security advisor on 9 April, said on Fox News that all those pronouncements were behind him as he prepares for his new role in the White House. “During my career, I have written I don’t know how many articles and op-eds and opinion pieces. I have given I can’t count the number of speeches, I have countless interviews ... in the past 11 years. They’re all out there in the public record. I have never been shy about what my views are,” Bolton said, adding later, “Frankly, what I have said in private now is behind me.” He concluded: “The important thing is what the president says and the advice I give him.” Still, here are some of Bolton’s most aggressive published views in recent memory which may offer window into exactly what kind of advice he may be about to give to Trump. Don’t talk to North Korea In August, when defense secretary Jim Mattis and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson co-published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal outlining their philosophy on North Korea, Bolton said he was “appalled” by the tack. “Time is not a neutral factor here. Time is an asset for the proliferator,” he said on Fox News. “More negotiation with North Korea? I think they’d say bring it on. More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities. “The object of our peaceful pressure campaign is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Tillerson and Mattis had written. “Diplomacy is our preferred means of changing North Korea’s course of action.” Preemptive strike on North Korea In a seeming retread of Dick Cheney’s infamous insistence that we not wait until the “smoking gun” is a “mushroom cloud” with respect to Iraq, Bolton argued in the Wall Street Journal in February that a lack of intelligence about North Korea’s missile program could justify a military first strike. “The threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times,” he wrote. “Given the gaps in US intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute. That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation. It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current ‘necessity’ posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons by striking first.” Preemptive strike on Iran In a 2015 op-ed in the New York Times headlined To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran, Bolton wrote: “The inescapable conclusion is that Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions block its building a broad and deep weapons infrastructure… “An attack need not destroy all of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, but by breaking key links in the nuclear-fuel cycle, it could set back its program by three to five years. The United States could do a thorough job of destruction… “Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.” The piece was published about three months before Barack Obama’s secretary of state John Kerry helped successfully negotiate a non-proliferation deal that saw Iran agree to a 98% reduction in its enriched uranium stockpile and a 15-year pause in the development of key weapons infrastructure. That deal is now in peril under Trump. No humanitarian obligation to accept Syrian Refugees “We have no obligation to bring them into this country,” Bolton told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro in 2015 as millions were fleeing the ongoing civil war. Bolton added that in his estimation the US can refuse to allow Syrian refugees entry “without in any way violating our humanitarian obligations”. The only mistake made in Iraq was leaving Iraq In the Daily Telegraph in 2016, Bolton wrote that: “Iraq today suffers not from the 2003 invasion, but from the 2011 withdrawal of all US combat forces. What strengthened Iran’s hand in Iraq was not the absence of Saddam [Hussein], but the absence of coalition troops with a writ to crush efforts by the ayatollahs to support and arm Shi’ite militias. When US forces left, the last possibility of Iraq succeeding as a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional state left with them. Don’t blame Tony Blair and George W Bush for that failure. Blame their successors.” Terrorism is a war, not a crime In the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris Bolton opined for Fox News that “This is not a matter for the criminal law, as many American political and academic leaders, including the President [Obama], have insisted… This is a war… “The mechanism of response must be to destroy the source of the threat, not prosecute it, not contain it, not hope that we will ‘ultimately’ destroy it. ‘Ultimately’ is too far away. “Knee-jerk, uninformed and often wildly inaccurate criticisms of programs (such as several authorized in the wake of 9/11 in the Patriot Act) have created a widespread misimpression in the American public about what exactly our intelligence agencies have been doing and whether there was a ‘threat’ to civil liberties. Now is the time to correct these misimpressions, and to rebut the unfounded criticisms.” Nobody tell Bolton’s new boss, who has dabbled in “deep-state” conspiracy thinking throughout his administration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/01/browse-bookshop-bookmarks-london","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"Browse a bookshop: Bookmarks, London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/01/browse-bookshop-bookmarks-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/01/browse-bookshop-bookmarks-london","fields":{"headline":"Browse a bookshop: Bookmarks, London","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“We sell socialist books – from children’s stories with a progressive twist to Marxist philosophy,” says bookseller David Sewell. “A lot of our customers are activists looking for knowledge they can bring to campaigns and debates.

Its roots lie in a prank played on unsuspecting fellow students. The punchline was how many would blindly turn over their secrets to him. “I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses,” Mr Zuckerberg bragged to a friend. “People just submitted it. I don’t know why. They ‘trust me.’ Dumb fucks”. Even if his pejorative description was half-joking, his insight was real. His teenage precociousness led him to build a vast surveillance machine around the false impression that users have control over what is shared. In truth, Facebook users have little authority over what is shared about them. For a number of years, Facebook’s asymmetry in control over its users’ personal data was extended to third-party applications. These were allowed to “scrape” Facebook profile information from users who, usually having been lured into playing a game or quiz, consented to giving up not only their data but that of their friends too. Most had no idea that their data had been siphoned off – let alone that it was being used to target voters for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Facebook has now stopped sharing friends’ data via third-party apps but it has not stopped using such information itself. Now advertisers come directly to Facebook. The reason why they do so is that Facebook’s data is a window into its users’ souls. By assessing a few score Facebook likes, a person’s personality can be more accurately delineated in many regards than it could by even their spouse. Data is Facebook’s gold. People will pay for it. New web technology has created many unexpected ways for corporations to track web activity. But Facebook is a treasure trove of the most intimate data. Why do so many Facebook users entrust it with so much personal information? The answer is that people have social reasons to participate on social network sites, and these social motivations – which revolve around creating an identity, building relationships and being part of a community – explain both why users value Facebook despite its privacy risks and why they underestimate those risks. Understanding this is vital for understanding why government must have a role in safeguarding public privacy. Given what is emerging, it seems madness to allow Facebook, Google and Amazon direct access to bank accounts. Yet that is what is happening and UK ministers are silent. It speaks volumes that data regulators and election watchdogs cannot conduct investigations speedily into Facebook’s role on this side of the Atlantic. The UK will adopt EU rules that will give users more power to opt out of being tracked online – but it’s unclear how adherence to such rules will be ensured. For Facebook the solution lies with Mr Zuckerberg himself. He has said he wants to give away 99% of his wealth before he dies. Some say he could do so by abandoning targeted advertising on Facebook, which brought in $40bn last year. The chances of a regulatory backlash – in Europe and America – are growing, fuelled by anger over tiny tax bills and antitrust cases. Mr Zuckerberg owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Such firms may need to compensate people for sucking up their data. Because of its size and reach, Facebook ought to submit to government oversight and critically examine its approach to data. Failure to do so makes it likely that Facebook will end up a regulated utility. Then Mr Zuckerberg could only blame himself for a lack of foresight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T18:01:10Z","webTitle":"Corbyn in antisemitism row after backing artist behind 'offensive' mural","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn in antisemitism row after backing artist behind 'offensive' mural","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn was embroiled in a fresh antisemitism row on Friday after conceding he was wrong to support a graffiti artist whose “offensive” work was scrubbed off a wall in London’s East End. In a Facebook post in 2012, Corbyn offered his backing to Los Angeles-based street artist Mear One, whose mural, featuring several known antisemitic tropes, was due to be removed after complaints. Mear One said on his Facebook page: “Tomorrow they want to buff my mural Freedom of Expression. London Calling, Public art.” Corbyn replied: “Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera’s [sic] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.”“In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on the grounds of freedom of speech,” said a statement released by the Labour party on Friday. “However, the mural was offensive, used antisemitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed.” The mural, which was subsequently scrubbed off, pictured several apparently Jewish bankers playing a game of Monopoly, with their tabletop resting on the bowed naked backs of several workers. Labour MP Luciana Berger raised the issue with Corbyn’s office after screenshots of the Facebook post emerged. She said on Friday afternoon that she was not satisfied with the statement issued by the Labour press office. Corbyn’s office then released a second statement – shortly after announcing the sacking of the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith. In it, Corbyn said he had made, “a general comment about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech”. He said the case he cited, in which a mural by Mexican artist Diego Rivera in New York’s Rockefeller centre was plastered over, was “in no way comparable” with the mural in the Facebook post. “I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and antisemitic,” he said. “The defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of antisemitism in any form. That is a view I’ve always held.” Corbyn has been accused of failing to crack down on a series of cases of antisemitism. He recently admitted being a member of a closed Facebook group called Palestine Live, in which a number of antisemitic posts appeared – though he did not join in the conversations and left the group in 2015. When the existence of the group was revealed earlier this month, Corbyn told reporters: “Had I seen it, of course, I would have challenged it straight away, but I actually don’t spend all my time reading social media. After Friday’s incident, Labour peer and former Ed Miliband adviser Stewart Wood said: “The German Social Democrats had an expression in the 1890s: ‘antisemitism is the socialism of fools’. Sadly, Labour’s leadership now faces the challenge of having to convince our party and country that they will not tolerate those who confuse the two.” Dudley MP Ian Austin said the mural was one of the worst antisemitic images he had seen. “Jeremy would never have defended racist imagery aimed at any other group,” he said. Some Labour MPs have also expressed concerns about the longrunning case of Ken Livingstone, who remains suspended over a series of controversial remarks. At prime minister’s questions, on Wednesday, Theresa May sought to capitalise on the issue in the run-up to May’s local elections. “The message is clear: if you believe in good local services, want to see more homes built and want to tackle antisemitism, there is no place for you in the Labour party,” May said. But some of Corbyn’s allies, including Derby North MP Chris Williamson, have suggested that the issue of antisemitism is being “weaponised” by those critical of Corbyn’s leadership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/24/cardinal-keith-obrien-iscotland-catholics-church-hypocrisy-oath","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T20:02:11Z","webTitle":"Gay clergy will live in torment until the Catholic church drops this hypocritical oath | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/24/cardinal-keith-obrien-iscotland-catholics-church-hypocrisy-oath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/24/cardinal-keith-obrien-iscotland-catholics-church-hypocrisy-oath","fields":{"headline":"Gay clergy will live in torment until the Catholic church drops this hypocritical oath","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The most human response to the death of Scotland’s shamed cardinal came from the journalist whose articles forced his resignation. Catherine Deveney spoke with compassion and pity as she expressed the hope that Cardinal Keith Patrick O’Brien had found peace and forgiveness at the end. Deveney’s articles for the Observer in 2013 revealed that O’Brien had, for many years, conducted a series of inappropriate relationships with young priests under his jurisdiction. Like others, she had been aware of a whiff of scandal surrounding this widely admired man who, unlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, seemed to possess something that endeared him to people. It was only when O’Brien began to front an ill-advised and nasty campaign against same-sex marriage that three priests who had been in sexual relationships with him felt they had to speak out and subsequently approached Deveney with their stories. A few months before this, I was informed by the editor of the Catholic Observer that O’Brien had chided her for publishing an article of mine in which I had criticised his attitude to gay people and the use of the word “grotesque” in describing their sexuality. Yet I didn’t derive any delight at his public outing, only a sense of deep sadness that a man with great qualities of leadership and compassion had been brought low by a lie that had probably stalked half his adult life. What misery and self-loathing must he have endured as he preached his fables about human sexuality. And yet what damage had he caused to the faith of thousands not by being revealed as a sinner but as a hypocrite. Ironically, the term “grotesque” can be more accurately applied to a bitter and vile band of ultramontane Scottish Catholics who have been permitted to roam the country, spreading fear and hatred within the Catholic church. These haters barely deserve to be called human, such is their contempt for those who do not adhere to their distorted form of Christianity. They have conducted a reign of terror among priests they suspect of being gay by threatening to “out” them lest they recant and repent. On other occasions, they have stalked successful young single women in the church and asked inappropriate questions about the status of their relationships. In some corners of Catholic Scotland a special level of suspicion is still reserved for Catholic women who have reached their 30s “without a man”. If Dante had existed today he would have reserved a special circle of pain and torment for this band of latterday inquisitors and social misfits. Catholic leaders are in denial about sexuality and especially the “grotesque” form of it that they fear more than anything else. Latterly in his ministry, something caused O’Brien suddenly to begin deploying more militant and unpleasant language in describing gay people. This would all be hilarious if it weren’t so tragic. The Catholic church is absolutely hoaching with gay priests and bishops. There are so many residing within the Vatican that they could probably form their very own order. I’ve been contacted by several in Scotland over the past few years, simply for highlighting the hypocritical oath that holds sway in the Catholic church and that has made their lives miserable. It’s not difficult to understand why so many gay Catholics are attracted to the priesthood. In many traditional Catholic households, homosexuality is simply not allowed to be mentioned. In such an environment, a Catholic adolescent male who is encountering issues around his sexual identity might be told to take some headache pills and go for a lie down until the feeling goes away. Indeed, that pretty much sums up the entirety of Catholic teaching on this matter. These young men, already hating a part of themselves, are then drawn to the priesthood that offers them a state where they can embrace celibacy and subjugate their sexuality. It is an ecclesiastical and bizarre set-up with disastrous consequences. A stance of denial has, of course, also been apparent in a different realm – namely, the lamentable response of the hierarchy (and the reactionary praetorian guard of lay civil servants that surrounds it) to the decades of sex abuse by Catholic clergy in Scotland. The week before O’Brien’s death, Father Paul Moore, an 82-year-old retired priest, was convicted of sexually abusing three children and a student priest over a period spanning more than 20 years. Without going into the details, the abuse was as bad as it gets. His bishop knew about this many years before, yet chose to park the issue by moving him on. He was only doing what other bishops are told to do. The principal victim who gave eight days of evidence has fought for many years to bring his violator to justice. During this time, he has been treated with a level of contempt and disdain by his own church which was astonishing to behold and utterly callous. There are thousands like him, stretching back decades, and yet the church now boasts of having the right safeguards in place to prevent future abuse. I’d be interested in examining these safeguards and asking why they were constructed without talking to any of the groups of people who survived widespread clerical sexual abuse. Pope Francis will visit Ireland in August, where he will preach to the converted. It is a home game for the pontiff where he will encounter few protests. I’d encourage him to visit Scotland and find out for himself why tens of thousands of the faithful have abandoned the church. He might also wish to conduct a review of a hierarchy that, with a few exceptions, is no longer fit for purpose. • Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist • This article was amended on 28 March 2018 to make clearer that a sentence reading, “Some of this has been evident in the decades of sex abuse by Catholic clergy” was referring to a stance of denial by church officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/25/macbeth-christopher-eccleston-review-rsc-the-great-wave-plough-stars-agnes-colander","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: Macbeth; The Great Wave; The Plough and the Stars; Agnes Colander – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/25/macbeth-christopher-eccleston-review-rsc-the-great-wave-plough-stars-agnes-colander","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/25/macbeth-christopher-eccleston-review-rsc-the-great-wave-plough-stars-agnes-colander","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: Macbeth; The Great Wave; The Plough and the Stars; Agnes Colander – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Before this RSC Macbeth has begun, you see three little girls in red onesies, each nursing a bleeding doll. They sit around a double bed in which lies a bearded old man, Duncan, who looks as though the very thought of the Scottish play has deprived him of the will to get up. And no wonder – because this Macbeth, directed by Polly Findlay (whose Beginning for the National Theatre has been a hit), fizzes with ideas but is a huge challenge. It is a combination of black-and-white horror film (it also nods at Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining), utilitarian tragedy and child’s play. Child witches ought to make sense in a drama involving murdered innocence, only that when the children chant “fair is foul and foul is fair” in a singsong tone, it sounds as though they have no idea what the words mean and are just up beyond their bedtime. Christopher Eccleston, making his RSC debut, is a down-to-earth, northern Macbeth. At one point he comments that it has been “a rough night” and gets a laugh. But having a Macbeth, dressed in camouflage, who sounds as though he would like to be one of the lads does not altogether come off – he is too busy killing other lads to be anything other than isolated as time runs out on him (designer Fly Davis has a digital clock on stage, ticking backwards from Duncan’s death to Macbeth’s). Eccleston is at his best in the instant remorse and weird anticlimax following Duncan’s death, but too often this plain-speaking Macbeth murders the flow of the speeches. What Findlay’s production powerfully reminds us of is how much time the Macbeths spend talking to someone who is not there – an audience with absence. And it is blessed with a sensational Niamh Cusack as Lady Macbeth. When she says “look like the innocent flower but be the serpent under it”, she could be describing herself in her stem-green dress. Her violent thoughts are offered with exultant softness. She would get blood out of air to achieve what she wants. There is good support from a well-spoken Banquo (Raphael Sowole), an eloquent Malcolm (Luke Newberry) and an unusual Macduff (Edward Bennett) who looks more cosy environmentalist than soldier but breaks one’s heart in the scene where he learns of his family ’s death. The drunk porter (Michael Hodgson) is oddly ubiquitous, becoming a traffic warden for murderers who have no sense of direction. This thoughtful, multitasking production has a fatal tendency to undermine tragedy with jokes. The Great Wave is not about a Hokusai painting; it’s about a Japanese girl, Hanako, who walked down to the sea one day and disappeared in a storm. She had been abducted by North Korea (as were other Japanese people in the late 70s) and held captive – her job to educate North Korean spies about Japan. Francis Turnly, a Japanese-Northern Irish playwright, has written a thriller that holds us captive too. His writing has a linear grace to which designer Tom Piper has responded with elegant screens upon which video artist Luke Halls projects roaring water – curvaceous black-and-white waves. It is a pleasure – and still a rarity – to see a predominantly Asian cast at the National, and this is a first-rate ensemble, directed by Indhu Rubasingham, artistic director of the Tricycle theatre. With help from a revolving and sometimes split stage, her careful production shifts between punitive North Korea and defensive Japan. Hanako (dignified Kirsty Rider) is in a North Korean prison cell, watched over by a portrait of Kim Il-sung and by a soldier (Kwong Loke) and an aspiring spy (Tuyen Do). Hanako’s anguished sister, Reiko (Kae Alexander), remains in Japan with the girls’ neat, distressed mother (Rosalind Chao) and with Tetsuo, the boy next door – played by Leo Wan with cartoon expressiveness, as though escaped from a manga comic. Twenty-five years pass – a concise epic – and some answers emerge. But the show’s parting image is enigmatic: an orange lantern taking off into the Dorfman’s upper darkness. No Japanese artist could have ended this fresh, moving, out-of-the-ordinary drama with more perfect punctuation. Seán O’Casey’s The Plough and the Stars (1926), about the Easter Rising in 1916, when Irish republicans attempted to end British rule, caused a sensation a century later in Sean Holmes’s rumbustiously updated 2016 production at the Abbey theatre, Dublin. This welcome revival is a persistently interrupted cabaret, a bold, discomfiting Irish babel. The set is a metal scaffold/Dublin tenement block (designer: Jon Bauser). Shortly before his death, according to a programme note, O’Casey was still advising young playwrights not to be afraid of “life’s full-throated shouting”. Silence would, one suspects, be death to O’Casey’s characters. The cast is phenomenal, with an especially impressive Kate Stanley Brennan as Nora Clitheroe, determined to stop her husband, Jack (outstanding Ian Lloyd Anderson), from fighting in the Irish Citizen Army and herself ending as an Irish Ophelia. Hilda Fay is affecting as unionist Bessie Burgess. Ciaran O’Brien is vivid as diminutive, fidgety zealot “the Young Covey”. Janet Moran is gorgeously brazen as Mrs Gogan, whooping with indiscretions. Peter Flynn (Niall Buggy) is a pitch-perfect comic turn. Phelim Drew convinces as Fluther Good. And Julie Maguire shocks as consumptive Mollser, who starts the evening singing the Irish national anthem before choking on her own blood – a warning made flesh. I can’t resist the temptation to say that Agnes Colander is full of holes – because that is the truth. This is a draft of an early and never-performed Harley Granville Barker play, which he wrote in 1900, aged 22, tactfully resuscitated by playwright Richard Nelson. The dialogue is patchily eloquent and often creaky, crying out for the dramatic equivalent of WD-40. And yet it’s a worthwhile curiosity because of the surprising (for the time) questions it raises about how to be a woman and an artist. Trevor Nunn, deft pro that he is, proceeds with flair, and the Ustinov Studio proves an ideal space in which to situate an artist’s studio: Farrow &amp; Ball colours, a paisley spread over a chair, an easel standing like an interlocutor (designer Rob Jones). Naomi Frederick’s Agnes is arrestingly self-involved, with bursts of febrile animation. There are moments when her thoughts anticipate DH Lawrence. The play is startling in its discussion of sex – a strange mix, to a modern ear, of frankness and evasion. Matthew Flynn works wonders as Otho, rambling he-man, lover and artist, fetching up with Agnes in Normandy (beautifully evoked in the second half). Freddy Carter, as a gentleman admirer, is comic in his gauche ardour. But will the joke last? Gauche young men do not stay gauche forever. In the same way, there is no telling what this play might have become had Granville Barker elected, as a grownup, to revise it.

A child will start going to nursery, a student can get a bachelor’s degree. In three years, someone can meet the love of their life and get married; someone can start a business and succeed. Imagine what change can happen to a country that is considered the poorest in the Middle East and exhausted by war. The day that changed the lives of millions of Yemenis was 26 March 2015, when, within three hours, the sky filled with aircraft. People were shocked by what was happening, hoping that when the sun next rose, this would just have been a bad dream. They thought it would only last for a couple of days, but sadly three days passed and there was still war; three weeks passed and there was still war; three months passed and there was still war; and, today, three years will have passed, yet the situation keeps deteriorating. Who can forget the pictures of hundreds of Yemenis around the world stuck in airports, unable to return to their hometowns or families? The lives of everyday Yemenis were completely paralysed; the streets were empty; schools and universities were closed. Airstrikes were intensive and there was ground fighting in many different cities and villages. Within just one month, more than 1.8 million people had been forced to flee their homes, becoming internally displaced within Yemen. There was a glimmer of hope when the airport reopened, and people were able to both come back and to travel abroad for medical treatment, education and other purposes. Students resumed school and universities also reopened. But, unfortunately, today, 2 million children are estimated to be out of school. As the second year of war began, people started to find coping mechanisms to help them survive its brutality. They learned how to sleep through the sound of airstrikes. They learned to put on a brave smile and hide their pain. While airstrikes continued, and ground fighting spread throughout many areas, the number of internally displaced people increased to nearly 2.4 million. And yet, still more was to come – the airport was closed in Sana’a and salaries stopped being paid. The closure of Sana’a airport caused severe harm. According to the ministry of health, an estimated 10,000 Yemenis have died from critical health conditions, largely because they could not leave Yemen to access medical treatment abroad. It is very hard for people who suffer from a critical illness to travel for 12 hours, be stopped at every checkpoint, just to be able to go to Aden airport to travel outside Yemen. I remember the story of Amira, an elderly woman who wasn’t able to travel because she had to carry her oxygen cylinder with her. Or Ali, who wanted to travel to see his son and grandchildren and to seek medical care, but who died waiting for the airport to open. These stories are not rare. Given the turmoil that Yemen is in, cutting public-sector salaries has had a huge impact on the economy and public services. It left civil servants destitute and hungry, as well as their spouses, children and parents – how will they be able to afford their next meal, and will there even be food or cooking gas? Today, more than 8 million people are on the brink of famine. People don’t know where their next meal is coming from. Ameena, a woman dependent on her husband’s salary, told me: “We were happy with the little that we had, but now we have only bread to feed me and my eight children.” How long can this go on? As the war entered its third year, Yemen’s humanitarian needs increased tremendously, with 22.2 million Yemenis – nearly three in every four people – reliant on humanitarian aid to survive. On top of this, dengue fever, malaria, diphtheria and cholera began to spread fast. In May 2017, there was a huge outbreak of cholera, which went on to affect 1 million Yemenis before the end of the year. Yemenis will never forget the images we saw of crowded hospitals, and the fear of the disease spreading again. Now, as we enter the fourth year of fighting in Yemen, it is up to political powers and the international community to end it. If the war continues, hunger, destruction, disease, and death will dominate, and this is what Yemen will be known for. Yemen deserves better. Looking at three years of destroyed infrastructure, starvation and unchecked spread of disease, the humanitarian needs have increased from one year to another at an insane rate. Peace is the only thing that will allow us to rebuild our country; the Yemeni people have been suffering for far too long. Peace has to take the place of destruction. Development and infrastructure have to take the place of starvation. Laughter and happiness and normality should take the place of the endless stories of sadness and destruction and death. Yemenis deserve more than this. Yemen deserves better. • Hind Abbas is communications assistant for Care International Yemen.

As England’s cricketers prodded their way to a strangely immobile 58 all out in Auckland, the Test team’s lowest ever first innings score on a covered pitch, the TV cameras kept flitting around in search of some defining note of crisis, settling with a sense of declining interest on the mild, untroubled face of Trevor Bayliss. There it was again, the Bayliss face, looming beneath that leathery white hat. And still conveying through this historically dark moment for the national summer sport all the savage, rage-filled intensity of a papier-mache-covered balloon plonked propped up inside an England tracksuit and decorated with an expression of polite, arm’s-length concern. This is, of course, a misleading first impression. Bayliss is a hugely successful and committed coach. He’s a nice bloke. He works hard and travels all year. He is clearly not the main, or even one of the main problems with England’s Test team. But is he actually a part of the solution? Again, that lack of pain. England were bowled out for 58 and instead of horror and blood, the old familiar bruising, it was possible just to enjoy the soft, satellite-fed greens of the outfield, the bleached-out powder blue sky, the beauty of Trent Boult’s in-nipper that spun Ben Stokes around like a man stuck in a revolving door, bails pinging off behind him in a matching arc. On BBC radio Graeme Swann said it was just a bad day, that we shouldn’t think for a moment of taking the Test job from Bayliss. Swann was a great England cricketer. He knows this team really well. But he is surely too clever, and too exacting himself, to really believe there should be no accountability, no referred pain up the line. Dwindling interest. Administrative fudge. The indifference of the modern world. Bayliss didn’t cause these. But he is still the head coach of a team that has lost 10 of its past 13 Tests away from home. And as he spoke with an interested smile about “a lack of intensity” in his own Test team it was clear, once again, that it is shamefully negligent of the ECB to have entrusted the rasping, gurney-bound body of English Test cricket to someone who clearly doesn’t feel the necessary desperation, that absolute vocation to preserve this beautiful, irreplaceable oddity. Contrast this with the madness of the tail-end of the Andy Flower regime, arguably the last time all of this seemed to really, really matter. Four years ago the 5-0 Ashes whitewash unspooled into a kind of fury in Sydney, with Flower in the Bayliss chair, all furious, mangled intensity, a desiccated walnut in a baseball cap. Asked if Alastair Cook was a good captain Flower replied, “There are different levels of good”, and there was a swirl of incredulous rage in the room, a realisation once again that the best coaches and managers are essentially mad. That this is why they infuriate you, why they seem so desperate. Because the opposite is to be rational, to cease on some basic level to believe. At which point sport itself, an essentially emotional business, starts to die. And yes, it’s that old story again. It is hard to say anything about Test cricket these days without at some point starting to talk about death, sounding the klaxon for the end of the world. When it comes to the longest form we all become dying Romantic poets, one hand on the laudanum. But the fact is Test cricket has always been about to die, has spent its entire vibrant 141-year existence menaced by the future. Death and decay are a natural part of the poetry of a sport so intimately tied to the seasons, spring greens through to autumn browns. Test cricket probably shouldn’t have survived, should have died either side of the war, might have died many other times. Blink a little and it isn’t a terminal patient: it’s a miraculous survivor. What keeps it going is constant life support: love, faith, obsession. It is essential for all concerned, above all the England head coach, to care blindly and madly, to communicate this passion into the veins. And so we get Bayliss, who shouldn’t really be sacked because he doesn’t really do much anyway, doesn’t pick the team, doesn’t determine which players are available. But who will by 2019 have been paid £2m by English cricket fans to not really care about, or be that good at the form so many people love above all others. Right now the ECB could do much worse than rotating Bayliss out of Test cricket and appointing not only a coach but a Test tsar with extended powers, someone like Nasser Hussain or Alec Stewart, there solely to promote, select and lobby for the red-ball game. Death is not inevitable. This doesn’t have to happen. Test cricket is still gripping, is still a Great Product. But there is a carelessness here, and Test cricket can’t survive carelessness. It is instead a case of maintaining that care and intensity, surrounding the most fragile form only with people and things that are part of the solution. Not to mention ridding us all of a coach whose polite sense of bafflement, whose failure to bring through talent, is a part of the death, not the continued precarious life of Test cricket."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/23/the-spice-girls-set-to-voice-animated-superhero-movie","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:09:58Z","webTitle":"The Spice Girls set to voice animated superhero movie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/23/the-spice-girls-set-to-voice-animated-superhero-movie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/23/the-spice-girls-set-to-voice-animated-superhero-movie","fields":{"headline":"The Spice Girls set to voice animated superhero movie","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Spice Girls are set to provide both their voices and their likeness for a new animated superhero movie.

Officers in protective clothing wrapped the bench in plastic before using an angle grinder and crowbar to cut it free and take it away in a white van. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: “It [the bench] is being removed … in order to preserve it as a potential crime exhibit as part of the investigation into the attempted murders.” It said that areas searched so far as part of the investigation included open spaces, commercial and residential properties and vehicles. A spokesperson said: “This is one of the largest and most complex investigations undertaken by British counter-terrorism policing. “Searches are ongoing in the Salisbury area and at this stage it is not possible to put a timescale on how long these may take to conclude. Specialist search officers wearing protective equipment continue to carry out a meticulous, systematic search for evidence to support the investigation. On Friday Public Health England gave further advice to people who were in the Mill pub and the Zizzi restaurant on Sunday 4 March and Monday 5 March – the two places the Skripals visited before they fell ill. PHE told them to wash the clothes they wore, and wipe down any personal items they handled with baby wipes. It said anyone with items that are dry-clean only could contact the council to arrange for them to be picked up. “That search is being carried out based on expert scientific advice to assist detectives in understanding the specific locations that are of most relevance to their lines of inquiry. “Around 250 counter-terrorism detectives continue to work round the clock, supported by a full range of experts and partners.” The bench, close to the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant, which the Skripals visited on 4 March before collapsing, has been cordoned off and protected with a tent. Meanwhile, the chief executive of the defence laboratory at Porton Down said there was “no way” the site could be linked to the poisoning of the Skripals. Gary Aitkenhead told the BBC that Russian claims that the proximity of the lab to Salisbury might be somehow suspicious were “frustrating” and insisted Porton Down had the “highest levels” of controls and security. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, visited Salisbury on Friday. He acknowledged that businesses had taken “a bit of a hit” but said a plan was being developed to mitigate the problems the city faces. Parking in some Salisbury car parks will be made free from Saturday to try to encourage visitors to return. It also emerged on Friday that door handles and computer keyboards were among the items at Skripal’s home that are being examined by investigators as they work to establish where and how the nerve agent attack took place. Skripal’s red-brick house in Salisbury remains cordoned off almost three weeks after the 66-year-old and his daughter, Yulia, 33, collapsed in the city centre. An investigator was seen at the house with a list headed “swabs” . It appeared to indicate that the spots the Skripals were likely to have touched were being looked at in particular. The front door, patio door and keyboards were all listed. Counter-terrorism officials have given no details of how the Skripals may have come into contact with the nerve agent, which has been identified as novichok. There was speculation it could have been placed on the door handles of Skripal’s BMW or in the car’s ventilation system. Another suggestion is that Yulia, who arrived in the UK on a flight from Russia the day before she and her father collapsed, may have brought it into the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/23/sajid-javid-faces-battle-over-4-affordable-homes-in-sainsburys-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:54:26Z","webTitle":"Sajid Javid faces battle over 4% affordable homes in Sainsbury's scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/23/sajid-javid-faces-battle-over-4-affordable-homes-in-sainsburys-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/23/sajid-javid-faces-battle-over-4-affordable-homes-in-sainsburys-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Sajid Javid faces battle over 4% affordable homes in Sainsbury's scheme","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The housing secretary, Sajid Javid, is facing a legal challenge after he approved a 700-home housing scheme by the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, which includes just 4% affordable housing. The 29-storey development in Ilford, east London, will be built in a borough that has a stated policy that 50% of all new homes should be affordable. It estimates it needs an extra 15,000 affordable homes in the next 15 years, but Javid backed a scheme with just 27 affordable homes. The rest are expected to be sold for about £400,000 for a two bedroom flat. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, branded the approval “outrageous” and said 4% was a “disgraceful” contribution. Labour’s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said it was “a clear case of ministers backing private developer profit over the homes that local people need”. A local residents group Ilford Noise is now preparing to request a judicial review of the decision after Javid accepted Sainsbury’s claim that the scheme would not be viable with any more affordable units. Javid’s report concluded: “There is no good reason to dispute the agreed conclusions of the financial experts.” The decision came just weeks after Javid gave a speech insisting it is “totally unacceptable” for developers to claim they cannot afford to meet affordable housing promises. He said: “It cheats communities of much-needed housing and infrastructure and gives new development a bad name.” But in this case, where Sainsbury’s never promised more than 4%, he has allowed the developer to hugely undershoot the local target. Across England, the number of affordable homes delivered by the so-called section 106 agreements with developers halved from 32,000 in 2008-09 to 16,000 in 2015-16, according to analysis by Oxford Brookes University. “If we can’t build affordable housing in outer London where can we build it?” said Meenakshi Sharma, a co-founder of Ilford Noise, which has branded the amount of affordable housing in the Sainsbury’s scheme “ridiculous and insulting”. “It is the poorest people who are getting the shortest end of the stick.” Sharma said the government had prioritised meeting total housing targets rather than seeking to meet the chronic shortage of affordable homes. Javid’s decision notice points out that the Sainsbury’s development would represent 60% of one year’s target for the whole of the borough. The London Borough of Redbridge, which had originally rejected the scheme before switching to support, branded the ruling good news for residents who “are set to benefit from more affordable housing”. It suggested that a clause which states that “if viability were to improve, the affordable housing offer would improve proportionately” and could lead to more cheaper homes than the 4%. But Khan said: “The government’s decision shows just how out of touch they are with the needs of Londoners. Ministers are merely paying lip service to tackling the housing crisis as evidenced in this outrageous decision. Both City Hall and the local council recognised the amount of affordable housing on offer was simply unacceptable – and government decisions like this are not in the best interests of the capital.” A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We’re pleased with the outcome of the appeal as our plans will support Ilford’s regeneration by driving growth, creating new jobs and providing a broad mix of housing for the community.” The Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government is yet to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/23/news-facebook-journalists-harvest-data","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:43:56Z","webTitle":"The world still needs news.

It’s time Facebook realised this","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We are at a crunch point between truth and lies, and Facebook is right at the centre. This week we – the Observer and Guardian, Channel 4 News and the New York Times – have thrown our all at exposing the dark arts facilitated by Facebook’s waywardness and its neglect of the security of those who love and live it, its users. Facebook’s users are voters across the world. What we revealed was the extent to which a London-based company, Cambridge Analytica, had used data to target them and affect elections. Trading in fear, it sought in the US to erode Democratic voters’ faith in their own candidate, with the “crooked Hillary” viral effort that depicted her as a wanted criminal. It took old media to rumble Cambridge Analytica. Carole Cadwalladr of the Observer, which shared the story with Channel 4 and the New York Times, worked with her source Chris Wylie for a year. on all this Channel 4 News spent four months investigating the way Cambridge Analytica was doing business. This was toil that Facebook had a moral imperative to do for itself. Facebook had a duty to protect its users’ profiles from theft, and to detect and track down any entities attempting to use them. Facebook knew two years ago that user profiles had been lifted, but did nothing. Even after our revelations, it took Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg four days to respond. Facebook is probably the biggest commercial entity in history to have penetrated the brain cells of so vast a number of human beings. Yet it is a law unto itself in terms of both regulation and tax. The world wide web’s inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, said on Channel 4 News the other night, that “the genie is out of the bottle”. He doubted it could ever be got back in. There surely has to be a cost to any individual or organisation that sets out to harvest humankind’s desire for connectivity, community and friendship, without safeguarding the mechanisms by which they do it. Cambridge Analytica’s activities have exposed the threat to democracy that Facebook’s omissions have facilitated. Zuckerberg owes us more than a squirt of soundbites on CNN. He should do an in-depth interview with one of the organisations trying to investigate what is going on in the new digital world. At the same time, civil institutions in countries across the world need to do far more to regulate what entities such as Facebook are doing. Here in the UK, the idea that the information commissioner has just 10 frontline officers to fight the regulatory and security battles to come is close to absurd. Governments, like citizens, are out of their depth. Democracies have a super-human job to do to preserve the glories of the internet while preserving us from the abuse, filth and criminality that we now know is all too easy to conjure through it. As a journalist, I am grateful every waking day for what I am able to do thanks to the internet. But I loathe the idea that a company such as Cambridge Analytica has the capacity to work out whether I am susceptible to covert messaging that will affect the way I vote. Facebook has enabled us to secure literally billions of viewings of the news clips we post on our site. But in doing so we provide material around which it can sell advertising. Channel 4 News gets no revenue for this. Most readers of the Guardian and the New York Times read online. We all depended on terrestrial advertising to support what we do. That source of funding is evaporating. We have been arguing fiercely with Facebook, and Google, that they owe us a fairer share. Serious news, which Zuckerberg says he believes in to counter the fake news that thrives on his platform, costs serious money. Unless the tech giants start to take notice, there is a real danger that next time there might be no “old media” left to call them out. Don’t get me wrong. We all want to cooperate with Facebook in forging a new media world, and still have a chance to get this right. We must do so if we are to restrict the criminal use of private data for perverted ends, and instead garner our collective resources to render Earth safer and better. Come on, Mr Zuckerberg.

Those jaunts usually involved one of the following: a backpack; some random person’s sofa; early symptoms of scurvy or other vitamin deficiency-related ailment from living exclusively off bread to save money. As I aged, and earned more, I upgraded my travel experience to Airbnb and regular B&amp;Bs. But a hotel was still a price tag too far. So it was only about five years ago that I first stayed in a “proper” hotel. I listened spellbound to the busboy giving me the room tour (“key goes here, minibar here, press 0 for reception”), wondering what magic might unfold. In the movies, something always happened in a hotel room: sometimes tawdry, other times saucy, but at the very least there would be room service, and possibly near-nude room service if those fluffy white robes were involved. And something did happen. I discovered that I am a thief. I’m a highwaywoman of hotel freebies, a marauder of the corridors, pouncing on unattended housekeeper trolleys: “Stand and deliver! The handcream, or your life!” (read: bad TripAdvisor review). At first, I rationalised it to myself: “They started it, putting that alluring little chocolate on the pillow. They’re sending me a message.” The half-used hotel mini-toiletries were only going to be binned, and the fact they’re a luxury brand I couldn’t otherwise afford, well, that’s just incidental. “Besides,” I’d tell myself, “these lovely white slippers are branded, so if I took them home and wore them I’d basically be advertising for them. I’m doing a good thing.” I hoped that as hotels became more commonplace in my life, as they are now, that the draw of what I like to call “supermarket sweep: hotel edition” might fade. After all, what kind of grownup traveller eyes up the curtains and thinks “maybe”? But instead, the opposite happened – my appetite for hotel freebies grew. Now, I can’t fully enjoy my stay unless I’ve totally plundered the suite. I take it all. Airline-style hotel magazine? Yoink. Branded pencil and notepad? Why, thank you. Complimentary nuts? Straight into the handbag. The pillow chocolate is a gateway drug: the next thing you know, you’re popping a battery out of the remote without a care, or setting off airport security with the butter knife you keep in your pocket “for spreading emergencies”. Admittedly, I’m not as bad as others – I’ve never taken a robe, or any of the furniture or appliances. Not yet anyway. But who knows? I grow more brazen each time.

A hundred yards to my left, on a windy shelf of moor at the 330-metre contour, were barely discernible remains of Treforys, a three-street village built to house the quarry workmen. It had 36 cottages according to the 1861 census, each of them with a quarter-acre plot. Today sedge spears through the acid soil and spikes of bog asphodel – the unfailing index to unproductive land – gleam brilliant orange when the sun dips below mist and cloud to illuminate this austere landscape. By 1871 the village was deserted, its consumptive and dispirited inhabitants dispersed. The grandiose Gorseddau scheme was over. “Everything that could facilitate the works was produced, nothing being wanting but the slate vein,” noted an 1871 report on the company’s liquidation in the local paper. The misjudgment of these venture capitalists amazes me. Even the layman can see at a glance that Gorseddau rock does not cleave in the way to satisfy a soaring mid-Victorian demand for roof-slates. But the scheme left enduring monuments: the quarry itself; the wave-wall; the marvellous, ingenious, romanesque-windowed Ynysypandy slate mill, where gravity fed the blocks down to the cutting floor. After the quarry closed, before it was de-roofed in 1906, the mill was used for eisteddfodau, and for nonconformist meetings prior to the building of Saron Chapel nearby in the mid-1880s. The latter is now a sumptuous converted holiday-let. As for Ynysypandy’s “slate cathedral”, RH Tawney would have smiled at the fate of this symbol of religion and the decline of capitalism. Somehow I prefer the stilled wave of rock at the head of the cwm: its huge blocks and exquisite curve designed to protect the tramway from rocks falling from spoil-heaps above; to shore up the line of communication against destruction by the scheme’s own waste. I can’t imagine a contemporary version in plastic having quite the same resonant solidity and beauty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2018/mar/26/justin-bieber-spots-new-fashion-trend-pimples-are-in","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Justin Bieber spots a new fashion trend – pimples","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/mar/26/justin-bieber-spots-new-fashion-trend-pimples-are-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2018/mar/26/justin-bieber-spots-new-fashion-trend-pimples-are-in","fields":{"headline":"Justin Bieber spots a new fashion trend – pimples","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Pimples. Also known as: Acne. Appearance: Cool, according to Justin Bieber. Sorry, are we talking about the Swedish fashion brand Acne Studios? Nope. We’re talking about the skin disease, acne vulgaris. Oh. Great. I love talking about skin diseases. Come on, it’s just pimples! Even the great Bieber gets pimples, as he proved by pointing to several in an Instagram video labelled “Pimples are in”. That’s what the kids are reduced to now, is it? Videos of Bieber’s pimples. Oh, I don’t know. The video’s only been watched about 54,000 times. Still, acne can be very upsetting for people at the time in their lives when they care most about looking good. Maybe it’s comforting to think that Bieber knows how they feel? Ye-es. He seems pretty cheerful about it, to be honest. And I’ve watched closely, but it’s hard to see any actual pimples. Plus, of course, he’s very handsome to start with. But the point is he shares the pain of ordinary spotty teenagers. To the best of his ability, I guess. And the Beliebers seem as pleased with him as ever: “this world doesn’t deserve you &lt;3” says one comment, from “ik.maha”. How right ik is. We should send Bieber to Neptune. Good plan. I’ll call Elon Musk. But look. Enough fooling. Spots aren’t really cool, are they? I’m not sure. The Malaysian designer Moto Guo used models with acne to show off his collection a couple of years ago. Seriously? Seriously. I suppose having tons of zits is natural. And it does make you look young. Exactly. Bieber must be regretting his spell as a salesman for the anti-spot treatment Proactiv a few years back. Boy, is his face red! Or not red. Anyway, you know what I mean. I do. So how do I “get the look”? There’s very not much you can do, I’m afraid. Whether you get spots seems to be mostly a matter of the genes you inherit from your parents, and how young you are. But if I’m lucky enough to see a pustule starting, should I stop washing? Maybe start picking at it? Please don’t do those things. Hey, I have to suffer for my beauty. I wouldn’t bother, if I were you. I don’t think pimples will remain a fashion accessory for long. Why not? They don’t cost anything. And most young people have them already. Do say: “Oh, please. Pimples are so over. It’s all about blackheads this spring.” Don’t say: “I’ve got a wart.

The QF9 flight, which takes off on Saturday evening from the capital of Western Australia, is expected to take around 17 hours and 20 minutes – depending on winds – and will mark a historic aviation feat by completing the 9,000-mile (14,500km) route without a break. Qantas is using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner for what will be the first direct commercial passenger flight between the two nations. And with more efficient aircraft giving longer ranges, some believe it is merely the precursor to the ultimate goal of a non-stop journey between London and Sydney, a further 4½ hours east. For the inaugural flight – scheduled to touch down at Heathrow at around 5.05am on Sunday – Qantas has reduced the capacity of the plane to 236 business, premium economy and economy seats. It has also increased the leg room by an inch for the cheapest seats. At a launch event on Friday night, Alan Joyce, the airline’s CEO, said: “Qantas has been preparing for this moment for 98 years … (since) we were founded in 1921.” He said the old “kangaroo route” between Australia and the UK was once “seven stops and it took four days. But way back then it took 42 days by boat to travel to the UK. “And back then it cost you £525 to use the service. The equivalent of two and a half years of your salary today. Tomorrow they will do the flight in 17 hours and 20 minutes. No stops. It is a gamechanger for Australian aviation.” Qantas has teamed up with Sydney University’s Charles Perkins Centre in order to investigate alleviating jet lag using optimum lighting, different cabin pressure and dietary offerings, including the timings of the meals served during the lengthy flight. Peter Cistulli, professor of sleep medicine at the centre, says Qantas approached himabout improving sleep on planes and from there a project evolved that included nutrition and physical activity while traveling. “There has been a breakaway from the traditional formula where you get on an aeroplane, you get fed and watered and then at the other end you get fed and watered and there is this white space in the middle. Doing that on a 17-hour flight doesn’t make sense because you are going to leave people for a long time. He said lighting on the plane would “nudge the biological clock towards the destination timezone so it kick starts the process of readjusting your body clock.” The professor said there was no single magic bullet to fight jetlag, instead it required small things done collectively with no one size fits all for passengers. On the first flight, the centre is wiring up 10 passengers with medical-grade, Fit-Bit style monitors to measure sleep and physical activity. Another device will measure posture. Prof Cistulli hopes the data from the devices on this and subsequent flights will provide valuable information which could go some way to making long-distance air travel more bearable. But he says much more data is required. “The holy grail that we are heading towards is to capture information over a much longer period of time. That would include preflight (perhaps a week preflight), the entire flight and then possibly a week post-flight.” The statistics for the inaugural flight make interesting reading. It will travel at approximately 560mph (900kmh) and is expected to use 110,000 litres of fuel. Qantas says the 787 uses up to 20% less fuel than similar sized aircraft. Return economy flights will cost from £1,095."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/26/im-obsessed-with-mock-meat-and-im-not-even-a-vegetarian","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"I’m obsessed with mock meat and I’m not even a vegetarian | Rhik Samadder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/im-obsessed-with-mock-meat-and-im-not-even-a-vegetarian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/26/im-obsessed-with-mock-meat-and-im-not-even-a-vegetarian","fields":{"headline":"I’m obsessed with mock meat and I’m not even a vegetarian","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Facon, tofurkey, chickenless tenders – overly processed mock meats have always sounded like punchlines, ludicrously named meat tribute acts. They are essentially the Faux Fighters, Proxy Music and Rolling Clones of the food world. Received opinion holds that if you want meat so badly, you should just eat it. The weird thing is that I have been obsessed with mock meats for a long time. The weirder thing is that I am not even a vegetarian. For most people, nothing can be weirder than the textures of these oddities. How could they not be, predicated, as they are, on what they are not? But it is the creative ways around such incongruity I find compelling. I like food that answers a challenge. The milk I take in tea has been squeezed out of oats or rice. My childhood was consumed by a fascination about what was in crab sticks, because I knew it wasn’t crab (although it is fish). Later, I felt the same way about Quorn – until a few years ago, the company didn’t exactly shout about the fact that its product is made from mould and grown in vats. But to me, weird just means new and interesting. Weird is my jam. Vegan alternatives to meat and dairy products answer the biggest challenge of all. Can plant-based ingredients replicate the firm bite of meat, the creaminess of milk, the stretchy casein in cheese? Last month, the UK’s first “bleeding”, plant-based burger was launched, made by Moving Mountains. It is all kinds of succulent, and shows how far this sort of food has come. The juicy fibre comes from grinding up oyster mushroom cores, with the “blood” supplied by beetroot. It is extraordinary – I would say it achieves a 90% similarity to meat (while containing 100% of recommended daily amounts of B12, and no cholesterol). Its texture is a shade softer than beef, but since the aim of most meat dishes is high levels of tenderness, is that a failure? At the Spread Eagle in Homerton, London’s first vegan pub, I have eaten mushroom tail “scallops”, slow-poached in garlic oil for silkiness, a baja tofish burger wrapped in nori to impart seafood flavour, and a Mexican fried “chicken” burger made from seitan, the chewy wheat meat. At home, I use Rubies in the Rubble’s mayonnaise, which is made from chickpea water (also known as aquafaba, if you’re serving it at the ambassador’s reception). Most laugh-out-loud impressive is a plant-based egg, made from agal flour, derived from water-dwelling algae. Eggs made from flour made from algae! It may not be gold alchemised from base metal, but since I can’t scramble up base metal on sourdough, I’ll take it. The current wave of vegan alternatives demonstrates human ingenuity at its finest. It is liberating to be kinder to animals, while still desiring dirty great quarter-pounders slathered in cheese. (When I say cheese, I mean a cashew and nutritional yeast melt, obvs.) Whether my delight will encompass the future of meat analogues, grown from stem cells in a laboratory, I don’t know. Most consumers still consider today’s plant-based alternatives to be over-processed, Frankensteinian wannabes, neither fish nor flesh. I think that is a shame, not just for the planet but their sense of adventure. Not today, seitan, not today; but, hopefully, tomorrow. Sar Trek-style phasers and fascist ghosts: the US shows off its weapons toybox Easter is just around the corner, so a boy’s thoughts turn to wondering if the US Department of Defense has any plans. Looking at its publicly released documents is a hell of a treasure hunt – particularly over at the Non-Lethal Weapons Program, where they are working on some magical new toys. (It would be nice to imagine the programme was created to suppress the film Lethal Weapon, after Mel Gibson claimed in 2006 that Jews were responsible for all wars. But it wasn’t.) Flash-Bang and Thermal Discomfort Effects sound like post-punk icons, but they are even less fun. They are nicknames for “laser-induced plasma effects”. Such as the Ocular Interrupter System, being rolled out to marines in the next few months, a Star Trek-style phaser that can “visually suppress” targets more than 25km away. Or the long-range, millimetre-wave directed energy weapon that stimulates “nerve endings in the surface of the skin”. Watching a video of it, another way to put it would be “burns you with spontaneous fire”. Within three years, it will be possible to remotely create a hovering, glowing ball of electrically charged cloud that can issue intelligible commands. You know, like a fascist ghost. “I need three or four more kilohertz,” David Law, the technology division chief, has said. That doesn’t sound like much. Can’t they have a whip-round? If they are saying it is possible within three years, I reckon they can do it now. And the fact that this is all public information makes me certain that they have far worse toys in the chest that we know nothing about. A pair of shoes that is only attracted to landmines. A tangerine that, when you eat it, makes your nightmares real. Another series of The X-Files, ready to go. The truth is in there, and I’m not sure I can handle it. Fancy a walk along the HSBC (hole in the) Wall? The countryside’s most beautiful walking trails are prime for corporate branding, apparently. I thought they were “prime” for a lovely picnic. The step – suggested by Natural England, the government’s adviser on protecting the environment – would counteract the effect of funding cuts imposed by the government. Is there any way to reverse the erosion of ourselves, once the Pennine Way becomes Northern &amp; Shell Media Group Way, or the Hadrian’s Wall Path becomes an HSBC (hole in the) Wall? Private money has done such a good job on the trains, I can’t wait to see what it does to the trails."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/22/office-work-snowflakes-gig-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T14:52:29Z","webTitle":"Wanting to escape the office grind doesn’t make you a snowflake | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/office-work-snowflakes-gig-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/office-work-snowflakes-gig-economy","fields":{"headline":"Wanting to escape the office grind doesn’t make you a snowflake","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Younger adults are by now used to having their deficiencies highlighted in the newspapers. We are profligate, spoiled, and easily offended by racism, sexism or homophobia (making us “snowflakes”). We’ve annihilated everything from marriage to golf to napkins. And now, we have turned our seek-and-destroy Gorgon-esque gazes to offices. A Times column by Jenni Russell (paywall) raises the concern that the switch away from traditional office work towards the gig economy, freelancing and contract employment might be affecting our social skills. There are 53 million people doing freelance work in the US – 34% of the national workforce. In the UK there are 1.4 million freelancers, an increase of 14% in the past decade. The self-employed are the fastest-growing group in the EU labour market. That brings many problems – contract working and the gig economy have serious pitfalls. With flexibility can also come vulnerability. Such ways of working are ripe for exploitation, as the recent book Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain by James Bloodworth so powerfully illustrates. The Australian Council of Trade Unions came out this week in support of casual workers being given basic employment rights. Job instability, low pay and unfair dismissal are all rife. But Russell is unconcerned about all of this. Aside from arguing that a diverse office environment replete with proles is crucial to keep rich people from stagnating in their own bubbles (one interviewee says it teaches you not to “talk tactlessly to an assistant about designer clothes”), she also quotes a twentysomething whose freelance peers are lonely, isolated or arrogant. Offices, meanwhile, allow you to mix with people “you would never choose to know and who would never be your friends … you have to work out how to communicate to get what everyone needs, avoid conflict … treat everyone with respect”. Sounds like most comprehensive schools. Did you really need an office to teach you that? To centre the office, to proclaim it so vital despite the vast array of human social experience, seems absurdly middle class. Do bar staff and delivery drivers and factory workers and tattoo artists and shop assistants somehow lack social skills? Are things so work-oriented that we do not encounter people in other contexts – the post office, NCT childbirth classes, at the school gates? The office is not a world I inhabit much, so forgive me if I am getting it wrong. But most people I know who do work in offices do not like their jobs, and take part in a range of other social activities and obligations that bring them interaction with other people. Most of them would jump at the chance to work flexibly. As for the freelancers – well, having to hustle for work teaches you rather a lot about people. A 2014 study found that 87% of students with first- or second-class degrees found freelancing to be an attractive option. It’s time we asked ourselves why. Is office culture limited and tyrannical? I have found it so at times. A frequent complaint from my peers is that, as older generations live longer and retire later, there is less scope for promotion or development. When you feel stuck, unappreciated and underpaid, then striking out on your own is an attractive option. It also allows you to pursue other projects that may not pay, especially at the beginning. Some university classmates chose tutoring over the £12k salaries that were being offered to us on graduation; many Uber drivers I have met have a side hustle of some kind. One man had worked as a manager in an office in India for 40 years. He acknowledged that there were issues with Uber, but said he loved being able to drive around in the sunshine. As we all become more aware of our mental health, it makes sense that we are trying to find new ways of living. Human beings are happier when they have access to the outdoors, to light and to greenery. Flexible working gives us more time with our families. One study found that remote workers are happier than office-based workers. Not having your own boss reduces performance anxiety. I love being freelance, most of the time. A certain lack of stability is, to my mind, traded off for better mental health and more freedom (I could never have written a novel were I working full-time in an office). But I do think companies have a duty to not exploit their staff, and my mind may well change if or when my wage stagnates, I see the maternity provisions on offer, become unwell, or try to buy a place to live in. Decoupling our ideas about working from office culture can only be a good thing. But it throws up questions about the ethics of freelance and contract working that all companies, including the Guardian, must think hard about, not to mention the trade unions that should be protecting us. Those, not questions about social skills, are the real challenges ahead – and not just for workers, but also for employers. Because when you treat your staff badly, loyalty decreases. And just as it might be easier to sack a contractor, so is it easier for them to cut and run in search of a better opportunity. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/31/thomas-paine-jcd-clark-review-tory-radical-hero-common-sense-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"Thomas Paine by JCD Clark review – a High Tory on the radical hero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/31/thomas-paine-jcd-clark-review-tory-radical-hero-common-sense-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/31/thomas-paine-jcd-clark-review-tory-radical-hero-common-sense-review","fields":{"headline":"Thomas Paine by JCD Clark review – a High Tory on the radical hero","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"JCD Clark is the veteran enfant terrible of English historical writing; now in his mid-60s, but still all petted lip, provocation and attention-seeking. A High Tory, Anglo-Catholic Little Englander, he has spent his career assaulting the central categories of the Whig-Liberal and Marxist versions of the English past. Clark identifies several moments of putrefaction in English history, such as EEC membership in 1973 and the Great Reform Act of 1832. His Tory traditionalism reaches back further even than that of Jacob Rees-Mogg, the so-called “Honourable Member for the 18th Century”; for Clark thinks the rot set in earlier still, during the late 17th century, at the not-so-Glorious Revolution of 1688, when the country unforgivably abandoned the divine right of kings for the curdled compromises of parliamentary monarchy. Unsurprisingly, Clark has accumulated a few enemies among historians, and he is extraordinarily lucky that his latest book has fallen into the hands of such an indulgent reviewer. Clark is based at the University of Kansas, but he addresses the reader, in the preface to his new book on the celebrated radical Thomas Paine, from his summer residence at Callaly Castle, Northumberland. The in-your-face incongruity is almost certainly deliberate. Clark insists we view Paine the right way round, as an 18th-century deist critic of superstition and hereditary privilege. Indeed, he presents him as a semi-detached revolutionary who never quite got to grips with America in the 1770s or France in the 1790s, and whose ideas derived largely from the England of his youth, decades before the age of the Atlantic revolutions. Paine was born in Thetford, Norfolk, in 1737, the son of a Quaker father and Anglican mother. Clark dismisses the notion that Paine’s oppositional outlook owed much, if anything, to Quakerism, or to Protestant dissent more generally. Rather, he insists, Paine was a deist of an Anglican type, a free-thinking Anglican who came to rebel against revealed biblical Christianity, but continued to endorse the existence of God. Such figures were a prominent feature of English culture between the 1690s and 1730s. Denuded of the anachronistic foliage with which he comes garlanded, Clark’s Paine is “a retro-deist, not a proto-socialist”. Nor was he ever an atheist or a secularist, though his religion veered from the tactical use of scripture in Common Sense (1776) to outright scoffing at the Bible in The Age of Reason (1794). As Clark notes, Paine’s political theory presupposed the existence of a creator. He argued for equality on theological grounds and conceived natural rights as “divine gifts”. Deism, argues Clark, underpinned Paine’s critique of the hereditary principle. He favoured a “moral corrective”, but was no prophet of wholesale “social transformation”. There is no denying Clark’s erudition, and the first third or so of this book is ingenious and enthralling. He is at his best when he sets Paine’s politics in the peculiar context of the mid-18th century, when the central determinant of English political alignments was whether one took a Whiggish or Tory-Jacobite line on the events of 1688, when James II had been forced to abdicate. Paine, Clark contends, belongs to a culture of partisan dealignment, an age, for example, when Tories and dissident Whigs coalesced under the aegis of Bolingbroke’s ideas of “patriot kingship”. Clark traces various “pathways” by which figures from high church Tory-Jacobite backgrounds – including the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham and the sceptic Edward Gibbon – alighted on new idioms with which to express their estrangement from conventional Whiggish norms. Paine was, of course, not a Jacobite, but came under the influence of a disciple of Bolingbroke’s deistical Toryism, and his dislike of kingship took on pronounced anti-Hanoverian hues. Paine’s contribution to the American revolution comes into focus less as a creative contribution to republican ideas than as a rather different brand of anti-monarchical negativity. Clark’s mission – mischievously parodying the socialist historian EP Thompson – is to rescue Paine “from the enormous approbation of posterity”. Clark asks us to distinguish clearly the “usable Paines” so freely appropriated by later radical movements from the very different “historic Paine”, whose ideas are more often celebrated than carefully parsed. Much of this is sensible. It is sometimes difficult, however, for readers to distinguish between new insights and stale truisms repackaged as clarifications of points never seriously at issue. He treats history polemically, delivering an unvarying sequence of penalty kicks against the supposed assumptions of radical historiography. But he is often shooting at an open, undefended goal. Which serious historian thinks Paine was a socialist, a cosmopolitan champion of the Enlightenment, a proponent of women’s emancipation or opponent of slavery? Clark’s is a sawdust revisionism: so many of his targets are straw men and Aunt Sallies. Eventually the dull, repetitive thud of his sledgehammer becomes tiresome. The fascinating early sections on England apart, this is a laboured project.

In a House of 594 Members, who were assembled on this extraordinary occasion, there were 355 for the third reading, and 239 against it, leaving a majority of 116. This number gives, proportion to the Members present, a result precisely the same as that of last year on the former Bill. Surprise has been expressed by some of the friends of Reform that the majority was not greater. Exultation has been manifested by the opponents of the Bill that it was still so small. We apprehend that there is little reason for the indulgence of either feeling. From the composition of the original Minority, and the motives they had for union and perseverance, no hopes could be rationally entertained that their numbers would be much lessened by chance, or change, in a contest for political existence; and the still nicely balanced proportions on the division must therefore be looked at as an indication that there has been none of that re-action which has been so confidently asserted, but that, on the contrary, the advocates of Reform have retained their convictions of the necessity of the course they adopted, and steadily and resolutely pursued it. All interested are now concentrated on the debate on the second reading in the House of Lords.

That would be Sven, the reindeer. Sven doesn’t speak. He doesn’t sing. If we’re being honest, he could use a haircut. But when he lumbers limberly across the stage, courtesy of the dancer Andrew Pirozzi, he is pure theatre and pure magic. His scenes are some of the few moments when Frozen, adapted from the 2013 Disney hit, the highest-grossing animated movie of all time, seems not just translated to the stage, but transformed by and for it. Broadway’s Frozen is a good show. With its music, its dance, its flurry of likable leads, and snowball after snowball of son and lumière, some of it newfangled, some of it stretching back to 19th-century melodrama, it offers most of the pleasures that we count on Broadway musicals to provide. But even with the addition of a dozen new songs by the composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, an enhanced book by Jennifer Lee, and the interventions of director Michael Grandage and scenic and costume designer Christopher Oram, it rarely feels like more than the movie and sometimes it feels like less. The story is more or less the same. Elsa and Anna, princesses of fairytale Arendelle, are bed-bouncing childhood besties until Elsa’s magical superstorm powers separate them. Elsa conceals those powers until her coronation, when an emotional outburst accidentally plunges the kingdom into nonstop blizzard conditions. So plucky Anna (Patti Murin), helped by ice-seller Kristoff (Jelani Alladin) and his shaggy friend Sven, sets off to find Elsa (Caissie Levy) and rescue Arendelle before the kingdom runs out of glugg. Frozen, like the recent Moana, isn’t a love story. Or rather it is a love story, but the love is sororal, not romantic. It’s about two women finding their place in the world – Elsa’s culminating outfit is a sparkly white pantsuit – but even acknowledging the immense charm of Murin and the stateliness of Levy, this Elsa and Anna feel less like real women and more like storyboards with great wigs. Anna is giddy and impulsive, Elsa closed off to the point of pathology. That’s it. Musical theater places a greater emphasis on character than most works of animation, even sophisticated works like the Frozen film, so while it seems at least a little wrongheaded to ask a show based on a cartoon for more interiority, more dimensionality, that’s what’s needed. Part of the problem is that the women aren’t given all that much to do. The central action is a quest narrative, but it’s a quest that’s easily accomplished. Anna climbs a mountain in search of Elsa; Elsa descends it to find Anna. They don’t encounter much in the way of obstacles – no wolves here, no snow monster, one friendly bunraku-style snowman – and when they do gain a boon it’s pretty much by accident. Without the gorgeous distractions of computer animation, the story feels thin. The new songs are capable and one of them, Monster, sung by Levy, neatly transfers Elsa from one psychological state to another, but none of them stick with the tongue-to-frozen-flagpole ferocity of Let It Go or Love Is an Open Door or even Do You Want to Build a Snowman. The uptempo duet between Anna and Kristoff, You Don’t Know About Love, just isn’t as compelling as her earlier duet with Hans (a clever John Riddle). The other number devoted to the pair, Fixer Upper, has been reassigned to the hidden folk, based on the Scandinavian Huldufólk, and it is way too giddy for them. If you’re going to go to all of the trouble to embed the Broadway version with figures from actual Nordic mythology, why freight them with such a goofball song? None of this seemed to rattle the legions of little girls in the audience who had dressed as Elsa or the few who had come as Anna. (No Svens. Yet.) Frozen could be more inventive, more imaginative, more vital, more necessary. But as those little girls would almost certainly say, let it go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/22/the-fiver-wales-china-gareth-bale","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T15:56:38Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Finally, after all these years, a chance to fulfil our dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/22/the-fiver-wales-china-gareth-bale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/22/the-fiver-wales-china-gareth-bale","fields":{"headline":"Finally, after all these years, a chance to fulfil our dream","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"CHINA CRISIS Obvious timing issues mean The Fiver doesn’t get the opportunity to report on actual football all that often – basically we’ve been a clanking empty vessel since 1998 – but on Thursday Wales played China in a match that kicked off at 11.35am our time. Finally, after all these years, a chance to fulfil our dream of becoming an old-school match reporter! In preparation, The Fiver excitedly compiled a dossier of Ryan Giggs’s first squad, studied the tactical set-up of Marcello Lippi’s side, pulled on an unwashed corduroy jacket, smeared grease in our hair and egg down the front of our string vest, stayed up half the night getting into spats with other journalists and trying to get the attention of minor celebrities on assorted social media disgraces, lost consciousness face down in a half-eaten kebab, and woke up with a start at 1.35pm having slept through the entire thing. Bah! Much the same as any other day then, give or take. But once again may we exclaim: bah! And: wah! Because it seems we missed quite the show. According to his new boss, Gareth Bale had been treated “like a god” upon his arrival in Nanning, Guangxi, scenes reminiscent of the time “Becks came into the Manchester United team”. Happy memories for Giggsy, then, and more were made in short order as Bale took all of a couple of minutes to saunter his way through the China defence and flick a precise shot into the net while falling backwards, yawning. He made it two soon after, as China were repeatedly overrun in midfield, the hosts unable to deal with the incessant Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogochenpress. Sam Vokes added a third on 37 minutes, before Harry Wilson became the latest nipper from the Liverpool academy to score a blinder on his birthday, rendering Ben Woodburn old hat just before half-time. The second half was a comparative non-event, with Wales scoring just a couple more en route to an easy 6-0 victory. Vokes got his second, while Bale completed his hat-trick, becoming the all-time leading scorer for Wales in doing so. His 29th goal for his country nudges him one ahead of Ian Rush on the charts, and six clear of Trevor Ford and Ivor Allchurch. “I never dreamed of being a record breaker for Wales and it’s one of the best things I’ve achieved in my career,” Bale smiled modestly after the game. “It’s great individually to get the record, but it’s more important to give the manager a great start. Everyone wants to impress him and we have to keep building on it.” They’ll get the chance to do exactly that on Monday in the China Cup final against either Uruguay or the Czech Republic, but not of course at the Ethics World Cup. Which is a shame, but then Russia are going to win that anyway. Or at least The Fiver hopes so, mainly because we’d quite like to see the expression on Boris Johnson’s face.

An art exhibition opening this week will celebrate the dockyard’s history. It features a Tracey Emin neon piece spelling out the haunting words She Lay Down Deep Beneath the Sea, which shines out near the spectacularly illustrated book of poems written by a 19th-century sailor, John Tilling. In December 1864 he witnessed the destruction of HMS Bombay when it caught fire during target practice off the coast of Uruguay. He wrote desolately: “Ninety three of that brave crew sleep in the mighty deep.” “I didn’t just want beautiful noble pictures of ships – and to me these both speak of all the lost souls at sea,” the exhibition curator, Jean Wainwright, said. The exhibition includes encounters between famous names such as JMW Turner and John Constable, contemporary artists Catherine Yass, Langlands &amp; Bell and Yinka Shonibare, and amateur artists, often sailors. A bird’s eye view of the Medway at Chatham, from the dockyard’s own collection, was painted in the 19th century by a Dr Turner, who must have had an attic view in the town, but about whom nothing else is known, not even his first name. He would probably be surprised to find his painting now hanging beside a spectacular work by his rather more famous namesake, JMW Turner, a study for The Fighting Temeraire, on loan from the Tate, in which the ship being towed to a breaker’s yard is just a ghostly grey mist over the river. A scale model of Shonibare’s ship in a bottle, Nelson’s flagship Victory which occupied the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2010, has been placed beside another Turner, of the ship coming up the Thames carrying Nelson’s body after his death at Trafalgar. The earliest image in the exhibition, a 17th-century view on loan from the British Library, shows the fortified dockyard with houses scattered outside the walls. The Kent town grew around it as the dockyard expanded in the 19th century, at its height employing 14,000 people. “The same families had worked here for generations. When it finally closed in 1984 it tore the heart out of the town, and it left a legacy of bitterness,” said Alex Patterson, the visitor experience manager who has been working on the exhibition for a year. “This exhibition is about celebrating its history, the creativity it has inspired, and rebuilding those relationships with the town and the region.” Admiral Sir Trevor Soar, now chair of the dockyard, said: “The closure was a political decision.” Soar commanded the last vessel built for the navy in 1966, the submarine Ocelot, which is now back in the dry dock where she was built as part of the museum collection. The contemporary works include Yass’s lightbox views of the giant iron bridge piers in the heart of London, which once carried the railway line to Chatham. The artists follow the course of the river down to the muddy sandbanks and creeks of the Medway recorded in huge glowing photographs by Nadav Kander. There are six in the exhibition, although Wainwright only intended to borrow three – “couldn’t resist them when I saw them. I had to have more.” Kander thinks there are now 30 in the series, which he is still working on. “I have to wait for the right weather, misty murky weather, that’s what I like,” he said. “The Medway is quite a boring river in many ways, but its history is extraordinary.” Powerful Tides: 400 Years of Chatham and the Sea, the Historic Dockyard Chatham, 23 March – 17 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/25/requiem-pour-l-bernstein-centenary-observer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"The week in dance: Requiem pour L; Bernstein Centenary – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/25/requiem-pour-l-bernstein-centenary-observer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/25/requiem-pour-l-bernstein-centenary-observer-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in dance: Requiem pour L; Bernstein Centenary – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In Requiem pour L, choreographer Alain Platel and composer Fabrizio Cassol present a 15-strong ensemble of musicians and singers who perform a new version of Mozart’s Requiem while slow-motion footage of a woman dying is projected on a screen behind them. Platel, who is Belgian, is a veteran of more than three decades of often controversial productions. He and Cassol are long-time collaborators, and Requiem pour L came about after Cassol attended a funeral in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Around the same time, in Europe, Platel met a woman who knew that she was dying, and who agreed, as he explains in a pre-show talk, “that we could film her death, and use it in performance”. Cassol’s contribution is magisterial. His Requiem, conducted by the Congolese artist-musician Rodriguez Vangama, combines a vast array of influences, among which Cassol cites the Pygmy, Indian and Malian traditions. It brings together operatic, polyphonic and choral singing, Latin and African texts, and virtuoso accordion, electric guitar, euphonium, likembe (thumb piano) and percussion. The singers and instrumentalists, all male except for opera singer Nobulumko Mngxekeza, are also compelling movers. At intervals they break into dance, stepping and shimmying with liquid hips and shoulders and fluttery convolutions of arm and wrist. All of this is joyous. And there’s nothing intrinsically wrong about the recording and screening of a person’s death, as a number of TV documentaries have demonstrated. But in this context, watching a stranger dying in carefully framed closeup feels intrusive, and the longer it goes on (the piece lasts an hour and 40 minutes, without an interval), the more troubling it feels. That the footage is shown in slow-motion makes things even more complicated. Instead of being a dispassionate record of L’s death, the film becomes a manipulated artwork, something altogether more ambiguous. By positioning the footage as the centrepiece of Requiem pour L, Platel is imbuing the piece with a poignancy and gravitas of which he is not the author. He’s hitching a ride, artistically speaking, on someone else’s tragedy. Earlier in the week I watched Ruben Östlund’s The Square, a Swedish film about an art world whose denizens are so numbed by fashionably transgressive posturing that they are barely capable of moral orientation. Conceptual dance hasn’t yet fallen down that rabbit hole, but it’s where you end up when artists consider themselves exempt from consequence by virtue of their status. Platel freely acknowledges that there are ethical issues surrounding the inclusion of the death footage in Requiem pour L, but it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that this is a project motivated, at least in part, by his desire to be seen as a boundary-breaker. “We wanted to try. To see how far we could go,” Platel says. “The whole thing had to be enormous.” He’s thrilled with the result. “It’s devastating… And now I ask myself, what do I want to do with the rest of my life?” Last week, the Royal Ballet opened its Bernstein Centenary programme, a triple bill, including two premieres, set to work by Leonard Bernstein (1918-90). First on the bill was Wayne McGregor’s Yugen, set to Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms, commissioned in 1965 by the dean of Chichester Cathedral. It’s a huge composition, but McGregor’s dance is restrained. Eleven dancers move through a series of encounters that trace the course of the music, demonstrate its architecture, and make clear that McGregor’s is a secular rather than a religious response. Where the voice of solo treble William Davies soars, as if to cathedral vaults, we see cursive body lines inscribed against the air by Calvin Richardson. In place of foliate columns and stone tracery, McGregor gives us quietly ecstatic arcs described by Sarah Lamb in a duet with Federico Bonelli, and Richardson’s calm ascent as he’s carried by five male colleagues. Yugen is not quite balletic; arm movements come from the shoulder rather than the back, and there’s little sense of spiralling torsion or épaulement. But it’s fascinating to watch the evolving stylistic negotiation between McGregor and the Royal’s dancers. The evening’s other works are Liam Scarlett’s strongly danced but conceptually baffling The Age of Anxiety, created in 2014, and Christopher Wheeldon’s Corybantic Games. The latter, as exquisitely crafted as it is weightless, infuses a pastoral Arcadian landscape, replete with sapphic interludes (Yasmine Naghdi, Beatriz Stix-Brunell), with a gym-bunny aesthetic embodied with commanding, you-go-girl sexiness by Tierney Heap. Matthew Ball and William Bracewell also dally to fine aesthetic effect. Champagne, but not quite vintage.

New figures from Cancer Research UK (CRUK) show that more than 2,500 cancer cases a week are avoidable, with exposure to tobacco smoke the leading factor, accounting for just over 15% of cancer cases. “Lung cancer contributes well over half of those smoking-related cases, but there are also thousands of cancers of smoking-related bladder, oesophageal and bowel cancers every year to name just a few,” said Dr Katrina Brown, lead author of the study at CRUK. While the researchers say that smoking rates in the UK are falling by about 1% a year, they flagged growing concerns about the nation’s expanding waistline, with excess weight the second leading preventable cause of cancer, accounting for 6.3% of cancer cases. The team said they hoped the government would learn from the success of measures such as advertising restrictions, tobacco taxes and standardised packaging in cutting smoking rates, and called for a 9pm watershed for junk food adverts and for food manufacturers to come up with new recipes to reduce salt, sugar and fat in products. However, the team said a shift in public attitudes was also necessary, warning that obesity had the potential to become “the new smoking”. “People regard being large as increasingly normal, and that is a shift in social norms and acceptability,” said Prof Linda Bauld, who works on behavioural research for cancer prevention at CRUK. “We need to get back down to what is the normal while recognising the challenges individuals face.” While a recent campaign by CRUK highlighting the link between obesity and cancer was met with anger by some who accused the charity of fat-shaming, Bauld said the charity had a duty to increase awareness, noting that just 15% of adults in the UK recognised the connection between obesity and cancer. The team say that while cancer survival is improving, the rate of new cancer cases in the UK has risen by 7% over the past decade, after taking into account the ageing population and population growth, and is expected to continue to increase by about 2% every year, making prevention important. The new research, published in the British Journal of Cancer, is based on a number of sources, including national surveys, cancer registries and analyses of data from scientific papers. The results reveal that drinking alcohol, having a low-fibre diet and infections such as HPV each account for just over 3% of cancer cases, with exposure to substances at work, such as asbestos, and UV radiation each causing almost 4% of cancer cases. Air pollution, eating processed meat, not breastfeeding and exposure to radiation such as radon gas each accounted for less than 2% of cancer cases. The figures took into account overlap between the different aspects of lifestyle, and only included definite causes of cancers. “What we are talking about here is at the population level: what we can’t do is say for any individual person what their risk is,” said Sir Harpal Kumar, chief executive for CRUK. “We can’t for example say if you don’t smoke you won’t get cancer, neither can we say if you do smoke you will get cancer, because these things are affected by other factors.” The team note that the proportion of preventable cases of cancer varies between the four nations within the UK, with 41.5% of cancers avoidable in Scotland, compared to 37.3% in England – a difference Brown put down to socioeconomic factors affecting lifestyles. Overall the proportion of avoidable cancer cases was slightly higher in men than women, probably due to higher levels of lifestyle factors such as smoking in men. However, some, such as excess weight and alcohol, were responsible for a greater proportion of cancers for women – probably because the cancers involved primarily affect women. The percentage of cancer cases attributed to excess body weight, 6.3%, had risen from 5% as calculated in the charity’s previous report on the topic in 2011, a change that researchers say is down an increase in obesity and a rise in the number of types of cancer known to be linked to being overweight or obese. Excess weight is now linked to 13 cancers, among them cancer of the breast, kidney, bowel and womb.The study had some limitations, including that survey data based on self-reports can be prone to error and that some of the data used was several years old. But Kumar said action was vital: “A lot of these behaviours start quite early, and that is where we need to think about addressing them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/china-us-sanctions-trade-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T17:42:47Z","webTitle":"US imposes sanctions on China, stoking fears of trade war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/china-us-sanctions-trade-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/china-us-sanctions-trade-war","fields":{"headline":"US imposes sanctions on China, stoking fears of trade war","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fears of a trade war heightened on Thursday as the Trump administration slapped trade sanctions on China, including restrictions on investment and tariffs on $60bn worth of products. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Beijing would “take all legal measures to protect our interest” if the US took “actions that will harm both China and itself”. The US announcement marked the end of a seven-month investigation into tactics China has used to challenge American supremacy in technology, including hacking commercial secrets and demanding US companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Speaking at the White House, Donald Trump said the imposition of tariffs was part of an effort for fairness, noting that China imposes a 25% tariff on US cars while the US only has a 2.5% duty on Chinese cars. “They charge us, we charge the same thing,” said Trump. White House aide Peter Navarro told reporters on a conference call: “Administrations before us and this administration have tried to work with the Chinese but with the Chinese talk is not cheap, it’s very expensive. Finally the president decided we needed to move forward.” He said the US was “strategically defending itself [from] … economic aggression”. The Trump administration argues that years of negotiations have failed to produce results. Dozens of industry groups, however, sent a letter to the president warning that “the imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the US economy, provoking retaliation; stifling US agriculture, goods, and services exports; and raising costs for businesses and consumers”. US stock markets reacted negatively, with the Dow closing more than 700 points down on fears of a US trade war Caterpillar, 3M and Boeing – all with significant exposure to China – were among the biggest fallers. Fears of a trade war between the two biggest economies in the world were also reflected in the bond market, with US 10-year treasury bonds posting their biggest one-day drop in yields since September. Bank and tech stocks also fell. Facebook was down almost 3% on top of an 8.5% fall over the first three days of the week. “The biggest thing is the unknown about what the Chinese are going to do in response,” said Ian Winer, a securities analyst at Wedbush. “The tariffs were not worse than what people were expecting, but based on the industries they are going to slap the tariffs on, you’re going to see some reciprocal action from Beijing. If that’s the case there are a lot of global companies that could potentially hurt.” But, Winer added, concern over a US-China trade dispute will hinge on inflationary pressures on consumer prices. “That’s the bigger issue. If China does something, and all of a sudden stuff that people are buying in Walmart and other places costs more, that’s not what the economy needs right now.” But US-China policy experts also cast doubt on the likelihood of an all-out trade war. “The Chinese will likely react moderately to this,” said Dennis Wilder, a Bush administration Asia policy adviser at the National Security Council. China, he said, understand this is related to American domestic politics and would not want to anger the US into further action. “An over-reaction to this would be a foolish move on the part of Beijing,” Wilder added. “The Chinese will feel they have the moral high-ground since the US is operating outside of the WTO system and the administration has not co-ordinated with other countries.” He added: “Any retaliatory measures are likely to be on the red state side to go after the president’s core constituency, with agriculture at the top of the list.” On Thursday Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, said imports of US soya beans, airplanes, cotton and cars could be viewed as examples of “unequal” trade. The US also “refuses to export what China wants”, Hua said, possibly referring to restrictions on technology and military sales. “We are firmly against unilateralism and protectionism,” Hua said. “China will not watch our legal interest being harmed. China will take all legal measures to protect our interest. We hope the US can understand the core of mutual benefits, do not take actions that will harm both China and itself.” Trump’s move comes as the US prepares to impose tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, sanctions that are meant to hit China. The US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said on Thursday that Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea would for now be exempt. Trump campaigned on promises to bring down America’s trade deficit – $566bn last year – by rewriting agreements and cracking down on what he called abusive practices. In January, he imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Then he unveiled the steel and aluminium tariffs, saying reliance on imported metals jeopardised US national security. To target China, Trump has dusted off a cold war weapon: section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, which lets the president unilaterally impose tariffs. It was meant for a world in which much commerce was not covered by trade agreements. With the arrival in 1995 of the World Trade Organization, it fell largely into disuse. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, this week urged Washington to act “rationally” and promised to open China to more foreign products and investment. Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said: “China has been trying to cool things down for weeks. They have offered concessions. Nothing seems to cool the fire. I fear they will take a hard line now that their efforts have been rebuffed … China cannot appear subservient to the US.” Hua said China hoped “that two sides can sit and talk calmly. On the principle of equality and mutual respect, we seek ways to guarantee mutual benefits through constructive dialogues and discussion.” But she said: “China will not just sit and watch its legal interest be harmed. China will take all necessary measures to uphold its interest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/mondays-best-tv-the-queen-her-commonwealth-story-marcella","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: The Queen: Her Commonwealth Story; Marcella","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/mondays-best-tv-the-queen-her-commonwealth-story-marcella","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/mondays-best-tv-the-queen-her-commonwealth-story-marcella","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: The Queen: Her Commonwealth Story; Marcella","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Queen: Her Commonwealth Story 9pm, BBC One Next month leaders from the 53 nations of the Commonwealth will assemble in London for a pre-Brexit exchange of views.

Sterling rose on foreign exchanges on news that Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders had backed a quarter-point rise in the bank rate to 0.75%. While the other seven members of the MPC voted to leave rates unchanged, the tone of the minutes of this week’s meeting left the City convinced that an upward move was on the way. Although the economy grew by a modest 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, the MPC said there was a chance activity in late 2017 would be revised higher and signalled concern about rising earnings growth. “The unemployment rate remained low in the three months to January. The firming of shorter-term measures of wage growth in recent quarters and a range of survey indicators suggest pay growth will rise further in response to the tightening labour market,” the MPC said. The minutes added that the view of the MPC had not changed since last month, when the Bank used its quarterly inflation report to say that the prospect of excess demand meant interest rates would need to rise in order to keep the annual inflation rate sustainably close to its 2% target. The seven MPC members voting for no change said May – when the Bank publishes its next quarterly economic health check – would be the right time to assess the extent of domestic inflationary pressure. A majority of the committee said little had changed since its February meeting and adopted a wait-and-see approach. McCafferty and Saunders said there was “widespread evidence” that spare capacity in the economy was largely used up and that pay growth was on the increase, presenting upside risks to inflation. According to the minutes, the duo said “a modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks from a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt change in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/23/mps-demand-tougher-rules-on-night-flights-for-heathrow-upgrade","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T06:01:46Z","webTitle":"MPs demand tougher rules on night flights for Heathrow upgrade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/mps-demand-tougher-rules-on-night-flights-for-heathrow-upgrade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/mps-demand-tougher-rules-on-night-flights-for-heathrow-upgrade","fields":{"headline":"MPs demand tougher rules on night flights for Heathrow upgrade","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tougher rules on night flights and keeping costs to passengers down are needed before parliament should approve Heathrow’s third runway, MPs have told the government. The transport select committee said it believed the London hub airport’s expansion scheme should go ahead, but only after the government addressed numerous concerns over its environmental impact. The MPs demanded more stringent safeguards on noise and air quality, as well as assurances that the cost of development would not be passed on in higher charges, which could mean higher air fares. They proposed a minimum average of seven hours respite each night for local residents under flight paths, and increased funds to insulate their houses from noise. Their report also called for more detail and guarantees over domestic flight connections from an expanded Heathrow – a key pledge in winning support nationwide, but which has attracted scepticism from airlines and opponents. The committee has been scrutinising a draft national policy statement (NPS) on aviation, which will be voted on by parliament this summer. If approved, it would in effect give outline planning permission for a third runway at Heathrow. Despite hearing evidence that the economic benefits described in the Airports Commission report had been greatly revised down by the Department for Transport – to the point where a runway at Gatwick was rated more highly on several measures – the committee accepted that expansion at Heathrow would “deliver strategic objectives for greater connectivity for passengers and freight”. But the MPs said, despite pledges by the government and Heathrow to mitigate the impacts of expansion at Heathrow, additional safeguards were needed in the policy statement going before parliament. Committee chair Lilian Greenwood said the recommendations would improve the policy and reduce the chances of a successful legal challenge, which councils and environmental groups are expected to launch. She said: “At present, the draft NPS does not guarantee that passengers will be protected from the cost risks associated with the scheme. The secretary of state must set out how airport charges will be held down.” She added: “Thousands of people across London could be exposed to worse levels of noise, air quality and traffic congestion – there must be sufficient measures to protect or compensate them.” John Stewart, chair of campaign group HACAN, said: “Although disappointed the committee didn’t reject the third runway, we welcome the tougher environmental conditions which it has recommended. In particular we welcome its recommended seven-hour night flight ban.” Currently there is a ban on scheduled night flights from 11.30pm until 4.30am, which the government has proposed extending to six and a half hours. Heathrow’s third runway scheme was recommended by the Airports Commission in 2015 and given government approval in December 2016. The airport has since been working to reduce the cost of the project, which the commission estimated at £17.6bn, to £14.3bn, and to allay airline fears that charges would rise steeply to pay for new infrastructure. A Heathrow spokesperson said: “This report couldn’t be clearer – Heathrow is the right answer for the UK and parliament should green-light the policy for Heathrow expansion and allow the project to move into the planning phase. “We are also clear that we will deliver an expanded Heathrow that is sustainable, affordable and financeable and maintains Britain’s position as a global trading powerhouse.” Opponents have warned that the public is not being fully informed about the wider costs of the scheme, which, according to Transport for London, will require at least an additional £10bn of spending on surrounding rail and road infrastructure. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said the report was very clear that a third runway at Heathrow was the best option for delivering more airport capacity. “Expansion will only proceed if it meets strict environmental obligations and offers a world-class package of compensation and mitigations for local communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/22/gay-hospital-chaplain-loses-discrimination-appeal-against-c-of-e","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T12:41:50Z","webTitle":"Gay hospital chaplain loses discrimination appeal against C of E","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/gay-hospital-chaplain-loses-discrimination-appeal-against-c-of-e","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/22/gay-hospital-chaplain-loses-discrimination-appeal-against-c-of-e","fields":{"headline":"Gay hospital chaplain loses discrimination appeal against C of E","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A gay clergyman who was prevented by the Church of England from taking up a job in the NHS as a hospital chaplain after he married his partner has lost his case against discrimination. Canon Jeremy Pemberton, who has been a priest for more than 30 years, went to the court of appeal to challenge earlier rulings against him. It rejected his claim, saying the church had applied “its sincerely held beliefs in a way expressly permitted by … the Equality Act”. Lord Justice Underhill said he could understand Pemberton’s feeling but “if you belong to an institution with known and lawful rules, it implies no violation of dignity and it is not cause for reasonable offence that those rules should be applied to you, however wrong you may believe them to be.” Pemberton’s “permission to officiate” – a licence needed by all clergy to work as priests and chaplains – was revoked after he married his partner in 2014. He was denied permission to officiate in another diocese by its then acting bishop, Richard Inwood, leaving him unable to take up a job offer at the King’s Mill hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. At an employment tribunal and an employment appeals tribunal, Pemberton claimed Inwood, who was then acting bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, had discriminated against him. During a two-day appeal hearing in January, Pemberton’s lawyers argued that the earlier rulings should be overturned. The C of E allows priests to be in gay relationships and civil partnerships as long as the relationship is celibate, but they are forbidden from marrying their partners. In a statement following the appeal court’s ruling, Pemberton said he had reached an agreement with the church not to pursue his claim further and the church would not apply for costs to be awarded against him. He said: “The C of E has established through this process that it can continue to discriminate legally against some LGBT people in relation to their employment, even where that employment is not within the boundaries of the church’s jurisdiction. This will seem to most people in the UK today an extraordinary result, and not one that will help commend the claims of Christ to the nation. “An official position that regards the loves and commitments of LGBT people, including clergy, as sinful by definition is years overdue for thoroughgoing revision. The need for a revolution in attitudes and practices in the church towards this minority is still acute. We continue to wait for real change.” Pemberton said he hoped to be allowed to return to active ministry in the future, but his permission to officiate was “in the hands of and at the will of individual bishops”. A spokesperson for the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham welcomed the court’s ruling and said: “We recognise that this has been a long and difficult process for many of those concerned, and we hold them in our thoughts and prayers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/22/contract-to-print-uk-passports-abroad-will-save-120m","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T14:01:27Z","webTitle":"New blue UK passports will be £120m cheaper if made in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/22/contract-to-print-uk-passports-abroad-will-save-120m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/22/contract-to-print-uk-passports-abroad-will-save-120m","fields":{"headline":"New blue UK passports will be £120m cheaper if made in Europe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The decision to award the contract to print Britain’s blue passports to an overseas firm is in effect final, the government has said, as Theresa May faced pressure to intervene over what critics have called a humiliating symbol of the post-Brexit future. Brexiters reacted with anger to the news that the job will not go to Britain’s De La Rue, but has instead been awarded to Franco–Dutch firm Gemalto. De La Rue’s chief executive has called on ministers to think again. The Home Office said the decision to pick a preferred bidder in the tender would save taxpayers about £120m over the five years of the contract. A spokesman said: “The preferred bidder has been selected following a rigorous, fair and open competition and all bidders were notified of the outcome last night. “The chosen company demonstrated that they will be best able to meet the needs of our passport service with a high quality and secure product at the best value for money for our customers and the taxpayer.” The spokesman added that since 2009 UK passports could be manufactured overseas, and that this was the case for up to 20% of the current burgundy versions. While Gemalto has not been formally named as the winning company, the Home Office said the choice of contractor would lead to the creation of about 70 jobs at Fareham in Hampshire and Heywood in Lancashire. One of Gemalto’s five current UK outposts is in Fareham. Downing Street had said the final decision would not be made for several weeks. But May’s spokesman said later the preferred bidder had been picked, and would be named following a 10-day “standstill process”, in place for legal reasons. News of the decision was greeted with anger by Brexit-minded Tory MPs. Priti Patel called it “a national humiliation”, while Bill Cash, the chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, called it “symbolically completely wrong”. Liz Twist, the MP for Blaydon, whose constituency includes De La Rue’s Gateshead factory, said she hoped the home secretary, Amber Rudd, would meet her to discuss the situation. She said: “At a time of heightened international security concerns, it is downright ludicrous to think that our new passports will be produced abroad. After months of talk about the return to blue British passports, the irony of this decision isn’t lost on me or my constituents.” Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, sought to blame EU regulations on procurement. He told a Westminster reporters’ lunch: “There is an irony, which is these rules are European rules and we are going to be leaving the European Union and then we may be able to – if we choose to – set out our own procurement rules.” May’s spokesman said World Trade Organisation rules also covered the same area but argued that Brexit should nonetheless bring more flexibility. “What we have is a process we put out to tender,” he said. “We want to follow the correct process – that’s the right thing to do. That’s what we’re doing here. When we leave the EU we will have more power over setting our own procurement rules, but we will still follow a formal process.” Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union, tweeted that the government should not “attempt to hide behind EU procurement rules”. The official statements appear to dash the hopes of De La Rue seeing the decision overturned. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, its chief executive, Martin Sutherland, said May or Rudd, should “come to my factory and explain to my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon”. He said he would appeal against the decision, and he refused to guarantee that no jobs would be lost at the Gateshead factory the firm uses to produce the current burgundy EU version. Sutherland acknowledged that his company had been beaten on price in an open competition, but he said that was unfair. He said that in France, as a foreign-based firm, De La Rue would be barred from bidding to produce the French passport. French passports are made by Imprimerie Nationale, the state-run French printing organisation, with the French government having made the decision not to put the job out to tender, as allowed under EU rules. Gemalto said it was aware of reports regarding the contract, adding: “As the process is still ongoing and the terms of engagement are confidential, we cannot make any further comment on it at this stage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/31/civilisations-david-olusoga-european-kenneth-clark-series-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T08:59:08Z","webTitle":"Civilisations by David Olusoga review – a riposte to European superiority","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/31/civilisations-david-olusoga-european-kenneth-clark-series-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/31/civilisations-david-olusoga-european-kenneth-clark-series-review","fields":{"headline":"Civilisations by David Olusoga review – a riposte to European superiority","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the summer of 1520, towards the end of his life, the great German artist Albrecht Dürer travelled from his home in Nuremberg to the Low Countries, to meet his new patron, the Holy Roman emperor Charles V. At the same time, halfway across the world in the middle of the Americas, the Spanish adventurer Hernán Cortés was carrying out his merciless siege of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán. By the time it fell, on 13 August 1521, much of the city lay in ruins, and as many as 100,000 of its inhabitants had already died. Many more were massacred as the victors set about plundering whatever they could lay their hands on. When the first shipment of spoils arrived in Brussels, Dürer was one of those who flocked to examine it. He was blown away. “All the days of my life,” he wrote in his diary, “I have seen nothing that rejoiced my heart so much as these things, for I saw amongst them wonderful works of art, and I marvelled at the subtle ingenuity of men in foreign lands. Indeed I cannot express all that I thought there.” This vignette of cross-global inspiration is one of the highlights of David Olusoga’s new book, a richly illustrated companion volume to the two episodes he is presenting in the BBC’s new Civilisations. In outline, its format is fairly Eurocentric and conventional. Despite all the fuss that has been made about the TV project’s updating of Kenneth Clark’s 1969 series Civilisation, Olusoga’s own approach is framed in terms that would hardly have shocked audiences 50 years ago: the first half of the book considers contact between civilisations in “the European Age of Discovery” (from the 15th to the 18th centuries), while the second looks at the impact of industrialisation on the art and artists of the 19th century. Non-European cultures make an appearance only when they come into contact with Europeans. The book’s artistic focus is likewise entirely traditional. We are shown a bit of sculpture, some architecture, a few photographs, and above all lots of paintings – the industrialisation and commercialisation of the artistic world itself, and the growing importance during these centuries of cheap, mass-market printed images remain invisible. It’s also perhaps odd to find Clark faulted for his lack of attention to female artists by an author who includes only one (the late 17th, early 18th-century German botanist Maria Sibylla Merian), refers unselfconsciously to “mankind”, and persists in describing all geographical entities as female (Rome has “her” legions, Christian Europe suffers from “her” isolation). But Olusoga is a smart and inventive narrator, with a keen historical curiosity and effortless style. No matter the conventional format, he fills it with unconventional, subversive storylines. He’s keen to overturn 19th- and 20th-century prejudices about the relative merits of different civilisations. For Clark, western culture was obviously the best, nobler than what he dismissively termed “the Negro imagination”. Olusoga doesn’t mention this offensive slight until the end of his afterword, but his own work is a magnificent riposte to it. For if there is an argumentative thread that connects all the parts of this book, it’s his portrayal of European civilisation as a slow but inexorable historical plague, which destroys everything it comes into contact with: other cultures, the natural world, and millions upon millions of its own people. Whenever they come up against a superior power, Europeans look weak and ridiculous. They were “a harmless sort of people” who lacked all the rudiments of civility, noted a surprised Chinese mariner in 1543: they ate with their fingers rather than chopsticks, had no system of ceremonial etiquette, couldn’t understand “written characters”, and displayed “their feelings without any self-control”. Yet given the chance, they invariably wreaked havoc. From the brutal Castilian invasion of the Canary Islands in the 15th century, to the 19th-century destruction of the native peoples and habitats of North America, Australasia and the Pacific, through to the great mechanised slaughter of the first world war, this is a grim story of human suffering. As often as not, the artistic objects it holds up for our inspection are but fragmentary relics and reflections of entire civilisations obliterated by European greed, hubris and disease. In the same bracingly revisionist vein, Olusoga sees slavery everywhere he looks: African, European, Islamic, Malay, Japanese. We cannot truly appreciate the inanimate artefacts of the past, he implies, or interpret them as markers of civilisation, without understanding that they were produced by cultures that simultaneously traded in flesh and blood. All this means that he has little time for individual genius, inspiration or exaltation. The book is at its most interesting and original when deconstructing the very notion of civilisation, most bland when discussing groundbreaking artists such as El Greco, Rembrandt or Picasso. Rather than being an art-based history, which takes its cue from specific works, this is the opposite, and helpfully so – a history, illustrated with a selection of beautiful objects. As a result, the best chapters are those that successfully juxtapose different cultures, and show the interactions between them. It’s illuminating, for example, to learn of the connections between Dürer, the artistic virtuoso of Renaissance Europe, and his nameless, highly skilled African contemporaries, the ivory carvers of Sierra Leone. Another engaging section sets George Catlin’s prolific mid-19th century portrayals of Native American men and women side by side with the fascinating portraits of New Zealand Maori that were painted a few decades later by the Czech immigrant Gottfried Lindauer. And the book starts with a thrilling tale of racism, plunder and centuries of artistic hybridity: the story of the brass sculptures of the ancient African kingdom of Benin, and how they ended up in the British Museum. Olusoga’s relaxed, fluent prose is a pleasure to read, and the many pictures (all in colour) are a treat. So many different themes and examples are packed into this brief book that its second half, especially, sometimes feels like an enjoyable, helter-skelter romp through the history of art: here’s the invention of the camera, now quick, on to the impressionists, and look – we’ve arrived in Tahiti! Still, it’s hard not to cheer an author who chooses to illustrate the modern afterlife of Aztec culture by using a still from a James Bond movie. Like Clark’s treatment a generation ago, this is a personal, idiosyncratic vision, and all the better for it. • Faramerz Dabhoiwala’s The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution is published by Penguin.

Doğan Holding, which owns the widely read Hürriyet newspaper, Doğan news agency and the CNN Turk television channel, said it had started talks with Demirören Holding to sell its media arm for an estimated $890m (£631m). A Demirören official confirmed to Reuters that the group intended to buy Doğan’s media division. “With this huge takeover, including Hürriyet, Turkish mass media industry comes under the direct political control of President Erdoğan,” tweeted Kadri Gürsel, a veteran journalist who was recently released from prison pending trial over his work. Demirören Holding is owned by Erdoğan Demirören, a businessman who was once reduced to weeping in a phone call with the Turkish president when the latter called to chastise him over his newspaper’s publication of secret meeting minutes between government representatives and Kurdish militants, according to a leaked recording of the conversation. The owner of Doğan Holding is Aydin Doğan, a symbol of Turkey’s secular establishment that has been swept out of power by Erdoğan’s Islamist-leaning ruling party, the AKP. Doğan’s media outlets are among an extremely small pool of independents within the country that dare to criticise the president and his policies. Even those critiques have been tempered in recent years. Doğan Media was fined $2.5bn (£1.77bn) in 2009 over alleged tax irregularities in a measure widely seen by the government’s opponents as punishment for critical coverage. Rights groups have condemned the crackdown on the free press in Turkey, which is now the world’s biggest jailer of journalists. Prominent journalists have sentenced to life in prison over alleged involvement in a coup attempt in 2016, charges that have been ridiculed by observers, while several trials of journalists critical of the government continue. The government in Turkey has used various methods to curtail free speech. In addition to prosecuting and imprisoning journalists, authorities have occasionally taken over rival media outlets citing administrative irregularities and have staffed their boards with government loyalists. Businesspeople who own TV stations and newspapers often self-censor their outlets for fear of losing contracts in other parts of their business, and pro-government tycoons have sometimes purchased media outlets and turned them into loyalist publications. Doğan Holding previously sold the once-widely read Milliyet newspaper to Demirören Holding, a sale that later resulted in a strongly pro-government slant to the publication’s coverage. Cumhuriyet, the last major mainstream opposition newspaper, has been threatened with a trustee board takeover and had a dozen of its employees imprisoned, only for most to be released after more than a year in prison due to lack of evidence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/23/bizarre-rules-of-italian-macrobiotic-cult-revealed-by-victims","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T13:59:20Z","webTitle":"Bizarre rules of Italian macrobiotic 'cult' revealed by victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/bizarre-rules-of-italian-macrobiotic-cult-revealed-by-victims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/23/bizarre-rules-of-italian-macrobiotic-cult-revealed-by-victims","fields":{"headline":"Bizarre rules of Italian macrobiotic 'cult' revealed by victims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"People who broke free from what police say was a macrobiotic sect in Italy have described gradually losing control over their lives through a web of archaic rules and subtle manipulation. Some said they spent more than 20 years within a system that police say was carefully cultivated by Mario Pianesi, an influential businessman celebrated around the world as a guru of macrobiotic food. Pianesi, 73, is among four people accused by the authorities of reducing people to slavery by strictly controlling their diets, denying them contact with the outside world and leaving them impoverished by forcing them to work for free or a pitiful salary. The group was exposed by police last week, following an investigation which began in 2013 when a young woman, whose weight had plummeted to 35kg (77lb), told police Pianesi had promised her that his “Ma-Pi” diet would cure her illness. Pianesi has not commented on the allegations. Manuel Formica, a lawyer representing all four accused, said: “This thing is far-fetched and the suspects will do everything to defend their integrity.” Six people have made formal complaints while two more have come forward over the last week. Carlo Pinto, the investigator leading the case, suspects there could be “hundreds more” who are “still under the cult’s influence”. Complainants described a sinister network which allegedly wielded power through a diet claimed to provide miracle cures for viruses and illnesses such as HIV, cancer and diabetes. Rules allegedly included banning women from wearing short skirts, make-up and from washing during their period. More bizarre customs were said to include having to get out of bed on the right side and cutting hair and nails on any day of the week other than Tuesday or Thursday. People were also allegedly banned from laughing too much, using the internet and going to the gym, while men were told that wives who left them were akin to prostitutes. “The rules came about over time,” said Vanda Secondino, who became involved with the group in 1989 after attending one of its first holiday camps. “Pianesi was charismatic. People who were sick would ask for his help with food. Then we started to seek advice for every aspect of our lives and, over time, we lost power and he gained more. We believed we were incapable of managing our own lives.” Originally from Albania, Pianesi is said to have discovered the macrobiotic diet, modelled on the teachings of Japanese philosopher George Ohsawa, after becoming ill during his military service. Seeing a positive impact on his own body, he set up his first “clinic” in Sforzacosta, a hamlet close to the Marche town of Macerata, in the 1980s. Locals, who jokingly referred to Pianesi as a “witch doctor”, would go to him for consultations. He allegedly told followers that traditional medicine did not work and that real doctors were killers. Pianesi’s UPM empire, which comprises a network of 85 macrobiotic product hubs and restaurants across Italy, began making bold claims in the early 1990s, a period when many people, particularly those diagnosed with HIV, would attend his seminars in the hope of finding a cure. Pianesi earned prestige by wooing those around him, allegedly giving gifts to local officials and free meals to police officers. “He would say that for a town to be safe the police needed to eat well and have a clear mind,” said Gilbert Casaburi, who was a chef within the association before leaving it in 2011. Police believe this was a tactic for Pianesi, who is also facing tax evasion charges, to avoid financial checks. The Ma-Pi diet was endorsed by scientific journals. Pianesi is an honorary citizen of 12 towns in Italy and across the world. He met Pope Francis in 2016 along with his second wife, Loredana Volpi, who is also under investigation. The meeting infuriated the group’s followers, who claimed Pianesi had always harshly criticised the church and the pontiff. But such was his popularity, people in Macerata are struggling to believe the revelations. The local macrobiotic restaurant, offering cheap and healthy meals, is well-visited. “I know many who work at the restaurants and are not exploited,” said Marco Ribechi, a journalist who reflected on Pianesi as a potential Jekyll and Hydecharacter in an article for the local online newspaper, Cronache Maceratesi. “Some of it may be exaggerated, but this is just my opinion.” He said there may have been “layers” within the movement, whereby some people were exploited and others were not. A macrobiotic diet aims to avoid foods containing toxins and is based on whole grains, vegetables and beans. “At the beginning the diet was the same one taught by George Ohsawa, then it became completely different,” said Secondino. Originally from Campania, Secondino moved to Macerata to get closer to the movement. Within months she had abandoned her studies and reduced contact with her family. Suffering from anaemia and anxiety, she said the group initially gave her “lots of love and attention”. “I was only 26, had a fractured relationship with my family and little faith in myself, ” she said. She met her husband Mauro Garbuglia, who has a benign brain tumour, within the group. Pinto said followers were so devoted to their “teacher” that they gave donations to the association and worked for free within its centres and restaurants, believing they were contributing to society. Secondino and Garbuglia ran one of the restaurants, into which they ploughed about €160,000. Police said the operation worked like a franchise but in reality, followers invested while the accused took most of the profit. Followers were also obliged to buy produce only from UPM and pay to attend the association’s workshops and holiday camps. Secondino, her husband and two sons left in 2012 following a series of events that made them finally realise that “things weren’t right”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/22/theresa-may-refuses-to-intervene-over-mans-54000-nhs-cancer-bill-albert-thompson","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T16:55:12Z","webTitle":"Theresa May refuses to intervene over man's £54,000 NHS cancer bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/theresa-may-refuses-to-intervene-over-mans-54000-nhs-cancer-bill-albert-thompson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/theresa-may-refuses-to-intervene-over-mans-54000-nhs-cancer-bill-albert-thompson","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May refuses to intervene over man's £54,000 NHS cancer bill","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has refused to intervene in the case of Albert Thompson, the London cancer patient asked to pay £54,000 for treatment despite having lived in the UK for 44 years, as it emerged that there could be tens of thousands of people in a similarly uncertain immigration position. Thompson, 63, is not receiving the radiotherapy treatment he needs for prostate cancer because he has been unable to provide officials with sufficient documentary evidence showing that he has lived in the UK continuously since arriving from Jamaica as a teenager in 1973. He is unable to pay the £54,000 fee. May said responsibility for the decision to charge Thompson ahead of treatment lay with the Royal Marsden hospital. “No urgent treatment should ever be withheld or delayed by the NHS regardless of ability of willingness to pay,” she wrote in a letter to Jeremy Corbyn, who raised the issue at prime minister’s questions last week. Regulations introduced last October require hospitals to check patients’ paperwork, including passports and proof of address, and charge upfront for their healthcare if they do not have documentary proof of eligibility, unless the treatment is deemed to be urgent. “The decision on whether his treatment is urgent or immediately necessary must rightly be made by the clinicians treating him,” May wrote. The Royal Marsden has repeatedly said that Thompson’s radiotherapy was not urgent. This surprises some prostate cancer specialists, who are puzzled why treatment prescribed for cancer can subsequently be deemed non-urgent, once the question of ability to pay is raised. Despite sympathising with “Mr Thompson and the worries he will be facing given his condition”, the prime minister said he needed to “evidence his settled status” in the UK. Thompson – who has asked for his real name not to be used – is one of a growing group of long-term UK residents facing life-shattering problems as a result of the government’s hostile immigration environment, which has been particularly affecting people who arrived as children from Commonwealth countries. Research released this week by academics at the University of Oxford-based Migration Observatory suggests that there could be up to 57,000 people potentially vulnerable to similar problems, because although they arrived from Commonwealth countries before 1971, they have never applied for a British passport or been naturalised. Their difficulties are only beginning to emerge now as the government’s tightened immigration regime inadvertently hits the wrong targets. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory, said: “This is an estimate of the population who arrived before 1971 but have not naturalised. It won’t be the case that all 57,000 can’t prove their legal status; we don’t know what share of them have problems with their paperwork and what proportion have everything in order. This is the maximum size of the population who are potentially at risk.” Thompson’s problems echo those experienced by Paulette Wilson, who was sent last year to an immigration detention centre and threatened with deportation to Jamaica, despite having been in Britain for 50 years. The Guardian has highlighted the cases of numerous other people who have lost their jobs or been made homeless because they are unable to prove they are in the UK legally, despite having lived in the country for over half a century. Thompson’s lawyer Jeremy Bloom, at Duncan Lewis, said: “The application that Mr Thompson needs to make to regularise his stay is complex and requires a great deal of supporting evidence. Meanwhile, Mr Thompson is being refused potentially life-saving treatment unless he can pay for it. Theresa May does not appear to place much value on the contribution that Mr Thompson has made to the UK since 1973.” Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, highlighted news this week that the Royal Marsden foundation trust predicted it would receive an income of £210m over two years from providing private healthcare. “It’s astonishing that this man still hasn’t been able to access the treatment he needs. This is a trust which is making hundreds of millions from private patients, yet seemingly refusing to provide urgent cancer care,” he said. A spokesperson for the the Royal Marsden said a cancer specialist would contact Thompson to discuss his treatment while he attempted to get his papers in order. Profits from private treatment were “ploughed back into the NHS for the benefit of our patients” and this had nothing to do with the the trust’s “legal obligation to check eligibility for access to NHS care”, the spokesperson said. “It is disappointing that NHS staff, who are committed to public service, should be criticised for being professional and fair in applying the principles required of them on eligibility.” Thompson, who worked as a mechanic and paid taxes for three decades before he became ill, has never applied for a British passport because he thought he had no need to; the Jamaican passport he arrived with was lost many years ago. He has also struggled to prove his eligibility for housing support and is currently living in a hostel. Over 87,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to give him treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/22/spoiler-alert-bank-of-englands-hints-of-may-rate-rise-are-not-subtle","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T15:44:11Z","webTitle":"Spoiler alert: Bank of England's hints of May rate rise are not subtle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/22/spoiler-alert-bank-of-englands-hints-of-may-rate-rise-are-not-subtle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/22/spoiler-alert-bank-of-englands-hints-of-may-rate-rise-are-not-subtle","fields":{"headline":"Spoiler alert: Bank of England's hints of May rate rise are not subtle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We’ve been here before. First, the Bank of England says publicly that it thinks interest rates will need to rise. Next, a couple of members of its monetary policy committee break ranks and vote for borrowing costs to go up. Finally, the other members of the committee say they too think that the time is right for action. This is how the Bank of England softened up the public when it raised interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November, and the same pattern is being followed again. In February, Threadneedle Street used its quarterly Inflation Report to signal that borrowing costs would be going up sooner and by more than the City had previously expected. This month, the two most hawkish members of the MPC – Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders – said they wanted rates to go up immediately on the grounds that a failure to deal with rising inflationary pressure would risk a more severe tightening of policy later. As a result, the markets drew the obvious conclusion: when the MPC next meets in early May it will announce an increase in interest rates to 0.75%. That would be quite a moment, because since early 2009 official borrowing costs have been set at 0.5% or lower. So is a May move a done deal? Not quite, because the Bank has been careful to leave itself a bit of wriggle room. A rate rise will depend on the economic data that is published over the next month and a half, but judging by the minutes of the MPC’s March meeting that data would have to be quite poor for Threadneedle Street to sit tight. One key piece of data that will come out before the May decision is the flash estimate of growth in the first quarter from the Office for National Statistics. The Bank thinks this will be just 0.3% given the 0.1 percentage points that will be lost as a result of the weather disruption at the start of March. As a result, it would take a figure of 0.2% for the Bank to have a radical rethink. Forward-looking indicators are likely to point to a bounce-back in growth in the second quarter. The Brexit implementation deal should boost business confidence while falling inflation and rising wage growth will bolster consumer spending. It is not certain that the Bank will raise rates in May, but it will now be a big surprise if it doesn’t."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/23/the-best-wes-anderson-movies-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Wes Anderson movies – ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/23/the-best-wes-anderson-movies-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/23/the-best-wes-anderson-movies-ranked","fields":{"headline":"Wes Anderson movies – ranked!","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"10. The Darjeeling Limited (2007) Anderson’s Indian train jaunt met the quota in terms of colourful compositions and visual panache (what better vehicle for his famous tracking shots than a train?), but exposed a privileged viewpoint that Anderson often struggles to shake. There was something distasteful about following three wealthy, troubled, white American brothers (metaphorical Louis Vuitton luggage in tow) across a landscape that seemed airbrushed of real-world poverty for the sake of hipster-friendly visuals, with an Indian boy’s drowning acting as a catalyst for their healing. 9. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) Let’s face it, Bill Murray’s Cousteau-like ocean explorer is a bit of a grump. He spends most of the film in a morose funk, brought on by his family baggage and his obsessive quest for the “jaguar shark” that ate his partner. And along for the ride is a crew of famous faces who seem to have nothing to do. Despite the lavish cutaway-ship set, the bespoke Adidas trainers, the nonsense sea creatures (designed by Henry Selick) and the rest, the film’s most lasting element was Seu Jorge’s Portuguese-language Bowie covers. That’s a sign of failure. 8. Bottle Rocket (1996) Compared with its successors, Anderson’s 1996 debut is practically a Dogme film. Unencumbered by budget or mannerism, it has a freewheeling roughness, the snappy dialogue and witty details hinting at bigger things to come. A ramshackle, slightly shallow tale of three friends whose commitment to a life of (petty) crime is not matched by their competence, it was also the debut of Anderson’s Texas buddies Luke and Owen Wilson (the latter steals the show) – an auspicious, if flawed, beginning. 7. Hotel Chevalier (2007) It’s only 13 minutes long but Anderson’s single-location two-hander – ostensibly a warmup for The Darjeeling Limited – proves that he can do perfectly well without the bells and whistles, perhaps better. There’s practically nothing to it: Jason Schwartzman is holed up in an expensive Paris hotel room; Natalie Portman visits for a last goodbye. Peter Sarstedt’s Where Do You Go (To My Lovely)? plays on the iPod. But this minimal story captures a moment, and there’s a sense of what went before – and what will come after. He should do more like it. 6. Isle of Dogs (2018) Anderson’s return to stop-motion is his most obsessively detailed film yet, with possibly his most out-there story: stray dogs quarantined on a Japanese trash island? Snout flu? Cat-loving bureaucrats? Robot attack dogs? Yoko Ono? And why set it in Japan anyway? “Why not?” seems to be the answer. Anderson’s mining of Japanese culture is largely deep and respectful, taking in futuristic postwar pop culture and traditional arts alike. There is still space among the sprawling voice cast for Anderson’s English-speaking regulars, plus a few Japanese names (speaking Japanese), and the familiar deadpan comedy is intact, even if the literally shaggy dog story lacks a sense of purpose beyond celebrating its own construction. But what construction! 5. Moonrise Kingdom (2012) Anderson’s shtick was starting to look a little repetitive by his seventh feature: the isolated location (check: a New England island, with scout camp); the idiosyncratic style details (check: Françoise Hardy played from a portable record player); the fractured family; the doll’s-house set design; the orthogonal camerawork. But the story they are in service to here is rather sweet: two naive kids elope, despite their tenuous grasp of love, conversation or outdoor survival – what could be more romantic? It might have lacked substance – a perennial Anderson complaint – but it had charm. 4. Fantastic Mr Fox (2009) If you want a straightforward Roald Dahl adaptation, you don’t go to Anderson. Dahl’s countryside classic is merely the jumping-off point for a parable that’s as much about growing up, settling down and facing parental responsibilities as foiling farmers and stealing chickens. But its wayward mischief arguably captures some of Dahl’s essence. Anderson found his dream medium in stop-motion animation, where absolutely every visual element and split second of comic timing can be controlled. Who knows what Dahl would have made of American-accented creatures, badger real-estate agents and the madeup sport of “whackbat”. But plenty would have been familiar: Anderson modelled elements on Dahl’s own Buckinghamshire home. It’s a kids’ movie for grownups, but we’re fine with that. 3. Rushmore (1998) The story of a precocious man-boy who stages wildly overambitious theatre productions but feels his talents are underappreciated – what could have inspired you, Wes? Rushmore is Anderson’s most focused story and also his darkest, with a willingness to skirt close to difficult subjects his later films sometimes dodge. Its hero, Max Fischer (Schwartzman), could be the anti-Graduate. He’s a brooding outsider student who develops a crush on an older woman, but Olivia Williams’s widowed schoolteacher isn’t much of a Mrs Robinson. Besides which, Max has a grownup rival for her affections in the form of Bill Murray, who also becomes his father-figure – awkward. Max isn’t much of a graduate either, but he’s a great character. He throws himself into extracurricular activities (cue Andersonian montage), sports a preppy blazer and an unearned sense of superiority, but his academic grades are terrible. It plays as a dry, stylistically daring coming-of-age comedy, but it could just as easily have been a horror movie. 2. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) By this stage Anderson’s troupe of star players and his grandiose design ambitions had grown so big, he had to build a hotel – in fact, an entire fictional country, Zubrowka – to accommodate them. His 1930s-set caper is like a cake from its own Mendl’s patisserie: crammed with richness yet light as a feather; and, of course, beautifully packaged. It finds a trump card in Ralph Fiennes. Traditionally a dramatic heavyweight (and Harry Potter villain), he sets the comic tone here: clipped and courteous, but prone to surprising expletives and bursts of violence, Fiennes’ consummate hotel concierge, monsieur Gustave, sets the busy story in motion, initially thanks to his sexual penchant for wealthy, elderly women, which leads to an inherited artwork, a trumped-up murder charge, prison breaks, mountaintop chases – how does he pack it all in? Anderson literally went to town on this one. Everything is exactingly designed, from the wedding-cake Alpine hotel to the pink patisserie packaging, the postage stamps to the tassels on the room keys. In Zubrowka, they would call it a Gesamtkunstwerk. But beneath the confection there is also a sense of history and loss – not only for the characters personally, but also for interwar Europe and its crumbling aristocratic order. 1. The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) Its influence has now seeped into the culture, but cinema had seen nothing quite like this when it came out in 2001. So fully formed was Anderson’s aesthetic vision, he seemed to be some kind of savant. He could craft a story of literary breadth with vivid characters (and marshal an intimidating star cast). His deadpan wit was so hip it hurt, and his dazzling command of visuals and music made more established film-makers look amateur. Peter Bogdanovich compared him to his hero Orson Welles: “Wes is one of those rare picture-makers who can see the whole movie in his head long before he shoots.” In many ways, Tenenbaums remains Anderson’s most complete movie. Like Welles’ The Magnificent Ambersons, it is an eccentric story about a family of eccentrics, but at heart an unhappy one, and therefore entirely relatable. The father (Gene Hackman) is a liar and a scoundrel. The mother (Anjelica Huston) is long-suffering and too smart to put up with it all. Their three children (Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow) were all prodigies who lost their respective directions, if not their talents for accessorising. And they’re all brought back together in their hulking New York homestead to compete for each other’s attention and affections. The yearning romance between Wilson and Paltrow’s characters, in particular, is the most sincere and mature of all Anderson’s movies. And it’s all the better for Paltrow’s Lacoste dresses and panda eyeliner, Wilson’s headband-and-sunglasses combo, and a choice soundtrack cut like Nico’s These Days. Style and substance came together beautifully to form a movie that is both breathtakingly precise and poignantly heartfelt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/30/wood-john-lewis-stempel-cockshutt-herefordshire-trees-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T08:00:16Z","webTitle":"The Wood by John Lewis-Stempel review – a fortress against agribusiness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/30/wood-john-lewis-stempel-cockshutt-herefordshire-trees-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/30/wood-john-lewis-stempel-cockshutt-herefordshire-trees-review","fields":{"headline":"The Wood by John Lewis-Stempel review – a fortress against agribusiness","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“A wood should not be a museum,” says John Lewis-Stempel. For four years he managed Cockshutt Wood in south-west Herefordshire, three and a half acres of deciduous and coniferous woodland “with a secluded pool where the winter moon lives”. This is his diary of his final year there. Such small woods play a vital role in the life of our countryside: they are the last refuge of many flora and fauna. Grassland sustains 70 pairs of birds per 100 acres but a wood is home to 400. Woods are “fortresses of nature against the tide of people and agribusiness”. For this reason, Cockshutt is a working wood, an example of “agroforestry”. Lewis-Stempel kept pigs, cows and Hebridean sheep (“small, black and primitive”) to control what would otherwise be a “sea of briars crashing around the trees”, allowing wild flowers to grow and attracting wildlife. In the summer he harvested “tree hay”, leaf fodder from ash, oak and elm, storing it as winter feed to which he added vitamin-rich upper branches of holly (whose leaves don’t have spines). The wood also supplied him with logs for his fire (“the released sunlight of years gone by”), wild plants, mushrooms for his table (the book includes recipes, from elderflower champagne to chestnut soup) and the occasional pheasant and wood pigeon: “I farm for wildlife. Cannot wildlife provide me with a meal?” His family come from “farm stock” dating back to the 13th century. He considers himself to be a “countryside writer”, not a nature writer: “I give the view of the countryside from someone who works there.” There’s a powerful sense in his books of the land as something to be worked and managed. The diary form is perfect for conveying the shifting moods of the seasons and allows Lewis-Stempel to delve into the history, lore, poetry and even the language of woods. But it’s his observation of the natural world – the sight, the sound, the smell of it – that is so memorable. He has a distinctively brisk, muscular style of writing that has a poetic intensity and concision. In October, “the leaves of the service trees flutter, flicker, flame, in pseudo fire”; and in March he discovers “primroses leaking spots of sun out of the earth”. Above, the sparrowhawk is “a twisting blade of badness”. This heartfelt, evocative book shows that woods such as Cockshutt, which has stood since before “the Romans trod their road to Hereford”, occupy a special place in both the countryside and our psyches. As Lewis-Stempel says, “Woods: they inhabit the mind.” • The Wood: The Life and Times of Cockshutt Wood is published by Doubleday.

However, he failed to persuade the new prime minister, Tony Blair, to support this course of action and was sacked just 14 months after his only appointment as a cabinet minister. He had begun a lifetime of public service as an ambitious young Welsh barrister and a Labour MP and minister in the first Harold Wilson administration of the 1960s, embraced a highly successful five years as Britain’s ambassador to the UN after he lost his marginal parliamentary seat in 1974 and spent a further three years as the European commissioner for employment and social affairs from 1981. He was appointed to the Lords in 1990, made Labour leader there two years later, became a privy counsellor in 1993 and joined the Blair government as leader of the Lords and lord privy seal in 1997. He chaired a six-week conference in 1976 in Geneva on what was then Rhodesia, which failed to make progress on achieving majority rule for what is now Zimbabwe. In 2002, he was appointed to chair a commission on extending the powers of the Welsh Assembly, which resulted in a unanimous report recommending law-making powers for the body on already devolved issues such as health and education. Another claim to fame, albeit somewhat vicarious, came as a result of the notoriety of a book by his wife, Janet Jones, shortly after he had been fired from the government. In Labour of Love, the Partly-Political Diary of a Cabinet Minister’s Wife (1999)_, she set out in glorious and precise detail exactly what her husband thought of his former colleagues in government. Even more damaging, she also disclosed to the world that Lord (Derry) Irvine of Lairg, the lord chancellor, who had been against Richard’s plan for the Lords, had embarked upon a £650,000 refurbishment of his official apartments that required such niceties as Pugin-style wallpaper at £300 a roll. It came across, to Tony Benn in his own diaries at least, as a form of “very bitter” revenge. In reality, the book on which Jones had embarked without intent or malice, under the original title of I’m No Lady, proved a hilarious and well-written read. As Benn noted: “Absolute gossip but interesting.” Richard’s physical presence, self-assured manner and courtroom delivery gave a solid authority to his speeches. But he was also clubbable and convivial, a pithy and entertaining conversationalist, who liked cooking, opera and playing the piano. All this made him a popular figure at Westminster, from his first election in 1964 for the now defunct west London seat of Barons Court. He was a moderate within the Labour party, a member of the Fabian Society, yet he did not leave Labour with some of his like-minded colleagues for the Social Democratic party and, indeed, replaced Roy Jenkins as the Labour-nominated commissioner in Brussels when he left to help found the SDP. Richard’s most enduring political passion was a commitment to the European ideal. He never disguised his pursuit of eventual European political unity, speaking powerfully on this objective when he rebelled against the Labour whip in October 1971 to support UK membership of the then Common Market, which he called “a small but very necessary step” towards this end. In his first speech as a member of the Lords in a debate on economic and monetary union, he railed against the “breathtaking insularity” he perceived in the mistakes he saw in British policy towards Europe. He had been previously particularly outspoken in his criticism of the approach of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister, in consequence of which she refused to appoint him for the customary second term as commissioner. She complained of him, as she did of others, that he had “gone native” in Brussels. Born in Cardiff, Ivor was the son of Seward Richard, an engineer in the mining industry, and his wife, Isabella (nee Davies). He was raised in Betws, near Ammanford, and educated at St Michael’s school, in Llanelli, and Cheltenham college. He was a front row forward for Amman United RFC. In 1953 he gained a law degree at Pembroke College, Oxford, was called to the bar in 1955 and practised in London until 1974, becoming a QC in 1971. His first attempt for Westminster came when he fought the safe Conservative seat of South Kensington in 1959, before being selected for neighbouring Barons Court and winning the 1964 election with a small majority. Wilson appointed him as parliamentary private secretary to Denis Healey, as defence secretary, in 1966 and installed him as army minister in the government in 1969. During four years of opposition, he was first a spokesman on broadcasting and then on foreign affairs from 1971 until he lost in February 1974 and his constituency was abolished. Richard was selected as Labour’s official candidate in Blyth in Northumberland for the October 1974 election, but was defeated by the sitting MP, Eddie Milne, who had been deselected as the candidate for alleging corruption in the local Labour party and was then triumphantly re-elected as something of a local hero. In 1956 Richard married Geraldine Moore, and they had a son, David. Following their divorce, in 1962 he married Alison Imrie, and they had a son, Alun, and daughter, Isobel. They divorced in 1983, and six years later he married Janet, with whom he had a son, William. She and his children survive him. • Ivor Seward Richard, Lord Richard, politician and barrister, born 30 May 1932; died 18 March 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/30/from-a-low-and-quiet-sea-by-donal-ryan-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T06:30:13Z","webTitle":"From a Low and Quiet Sea by Donal Ryan review – waves of compassion and anger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/30/from-a-low-and-quiet-sea-by-donal-ryan-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/30/from-a-low-and-quiet-sea-by-donal-ryan-review","fields":{"headline":"From a Low and Quiet Sea by Donal Ryan review – waves of compassion and anger","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There comes a moment in every novelist’s career where they must decide whether to plough the same furrow that has brought them great success or make their way cautiously into another field, uncertain whether the soil on neighbouring land is as rich. In his fourth novel, Donal Ryan has not only bounded over a wall into new territory, but built himself a castle there. It’s astonishing to realise that Ryan’s first novel, The Spinning Heart, was published only six years ago. Since then, across three novels and a story collection, he has displayed a sympathy for the voices of the dispossessed that few writers ever develop. His debut was narrated by 21 victims of Ireland’s economic crash; he introduced readers to Johnsey Cunliffe, the isolated and troubled young man at the centre of The Thing About December. Then, along came Melody Shee in All We Shall Know, who found solace with a younger man, Martin Toppy, a Traveller: a character often seen and persecuted in Irish life, but still under-represented in Irish fiction. And so, when the opening section of From a Low and Quiet Sea introduces its first protagonist, and he is not named Seánie, Mick or Peadar, but Farouk, readers will recognise that Ryan has decided to try something a little different. The novel is divided into four sections, the first three of which feature characters whose stories initially appear to have no relationship to each other. Farouk is a Syrian refugee, escaping his homeland with his wife and daughter for what he hopes will be a brighter future in western Europe. Ryan keeps the pace deliberately slow, with long, dense paragraphs that are as absorbing as they are convincing. An educated man and a doctor, Farouk’s story develops in a manner that I suspect is painfully familiar to anyone who has been forced to flee the country of their birth under cover of night. The next two sections find Ryan on more recognisable terrain. A young man, Lampy, recovering from his first broken heart, lives with his mother and grandfather while working in a care home, driving old people to and from hospital on a private bus. The tone switches dramatically here but the reader quickly warms to Lampy’s brutally honest, moving and often hilarious narrative. Finally, there is the elderly John, an accountant and lobbyist filled with remorse over a failed relationship with a much younger woman. A money-wielding shyster, the sort whose illicit actions precipitated the dramas of The Spinning Heart, he is thrown off balance by an unexpected crush that quickly turns to obsession and violence. The three stories are equally involving but it is only when the final section arrives that they are drawn together in the most heartbreaking manner. There are revelations to be found in the closing pages, and connections between characters that took me by surprise – making me utter an expletive aloud in Dublin airport while reading, causing a woman sitting next to me to declare furiously, “May God forgive you!”, before picking up her carry-on luggage and moving somewhere less profane. I struggle to think of a writer who has been so prolific and consistent in quality as Ryan, the best of the new wave of Irish authors to have emerged over the last decade. His ability to understand the minds of young men stuck in small towns, longing for escape but unsure how to achieve it, is second to none. But he is also able to write about older people reliving the mistakes of their lives with compassion and a total lack of sentimentality. And throughout all his work runs a careful study of Ireland’s historical prejudices, combined with clear insights into what makes it such a peculiar, complicated and contradictory country. Lampy and John figure alongside Johnsey as Ryan’s most vivid creations to date, but it’s Farouk who is the beating heart of this novel. He disappears after 50 pages, only to return at the end, but his presence hovers over every paragraph and we can almost sense him making his way slowly towards Ireland as we busy ourselves with the other two narratives. This is a superb novel, from a writer building a body of work the equal of any today. His books are filled with love and righteous anger, most of which lurks darkly beneath the surface ready to explode like an ill-judged comment at a family gathering. Until now, The Spinning Heart was my favourite of Ryan’s novels. From a Low and Quiet Sea is better. John Boyne’s latest novel is The Heart’s Invisible Furies (Doubleday).

Marielle Franco, a city councilwoman and human rights defender, was shot four times in the head by unknown assailants in a passing vehicle shortly after leaving a gathering of young black activists. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, was also killed (Report, 16 March). Long before being elected to Rio’s city council in 2016, Marielle was widely known as a tireless and fearless advocate for the rights of Afro-Brazilians, LGBT people, women and low-income communities. A gay black woman born and raised in one of Rio’s poorest neighbourhoods, she campaigned relentlessly against spiralling police violence in the city’s favelas. Marielle’s activism earned her many powerful enemies. She vehemently challenged the impunity surrounding extrajudicial killings of black youth by security forces and, two days before her death, had denounced the police’s role in the killing of a young black man named Matheus Melo. She was a leading critic of the military intervention in Rio de Janeiro and was the head of a city commission tasked with monitoring the intervention. We are deeply concerned and shocked by this commando-style killing of a woman who was a voice for the voiceless and a symbol of resistance to state-perpetrated violence, militarisation and anti-democratic forces. Given that Marielle’s murder bears all the hallmarks of a targeted assassination, we call for the creation of an independent commission comprised of prominent and respected national and international human rights and legal experts and tasked with carrying out an independent investigation of the murder of Marielle Franco with the full cooperation of state judicial and police authorities. Shortly before her death, Marielle asked: “How many others will have to die before this war will end?” We call for justice for Marielle Franco and the daughter and the partner she leaves behind, and for an end to the killings and criminalisation of activists, government opponents and low-income people in Brazil.

Data published by the Department for Education (DfE) on Thursday revealed that about one in six students (16.9%) missed at least half a day of lessons in 2016-17 for a family holiday – up from 14.7% the previous year. At the same time the proportion of parents being fined for taking their children out of lessons without permission fell by 5.4% – from 157,879 in 2015-16, to 149,321 in 2016-17 – reversing a six-year trend. More than three-quarters (77.5%) of those fines were for unauthorised holidays, statistics show. The increase in unauthorised holidays coincides with the high-profile legal battle involving Jon Platt, a father from Isle of Wight who was taken to court after taking his daughter on an unauthorised holiday to Florida. In May 2016 the high court backed an earlier ruling by magistrates in Platt’s favour, which said he should not have to pay a fine for an unauthorised term-time holiday. The absence figures indicate that after this ruling many parents decided to take term-time breaks believing it was unlikely they would face action for doing so. However, a supreme court ruling last April found against Platt and reversed the ruling. Overall absence rates across primary, secondary and special schools in the state sector increased from 4.6% in 2015-16 to 4.7% in 2016-17. While absences in primary schools remained the same at 4%, they rose in secondary schools from 5.2% to 5.4%. Absence rates in special schools were considerably higher at 9.7%. According to the DfE, the total number of days missed across state-funded schools went up from 54.8m in 2015-16 to 56.7m in 2016-17, which reflects in part a rise in the number of pupils. Government statisticians said the increase in overall absence rates had been driven by unauthorised absences, which went up from 1.1% to 1.3% in the space of a year. Persistent absence is also up, according to the latest figures. The proportion of pupils classified as persistent absentees increased from 10.5% to 10.8%. A child is described as being a persistent absentee if they miss 10% or more of lessons. A DfE spokesman said: “Children only get one chance at an education and evidence shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil’s chances of achieving good GCSEs. “Therefore, we believe that no child should be taken out of school without good reason and the supreme court agrees with us. The rules on term-time absences are clear and we have put schools back in control by supporting them – and local authorities – to use their powers to deal with unauthorised absence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/22/firefighters-tackle-blaze-glasgow-shopping-precinct","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T13:48:33Z","webTitle":"Asbestos warning after firefighters extinguish Glasgow 'inferno'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/firefighters-tackle-blaze-glasgow-shopping-precinct","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/firefighters-tackle-blaze-glasgow-shopping-precinct","fields":{"headline":"Asbestos warning after firefighters extinguish Glasgow 'inferno'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A major fire which took hold of a building in Glasgow city centre has been contained but an asbestos warning has been issued to local residents and businesses. More than 120 firefighters dealt with the incident on the busy shopping thoroughfare of Sauchiehall Street. The blaze started in the roof of the building which houses Victoria’s nightclub at about 8.20am on Thursday. Chief fire officer Alasdair Hay said the fire was one of the biggest the service has had to deal with. “It’s an incredibly complex fire in hazardous conditions and I want to praise the firefighters for their professionalism in the way they are dealing with this incident,” he said. “It is one of the biggest incidents we’ve had in the Scottish fire and rescue service since its inception.” No one was injured in the incident. Shows at the Pavilion and nearby Theatre Royal have been cancelled with firefighters expected to remain at the scene for a few days. Assistant chief officer Lewis Ramsay said crews were quick to attend and control the fire. He said: “I am delighted to say we have managed to contain it within the block that was affected and more importantly we have managed to protect and save some iconic premises round about, most notably the Pavilion Theatre.” He added: “We would urge the occupants of surrounding buildings to remain indoors and keep their windows closed due to the suspected presence of asbestos.” Fire crews broke into the 114-year-old Pavilion, one of the city’s best-loved music hall venues, which is located on the other side of a narrow lane behind the building that was on fire, amid concerns that the flames would jump across. Speaking from the scene, Ramsay said: “It was like a blowtorch and [the first crews] were beaten back by the heat and the flames and a really rapid spread.” He said the fire crews had to retreat from the burning building quickly before undertaking “some really aggressive firefighting”. “It was a really complicated fire with an extensive fire spread, spreading across a number of older tenement-style buildings.” More than 20 fire engines were used, including specialist high reach appliances and a heavy rescue vehicle, with many of the 120 firefighters wearing breathing apparatus. Streets in the city centre have been cordoned off to traffic and several buildings have been evacuated. Sandra White, a local MSP, talked about the fire at first minister’s questions in Holyrood, asking what assistance could be given to the emergency services, businesses and residents affected. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the incident was “deeply concerning” and added: “The Scottish government’s resilience unit will remain in contact with the fire services as this incident develops and I will be kept updated in the course of the day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/22/passports-are-symbols-over-substance-brexit-in-a-nutshell-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"'Symbols over substance – Brexit in a nutshell': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/22/passports-are-symbols-over-substance-brexit-in-a-nutshell-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/22/passports-are-symbols-over-substance-brexit-in-a-nutshell-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'Symbols over substance – Brexit in a nutshell': your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re looking back at some of the stories getting you talking today, with the blue passport procurement process provoking some of the most entertaining exchanges.

Minister floats prospect of procurement rules changing after Brexit after passport contract backlash Readers have been reacting to reports the blue British passports beloved of some prominent Brexit supporters keen for “restored sovereignty” will be made by a Franco-Dutch firm. Here are some of your thoughts shared beneath Thursday’s politics live blog. ‘The UK government is to blame for this perceived sleight on our sovereignty’ Once again, a minister blames the EU, this time for their procurement rules, instead of admitting that, as usual, it’s the UK government that is to blame for this perceived sleight on our sovereignty. As for procurement – that is largely governed by the WTO. The French meanwhile produce passports in France because they prefer the security of being able to regulate directly. Not that our government has any idea what national security actually means or looks like in practice, having cut the army, police and border force to shreds during their time in office, and refusing to administer any allowed EU restrictions on movement. Iwan Roberts ‘Symbols over substance: Brexit in a nutshell’ Leavers truly believe that post-Brexit these contracts will go to British firms, when in reality they will go to China or India. They should check out the manufacturers of the Union Jacks they wave outside parliament – all made in China... A taste of things to come. And if leavers are looking for someone to blame, they should look no further than the Tory party which dismantled our manufacturing industry in favour of a service-based economy. This has nothing to do with the EU, it’s just that in some areas, continental firms are more competitive. In others, the UK gets the lion’s share of business. Concentrating their ire on something as insignificant as the manufacturing of passports, or fishing for that matter, demonstrates precisely why referendums are such a bad idea. They give rise to demagogues and populist thinking about niche issues that are unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Symbols over substance: Brexit in a nutshell. ParisBrit ‘They should play the national anthem, just like some Birthday cards do’ Will the blue passports contain their country of manufacture, with a CE mark, perhaps the EU flag and on being open play the national anthem, just like some Birthday cards do? A security feature suggestion: a watermark showing the Leaver’s protagonist, throwing fish into the Thames, when the could’ve given the fish to food banks. ID85521051 Instagram ‘influencers’ can flog stuff all day – but it’s weird when they use their kids to do it Hadley Freeman answers a readers question on the morals of “using” children to project a certain image online. ‘They use their audience to achieve a lifestyle that their audience could never afford’ The lifestyle that these influencers push – with their backdrops of white walls and expensive candles, tiny yappy dogs, luxury holidays and compliant boyfriends, is the overarching problem for me. These impossibly white-teethed people producing videos about extortionately-priced designer bags and other unattainable-for-most goods that they only have through courting greedy brands is pretty revolting and totally unrealistic. They use their audience (usually young) to achieve a lifestyle that their audience could never afford. You only need to see the comments of vulnerable people below (eg ‘I was feeling really anxious until your video came up in my feed’), as well as other sycophantic drivel, to see that the power that they yield. tulipred Now is the time for Labour to reach out to disabled people, young and old Columnist Frances Ryan says that as the Tories cut benefits, Jeremy Corbyn is perfectly placed to represent the interests of the UK’s millions of disabled voters. Here are some of your thoughts. ‘Disabled people in his own constituency will make sure Corbyn does this’ Corbyn will do this I’m sure. Because disabled people in his own constituency will make sure of it – as was evidenced at a local Labour party meeting I went to last night. I also know that Corbyn is already committed to disability rights – he attended an event at my local disability project a while back, gave a speech, listened to other speeches, cut the cake amidst much joking and hung out with us there for ages. jessthecrip ‘There is no way Labour would have permitted the deaths of in excess of 120,000 elderly’ The only way forward to a brighter and caring society, where people with disabilities and mental health needs, people escaping and in need of protection from their abusive partners and attackers, people who are elderly waiting for care, is through Labour. There is no way Labour would have permitted the deaths of in excess of 120,000 elderly. And would have certainly not scapegoated the most vulnerable members of society by withdrawing social security at a time when most in need. Vote Labour. Jeremy Corbyn all the way and the only way.

The Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes were up by 0.8% last month but that the increase was not enough to make up for the weakness of spending in December and January – two crucial months for the sector. After gloomy news from retailers including Carpetright, Moss Bros, Kingfisher, Mothercare and New Look, the ONS reported that retail sales in the three months to February – a better guide to the underlying trend than one month’s figures – were down by 0.4% on the previous quarter. Rhian Murphy, the ONS senior statistician, said: “Retail sales did grow in February, with increases seen in food, non-store and fuel, but this followed two months of decline in these sectors. “However, the underlying three-month picture is one of falling sales, mainly due to strong declines across all main sectors in December.” The monthly 0.8% increase in retail sales – seasonally adjusted to take account of big monthly swings in spending patterns before and after Christmas – was double the rise expected by the financial markets but the figures only covered spending up to 24 February – before the UK was blanketed in snow by the “beast from the east”. Ruth Gregory, the UK analyst at Capital Economics, said it would take a 2% increase in March for retail sales in the first quarter of 2018 to match the 0.5% rise in the final three months of 2017. “Overall, then, the retail sector looks set to act as a small drag on overall GDP growth in the first quarter,” she said. Retailers are hoping that the fall in inflation and the pickup in earnings growth reported by the ONS this week will lead to rising real incomes and increased spending by consumers during 2018. The ONS said it was still finding price increases across all parts of retailing, but the annual increase had dropped from 3.1% in December to 2.5% in February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/22/ministers-vow-to-end-secrecy-around-foreign-ownership-of-uk-property","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T11:12:20Z","webTitle":"Frontmen for shell companies could face jail in UK property crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/22/ministers-vow-to-end-secrecy-around-foreign-ownership-of-uk-property","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/22/ministers-vow-to-end-secrecy-around-foreign-ownership-of-uk-property","fields":{"headline":"Frontmen for shell companies could face jail in UK property crackdown","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Frontmen of foreign shell companies that are used to hide the true ownership of some of London’s most expensive properties could face up to two years in jail and unlimited fines under new government plans. The government announced the new sanctions on Thursday as it unveiled plans to set out draft laws this summer to lift the secrecy surrounding foreign ownership of billions of pounds worth of British property. Under the draft laws, foreign companies must disclose who ultimately owns their properties. The plans follow new rules on ownership and control of UK companies that were introduced in 2016. Questions surrounding secret and offshore ownership were highlighted by revelations from the Paradise Papers, published in the Guardian. However, the timetable for the new property register had been subject to numerous delays and even a threat of rebellion by two Tory peers, who put forward an amendment to the sanctions and anti-money-laundering bill in January. Facing a potential defeat, the government announced that it would table draft legislation by this summer, though transparency campaigners have said this will still in practice delay an operational register until 2021. Russian ownership of UK property has been under the spotlight since the nerve agent attacked attributed to the Kremlin in Salisbury. A Whitehall source said though the new draft law was not explicitly aimed at Russia, the UK had seen a significant increase in the number of Russians seeking to invest in property, with one estate agent reporting a 30% increase in interest in the first quarter of 2017. Prominent Russian figures with ties to the Vladimir Putin regime own British properties worth nearly £1.1bn, although the true value may be greater because of the way ownership can be concealed. In the Commons earlier this week, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, cited the case of Russia’s first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, who owns two flats in Whitehall bought in 2014 for £11.4m by a company that campaigners have alleged the minister owns. Shuvalov’s official salary in 2014 was £112,000. Campaigners have repeatedly called for similar register of beneficial ownership to reveal details of companies based in Britain’s overseas territories, some of which have become major tax havens, which the government has so far resisted imposing, despite previous support by David Cameron. British crown dependencies and overseas territories are currently only required to provide information on the true owners of offshore companies to law enforcement agencies, and only if requested. The business minister, Andrew Griffiths, confirmed on Thursday that the UK would seek to introduce the UK property legislation early in the second session of this parliament. “The UK is taking a leading role in the global fight against corruption, including cracking down on the use of shell companies to launder dirty money by buying up some of London’s prime real estate,” he said. “Our public register will ensure we know who owns UK property wherever they are from and will help authorities come down hard on frontmen seeking to conceal their paymasters’ true identities. “This is the first register of its kind in the world and we must be careful to ensure it strikes the right balance between improving transparency and minimising burdens on legitimate owners.” In the announcement, the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy said more than £180m worth of property in the UK has been brought under criminal investigation as the suspected proceeds of corruption since 2004, and more than 75% of properties currently under investigation use off-shore corporate secrecy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/25/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-sparkling","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T08:00:48Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'sparkling'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/25/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-sparkling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/25/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-sparkling","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'sparkling'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘sparkling.’ Share your photos of what sparkling means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

Figures reported to the government equalities office from Penguin Random House, Hachette UK and HarperCollins reveal that while women make up almost two thirds of the workforce, on average men are paid more. The biggest disparity was seen at Hachette UK, where the median gender pay gap was 24.71%, and the mean gender pay gap was 29.69%. Hachette attributed the imbalance to issues including the higher number of men in senior roles; the higher proportion of women in lower pay brackets; and the higher number of women working flexibly and part time. When employees from the wider entity of the Hachette UK Group were taken into account – which includes warehouse staff from Hachette Distribution and LBS as well as other publishing imprints – the difference is less glaring, with women paid 14.18% less using the mean and 1.32% more using the median. The UK’s largest publisher, Penguin Random House (PRH), reported that women were paid 1.6% more than men when considering the median, which compares mid points of the pay distribution. But using the mean – which totals the hourly rates of pay for men and women and divides by the number of male and female employees – the pattern was reversed, with men earning 11.3% more on average than women. According to PRH, this gap was partly attributable to “an increased proportion of men in more senior and higher paid roles in comparison to our overall gender split”, and partly down to a high proportion of male contractors used during the reporting period. At HarperCollins, the median pay gap was 10.41%, and the mean was 16.06% – a situation that company attributed to “an increased proportion of men in the top quartile where we have more highly paid roles”. Figures from the book industry are comfortably better than national averages, which stand at 18.4% for median earnings and 17.4% for mean earnings. All three companies employ more women than men, with a split of 58% at PRH, 66% at Hachette and 64.5% at HarperCollins. But the balance was reversed at board level, with 44% of the board at PRH female, 33% at Hachette and the executive committee at HarperCollins made up of a male CEO in addition to eight men and eight women. Hachette UK’s chief executive, David Shelley, told the Guardian that he was “saddened” by the company’s results, “but unfortunately not surprised in many ways, as I am really aware that there are a disproportionate number of men in the top quartile”. “It is an historic imbalance, and we are taking huge steps to correct it,” he said, pointing to initiatives including unconscious bias training, which was rolled out last year, improvements to parental leave, blind recruitment, and a “diverse future leaders” mentorship programme in which board members mentor a member of staff who aspires to board membership and feels underrepresented on the current line-up. Staff, said Shelley, had reacted with “shock, sadness [and] frustration” to the report, “but also with a great amount of will to change things and create something different”. The company has set the target of 66% of its top pay quartile being female by 2020, to match its overall gender balance, with 50% of its board to be female. “The numbers are stark,” he said, “but there is an extraordinary group of people at Hachette dedicated to changing the story for us, and I feel very dedicated to working with them in the years to come to make Hachette a gold standard employer in terms of representing all people at all levels of the business.” Penguin Random House said it hoped to “work towards a more balanced gender representation in the layer below senior leadership” and introduce initiatives including transparent pay banding as it tackled its gender pay gap. “We recognise there is more we can do to better support women working across our organisation, to level the playing field and ensure a truly gender-neutral working environment,” it said in its report. HarperCollins said in its report that “while it is positive that our gender pay gap is lower than the UK average we know there is more we can do”, citing planned initiatives and programmes already in place “to encourage both the retention of senior women and the recruitment and progression of more women into senior roles”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/23/john-bolton-cambridge-analytica-videos-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T17:13:59Z","webTitle":"Trump adviser John Bolton worked with Cambridge Analytica on YouTube voter experiment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/john-bolton-cambridge-analytica-videos-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/23/john-bolton-cambridge-analytica-videos-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Trump adviser John Bolton worked with Cambridge Analytica on YouTube voter experiment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s new national security adviser John Bolton collaborated with the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica on an experiment to target YouTube videos to different “psychographic” profiles of US voters, the Guardian can reveal. The project, to explore how different types of political campaign ads would resonate with an electorate divided into different personality types, involved Bolton appearing on-screen endorsing candidates in New Hampshire, North Carolina and Arkansas in the run-up to the 2014 midterms. Details of the project are contained in emails obtained by the Guardian. They shed light on an earlier report published on Friday in the New York Times, which identified Bolton, who was appointed by Trump on Thursday, as an early beneficiary of Cambridge Analytica’s controversial Facebook data. In an email about the 2014 collaboration with the John Bolton Super Pac, Robert Murtfeld, a Cambridge Analytica executive who left earlier this year, described the video project as having “used our psychographic data to create ads targeting people based on their personalities”. Bolton, a national security hawk, adopts significantly different tones in the videos, depending on the personalities of the voters the videos were targeted at. The voters were partitioned according to personality analysis conducted by Cambridge Analytica. “This was the first real results that we had, where you could say: this works,” one source with knowledge of the video-testing said. “You could see the difference between a control group and our targeted messaging, and the uplift was huge.” The company has long claimed to be able to divide voters according to the “Big Five” psychological traits – openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism – and the experiment reveals how the company seeks to do that that. “This ad targets people high in neuroticism, who tend to be anxious and to see the world as a dangerous place,” a Cambridge Analytica employee said in the email, linking to an ad which opens with Bolton looking at the camera saying “terrorists love porous borders”. The ad, which is for now-senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, is cut to footage of military conflicts around the world, with dark, thudding noises in the background. Analysis by the company said of the ad: “It highlights the threats facing America – in this case Islamic terrorism – and makes the case to the viewer that they should support a strong national security policy in order to keep America safe.” In contrast, a feel-good ad supporting Thom Thillis, a Senate candidate at the time in North Carolina, with images of a meadow in the sunshine, and shots of crowds in the Washington Mall, was intended for “conscientious” voters. The company described these voters as “collected, orderly and traditional … they admire the same qualities in the leader”, and as such, a rather different Bolton appears on screen. He is shown with Kofi Annan – a reference to Bolton’s work as the US ambassador to the United Nations – along with upbeat, light, music. In an advert targeting voters who exhibit “openness”, on behalf of Republican senate candidate Scott Brown, there are shots of refugees, and humanitarian crises. “Millions of men, women and children are fleeing Iraq and Syria to safety,” a female narrator says, calling on people to vote for Brown. Bolton makes no appearance in the ad, although there is a flash of a logo for the John Bolton Super Pac, which collaborated on the project with Cambridge Analytica. There was fourth ad for voters who were deemed to be “high in agreeableness”, and a fifth aimed at voters who were extroverted. “This ad is built around the concept of ‘leadership’ in different spheres of American society,” a Cambridge Analytica employee said of that ad. “People high in this trait tend to admire energetic, decisive actions.” The video project appears to have been part of a wider service provided to Bolton’s Super Pac, which paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.1m since 2014 for “research” and “survey research,” according to Center for Public Integrity analysis of campaign finance filings. The Observer reported last weekend that the personal data of about 50 million Americans had been harvested and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. The tech firm used personal information in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements, former employee Christopher Wylie told the Observer. Cambridge Analytica has denied Wylie’s claims, and said that it had deleted all of the Facebook data once it became aware of how it had been obtained. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have called for senior executives of the firm to testify in light of the new revelations and the company is already being investigated by the UK authorities. Garrett Marquis, a spokesperson for Bolton commented: “With respect to any allegations of impropriety, the John Bolton Super Pac was completely unaware of anything Cambridge Analytica did until recent press reports. Furthermore, the John Bolton Super Pac hasn’t worked with Cambridge Analytica on any independent-expenditure effort since 2016.” This article was amended on 23 March to make clear that Robert Murtfeld no longer works at Cambridge Analytica, and to clarify the attribution of quotes from a company email."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/27/how-much-power-should-students-have","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T06:45:07Z","webTitle":"‘They’re trying to take away our rights.’ How much power should students have?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/27/how-much-power-should-students-have","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/27/how-much-power-should-students-have","fields":{"headline":"‘They’re trying to take away our rights.’ How much power should students have?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At its annual conference this week, the National Union of Students will discuss whether its members have enough say about tuition fees and university regulation. The government claims it wants students to play a central role through the new Office for Students – but barred them from the OfS board if they had been involved in the NUS. Charlie Peters Philosophy student, University of Edinburgh “I have yet to meet a fellow undergraduate who is fit for the role of forming higher education policy. I would feel much more comfortable with those decisions being made by career professionals and experts. Students can give their views, of course, but they should not be given actual power over the management of higher education. It is extremely tough to find students who can actually represent the views of their peers. The NUS is the main vehicle of student democracy, but its election turnouts are woefully low. The vast majority of students simply do not want to engage with public policy. There is a vast disconnect between the views of most students and those selected to represent them – undergraduates have largely ignored the lecturers’ strikes [over their pensions], turning up to campus and crossing picket lines every day to get on with their work.” Prof David Green Vice-chancellor, University of Worcester “English higher education policy is a disastrous stew. The government’s scandalous manipulation of student representation on the OfS board exposed by the Commissioner for Public Appointments is an outrage. Students and their elected representatives have a huge role, alongside university staff and the many, many allies of universities in society, in saving England’s universities. At Worcester, elected student representatives serve on the board of governors and its committees, including audit, finance and development and human resources. We have over 500 elected student representatives for courses and academic institutes. Democracy is thriving. And I support a student representative joining the committee that decides the vice-chancellor’s remuneration.” Mahatir Pasha General secretary, LSE students’ union “The government says it wants students to play a bigger role, but which students? What we are seeing now is a clear attempt to push student unions out of the picture and reduce their significance as it tries to sort out the mess it’s made by its marketisation of higher education. Student unions are seen by universities as legitimate representatives of students and provide a bridge between individual students and the management. I am struggling to see, operationally, how the OfS will be able to work without this bridge and deal directly with individual students. It is nonsense to suggest that student unions do not represent students. Sabbatical officers, such as myself, who help to lead the direction of the union, lay out our policies and are directly elected by students. They can always choose a different candidate.” Nick Hillman Director, Higher Education Policy Institute “Students should have huge influence over what universities do. That is one reason why Hepi surveys students for their views so often. But until things such as turnout in student union elections reach a respectable level, I will remain wary about reserving lots of formal positions of influence for students. One specific problem is that existing students tend to have different views from future students and these key interests have to be balanced. Having one or two student union representatives on governing bodies makes sense. I even think it is fine for them to have a say in the fee-setting arrangements, as long as other interests are also fully represented. In my experience, for example, students tended to push for higher fees at their universities as they did not want to be regarded as attending a low-grade institution, even though the official NUS position was to oppose all fees.” Azza Abdulla NUS education officer, University of Leicester “Students should be involved in all university decision-making bodies. At Leicester, students are co-leading with academics in everything from an inclusive curriculum to assessment – and that’s a huge step forward. Our students were not consulted in the appointment of the new chancellor, David Willetts, and that’s led to anger and disappointment. When students don’t have a voice, this is what happens. Excluding student unions is hugely problematic. The government appears to want to take away our democratic lobbying rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/23/mark-anthony-conditt-terrorism-christianity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T13:50:10Z","webTitle":"Why Mark Anthony Conditt – a white Christian – isn't called a terrorist | Daniel José Camacho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/mark-anthony-conditt-terrorism-christianity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/mark-anthony-conditt-terrorism-christianity","fields":{"headline":"Why Mark Anthony Conditt – a white Christian – isn't called a terrorist","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If a Muslim man planted bombs in predominately white neighborhoods before blowing himself up, you could bet that the White House and various media outlets would label him a terrorist and draw some connection between his religion and his violent acts. But the case of the Austin bomber reveals an enduring double standard: white Christian terrorists continue to get a free pass. According to a Buzzfeed report, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt – the one responsible for the recent bombings in Austin – was part of conservative survivalist circles. An acquaintance of Conditt confirmed he was involved in a group called Righteous Invasion of Truth, “a Bible study and outdoors group for homeschooled kids, created and named by the kids and their families that included monthly activities such as archery, gun skills and water balloon fights.” Thus far, the White House press secretary has denied any link between the Austin bombings and terrorism. Never mind that Austin was terrorized in a three-week long serial bombing campaign. The Austin police chief claims Conditt should primarily be seen as a “very challenged young man” because he did not mention terrorism or hate in the video he left behind before carrying out the bombings. I guess we should let all bombers self-identify now? Racial and religious privilege intersect in how Conditt is being perceived. Because he is white, his acts are reduced to a personal problem even though white American men have consistently posed a bigger domestic terrorist threat than Muslim foreigners who get treated as systemic threat. Since Conditt is a Christian, his faith is considered coincidental in spite of the fact that conservative survivalist circles explicitly pursue a racialized, apocalyptic social project. Many refuse to label Conditt a terrorist over technicalities involving whether his acts were clearly “politically motivated.” But that’s the luxury of being white. To be white is to be considered culturally and politically neutral even when you’re part of a long legacy of white extremists. Granted, violence is complicated and its motivations cannot be reduced to one factor. Nevertheless, even if Conditt was not primarily motivated by his faith, we are still right to question whether such a segregated and militant religious ideology can feed ignorance, hate and violent acts. We may never find a video or journal in which Conditt claims that his religious faith was the prime motivator for his terrorizing acts. But even if we did, the double standard would probably still endure. According to a PRRI survey: “White evangelical Protestants are the most likely (87%) to disown Christian terrorists who claim to be acting in Christianity’s name. However, they are among the least likely (44%) to say the same about terrorists who say they’re Muslim.” In other words, white evangelicals find it hard to believe that white Christian terrorists can truly exist. Yet this flies against everything that has happened in the history of the US. At one point, almost half of the Christians in this country went to war over the power to own black slaves. When that failed, they reverted to organized terrorism. As Christian writer Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove powerfully recounts in his book Reconstructing the Gospel: Finding Freedom from Slaveholder Religion, the era of reconstruction following the civil war was interrupted by Christian terrorist attacks, such as the Colfax massacre that took place on Easter Sunday in 1873. The history of Christian-identifying terrorist groups such as the Klu Klux Klan shows how the violence of Christian terrorists continually flies below this nation’s radar. Thinking about Stephon Clark getting shot 20 times while unarmed in his backyard and about the reluctance of many to name Mark Anthony Conditt a white terrorist makes me wonder: it’s almost as if this nation was founded on the sacredness and holiness of white violence. This is a violence set apart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/25/walter-tull-football-pioneer-war-hero-tottenham-northampton-military-cross","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Football pioneer and war hero Walter Tull may be honoured at last | Ed Aarons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/25/walter-tull-football-pioneer-war-hero-tottenham-northampton-military-cross","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/25/walter-tull-football-pioneer-war-hero-tottenham-northampton-military-cross","fields":{"headline":"Football pioneer and war hero Walter Tull may be honoured at last","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For the best part of 80 years, it was not just the body of the British Army’s first black officer that lay buried in the killing fields of northern France. Walter Tull, born in Folkestone to a Bajan carpenter and English mother in 1888, had also played as an inside forward for Tottenham and Northampton before the first world war. He died on 25 March 1918 near the village of Favreuil in the Pas-de-Calais region - one of 250,000 allied troops to perish during the spring offensive. A series of events in Northampton this weekend will mark the centenary of his death, with the Football League backing a government-led project that celebrates Tull’s legacy. Starting on Monday, Tull 100 will offer small-scale funding to local groups in an effort to increase participation in sport among ethnic minority groups. Tull featured on a special £5 coin in 2014 to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of war but his death was never mentioned in any official reports of the time. Until the mid-1990s when his family and the historian Phil Vasili began to look into what had happened to Tull and twin brother, Edward, the only evidence of his fate was the presence of his name on the Arras memorial for those who have no known grave. “It wasn’t politically expedient to tell his story because he embodied a contradiction,” Vasili says. “The manual for military law said officers had to be of pure European descent and he wasn’t. It wasn’t until June 1918 that the army council said they would officially accept men of colour into British regiments. Honouring him when he died might have exposed the institutional racism that existed.” After making his name with the amateurs of Clapton, Tull had enjoyed early success at Tottenham making 20 appearances, scoring four goals, before he was purchased by Herbert Chapman’s Northampton in 1911. In spite of the racism he faced from opponents and opposition supporters, he played more than 100 times for the club and became an established member of the side which regularly challenged at the top end of the Southern League. Tull was among the first to sign up when war was declared in 1914. A member of the footballers’ battalion of the Middlesex Regiment, he fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 30 May, 1917 despite laws supposedly preventing him from doing so. Tull was cited for his “gallantry and coolness” during the Italian offensive of that year after safely leading 26 men on a night raiding party. Vasili believes he was subsequently recommended for a military cross but the ministry of defence has always maintained it has no record of that. In 2016, Vasili uncovered fresh evidence that could suggest a reason for the army’s reluctance to recognise him in the form of a top-secret memo sent by a General White – the head of recruitment in New York – to the War and Colonial Offices. That made it clear any “wooly [sic] headed niggers” were not wanted for the forthcoming spring offensive that eventually led to the allied victory later that year. “We now refuse to post coloured men to ‘white units,’” the memo stated. “These ‘niggers’ must therefore go to native units if accepted. Can we take them for W Indies or other bns [battalions]?” Northampton erected a memorial to their former player outside Sixfields Stadium in 1999 and still take the lead in remembering one of English football’s first pioneers. Vasili, who has recently published an updated version of his book Walter Tull, 1888‑1918, Officer, Footballer: All the Guns in France Couldn’t Wake Me, will also be speaking at a ceremony in the town centre on Saturday before a memorial service takes place at All Saints Church on Sunday. Members of Tull’s family will be present and Vasili says they are fully in support of the campaign for him to be honoured posthumously. On Friday, a letter signed by 127 MPs including Jeremy Corbyn called on Theresa May to “right the wrong” and award Tull a military cross, although that would require a change to current rules. There is, however, a precedent. In 2015, the United States awarded Medals of Honor to Henry Johnson, who was black, and William Shemin, who was Jewish, in belated recognition of their sacrifice during the conflict and Vasili hopes the British government will follow suit. “It’s a carbon copy of Walter’s story,” he says. “When they were awarded their medals, Barack Obama acknowledged that we can’t put right the injustices of the past but we can say sorry for them to try and make amends. It’s long overdue recognition. I’m just hoping the MoD will take the lead from Obama and recognise him properly. “By giving him his military cross it’s almost like a symbolic gesture to apologise for the injustices that other soldiers of colour have gone through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
