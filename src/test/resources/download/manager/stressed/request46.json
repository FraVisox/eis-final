Yet that is what we are told has happened. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, came to parliament on Wednesday to confess that up to 450,000 older women in England may have somehow fallen off the breast cancer screening system, thanks to a computer glitch. Unravelling the real-life consequences of that is a complicated and contested business, but Hunt said it was likely there were people who “would have been alive today if this had not happened”; and that up to 270 lives may have been shortened. The next few days will be difficult ones for already overloaded GP surgeries and screening clinics, with anxious women now calling the hotline set up by the Department of Health in their thousands. But brushing something like this under the carpet was hardly an option. It should be said, however, that this is not another Windrush scandal. It’s down to a faulty computer algorithm, rather than to some kind of hostile medical environment; the glitch that wrongly cancelled some women’s scans crept in accidentally in 2009, during the setting up of a pilot project on whether it was worth expanding the screening programme, not in some attempt to chop it back. Nonetheless, eight years is a hell of a long time for nobody to notice. Older women – that perennially invisible group – can be forgiven for wondering whether it would have happened to anyone else. Those worst affected would have been in their late 60s when their scans were cancelled and perhaps in their 70s when they started getting sick, a time of life when bad news is half-expected and medicine becomes mainly about managing decline not reversing it; when routine visits to the doctor end in apologetic mumbling that unfortunately, these things are to be expected when you get older. And older women are so often not the type to make a fuss. They’re of a generation that waits to be served, doesn’t like to bother anyone, trusts the people in charge to know what they’re doing. Of late, they have not been repaid well for that trust. Think of the Waspi (Women’s Against State Pension Inequality) women, who didn’t realise the government had moved the goalposts on their state pension age until it was too late, and whose subsequent rage at their poverty has fallen on deaf ears. Think even of the middle-aged women who suffered for years from complications from vaginal mesh, whose complaints of agonising pain and infections weren’t taken nearly seriously enough at first, because they were often post-menopausal and well, what do you expect at your age, after a few difficult childbirths? They too found it difficult to get a public hearing, because incontinence and pelvic pain are not considered glamorous stories. Given the indignities heaped upon them – their erasure from a culture still fixated on the young – it’s surprising in a way that older women are not more radicalised politically. To be fair to the NHS, it’s possible that the inquiry Hunt has ordered will discover that this isn’t as bad as it initially looks. Most of the women who missed a scan would thankfully have been perfectly healthy; some of those who didn’t get called in will have had scans for other reasons, such as finding a lump by themselves or being part of a programme of extra checks scheduled for women who have had breast cancer in the past. It may be that there were never enough cases clustered in the same place for doctors to spot a pattern of patients presenting with tumours who inexplicably hadn’t had mammograms for years, or for clinics to wonder why women who diligently showed up for previous scans had mysteriously stopped coming. My heart goes out to all the grieving families who will now be wondering if their mothers and wives could have lived for longer, but sadly even some of those who died after missing a scan might not necessarily have been saved by screening. Early diagnosis gives a much better chance of survival, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of anything. The sad thing, however, is that the women themselves presumably weren’t asking questions. When the letters stopped coming, they must have just assumed they’d had their lot from the NHS. It’s an age when you get used to dropping off people’s radar, after all. It is partly to avoid such human blind spots, of course, that algorithms like those our public services now use to manage data exist in the first place. Machines are meant to excel at routine tasks like churning out appointments and they don’t make emotional judgments about what you can expect at your age (or at least, not unless they’re programmed by people who do). But we have grown so used to relying on computers to do the thinking and the remembering for us that we barely realise how much has been delegated to systems we don’t particularly understand, and didn’t realise could fail until it was too late – as those TSB customers still struggling to get into their bank accounts after an almighty car crash of an IT upgrade will know. The cervical cancer scandal currently unfolding in Ireland, where early abnormalities were not picked up in the cases of over 200 women who went on to develop cancer, and who in some cases have since died, is another grim reminder that no system is infallible. It is important not to over-romanticise the past. These scandals did not used to happen, but only because worse ones did; before screening, more women died unnecessarily. For all its flaws and the hotly debated risks of over-treatment, screening has saved thousands of lives over the years, including in my own family. The risk remains small, but if you’re putting off a smear test, prostate check or mammogram then for heaven’s sake, go. But it isn’t women’s fault that, for whatever reason, the system missed any clue that something had gone awry for eight years. And all too often, dismissiveness and casualness is what older women have been taught to expect from a society that looks right through them. They need to be reassured that the doctor will, in all possible senses of the word, see them now. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/may/03/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/03/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/03/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An article about self-harm among women in prison (Women still dying in jail 11 years after critical report, 2 May, page 12) said that 2,093 women per 1,000 self-harmed in English and Welsh prisons last year.

She is eventually captured by Yevgeny and when he finally realises it is Carrie, not Simone, that he’s been chasing, he drops her with a straight right. The grin that comes from her bloodied face tells him she’s won. Simone has been extracted. Carrie came off the ropes swinging, stole his lover from under his nose and played him like an accordion. Still, a filmed apology from Carrie to the Russian people would go some way to rewriting the narrative. Yevgeny deploys a classic carrot-and-stick strategy. Comply and she gets her meds; defy and she goes mad. Carrie chooses the latter as we know she always must. Death before dishonour. The mission comes first. ‘Christ’s sake. I’m offering you three of the highest-level captures in the last decade’ Saul has been on enough death-or-glory missions to know that it’s the journey home that’s the tricky part. Millions are watching the assault on the GRU building, making it the least covert covert operation in history. No wonder Mirov starts asking questions and when his delegation is barred from entering the airport, Saul is forced to appeal directly to the abysmal President Warner for help. Things look grim but Warner goes from zero to hero in a flash, slapping down Paley and shredding the Russian ambassador in the Oval Office. Either Saul’s party make it on to the plane or the ambassador will be detained along with every other Russian diplomat in the country. One phone call and the barrier comes up. Saul, Simone and the rest of the gang are free to leave. As they fly away, Saul can’t help thinking that he’s left a little something behind in Moscow – blonde, bit of a handful, but oh so worth it. It takes seven months of negotiating, wheel spinning and nailbiting before the exchange is made on the Estonian border. The broken woman they dump at his feet is Carrie all right, but exactly how much of her is left is anybody’s guess. ‘For over 200 years, we have had an angel on our shoulder in this country. Lately, I’ve been wondering where she’s gone’ Seldom will you see a vindication as emphatic as that enjoyed by Elizabeth. Simone Martin’s testimony puts her in the clear and back in the White House. She has the mandate and moral authority to do as she pleases. A string of executive orders expanding sanctions against Russia are lined up, but first she broadcasts directly to the American people. The woman who made a career of tearing up the script speaks off the cuff and from the heart. She starts with some division-bad-unity-good stuff that any chump could have written, but she then throws a curveball. She identifies the biggest obstacle in the way of progress: President Elizabeth Keane. Her next and final act as president is the removal of this most divisive figure. You can almost hear David’s strangled cries of protest, but the lady’s not for turning. Now that Warner has proven his mettle, she has a decent enough substitute. Let him be fed feet first into the wood chipper of public opinion and see how he fares. Notes and observations I am certain we will see Yevgeny again. Like Carrie, he’s a master of his craft with few peers and a problem with authority. Being bested this time out won’t sit well with him – expect the payback to be epic. Elizabeth spitting in Paley’s face as he grovelled on his knees for clemency for his family was totally badass, but was it presidential? As she is no longer president, I don’t suppose it matters. Nothing from Janet this week, only the reports that she is “cooperating with investigators”, ie throwing Paley under the bus. Lest we forget, it was she who sabotaged Saul’s Moscow operation. Keep your eye on this one – she’s shady. The Russians bodying the innocent Muscovite whom Carrie had wrapped her red scarf around shows that Homeland can do slapstick alarmingly well. Now all that’s over, relax with Saul covering Stephen Merritt, Mark Bolan and Randy Newman. A big thank you for your interest and your comments this season.

A cut would be better advised","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The City has had the date ringed in the diary for months. On Thursday the Bank of England is supposed to raise interest rates, taking them above 0.5% for the first time in almost a decade. It’s not going to happen. A deluge of weak data over the past month has surprised the Bank. It has badly misread the economy, and not for the first time. The message had previously been clear. There was a limit to how long inflation above the government’s 2% target could be tolerated at a time when the steady fall in unemployment was likely to lead to stronger wage pressure. The City knew what was meant when the Bank talked about the need for an “ongoing tightening” of policy. In the past few weeks, however, it has emerged that growth came to a virtual standstill in the first quarter of 2018 and, judging by the first business surveys for April, has not picked up much since. Inflation has come down more quickly than expected. The housing market is dead. Consumers are reluctant to spend. Demand for credit is weak. The idea that the Bank of England would increase the cost of borrowing in the current circumstances is fanciful. In 21 years of operational independence, the Bank has never cut interest rates when the latest estimate of the quarterly growth rate was below 0.4%. The financial markets have moved on. They now think the Bank will signal on Thursday that the rate rise has not been abandoned, merely postponed for three months until there is more evidence of the economy recovering and wage pressure building. The monetary policy committee has a credibility problem though, and anything it says should be taken with a very large pinch of salt. Its inability to forecast the economy accurately undermines its attempts to provide forward guidance over the future path of interest rates. Any one who thinks the MPC is simply waiting for August to move should recall that the February inflation report said interest rates would need to rise “somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent” than it had anticipated at the end of 2017. Growth was then expected to come in at 0.3% in the first quarter even after the weather disruption, but it was actually 0.1%. Looking at the data, there is actually a stronger case for interest rates being cut than there is for them being raised. In part that’s because the government’s fiscal policy – the Treasury’s combination of public spending and tax decisions – is still holding growth back. Philip Hammond eased austerity when he became chancellor, but did not abandon the strategy pursued by his predecessor, George Osborne. As the National Institute for Economic and Social Research pointed out last week, public spending as a share of GDP has come down from 45.1% in 2009-10 to an estimated 38.9% in 2016-17. But although spending is already below its postwar average of 39.3% of GDP, the government’s plans further falls to 37.6% by 2022-23. There will be no let up as Hammond pursues his goal of balancing the budget by the middle of the next decade. In its latest quarterly review, NIESR has used four factors – existing spending commitments, the proportion of the population over 85, the growth rate and the UK’s debt-to-GDP ratio – to estimate the amount of public spending that previous postwar governments would have chosen if confronted by today’s circumstances. The thinktank calls this “warranted” spending because it reflects the historic choices made by democratically elected governments in the past. Using this approach, it found that the pace of deficit reduction was slower than its estimate of that warranted during the 2010 to 2015 parliament but that since 2014-15 it has been more stringent than it should have been. Using the same approach to look at individual areas of public spending, the thinktank found that even the NHS – which has had its budget ringfenced – has been treated too harshly. It estimates that in 2016-17, the health sector needed extra funding of around £440 a head. Spending was also below warranted levels in education, public order and safety and social care. “The government will find it hard to resist pressure to restore the quality of public services in these areas,” NIESR concludes. A few eyebrows will be raised at the idea that George Osborne’s austerity programme was not tough enough during the years of the coalition government, particularly among economists of a Keynesian bent, but it is hard to dispute the NIESR argument that austerity fatigue has now set in. The public sector is having trouble recruiting staff and voters are starting to fret about the quality of public services. Hammond says deficit reduction is needed so that the public finances are in decent enough shape to cope when another recession comes along. Some in the City are urging the Bank to raise interest rates for the same reason. Self-evidently it would be better to face another downturn with the government in the black and official interest rates at 5% rather than 0.5%, because it would give the Treasury and the Bank more policy space. But the idea that the MPC needs to raise rates and that Hammond should be cutting public spending – especially when it is so cheap to borrow – in order to stockpile ammunition to deal with the next recession is daft. The point of economic policy is to prevent recessions, not to cause them by tightening policy when it is unnecessary. That’s not prudence. It’s self-flagellation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/11/the-best-recent-science-fiction-eric-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"The best recent science fiction – reviews roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/11/the-best-recent-science-fiction-eric-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/11/the-best-recent-science-fiction-eric-brown","fields":{"headline":"The best recent science fiction – reviews roundup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Heather Child’s debut novel, Everything About You (Orbit, £14.99), reads as though the author has travelled to the future and returned with an itemised report. We are in near-future Britain, and Child has extrapolated from current trends in social media to catalogue the pitfalls and benefits of a world in which most citizens take part in various forms of virtual reality and smartware curates everyone’s identity. The novel begins eight years after Freya’s 17-year-old stepsister, Ruby, vanished without trace, and Freya has been living with a burden of guilt and grief. When she borrows her ex-boyfriend’s Smartface hardware, its algorithms trawl the datasphere and provide Freya with a default virtual helpmate – a construct based on her sister’s old online presence. The novel is low on plot but high on acute psychological observation as Child skilfully portrays Freya’s growing identification with her missing sister’s virtual alter ego, while she investigates what happened to her. Everything About You is a captivating and assured first novel. Hunted by GX Todd (Headline, £16.99) is the second volume in the post-apocalyptic Voices series, which opened last year with the highly acclaimed Defender, depicting the collapse of society and the flight of Lacey and Pilgrim across a blighted America in search of Lacey’s sister. The cause of global breakdown was a mystery, but it left survivors with voices in their heads, driving many to the point of madness. Hunted follows straight on from the first novel, introducing two groups of new characters hellbent on finding Lacey for their own reasons. It’s a thrilling journey through a bleak landscape haunted by echoes of the past and riven by the violence of desperate people. Todd skilfully captures hope and humanity in the lives of characters whom the reader comes to care about: Hunted, like Defender, is an impressive achievement. In A Man of Shadows, the first volume of Jeff Noon’s John Nyquist mysteries, Nyquist was investigating a case in the cities of Dayzone and Nocturna, where the corrupt traded in time rather than money. In the mind-bending follow-up, The Body Library (Angry Robot, £8.99), Nyquist is treading the mean streets of Storyville. He has been hired to report on the movements of Patrick Wellborn during the international festival of words – only to find himself on the run after killing Wellborn. So far so noir, but this is Noon, mash-meister and metafictional supremo, and in Storyville he has created a fantastical, nightmarish world in which citizens are policed by “narrative officers”, all the streets and districts are named after famous writers, and individuals cast off alter egos who go on to inhabit lives, and narratives, of their own. It’s a heady psychedelic mix, packed with literary allusions, which brilliantly explores notions of self-identity, personal awareness and how we fit into our own stories. Claire North goes from strength to strength. In her fifth novel, 84K (Orbit, £18.99), the world is ruled by the Company, a merciless bureaucracy that places a price on every citizen’s life and on every crime committed. Those with wealth can settle up for their crimes, while the poor must pay for their misdemeanours by becoming little more than slaves. Theo Miller works as a criminal audit officer, tabulating the costs. He knows the system is corrupt, but toes the company line – for good reason. Miller is not who he seems to be and has a dark secret which is in danger of being revealed when an old flame re-enters his life. Her daughter was taken into the state orphanage at birth and she wants Miller’s help to find her. What follows is a tense, moving story set in drawing from current political trends to present a draconian future similar to that of Nineteen Eighty-Four. Roger Levy’s The Rig (Titan, £8.99) follows the fortunes of two difficult young men: Alef is emotionless, with an eidetic memory, and Pellonhorc is self-centred and psychotic. Together, they scheme to take control of the vast, multi-planet business venture known as “the Whisper”. Earth is no more, and humankind has taken refuge in a distant star system. On many of its planets, religion – known as “Goddery” – has been banished and replaced with a system called AfterLife. At birth, citizens are implanted with devices that record their lives; after death, they are frozen and stored, their recorded existences passing into the public domain to be judged and voted on and the winners rewarded with a second chance to live. How Alef and Pellonhorc rise to power, and how AfterLife came into existence, are at the heart of this meaty, ambitious novel; Levy lays bare the excesses of capitalism and the corrupting power of unregulated control. • Eric Brown’s latest novel is Murder Takes a Turn (Severn House)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/04/name-gameshow-app-thats-an-online-smash-hq-trivia","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T13:21:43Z","webTitle":"HQ Trivia: the gameshow app that's an online smash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/04/name-gameshow-app-thats-an-online-smash-hq-trivia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/04/name-gameshow-app-thats-an-online-smash-hq-trivia","fields":{"headline":"HQ Trivia: the gameshow app that's an online smash","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Imagine the intellectual and social pressure of a pub quiz, then multiply it by more than 2 million people. Every day, at 3pm and 9pm sharp, an army of teenagers, students, pensioners and office workers stop what they are doing, whip out their smartphones and fire up an app to take part in a new online craze called HQ Trivia, the pub quiz brought kicking and screaming into the smartphone era. As many as 2 million people in the US and about 200,000 playing the UK version at the same appointed hours watch a live quizmaster broadcasting from a New York studio surrounded by colourful graphics bursting from the screen. The host asks players a series of increasingly difficult questions in a 15-minute version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire crossed with the Hunger Games. There’s no forgetting the game times. Players, called HQties, are reminded by a phone notification. Anyone and everyone can play for free all at the same time, eliminated with one wrong answer. The prize pot ranges from £500 to £200,000 or more, to be shared among the winners. Answer 12 heart-pounding multiple-choice questions right and the money is yours. Few are going to get rich playing. In Thursday night’s UK game more than 160,000 people started playing, and 51 answered all of the questions correctly. With a prize pot of just £550, they banked £11 each. The catch is that players have to answer each question within 10 seconds, which is barely enough time to figure out what’s being asked, let alone answer with any real thought. The 10 second slot means the answers can’t be Googled, because by the time contestants brains have assessed the three possible responses the time has run out. There are also distractions – a constant stream of inane chat from the app’s hundreds of thousands of viewers which streams across the bottom of the screen and “shout-outs” – birthday wishes and other mentions blurted out by the host between questions. The game, which is available for Android and the iPhone, is the brainchild of Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll , the co-founders of Vine, the six-second video-sharing app bought by Twitter for $30m (£22m) and since closed down. It is currently burning through $15m of capital venture money provided by Lightspeed Venture Partners, an early investor in Snapchat, and an investment fund set up by PayPal’s founder, Peter Thiel. The app launched in the US in August 2017 and is hosted by the New York standup Scott Rogowsky, who has quickly gained cult status as the “quiz daddy”. The UK version is hosted by British-born, New York-based Sharon Carpenter. It was launched in January and is following a similar trajectory to its US sibling. Carpenter answers in her couldn’t-be-more-British daytime TV manner and delivers snippets of extra trivia between questions. Thousands are eliminated as the rounds go by. In particularly gruelling “savage” questions tens of thousands can be ruled out. Once a week there’s even a special edition of the game in which remaining players continue to answer questions until only one is left holding the whole cash prize. It can be quite riveting. The popularity of the app has not gone unnoticed. Celebrities and brands have queued up to appear as guest hosts in the US or to sponsor the games. Sting, Shaggy, Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson, Robert De Niro and Ryan Seacrest have all made appearances. Nike gave away Air Max trainers on one $100,000 game and the movie Ready Player One pumped the prize up to $250,000 for another. The hope for the investors ploughing their money into the game and financing the prize pots is that at some point down the line HQ Trivia will be able to take advertising, offer more sponsored games and product giveaways or pivot users away from the quizzes into more direct-to-smartphone live interactive entertainment. The app has faced its fair share of controversies already, primarily about its founders and investors, and apps such as The Q and QuizBiz are lining up with similar combinations of cash prizes and celebrity hosts. Right now though the live-stream quiz crown is HQ’s to lose. 12 questions Here are the dozen questions, in order, played at Thursday 3 May at 3pm (BST).

Vee Matu is one of at least 1,000 highly skilled migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK who are facing deportation because of the application of the controversial section 322(5) of the Immigration Act. The section is designed to tackle criminals and those judged to be a threat to national security, but highly skilled workers are being refused ILR on the grounds of so-called bad character and conduct, after being accused of making minor and legal amendments to their tax records, or having discrepancies in declared income. Matu, not her real name, has not slept in her bed since 19 April, when the Home Office said it would deport her. “The stories I hear about when the enforcement teams come are too terrifying. I don’t want to be dragged out of my house from my bed in the middle of the night,” she said. “So I sit, fully dressed in the lounge all night. I have a bag packed and I sit, waiting for the knock on the door. “But when I sit, it feels like I’m drowning. My anxiety levels have spiked. I feel I am losing my mind. I’m trying to remain focused, but I feel I am losing my will to live.” Matu came to the UK from Zimbabwe in 2007, aged 35, after winning a British Council Chevening scholarship, sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, to study for an MSc in corporate governance and business ethics at Birkbeck College in London. “That alone shows a good character,” she said. “I underwent a rigorous and robust selection process by the British embassy.” In the 11 years that Matu has lived in the UK with her children, aged 12, 16 and 23, she has paid £27,315 in visa costs and legal fees in efforts to regularise her status. To fund those costs, while bringing up her children as a single mother without recourse to public funds, she has never worked fewer than two jobs. She has held management posts at three London local authorities, various roles in care homes, cleaning jobs and is the director of a limited company she set up in 2010. Until her right to work was removed last month, Matu was an inspector for a health and social care regulator. Her manager has told the Home Office, in a character reference letter the Guardian has seen, that it would be a “great loss” to [her employer] if someone with her exemplary “attitude and commitment to her role were to leave”. “I have been a role model while living in the UK because I feel that, as a migrant, you have to put more than 100% into your new country and that’s what I have done,” she said. As well as her professional commitments and her children, she has been a governor and volunteer at an inner London school for the past nine years, sitting on three committees. She has run three marathons for charity, volunteers at Crisis at Christmas, makes regular donations in support of London school development campaigns, has helped to set up Arthritis Care Africa Foundation in Africa, and regularly attends her local church. Through what she describes as sheer hard work and determination, Matu had saved enough money by 2012 to buy a house in London. “I did it because I knew that I was here to stay,” she said. Her time here hasn’t been easy. In 2010 she was raped. She reported the incident to the police but didn’t press formal charges for fear she would lose her job, forcing her to breach her visa conditions by turning to the state for support for rent, social housing or childcare. Other victims of her aggressor did press charges, however. In 2010, he was sentenced to 15 years in December 2010 for multiple charges of rape. With no family to help her, Matu turned to her local rape and sexual abuse support centre, where she received counselling and help to find other employment. It was during this period that Matu made the mistake in her tax return. “It was my fault,” she admitted. “I made a mistake on my tax return because I had so many pressures in my life at that point.” She didn’t realise the mistake until 2016, when she was preparing to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR). “As an immigrant and responsible citizen, it is difficult to keep up with the changes in the requirements of the Home Office,” she said. “This got me reviewing on a regular basis all the documentary evidence I had and regulatory changes in my visa category pending my application to the Home Office. I identified the oversight and took action to rectify the tax issue. HMRC accepted my amended tax returns and I paid the outstanding taxes of £3,315 including interest, but no fines. “There was no criminal case ever raised against me by the HMRC, nor was I subject to an investigation or blacklisting because of my mistake,” she said. “The decision of the Home Office to refuse me a visa because of the tax error that I identified myself, and corrected, is clearly disproportionate. Why would I put my life at stake for that sum? It was a genuine error that I made good on as soon as I realised it.” A few months later, Matu applied for ILR as a highly skilled migrant. After 19 months, the Home Office rejected her application, highlighting her tax amendment and citing section 322(5). “Without explanation the letter tells me my character is so undesirable that it puts me in the same category as criminals or terrorists who have to be deported for their crimes,” she said. “I have served the UK with pride as a citizen of a former British colony and have been a good ambassador for the brand Great Britain. The refusal reasons would bar me from successfully applying for visas to reside elsewhere in Europe or the USA or North America. “I am very grateful for the hospitality of the British people and have never abused that. It is hard to imagine that I would willingly deceive the country that has provided me with opportunities for a better life.” Matu submitted a request for an administrative review, which was rejected on 18 April in a letter giving her seven days to leave the country, after which date it said she would be detained or deported. “When I read the letter, and reread it, I realised that I was no longer welcome in the UK,” she said. . Matu has spent all her savings on legal advice and now she has lost her right to work, she is struggling to afford further legal representation, as well as paying her mortgage and bills. “I have always been in employment. I have never defaulted on any bill, but I am hysterical on how to finance my next month’s livelihood if I am spared removal or deportation. Just relying on handouts from my community and people who earn far less than what I got from the job I have had to literally abandon, is heartbreaking.” With the help of friends and her community, Matu submitted a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office on 3 May, saying that unless they reconsider their decision in favour of her application in the next 14 days, she will seek a judicial review. She doesn’t, however, know how she will pay for it. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Former fashion student Berlinah Wallace, 49, insisted she had thought she was throwing a glass of water rather than sulphuric acid over engineer Mark van Dongen at her Bristol flat. Giving evidence at Bristol crown court for a second day, she claimed on the night of the alleged attack Van Dongen had told her to drink the acid, which she said she had bought to clean smelly drains. Wallace, 48, is charged with murdering Van Dongen by leaving him with such catastrophic injuries that he opted for euthanasia at a clinic in Belgium. She threw acid over him in September 2015 and he died in January 2017, the jury heard. Before he died, Van Dongen, who had a new girlfriend, told police he woke at 3am to hear Wallace laugh and tell him: “If I can’t have you, no-one else can,” before the acid was thrown. Wallace told the court she picked up a glass and hurled its contents at Van Dongen after he pulled her underwear during an argument. “I thought it was water,” Wallace said. “I just wanted him to stop. He was hurting me. The contents went on him. I was trying to run away then he said: ‘Ooh you threw acid at me.’ “I just turned around and I think I saw smoke or something. The only way I can describe it is black. I was so shocked. I said: ‘Come on, let’s get into the shower.’ He was saying: ‘It hurts, it hurts.’ He went in the shower.” She wept: “I didn’t mean to hurt my boy.” He got out of the shower, pushed past her and left, Wallace said. Wallace claimed Van Dongen must have poured the glass of acid for her to drink and left it by the side of her bed. She said she did not phone the emergency services to assist Dutch-born Van Dongen. “I didn’t think until the police asked me,” she said. “Then I thought: ‘I should have called the ambulance.’ I was so scared, so shocked and so scared. I didn’t think about it. I was so shocked, really, really shocked. “I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, Mark, Mark.’ My legs couldn’t carry me properly, [they were] like jelly.” When asked how she felt about what happened to Van Dongen, Wallace wept and wailed in court. “Bad,” she eventually replied. “I feel so sad. So sorry. He was my best friend. He was my family.” Wallace said she collected Van Dongen from his work on the evening of 22 September 2015. During that night, she said, they argued and he became physically abusive to her after she insulted him. “My head was hurting,” she said. “Everything just seemed to be like a nightmare – what’s going on with my life, what has my life come to?” Van Dongen usually prepared a glass of warm water for Wallace to take medication, the court heard. “He said: ‘I have water for your medication, come to bed, I have water for your medication, come take your medication,’” Wallace said. She said she did not take her medication and instead went to call her ex-boyfriend, who suggested she went to his home. She dressed and threw the liquid in the glass at Van Dongen when he prevented her from leaving by pulling on her underwear, she said. Wallace denies charges of murder and throwing a corrosive substance with intent. Her trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27511","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T23:00:13Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,511","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27511","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27511","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,511","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/may/03/jobs-at-risk-virgin-media-retail-group-calvetron","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T18:39:59Z","webTitle":"More than 1,500 jobs at risk at Virgin Media and retail group Calvetron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/03/jobs-at-risk-virgin-media-retail-group-calvetron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/03/jobs-at-risk-virgin-media-retail-group-calvetron","fields":{"headline":"More than 1,500 jobs at risk at Virgin Media and retail group Calvetron","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 1,500 jobs are at risk after Virgin Media announced plans to shut a Swansea call centre, and as the company behind the fashion brands Jacques Vert and Windsmoor teeters on the edge of collapse. More than 1,000 jobs are on the line at Calvetron. Administrators are expected to be formally appointed at the parent group, Calvetron Style Holdings, on Friday for what will be the second time in a year.Virgin Media confirmed it was cutting jobs as part of a shake-up that will involve the closure of its call centre in Swansea and another site in Nottingham over the next two years. The Swansea centre employs 792 staff. Some roles are being switched to Manchester. The telecoms company said the decision was part of a £40m plan to create “fewer, higher-quality workplaces.” Virgin Media, which has 14,000 employees across more than 100 sites, is reducing the number of customer operations centres from eight to four, creating larger regional hubs in Wythenshawe in Greater Manchester, Bellshill near Glasgow, Gateshead, Teesside and Reading. The Swansea West MP, Geraint Davies, described the job cuts as a “catastrophe for our city”. “I’m stunned by the Virgin job losses, which is a traumatic shock for every family concerned and a body blow for Swansea,” he said. Carolyn Harris, the Swansea East MP, said Virgin Media handled the situation very badly and had “questions to answer” about the job losses. Virgin Media’s chief executive, Tom Mockridge, said: “We have proposed the closure of a small number of our offices over the next two years, including our call centre in Swansea and our current site in Nottingham. “These changes will help deliver a more agile, digitally oriented experience, which our customers increasingly expect as standard.” Last summer, Calvetron was restructured in a rescue deal that resulted in several hundred job losses. It was acquired by a group of retail investors, which at the time included the businessmen Sandeep Vyas and Haseeb Aziz. The business secured a £12.5m loan from Secure Trust Bank to fund its turnaround. But since then, fashion retailers have faced an extremely tough market. The weather – an unusually warm autumn last year and miserable spring this year – has combined with the squeeze on consumers, the rising cost of labour and imported goods, a continuing switch to online shopping, and a trend for shoppers to spend more on leisure than fashion, to create the harsh retail environment. Store closures are planned at New Look and Carpetright, while Toys R Us and Maplin have collapsed. Mothercare and Homebase are also expected to close stores as they struggle to find new funding. Calvetron’s problems have been magnified by difficulties at Debenhams and House of Fraser, two of its biggest retail partners. On Wednesday, House of Fraser said store closures were coming as part of a restructuring deal that will give control of the retail chain to the Chinese owner of Hamleys. Hundreds of jobs are expected to go. At the time of the 2017 rescue, Calvetron had more than 1,200 UK staff working in shops in department stores, and another 400 overseas in countries including Belgium and Canada. Calvetron was not available to comment. •This article was amended on 6 May 2018. An earlier version incorrectly stated Harold Tillman was one of the business’s owners. His only role was to provide strategic advice following last year sale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/11/supporting-the-west-no-syrias-white-helmets-are-about-saving-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T12:45:58Z","webTitle":"Supporting the west?

No, Syria's White Helmets are about saving lives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For years, Syria’s civil defence workers have been subjected to a vicious online propaganda campaign by the “electronic armies” of the Assad regime and Russia. The digital offensive accelerated following a 2016 Netflix documentary that was cited as evidence of “western bias in the Syrian conflict”. What is little known, however, is the countless times these workers, known as the White Helmets, have saved civilians from the rubble of airstrikes launched not by the Syrian regime or Russia, but by the US-led coalition. While the majority of US attacks in Syria have targeted areas under the control of Islamic State (Isis) – areas in which the White Helmets are not allowed to operate – there have also been dozens of US airstrikes on rebel-held territories, which have been vastly under-reported. Indeed, since 2014 the US has bombed anti-Isis rebel population centres far more than areas loyal to the regime, despite the far greater coverage afforded to the latter. Ismail al-Abdullah, a 30-year-old former teacher and volunteer with the Syria Civil Defence from the rural area around Aleppo, was present when 46 civilians were killed by a US-led airstrike on a mosque in Al-Jinah, a village held by the rebel faction Ahrar al-Sham. He said the victims at Al-Jinah were civilians, “students at an institute” who died “after the building was targeted twice consecutively”. Al-Abdullah noted that the coalition had focused on opposition-held areas “intermittently” throughout the war and said that, on the pretext of bombing Jabhat al-Nusra, the coalition also targeted opposition factions such as the Free Syrian Army. He confirmed that Syria Civil Defence first responders had reported to the scene in several incidents, including attacks on Atarib, Atmeh, Kafr Daryan, Sarmada and Harem. Despite being labelled “western proxies”, the White Helmets had rejected the US-led intervention in 2014, reflecting the public mood in their local areas, he said. “We, as the Civil Defence, released several statements saying that any bombardment would not solve the problem, would not end the crisis, would not end this ongoing war in Syria … and indeed the coalition airstrikes only led to the killing of more civilians under different ‘names’ [pretexts] or accusations.” Many official accounts of civilian deaths in coalition airstrikes later came from the Syria Civil Defence. Western coverage of the Syrian conflict has been underpinned by the notion of a “proxy war” between the US and Russia. But volunteers who, like Al-Abdullah, have helped to rescue civilians in their local area from airstrikes by the Syrian regime, Russia and US-led forces, see it differently. “The similarity is obvious. They both bomb under a certain ‘name’ [pretext]. The coalition bomb using the name of Daesh [Isis], and they target schools harbouring refugees and civilians, and the media is forced to be absent from documenting the massacres there. Then you have the Russians who target civilians, including with propaganda, with the media arms they have, saying they are targeting Jabhat al-Nusra.” The White Helmets once operated in a much wider stretch of Syria than the areas they later became associated with, including Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor. But in 2014 the group’s volunteers were expelled from vast swathes of territories by Isis. “The organisation made a lot of problems for them, as they viewed them as subservient to the west, to infidels,” said Al-Abdullah. “They all fled. The organisation did not recognise something called ‘civilians.’” For Al-Abdullah, it was a missed opportunity for the documentation of possible war crimes by the US-led coalition. “The massacres that happened in those areas were many, and they passed without any visual documentation or videos. This was extremely damaging, and we wish we could have documented it.” After Isis were expelled, the White Helmets returned to some areas retaken by the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army, said Al-Abdullah. However, they continued to be exiled from the vast majority of recaptured territories by the rival, US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. In other words, the alleged US “proxies” continued to live in exile from many of their home towns and villages, under the nose of the US military. In 2015, advocacy group the Syria Campaign launched a petition asking for the White Helmets to be provided with radar information held by the US-led coalition which could help warn of Syrian regime airstrikesin advance. According to Al-Abdullah, the petition achieved a “high level of engagement”, but “was of no use whatsoever”. Ultimately, sparse coverage of what life is like in areas that have come under US bombardment – areas that, overwhelmingly, happened to be the centres of popular protest against the regime in 2011 – means there is virtually no awareness of how local populations have been effectively punished for their Arab spring rebellion, not just by Bashar al-Assad and Isis, but also by the US-led coalition. Without doubt, the estimated 4,000 civilians killed by the coalition, overwhelmingly in “non-regime” Syria, includes many who took to the streets in 2011. Did Al-Abdullah know of any 2011 anti-regime protesters who were later killed by US-led airstrikes? He promptly responded by naming three friends: “Abdul Ghani Al-Hamad from the countryside of Aleppo, Mohammed Al-Abo from the countryside of Aleppo, and Mohammed Baroud from the countryside of Safira.” The publicity campaign against the White Helmets would not deter him, he said. “We don’t care about these accusations. Practically speaking, how are we following western agendas when we are rescuing civilians from their airstrikes, as well as the regime’s and Russia’s? These are allegations that go nowhere. We will continue to rescue the people.” Omar Sabbour is an independent Egyptian writer and activist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/04/trump-qatar-buys-apartment-new-york-tower","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Trump set to benefit as Qatar buys $6.5m apartment in New York tower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/04/trump-qatar-buys-apartment-new-york-tower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/04/trump-qatar-buys-apartment-new-york-tower","fields":{"headline":"Trump set to benefit as Qatar buys $6.5m apartment in New York tower","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government of Qatar bought a $6.5m apartment in one of Donald Trump’s New York towers soon after the dismissal of a lawsuit that tried to stop the president benefiting from such deals. Qatar’s mission to the United Nations signed a deal for the condominium at Trump World Tower on 17 January, according to city records. The purchase means that the Middle Eastern state now owns four units in the building, for which it paid $16.5m. On 21 December, a federal judge in New York had thrown out a lawsuit from ethics campaigners alleging that Trump was breaching the emoluments clause of the US constitution by collecting tens of thousands of dollars in charges from Qatar each year for the three apartments it already owned in the building. Qatar’s new acquisition at Trump World Tower, which is in Manhattan’s Midtown East section, coincided with an intense lobbying campaign in Washington by the Qatari government amid a regional crisis that has pitted the Gulf monarchy against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which brought the lawsuit against Trump, said: “This plays to the central concern with the president’s refusal to divest from his holdings – that he would be susceptible to influence from foreign countries invested in his businesses.” In an unattributed email, Qatar’s mission to the UN said the properties were used to house diplomatic staff close to the UN headquarters. “These apartments, plus the recent unit, were all purchased due to their location, nothing more,” the email said. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. The three-bedroom condominium was sold to Qatar by a pair of sisters who bought it for $5m in 2007. Trump owns the surrounding building, according to his real estate portfolio, and his company is paid monthly charges by residents. An archived listing for Qatar’s newest condominium said the common charges and maintenance fees totalled $3,151 a month. Michael Cohen, Trump’s embattled legal fixer, owned an apartment in the same building until October last year, when he sold it for $3.3m. Cohen’s wife’s parents own four apartments in the building, according to city filings. The property bought by Qatar was touted as “truly top of the line”, offering residents spectacular views along with the use of a spa and swimming pool. Crew’s lawsuit said the governments of Afghanistan, India, Qatar and Saudi Arabia were already paying more than $225,000 a month in charges for space in the building. The Qatari monarchy has been scrambling to regain its footing with the US since Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies imposed an embargo in June last year. Trump initially threw his backing behind Riyadh, though other senior US officials rushed to express support for Qatar, home to al-Udeid airbase, which houses the US military’s central command and 10,000 American troops. Throughout the crisis, Qatar has continued to buy US weaponry in large quantities: a $12bn deal for F15 jets was announced last summer. The Qataris also pay for the cost of maintaining al-Udeid, and have promised significant upgrades to the facilities for US troops and their families. This spring, the emirate has put in further orders worth another half billion dollars for US guidance systems and precision-guided missiles for helicopters, just ahead of a visit to the White House in April by the emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. “They are certainly spending a lot of money trying to influence the shape of the debate in Washington,” said Gerald Feierstein, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia now at the Middle East Institute in Washington Qatari money was behind the creation of a DC-based new thinktank, the Gulf International Forum in February, and since last June, when the blockade began, the Doha government has spent over $5m on lobbying firms, in an effort to match the Saudis. “The way they are competing is going to allow a lot of Washington lobbyists to buy vacation homes this year,” Feierstein said. Trump broke with decades of presidential convention by retaining ownership of his businesses even after entering the White House. His decision created dozens of possible conflicts of interest and was heavily criticised by former ethics officials from past Democratic and Republican administrations. The president has been accused of violating a section of the US constitution prohibiting people in public office from receiving gifts – or “emoluments” – from “any king, prince or foreign state”. Trump’s attorneys argue that simple payments for services at fair market value are not emoluments. In his December decision, Judge George Daniels ruled in Manhattan’s federal court that the lawsuit brought by Crew presented a “non-justiciable political question” that was a matter congress rather than the courts. He said the ethics campaigners and their partners on the lawsuit were not entitled to sue. Crew is appealing against the decision. A separate lawsuit alleging emoluments violations, which focuses on spending by foreign officials at Trump’s hotel in Washington DC, has been brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia. A judge ruled in March that the case had cleared an initial hurdle and could proceed. The lawsuit incorporates some of the allegations made by Crew, which has joined the legal team behind it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/03/network-rail-is-on-the-wrong-track-with-tree-culling","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T16:32:05Z","webTitle":"Network Rail is on the wrong track with tree culling | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/03/network-rail-is-on-the-wrong-track-with-tree-culling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/03/network-rail-is-on-the-wrong-track-with-tree-culling","fields":{"headline":"Network Rail is on the wrong track with tree culling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sandra Laville’s article (Mile after mile of stumps: anger at trackside tree cull, 30 April) once again highlights decisions about tree care and management being made without a full understanding of the roles of trees and other vegetation in the landscape. Network Rail’s clearance of trees is being justified as necessary to reduce the risk of accidents (falling branches and trees) and delays (caused by leaves falling on the track). While these aims may be valid, this “scorched earth” policy exposes the underlying soil, leaving it vulnerable to rain, erosion and even land slippage. In the days of the “lengthsman”, a person responsible for maintaining a stretch of line, vegetation growing into the running area was cut back as necessary by pruning or felling, and stumps were allowed to regrow. In this way the immediate operational area, including visibility of signals, was protected. This left the majority of the vegetation within the responsibility of the railway intact. As a result, the underlying soil was not exposed to the impact of rain, and roots held the soil against water escaping from water-bearing strata that had been exposed by construction of the railway. Trees do produce and shed leaves. During much of the day these falls are of limited significance because the vortex caused by the passage of each train disturbs fallen leaves, many of which are blown off the track. It is overnight that falling leaves are able to accumulate on the line. Clearly running overnight trains simply to disturb these leaves is impractical. Litter, including leaves, becomes trapped in low vegetation. As such, retention of low-growing, woody vegetation (eg brambles) along the track should ease the “leaf problem”. This vegetation used to pose a fire hazard, particularly where steam trains were running. Diesel and electric trains do not pose the same risk.

Until recently, this would have struck me as bad form: allowing days, and occasionally weeks, to go by before engaging with non-urgent requests. Recently, however, I’ve noticed a new etiquette: what feels to me like a free pass to put emails on ice until you break the seal and begin the exchange. I raise this because it seems to me as if we’re in another transitional moment, a correction to the first two decades of email enslavement and a move towards a slightly more manageable protocol. Where once a same-day reply seemed not just ideal but mandatory, now a slow response indicates freedom of mind and a robust push back against the tyranny of one’s inbox. Perhaps I’m deluded, but all the handwringing over whether technology takes away from our ability to be human is countered by the fact that it brings more awareness to the parts that are left. Or at least, that is the story we can tell ourselves. The best thing about the new rules of engagement, if that’s what they are, is the overwhelming sense of self-righteousness they confer. It’s not that I can’t be bothered to reply or am trying to avoid you; it’s that I have liberated myself from the yoke of technology. My lassitude, rather than a sign of organisational failure, is in fact an ideological victory. There are limits to how far one can take this. In the case of email, I’ve noticed, the crucial thing is not to initiate a too-speedy response, since the speed of reply sets the pace of discussion. Once an exchange is under way, you’re committed and it feels very rude to go dark for a few days if a quicker rate has already been established. And, of course, a too fanatical non-engagement with technology puts you in danger of becoming the person who inconveniences everyone else so you can lovingly curate your self-image. There are practical downsides too. I recently found myself in LA, in a 300-year-old taxi cab driven by a man of equal vintage, who slammed to a halt to check his satnav on a busy two-lane highway. I sat in the back, considering the possibility I was about to orphan my children because I got on my high horse about Uber. (On the way home, I tried to re-download Uber but it wanted Touch ID, which I couldn’t get to work, and for several moments I stood there dithering in a car park like someone teleported in from the 80s.) As technology extends its reach, so we find new ways to avoid it.

Scores of continental favourites that currently sail and rail through the French border – including oranges, lemons and avocados from Spain and fresh flowers from Holland – will be subject to phytosanitary checks in addition to customs checks after Brexit. “Controls can take a few minutes to 48 hours if a laboratory test needs to be done,” John Keefe, the director of public affairs at Getlink, the new name for Eurotunnel Group, told the annual Multimodal logistics conference in Birmingham. “Coming in through the Channel tunnel on an everyday basis are food, flowers … If the government turn round at the end of Brexit negotiations and say: ‘Sorry consumers, you will no longer be able to have fresh strawberries or fresh lettuce or fruits de mer from France, there is likely to be a strong reaction from consumers. If we go backwards from frictionless border, then we really have lost from Brexit.” There will also have to be checks in Calais and other continental ports for British exports, meaning French diners may have to do without Scottish salmon or langoustines. Supplies of such foods from Scotland rotted on the roadside in 2015, the last time there were major delays in the ports. Keefe said the phytosanitary checks legally required on both sides of the border were a bigger challenge than the high-profile issue of customs checks that is currently dividing the cabinet. “If we are all happy eating frozen meat then it’s an easy win, but if we want fresh food and having it on our shelves 365 days a year then it’s a big problem,” he said. “We export about £8bn of fresh produce a year and import £12-13bn. That amount of fresh produce going backwards and forwards is far more of a risk for the government than is anything of customs or duty.” Keefe said one problem was there were no existing border inspection posts to serve Folkestone and Dover, the gateway for the majority of fresh food supplies. It is estimated it could take between five and 10 years to put enough posts in place to deal with the volume of freight requiring phytosanitary inspection. “One of the things the government is significantly behind the curve on is the whole border inspection posts. We have the cabinet talking about different customs partnerships, but what we haven’t seen yet is any kind of progress out of Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] in particular to provide us with some clear guidelines about how [border inspection posts] might develop,” he said. Keefe called on the government to urgently draw up a plan of action, as he said it was estimated it could take “anything between five and 10 years to build border inspection posts to deal with the level of traffic coming across a short strait”. Representatives from the Dover Port and the Freight Transport Association had the same message. “It is the non-tariff barriers that could cause the bulk of delay,” said James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA. Pauline Bastidon, the association’s head of European policy, told the conference: “Everything needs to be checked – animal products, animal feed, fruit and veg, raw meat, but also things like pot noodles and readymade meals with a little bit of meat.” There are border inspection posts at ports and airports that are hubs for non-EU goods, such as Heathrow, Felixstowe and the Thames Gateway, but none in Dover or Folkestone. Keefe told the conference that 20% of Eurotunnel’s freight was perishable food, and after Brexit trucks coming through Eurotunnel would have to divert their content to Heathrow or Southampton for inspection, cutting into the shelf life of fresh food and flowers. The phytosanitary checks are a critical part of infection control to protect animals and the public and help stop the spread of everything from mad cow disease to Dutch elm disease. They are also a vital weapon in the battle against cases of food fraud like the horsemeat scandal in 2013, when beef burgers sold in several Irish and British supermarkets were found to contain mixed meat. The UK is not self-sufficient in food and relies on imports, an issue that farmers and food producers have said could lead to shortages of staples after Brexit. Richard Christian, the policy director at Dover, said delays from checks could lead to miles-long tailbacks at the port and in Calais. “We are open 364 days a year to keep the goods in the shops that we all enjoy. The second we stop that flow, that’s where we’ve got this problem,” he said. “The amount of time to process non-EU freight – on a good day it can take 20 minutes, it can take several hours, on a bad day it can take several days. Somehow we’ve got to get a few hours down to two minutes otherwise there will be a perpetual queue of 17 miles.” Several executives at the conference poured cold water on the government’s current proposed solution for the borders. Peter MacSwiney, the chair of Agency Sector Management, a freight specialist, described the proposed customs partnership as “ridiculous” as it would require French, Belgian and Dutch authorities to reciprocate. “Why would they invest in developing new IT systems to match ours when it was the UK that voted for Brexit, not them?” he said. A Defra spokeswoman said its priority was “to maintain environmental, welfare and biosecurity standards in a way that supports trade and the smooth flow of goods”. She said the department was “considering our import controls for a range of scenarios to make sure we are ready for when we leave the EU”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/liverpool-mohamed-salah-final-cristiano-ronaldo-champions-league-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T13:33:00Z","webTitle":"Salah: Champions League final is not me against Ronaldo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/liverpool-mohamed-salah-final-cristiano-ronaldo-champions-league-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/liverpool-mohamed-salah-final-cristiano-ronaldo-champions-league-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Salah: Champions League final is not me against Ronaldo","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mohamed Salah has said the Champions League final against Real Madrid will be a showcase of Liverpool’s collective power and not a personal duel with Cristiano Ronaldo. The Egypt international will cap his stunning debut season at Liverpool with a first Champions League final appearance in Kiev on 26 May, when Jürgen Klopp’s side will seek to end Real’s recent dominance of the competition. By contrast, Ukraine will play host to Ronaldo’s sixth Champions League final, with the tournament’s all-time leading scorer having won the trophy three times with Madrid and once with Manchester United. Salah, with 43 goals this season, is seen as the biggest threat not only to Real in Kiev but to the dominance of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi over the Ballon d’Or. The Liverpool forward is targeting a bigger prize, however: the club’s sixth European Cup. “I know all of the Arab people wish the best for me, and they are happy every time I win, but now at the moment I am only thinking about the final and to bring the trophy to Anfield,” Salah said after Liverpool’s semi-final over Roma. “It is not going to be a final between Mohamed Salah and Cristiano Ronaldo. I am playing for a great club and we have great players, so qualifying to the final came with great teamwork. I cannot do it alone – it is collective work. When we score a goal it’s because we are all doing good, when we concede it means we all need to work harder.” Georginio Wijnaldum, who scored his first Liverpool away goal at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday, admitted Real will present the most difficult challenge of his career. “It is probably the biggest test we could have had, the biggest I’ve had as a player,” he said. “It’s going to be difficult – but for both clubs. Everyone in the Champions League has quality. We have to be aware of their quality but they have to be aware of ours. They are not the only team with quality or the only team that can win games. “The Champions League is the biggest competition you can play at club level so, if you can go in your first season to the final, it’s a great feeling. But then you want to win the final now, so you can’t relax.” Wijnaldum made a beeline for Andreas Kornmayer, Liverpool’s head of fitness, after heading Klopp’s team into a 2-1 lead in Rome. He explained: “We already had an agreement a few games ago that I would run to him if I scored but it didn’t happen. He said a few times that I’d score but then he forgot. Then before Roma he said I would score, so I had to!” Despite concerns over security in the buildup to Liverpool’s visit to Rome the semi-final passed off relatively trouble-free. One visiting fan was arrested for a public order offence and the most serious problem on the night was access to the stadium for the 5,000 Liverpool supporters. Only three turnstiles were available for away fans, who had to wait several hours to gain access to the Stadio Olimpico. Uefa is awaiting reports from the game before deciding what action, if any, to take."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/joan-didion-john-dunne-malibu-writers-food","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T10:30:06Z","webTitle":"Frozen in time: Joan Didion in her California kitchen, October 1972","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/joan-didion-john-dunne-malibu-writers-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/joan-didion-john-dunne-malibu-writers-food","fields":{"headline":"Frozen in time: Joan Didion in her California kitchen, October 1972","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This kitchen is in the Malibu house where Didion lived for eight years with her husband John Dunne and daughter Quintana – it stood equidistant from Hollywood (where the two wrote films together) and the San Andreas Fault. Every morning, Dunne would rise, make a fire, give Quintana breakfast, and take her to school. “Then I would get up, have a Coca-Cola, and start work,” Didion remembers, in a recent documentary by her nephew, Griffin Dunne. The Coca-Colas were kept ice cold, and appear as essential to her writing routine as quiet and light. Those who pledged $50 or more to the crowdfunding of Griffin’s film received a copy of her personal cookbook. A scrapbook of food clippings from magazines, menus of the meals she served at dinner parties (for Patti Smith she made chicken hash with roasted yellow peppers and baguettes) and food-stained recipes, handwritten, with terse crossing-outs, its most revealing page was the recipe for a parsley salad, less as an illustration of her diet, or even for the way its sparse style reflects her prose, but more as an insight into her social reach: the salad feeds up to 40. It’s not just that her recipes reveal her – reading her work you see Didion discovers herself this way too. In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”. Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad; Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee; in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch. It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/08/jeff-dunham-offensive-puppets-voice-trumps-america-achmed-dead-terrorist-jose-mexican-immigrant","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T15:21:32Z","webTitle":"How Jeff Dunham's offensive puppets became the voice of Trump's America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/08/jeff-dunham-offensive-puppets-voice-trumps-america-achmed-dead-terrorist-jose-mexican-immigrant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/08/jeff-dunham-offensive-puppets-voice-trumps-america-achmed-dead-terrorist-jose-mexican-immigrant","fields":{"headline":"How Jeff Dunham's offensive puppets became the voice of Trump's America","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeff Dunham is on a high. He has just played to a sell-out crowd in the Texas city of San Antonio. Any other ventriloquist would be happy with an audience of a few hundred, maybe in their wildest dreams a thousand. But Dunham and his cast of dummies pulled in a whopping 19,000 fans – and every one of them seemed to have had a riotously fun evening. “Other comedians,” he says, “must be scratching their heads and thinking, ‘How the hell is this happening?’ It’s like aliens were looking down and saying, ‘Here’s how we’re going to screw up Earth. We’ll make a reality TV guy the president – who 60% of people hate – and then, here’s something weirder, we’ll make this ventriloquist guy so successful he sells out stadiums.’” Dunham is no children’s entertainer. His puppets are dysfunctional, foul-mouthed and unashamedly stereotypical, from Seamus the drunken Irish baby to José the Mexican immigrant and Achmed the jihadi suicide bomber. Spurning all accusations of racism, sexism and homophobia, Dunham has become a comic phenomenon. He doesn’t just hold the Guinness World Record for most tickets sold for a standup comedy tour – 2m across 386 venues – he is also ranked by Forbes as one the highest paid comedians on the planet, up there with Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Amy Schumer. His videos have amassed 1bn views on YouTube and his shows on NBC, Comedy Central and Netflix regularly top the ratings. So big is Dunham that last September he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. No mean feat for a man who throws his voice for a living. It’s not something that could have happened to Keith Harris and Orville the Duck. Not since Edgar Bergen – the ventriloquist turned movie star of the 1940s – has the art form been so popular. Two of the last three winners of America’s Got Talent have been ventriloquists. There’s a new generation catching on, Dunham says: “We were the guys they shoved out on stage with the closed curtain while the headliners got ready. We were always the sideshow, the little guys, the cheap, easy entertainment.” Not any more. Dunham’s characters revel in smirking at liberals and carving up political correctness. Alter egos There’s Walter, a retired, grumpy old man whose catchphrase is: “Shut the hell up!” And Peanut, a furry purple creature from a small Micronesian island who is hyperactively annoying. The two trot out lewd comments about women and ridicule foreign accents. Meanwhile, Seamus derides alcoholism and Achmed jokes about virgins in paradise and chides his gay son. “People accuse me of using the puppets as a vehicle to shoot off about my own beliefs,” says Dunham, “or to tell terrible jokes that I believe in. But it’s not that at all. What the characters do is give you a licence to go a little further than you would as a human being, simply because they’re not real.” Dunham’s audiences, judging by the myriad clips online, are mostly comprised of white Americans. They are the ones guffawing, for example, when the one-legged José Jalapeño puppet declares he can’t show his green card because he’s left it in his other leg. “Never make fun of big groups of people,” says Dunham. “Always make fun of individuals. I think that’s a good rule of thumb. I mean, if a group of people believe or think one thing, that’s their right. But if you have one idiot out of a group behaving incredibly badly, then that person deserves to be made fun of.” British audiences will this month get a chance to decide for themselves, as Dunham arrives to play a couple of arena gigs, in Birmingham and London. What will they make, I wonder, of Dunham’s most notorious character: Achmed the dead terrorist, as his jihadi suicide bomber dummy is more properly known? A video clip – Meet Achmed – has notched up 16m views on YouTube. In it, the crowd roar with laughter when the puppet curses: “God damn it! I mean – Allah damn it! Silence, I kill you!” The jihadi character came about, Dunham says, after the attack on the World Trade Center and the initially fruitless search for Osama bin Laden. “We didn’t know if he was dead or alive, so I thought, ‘You can’t make fun of 9/11, that will never be funny. But I will make fun of that guy, that idiot. And I know where he is – Osama bin Laden’s dead and he’s hiding out in my suitcase with all my other guys.’” Dunham handcrafts all the puppets. Achmed appears as a charred skeleton wearing a turban, with bushy eyebrows, red eyes and a thick black beard. He’s haunting yet childishly comedic. “The way I create characters is to react to whatever is going on in the world and come up with something, someone, that I think other people will laugh at, or identify with.” Does he ever worry he might offend people? Dunham insists he only ever offends a “teeny bit” of people, adding that whatever he is doing to offend those “3 or 4%”, is what the other 96% are “laughing at the hardest”. Unusually for an American comedian, Dunham backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and lampooned Hillary Clinton. Trump, he thought, had the business acumen to take the US forward while most people only favoured Clinton because they thought it was “time” for a woman to be president. “You wanna punch [those voters] in the face,” he told one radio host in 2015. Dunham claims to have become more sensitive to criticism of late “because it’s gotten so much worse”. He concedes, too, that some of the material he performed in the past now makes him “cringe a bit”. But he is otherwise unrepentant. “You don’t want to lose your edge either, that’s another fine line.” Adopted by a devout Presbyterian Texas family in the 1960s and raised as an only child, Dunham says he was a very average kid with bad self-esteem. “I wasn’t good at sports, I wasn’t popular with other kids. Everybody else seemed to be good at something, but I didn’t have anything.” Things started to change at the age of eight when he found a dummy in a toy shop and learned how to speak with his lips tight shut. “Being an only child, there was nobody to tell me that what I was doing was incredibly lame,” he says. “It made kids laugh and people said it really sounded like the dummy was talking. So I thought, ‘Well, now maybe I’ve found something.’” Dunham, now 56, has turned his art into a multimillion-dollar brand with DVDs, books, hoodies, dolls, even his own wine. Also, as a petrol nut, he’s built up a huge collection of cars, including the Batmobile driven by Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight. Restored with a Corvette engine, it is now street legal. (“I like cars that start conversations.”) Dunham lives in the celeb-packed western suburbs of Los Angeles with his wife, a fitness model, their two-year-old twin boys – and dozens of puppets. “They’ve been my entire life,” he says. Whatever people might think of his controversial take on the world, there’s no doubting one thing: his brilliance as a ventriloquist. Over two hours, he plays more characters, often in rapid conversation with one another, than seems possible from a single human voice. All without moving his lips. “Every few minutes I pull out a different guy, a different point of view, a different conflict with me, so it’s like a little sitcom on stage that just keeps on going.” Dunham never takes a break when he’s performing, never touches a drink, not even water. It’s to do with the speed of the show, he says, and the dialogue – but also because his hands are otherwise engaged. He has had to learn to adjust. He’s proud, he says, of taking ventriloquism to heights it has never been before. Although Dunham doesn’t need to work any more, he’s too hooked on the buzz of performance. “It’s like jumping off a high diving board in the middle of the night with the lights off,” he says. “Then halfway down you realise you forgot to check if there’s any water in the pool.” Jeff Dunham’s Passively Aggressive tour plays Birmingham Genting Arena on 19 May and Wembley Arena 20 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/03/big-time-sensuality-bjork-ballet-rave-puts-san-francisco-under-its-spell-unbound-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T14:39:53Z","webTitle":"Big time sensuality: hyper Björk ballet unveiled in San Francisco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/03/big-time-sensuality-bjork-ballet-rave-puts-san-francisco-under-its-spell-unbound-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/03/big-time-sensuality-bjork-ballet-rave-puts-san-francisco-under-its-spell-unbound-festival","fields":{"headline":"Big time sensuality: hyper Björk ballet unveiled in San Francisco","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With 12 new works, two specially commissioned scores and the world’s first Björk ballet, the Unbound festival by San Francisco Ballet (SFB) properly lives up to its title. Yes, there may be some predictable names among the dozen commissioned choreographers; yes, there are only two women among them. But artistic director Helgi Tomasson has undertaken an exhilarating experiment in California – challenging audiences to take a risk on four ambitious triple bills and challenging choreographers to cut loose and play. Arthur Pita has never needed permission to play. As delinquent and riotous as some of his choreography has been, the setting of eight Björk songs in Björk Ballet still looks like nothing he’s ever produced. Visually, the work is a cacophony of glamour, craziness and fairytale: the stage transformed into a spangled salt marsh by 40 clumps of silver grass; the dancers costumed by Marco Morante to become, variously, a tinsel-cloaked fairy with raspberry-pink socks, a tango diva, a scarlet butterfly and a chorus of clubbers in sequined muzzles. There is a hint of a story in the fisherman figure who wanders through the piece, alternately wearing sad and happy clown masks. At moments he cast his line as if fishing for dreams, and it is perhaps those dreams that Pita hears in Björk’s music. The scenarios include a group of lovers, locked in an underwater embrace; a sexy goddess carried on a bier; and a classical rave. A stageful of ballet dancers pogoing in perfect first position to Hyperballad is a sight to see. Viewed as pure choreography, some sections may seem disposable, even random, but as a synthesis of dance, music and design it becomes far more than the sum of its parts. Unlike so many pop-inspired ballets, Pita doesn’t ride the surface novelty of Björk’s music. Instead, he communicates something of the transgression, yearning, mischief and magic at its heart. Evanescent though it may be, Björk Ballet is a wonderful watch – surprising, mysterious and a ridiculous amount of fun. Pita is one of four British or British-based choreographers to feature in Unbound, and while he and Christopher Wheeldon have worked with SFB before, David Dawson and Cathy Marston are making their company debuts. Marston’s Snowblind is the more substantial, an adaptation of Edith Wharton’s Ethan Frome, a bleak fable of love, possession and loss that proves a smart choice for a one-act ballet. Working with an arranged score by Philip Feeney, Marston whittles her material down to around 30 minutes of pure dance. She uses a modest-sized chorus to evoke the story’s crucial element of snow; her drifting choreography not only its figurative representation but also of the claustrophobic situation in which three characters – Ethan, his wife, Zeena, and the free-spirited Mattie with whom he falls in love – are trapped. There is a superb chemistry between casting and choreography. Sarah Van Patten is terrifyingly good as Zeena – her hands clawed, her spine rigid and her gaze steely with possessiveness and pain. Mathilde Froustey’s Mattie is her quicksilver opposite, light, sensuous and supple. Ulrik Birkkjaer’s Ethan, his back bowed from years of dutiful service, develops poignant layers of rectitude and longing. Marston keeps her language plain and functional when she needs to move her story along, but it blooms vividly when focusing on the characters’ inner lives. In one finely judged image she has Mattie kneel and rest her head against Ethan’s leg, concentrating the spontaneity, sweetness and willingness that make her so lovable to him. When the errant lovers try to escape, and Mattie is paralysed in an accident, Marston masterfully tracks the changing dynamics of power in a trio that ends with the two lovers clasped in Zeena’s arms and Zeena triumphantly in charge. Snowblind is the only literary ballet to feature in the festival, but some of the most abstract-seeming works carry an implicit theme or personal story. Gender identity is subtly addressed in David Dawson’s Animus Anima, which plays with the traditional dynamics of male and female dance languages. In The Infinite Ocean, Edwaard Liang contemplates death; in Bespoke, Stanton Welch meditates on the transience of a ballet career; and in Wheeldon’s Bound To, a cast of mobile phone-clutching dancers tackle the world’s addiction to social media. Wheeldon doesn’t typically moralise as a choreographer, but this idea takes his work to some interestingly expressive places. When a phone-free Dores André tries to seduce Benjamin Freemantle into paying her proper attention, their duet becomes a cleverly evocative experiment in dysfunctional partnering; she initiating the moves, while he absent-mindedly responds. An intricately fluid, intimate quartet has four women recalling a time when they used to talk rather than text; while an affecting solo for Lonnie Weeks shows a man stranded in solitary anxiety, among a group of phone-transfixed friends. What’s odd is how little trust Wheeldon places in his own language. Each section comes with a title projected on to the stage – “Open your eyes” or “Take a deep breath” – and in tandem with Keaton Henson’s overly saccharine score, these preachy little captions seem to trivialise rather than concentrate the choreography’s message. Dance often works its deepest effects through the gaps and ambiguities of its language. In contrast to Wheeldon’s over-signalling, the charm of Trey McIntyre’s Your Flesh Shall Be a Great Poem lies in its willingness to let the audience find their own way into the material. The work is about McIntyre’s grandfather, who died after suffering years of dementia. Set to the waif-like folk songs of Chris Garneau, McIntyre’s choreography cleverly evokes the past without sentimentalising. Freemantle as the young grandfather dances among his male friends with a slightly stilted jocularity. He flirts with sweetly artless young women, and McIntyre adroitly captures their individual vulnerabilities in the rawness of the characters’ steps and their eccentricities of phrasing. At the end, when Freemantle is left alone, dancing a strange, ragged duet with a three-legged stool, we glimpse the pain of the grandfather losing his mind and the choreographer trying to piece it back together. Flesh is a very personal work, authentic and generous; these are qualities disappointingly absent from Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s Guernica. A homage to Picasso, it throws together sex, politics, cubism and Spain in a high-gloss spectacle of bull-horned lovers, flamenco and blood red lighting . It’s all too much and while I normally admire her work for its breadth of spirit, Guernica feels overwrought and hollow. It is marvellously danced, however, as are all the works in the festival. Even if there are moments when this elegant, versatile and committed company look as though they could have done with an extra rehearsal or two, it’s impressive how fully and deeply they embody the range of choreographic idioms that have been thrown at them. Standout performances include Angelo Greco, his moulded line and impassioned attack beautifully showcased in the pure neoclassicism of Welch’s Bespoke; Yuan Yuan Tan, spooling her eerily graceful body though Liang’s Infinite Ocean; Sofiane Sylve magnificently regal in just about everything; and Maria Kochetkova as a ferocious modern-day Odile in Dawson’s Anima Animus. The company shine in Justin Peck’s Hurry Up We’re Dreaming, set to a sequence of tracks by M83 with 14 dancers dressed in trainers, shorts and jeans. Peck has a special genius for choreographing ensembles, creating surges and crosscurrents of dance that sparkle with brilliantly bevelled detail. The heart of this beautiful ballet lies in the long, quietly ecstatic duet for Sarah Van Patten and Luke Ingham – a sequence of low lifts, gently delineated balances, and unexpected changes of direction during which the two dancers seem to move together on a single breath. I saw all 12 works over a weekend, and in that concentrated viewing some of the festival’s choreographers appeared markedly braver than others. But overall these ballets constitute a fine statement of faith in the future of the art form. If I were Tomasson and cherry-picking my dream triple bill, Peck, Marston and Pita’s works would be frontrunners, but Wheeldon, Dawson and McIntyre’s would not be far behind.

We’re sitting in the stalls of the Royal Opera House watching various props being wheeled out on to the stage, where a dark-walled, Scandinavian-style bedroom has been created. It’s dominated by a low-frame double bed and features an aquarium built into a wall that’s glowing pink, purple and blue. But Mitchell’s concerns are elsewhere. “I’m interested in the lamps,” the 53-year-old director tells me, as she surveys the set. “We need to test them. We have two suspended lamps, very Danish in design, but we didn’t have bedside lamps that matched. So I just need to see what their light looks like before rehearsals begin.” There’s just a fortnight to go until the world premiere of Lessons in Love and Violence, George Benjamin’s new opera, and everything clearly has to be perfect. The project began two years ago, when the ROH commissioned Benjamin and librettist Martin Crimp to write a new work, following the staggering success of their previous collaboration, the chillingly beautiful Written on Skin, a medieval-set story in which the creation of an illuminated manuscript leads to adultery, murder and eventually cannibalism. Yet, while Mitchell directed Written on Skin and is regarded as one of the most important British directors of theatre and opera, she insists it was never a done deal that she’d work on Lessons. “Nothing was agreed,” she says. “As stage director, you’re always the last person to join the party – and you can never make any assumptions you’ll be invited again. But I was delighted when they asked me.” In the theatrical world, Mitchell is regarded as either a saviour or a vandal, tossing aside narrative conventions to reveal the emotional truth beneath. She is generally painted as a straight-backed, button-down zealot, with little room for humour. Today, however, sipping her morning coffee, she is gently funny and appears genuinely concerned when my Kindle, containing all my questions, starts to die on me. She even allows me to watch some of the dress rehearsal, which the Guardian had previously been told was a no-no. A reimagining of the life of Edward II and his doomed relationship with Piers Gaveston, the first Earl of Cornwall, the opera is presented as seven troubling lessons, viewed through the eyes of the monarch’s two children. Judging by what I saw, Benjamin’s creation is a work of intense sadness, exquisite beauty and mounting dread that, in its depiction of what absolute power can do to an already broken family unit, seems extremely relevant to the world we’re living in right now. “It is a brutal piece of work,” agrees Mitchell. “I mean, there’s a shaft of optimism at the end for about 10 seconds. Maybe a little bit more than 10 seconds, but …” She pauses. “I’m nervous of spoilers, so I’m being slightly cautious, but it does excavate a sad world.” The same could be said of Mitchell’s particular skill as a director. Throughout her 35-year career – particularly in such landmark productions as her 2006 staging of The Seagull, the 2008 adaptation of Franz Xaver Kroetz’s play without words Wunschkonzert, and 2016’s Lucia di Lammermoor – Mitchell has always sought different ways of seeing the action. She ramps up events and accentuates the emotional lives of overlooked characters, while reconstructing the theatrical world for a modern audience. With Lessons in Love and Violence, Crimp’s libretto was originally set across five locations, including a medieval castle and a dungeon. Fearing multiple sets might dilute the play’s energy, Mitchell had the idea of transferring all the scenes to the king’s bedroom. “I thought that would be a good solution, as it intensifies the action,” she says, “and allows you to look at it from lots of different angles. There’s such a respectful unity in George and Martin’s work. On the opening night of Written on Skin, I sensed what it must have been like to be part of an early Britten opera. Very powerful.” Inspired by the work of the German choreographer Pina Bausch, as well as Stanislavsky, Mitchell’s productions also place great emphasis on characters’ psychological motivations. On the first day of Lessons’ rehearsals, she and Crimp assembled a detailed biography for all the characters. Mitchell has, in the past, been criticised for such an approach, with certain playwrights doubting the relevance of questions about how many cups of coffee a character has had. “To me,” says Mitchell, “these biographies are efficient, pragmatic tools to help direct the scene. I find that [sort of criticism] very curious. If you’re playing a queen and you enter the room with a king, it’s useful – in terms of how to play it – to know whether you’ve been married for 10 years or four months. Maybe people criticise it because it’s a different way of thinking about theatre. Maybe some people still want old-fashioned, museum-like animation. You ask yourself, ‘Why do they come to the art form? Do they want to escape reality?’ I don’t know.” Mitchell is, however, no absolutist. She believes a healthy arts culture should have a spectrum running from very conservative to avant garde, but she also believes her job is to keep opera and theatre “oxygenated”, so that it continues to attract young people, as watchers and makers. “I spend a lot of time with young people,” says Mitchell, who currently teaches directing at the Royal Holloway University of London, “and I’m really struck by the rage of this generation. They feel very culturally dispossessed. But, while it’s hard for young women to feel there’s a place for them in an old-fashioned, patriarchal art form such as opera, I also speak with a lot of fourth-wave feminists and people within the trans community who are re-examining how we present female experience in opera, an art form where a lot of the conventions are to do with ideas of gender, women dressing as a young boys. You feel that if opera could just open up, breathe, and allow those voices in, it could be a really exciting time.” One iconic opera Mitchell feels might benefit from such an approach is La Traviata, Verdi’s tragedy about a courtesan who sacrifices herself for love. “It basically takes place in the head of a dying woman,” she says, “and I’ve never quite seen that idea followed through.” However, she also acknowledges that the freedom to raise such questions of representation is tied up in how institutions such as the Royal Opera House operate. “A young women entering a hierarchical practice will find it very difficult to articulate that vision,” she says. “For me, the privilege of being long-in-the-tooth is that I can gently have those conversations. But I do think Oliver Mears [ROH’s director of opera] is a trailblazer. He has an appetite for change, which is good.” She trails off, then looks up at the stage. “Ah, the light’s gone on!” Is that what you were waiting to see? “Yes,” she says, with a smile on her face. “There’s a conceptual idea I can’t tell you about yet – and I don’t know whether we’ll achieve it. But, if it comes off, it will crystallise the material in a rigorous way. And it all depends on that new light. Isn’t that exciting?” • Lessons in Love and Violence is at the Royal Opera House, London, 10-26 May.

I am looking for a 13in laptop in the £500-£700 range. I am not too picky about the aesthetics. What matters most is that it’s fast and can handle more tasks than just email and browsing. What is my best bet? Ivana This is an interesting question, partly because the mainstream PC market is broadly divided into two main groups. There are lots of low-end laptops aimed at consumers, and they usually cost around £250 to £500. (Yes, there are even cheaper systems.) Examples include the Lenovo Ideapad 110, Asus VivoBook, and lots of HP Pavilion and Dell Inspiron laptops. Most are relatively slow, but some are fast enough for your purposes. There are also lots of upmarket laptops for high-end buyers and freelancers, and they usually cost from £750 to £1,500. (Yes, there are even more expensive systems, especially the ones designed for gaming.) Examples include the Dell XPS 13, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, HP’s Spectre 13 and EliteBook x360 G2, the Microsoft Surface range and many more. Most of them are thin and fast, but you are also paying a premium for aesthetics. The third option is to look at laptops aimed at IT managers, especially those in large corporations. Most are designed more for durability, reparability and predictability than for speed or style. The main examples are Lenovo (formerly IBM) ThinkPads, Dell Latitudes, and HP Elitebooks. You can also buy refurbished models of these machines from corporate asset management companies such as Tier1Online. Check your specs It would be useful to know the specification of the laptop that you used in your corporate job, for comparison purposes, and the work involved. How fast was the processor? How much memory did it have? Did it have a traditional hard disk drive or a faster SSD? What was the screen resolution? Was your corporate laptop as fast as you wanted, or did it feel too slow? If you know which CPU you had, you can check its PassMark score, or find it on Notebookcheck’s list of mobile processor benchmarks. You will then be able to make sure you buy a faster CPU and as much or more memory than you had before. A typical corporate laptop today might have an Intel Core i5-5200U or similar processor, 8GB of memory, and a 128GB or 256GB SSD. I reckon you would find that a usable specification. However, it can be very frustrating to go from a fast laptop to a slow one, so try to avoid that. A Core i5-5200U has a PassMark score of 3492, which isn’t very fast by today’s laptop standards – a Core i7-7700HQ scores 8865. However, you’d only need a very fast processor for video editing, graphics applications, or handling very large spreadsheets, and it would be better to do those on a desktop. As for size, 13.3in screens are not as popular as they used to be, and there are now models with 10.1in, 11.6in, 12.5in and 14in screens as well. Ultraportables with 10.1in or 11.6in screens are a bit small for everyday use, but 14in models are becoming increasingly common. Consumer laptops If you buy a consumer laptop you’ll have the advantage of shopping for one of the better models, but there’s not a lot to choose between them. There’s been a trend towards more solid construction and better trackpads, along with higher prices. You can check out the different models at stores such as PC World and John Lewis, but there are many other suppliers. I’m linking to PC World partly because I did that myself on Tuesday. Have a look at an HP Pavilion 14-bk052sa with a 14in screen, which is available in silver or gold for £429. It has an Intel Core i3-7100U processor with 8GB of memory and a 128GB SSD. There’s also an x360 version – where the screen folds over to work as a tablet – at £549.99. I’d normally prefer a Core i5. However, the seventh-generation Core i3-7100U has a PassMark score of 3778, which is faster than a fifth-gen Core i5-5200U (3492) and not too far behind a sixth-gen Core i5-6200U (4014). The main drawback with the HP Pavilion 14 and similar consumer laptops is that most of them have a standard Windows screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. But if this is what you’re used to, you probably won’t mind. Full HD screens If you are used to high-definition 1920 x 1080-pixel “Full HD” screens, it would be better to go for a discounted Lenovo Ideapad IP320s for £549.99. This has a Core i7-7500U (PassMark 3492), 8GB of memory and a 128GB SSD. Alternatively, consider an Acer Swift 3 SF314-52G or a Lenovo Ideapad IP320s-14IKB. Both have 8GB of memory and 2x bigger 256GB SSDs. The Acer Swift 3 has a Core i5-7200U (PassMark 4646) and Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics for £649.99, while the Ideapad IP320s has a Core i7-8550U (PasssMark 8304) for a penny less: £649.98. The Swift 3 is a nice laptop but the Ideapad 320 wins easily on speed. You could also consider the 13.3in Dell Inspiron 5000 2-in-1 range, with models that stretch from £479 to £929. The best value for your purposes is the one with a Core i5-8250U (PassMark 7654) for £699. Buy direct, with support One of the advantages of buying a Dell business laptop – not an Inspiron – is that you can add next-business-day on-site service for a low price. For example, you could get a 14in Vostro 5471 from Dell’s small business/soho range with a Core i5-8250U/8GB/256GB spec for £579 plus delivery and VAT. You could then add four years of collect-and-return service for £50.36, or four years of on-site service for £95.14. I’ve used this service in the past, and have it on my current Dell desktop. I can confirm that having someone turn up on your doorstep to fix things is fantastic value for 46p a week. The Vostro 5471 with the spec mentioned, four years of ProSupport Plus and on-site service, VAT and delivery currently comes to £885.05. It busts your budget, but if you are used to getting good IT support, it’s probably worth it. Bear in mind that you can also buy HP laptops direct and add three years of pick up-and-return service for £79 or less. If you like the HP Pavilion 14, you can get a 14-bk002na with 4GB and a Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) screen for £429, or a silver Pavilion x360 14-ba007na with 8GB and a 1366 x 768 screen for (flash sale) £449.10. Both these laptops have Core i3-7100U processors and 128GB SSDs. Most Pavilion 14 laptops have two memory slots, so you should be able to expand a 4GB system to 8GB, but check before buying. Their usual maximum memory is 16GB. Buy refurbished I recently wrote an answer about buying refurbished laptops, and this option might suit you. For example, Tier1Online is currently offering a 14in ThinkPad X1 Carbon with a Core i7-4600U processor (PassMark 4111), 8GB of memory, a 240GB SSD and a 1600 x 900-pixel screen with a one-year warranty for £449, or with a three-year warranty for £509. It is grade B (some cosmetic defects) but should work perfectly well. A newer grade A version with a Core i7-5600U (PassMark 4305) and a 1920 x 1080 screen would set you back £619. In all cases, I’d also take advantage of Tier1Online’s cheap upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Most refurb buyers are looking for cheap machines, typically under £250. In your case, you could get a high-end laptop – the latest X1 Carbon starts at £1,439.99 – within your budget. Refurbs are available from many other websites including Laptop Outlet and Dell Outlet, as well as on Amazon and eBay. As long as you go for a decent spec, they should do what you need.

But the Business Council of Australia wanted more favourable coverage of its campaign for big business tax cuts. After talking to, but not using, Cambridge Analytica to improve its campaigning style, the BCA began raising funds and locked in the support of News Corp Australia. As part of its political campaign, For the Common Good, the business lobby inked a media deal with News Corp and Sky News for which it paid Rupert Murdoch’s empire a reported $1m. For the cash the business lobby gets coverage of its agenda in the form of a series of television programs over 12 months, newspaper articles and community events to promote the “positive contribution of business” to the nation. “Business Council members will embark on a roadshow across the nation into regional areas to discuss the issues facing local communities and to work on the solutions to the challenges people face,” the council said when announcing Strong Australia. Sky’s excellent political editor, David Speers, one of the few straight shooters on the channel, has the unfortunate role of hosting these Strong Australia business panels, which are being held at the rate of about one a month running up to the election. In the live broadcast, Speers introduces Westacott and acknowledges that the council is making the program with Sky, effectively telling viewers it is sponsored content. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Eager for additional revenue most media companies offer sponsored content but this joint project between News Corp and the BCA does seem to be blurring the lines somewhat. The business council’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said: “Australians aren’t interested in the bickering that dominates our political landscape. If ‘politics as usual’ can’t tackle the challenges we face, our joint Strong Australia campaign will help identify the practical, pragmatic solutions we need.” The Sky chief executive, Angelos Frangopoulos, said: “We’re proud to provide a national broadcast platform that will highlight the issues affecting regional communities across Australia.” While Sky has confirmed the business lobby paid for the programs, the 24-hour news service maintains it is an editorially independent broadcast. “Sky News has a commercial arrangement with the Business Council of Australia to produce and broadcast the television series ‘Strong Australia’,” a Sky spokeswoman told Weekly Beast. “Sky News maintains complete editorial control of the broadcast.” Wait for the punchline ... The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, who recently admitted he was still a paid up member of the Institute for Public Affairs, has made an extraordinary intervention into the media watchdog’s handling of a complaint about the ABC comedy program Tonightly with Tom Ballard. Not satisfied with the ABC’s response to his complaint about the segment – in which a candidate for Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives party was lampooned – Fifield has written to the Australian Media and Communications Authority, the independent media watchdog, to complain. Tonightly highlighted the racist past of the grazier John Batman, who the seat is named after, suggesting the electorate change its name to “Batman was a cunt”. The comedians mocked up an election poster of the Australian Conservatives party candidate Kevin Bailey, which said “Kevin Bailey is a cunt”. The Courier Mail reported Fifield had written to ACMA to say “I am dissatisfied with the response I received from the ABC on April 10”. Fifield also complained about a video on an ABC Indigenous Facebook page. We hate it break it to him, because he is the minister responsible for ACMA, but the watchdog has no remit over Facebook. Lest he forget There was widespread disbelief at a correction and apology published by the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday for a feature written by the septuagenarian historian Jonathan King. The correction was more than 300 words long and the piece was so riddled with errors it had to be pulled down rather than corrected. Fairfax says it will never work with King again. Weekly Beast understands the 1,300-word piece was first offered to the Australian, whose editors turned it down, and was then accepted by an editor for the Age. King was a fixture on the Oz in the early 2000s, producing the paper’s centenary of federation coverage and an 18-month bicentennial re-enactment of Matthew Flinders’s voyage around Australia. This project saw cadet journalists take turns in sailing on the Windeward Bound as it made its way around Australia. But King also did a significant amount of work for Fairfax around the 90th anniversary of Gallipoli. King declined to answer requests for an interview, so we can’t tell you how he got it so wrong. A Fairfax Media spokesperson said: “The errors were made by the author. We have apologised for running the piece. We have no plans to run anything further from him. The correction and apology ran in print and online, and the piece has been retracted from the website. The correction was checked with historians.” King told the same battle story to the ABC’s PM program before Anzac Day and it was put to air and reported online. The ABC has since issued a correction. “On Tuesday 24 April, PM broadcast an interview with the author Jonathan King in which he said that Australian troops at Villers-Bretonneux were ‘led by General Monash’. This is not correct. The Australian brigades were commanded by Brigadier-General William Glasgow and Brigadier-General Harold ‘Pompey’ Elliott, under the overall command of Major General Rawlinson. On Wednesday 25 April, ABC News online also incorrectly reported that General Monash was ‘responsible for taking the town’.” Deflecting the blame Speaking of errors, some mistakes are best blamed on someone else. A US band pulled out of a scheduled appearance on Sunrise this week in protest against a panel hosted by Samantha Armytage that discussed the adoption of Indigenous children from abusive homes by white families. Reporting the protest this week, the Courier Mail said: “[Armytage] said children’s minister David Gillespie had proposed white families should be able to adopt Indigenous children to save them from rape, assault and neglect. Mr Gillespie later said he had not used the phrase ‘white families’.” In fact it was not Sunrise but the Courier Mail who was the instigator of the “white families” debacle. The Sunrise panel was discussing the front-page article that claimed Gillespie had called for “white families” to be “allowed to adopt abused Indigenous children”. Although Gillespie said he never used the term white families, the Courier Mail has never apologised for its claim, instead shifting the blame to Sunrise. The segment is currently under investigation by the media watchdog. Paper tigers It’s a toss-up this week for the most misogynist item published in a newspaper. The Australian has two contenders and the Australian Financial Review one. On Thursday the Australian portrayed Labor senator Kristina Keneally as a witch, complete with a green face. On the weekend the national broadsheet published a bizarre column by Angela Shanahan in which she discussed the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, having a baby in office. Shanahan, who wrote that she is a mother to nine children herself, said it was unworkable for Ardern’s husband to be the primary carer and that voters have a right to ask how she will do it. “There are the simple practical issues: the three to four-hourly feeds for which, being a greenie leftie, she will try to do using her own milk; the sleepless nights, which reduce many women to a zombie-like state; and the blithe confidence that after six weeks her partner will take over as full-time caregiver. Well, good luck with that one, too, because the father is not the mother and there is such a thing as maternal bonding, which is a basic post-partum physical need for mothers and infants. This woman needs at least six months off, not six weeks.” Who knew breastfeeding was a leftwing thing? Finally there is Karen Maley on the “attractive” Catherine Brenner’s “meteoric ascent” to the top of AMP. Brenner, Maley said, spent as much as $600 a month on beauty accessories and spent a lot of time networking, even missing out on seeing her own daughters because she was out every night of the week. The corporate profile included anonymous lines: “She really has had a gold-plated ride and, although a nice person, is a good example of intentional gender bias getting the wrong result.” And another: “There’s no doubt there’s a men’s club on a lot of boards,” notes one company director. “But there’s a women’s club as well, and this is turning out to be just as bad as the men’s club.” Easy as ABC The ABC chairman, Justin Milne, has congratulated broadcaster Jane Connors on her election to the ABC board. Connors won a highly contested vote for staff-elected director for a period of five years. It is a crucial time for staff, who are still adjusting to a major content restructure and who are now facing the loss of another 20 experienced journalists from the newsroom. “Jane has made significant contributions to the ABC across policy, strategy and content areas and will bring with her an enormous amount of experience and knowledge about the broadcaster that will benefit the ABC at the boardroom level,” Milne said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/04/auguste-rodin-the-kiss","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T08:59:18Z","webTitle":"Auguste Rodin’s The Kiss: an adulterous couple transformed into everyday icons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/04/auguste-rodin-the-kiss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/04/auguste-rodin-the-kiss","fields":{"headline":"Auguste Rodin’s The Kiss: an adulterous couple transformed into everyday icons","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Just a kiss … The Kiss is an everyday icon.

England’s campaign starts on Friday against Israel at Chesterfield’s Proact Stadium, with Switzerland and Italy the other Group A sides. Cooper’s side joined Paul Simpson’s under-20s by becoming world champions last year, with a 5-2 win against Spain in India. Yet Manchester City’s golden ball winner Phil Foden and Liverpool’s eight-goal golden boot winner Rhian Brewster are now – along with all players born in 2000 – too old. Cooper says: “This is a different under-17 group than won in India – boys born in 2001 – so they’re very much on their own journey on this international stage. Obviously with all teams doing so well in last 12 months, with World Cup wins for the 17s and 20s, and the 19s becoming European champions, too, we know the landscape has changed a little with expectations. “So we need to thrive on it but at the same time focus on our work, make sure every day is a good day, so nothing has really changed from [before the success]. We want to be successful in every event we enter but we’re also building for the future. The aim of our work is to produce players for a senior winning England team.” As the hosts, England, who are based at the tournament hub, St George’s Park, did not have to qualify, so the 38-year-old arranged bespoke preparation. In a November friendly less than two weeks after England’s World Cup triumph, they defeated Portugal 3-2, before 2-1 victories over Russia and Germany in the buildup to February’s Algarve Tournament, where they were captained by Manchester United’s Jimmy Garner and City’s Tommy Doyle. There, England lost 4-0 against Portugal, drew 1-1 with Germany – the goal scored by Bobby Duncan, who is Steven Gerrard’s cousin – and defeated the Netherlands 2-0. Their last two matches before the Euros were against Brazil in Spain, losing 1-0 and drawing 1-1. Cooper, whose team against Israel may feature Fulham’s Luca Ashby-Hammond in goal, Doyle in midfield, United’s Mason Greenwood at No 10 and Duncan at centre-forward, says: “We’ve had a different kind of programme and have tried to arrange the most demanding games possible. There’s been some good and not so good results and performances as well. We’ve managed to look at a lot of players this year and it’s different now as we’re in tournament mode. We want to get ready for the first game and feel we’re heading towards that.” After Israel, England face Italy in Walsall on Monday before closing the group phase against Switzerland in Rotherham on Thursday. Cooper says: “The beauty of the under-17s is that you don’t quite know what you’re playing against and sometimes don’t know what you’ll get from your own boys at these tournaments because it’s their first experience of the Uefa finals. “Israel are a really good team – we’ve studied them closely. Some people may look at the fixture and think it’s going to be straightforward but it’ll be far from it. They qualified comprehensively in a tough group; they play good football, they’ve got good attacking players and we’ll be showing them maximum respect.” Cooper’s team should line up in his usual 4-3-3. “We have England DNA: we very much want to play out from the back, dominate possession, play with purpose,” he says. “Build our way up the pitch, so we can score as many as possible. And, when we haven’t got it, try to win the ball back as quick as we can. “It’s a real mixed group in terms of the way Israel, Italy and Switzerland play, so we’ve had to get our preparation right. “Italy are focused and hardworking – what we associate Italian teams to be – and they have some dangerous attacking players as well that cause problems. They’re athletic and physical players and really good technically – score a lot of goals. “Switzerland have some really technical players and play with a clear identity. They’re well coached, very much adhere to what the team’s tactical ideas are. But we work in a way that we think it’s about us. Rightly we think we can beat anyone we come up against but we’ll have to get it right, that’s for sure.” In a 16-nation tournament, Group B consists of Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia and Norway. Denmark, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ireland are in Group C, and Germany, the Netherlands, Serbia and Spain Group D. As Cooper, the son of the former Premier League referee Keith, states, the competition will be tough. “It’s important to say that you can win in many ways in the development teams – winning tournaments is one form,” he says. “But however this goes it’s still going to be a massive learning experience. “I think there’s a bit of a thought that we’re going to be favourites again and we’re going to win it – that’s what winning makes you do. But we’re not going to lose sight that this is a development tournament.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/06/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-warm","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T08:00:16Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'warm'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/06/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-warm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/06/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-warm","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'warm'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘warm.’ Share your photos of what warm means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

The legislation will almost certainly draw a swift court challenge and the move sets the scene for another lengthy legal battle as anti-abortion lawmakers ultimately eye the landmark Roe v Wade 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion in the US. Reynolds has declared herself “proud to be pro-life”. Her announcement on Friday came shortly after the Iowa affiliates of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union warned that they would sue her if she signed the bill. The Republican-controlled state legislature passed the bill on Wednesday and sent it to the governor’s desk. “We will challenge this law with absolutely everything we have on behalf of our patients because Iowa will not go back,” said Suzanna de Baca, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland. The legislation has propelled the state to the front of a push among conservative statehouses jockeying to enact the nation’s most restrictive regulations on the procedure. The bill would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of pregnancy. Similar legislation passed in other states did not go into effect after they were challenged in court over their constitutionality. Critics say the so-called “heartbeat” bill would ban abortions before some women even know they are pregnant. A federal appeals court three years ago struck down similar legislation approved in Arkansas and North Dakota. Backers of the legislation are optimistic about an influx of right-leaning judicial appointments under Donald Trump. “We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v Wade – 100%,” said the Republican Iowa state senator Rick Bertrand of Sioux City after the bill passed. In March, Mississippi banned abortion after 15 weeks, sparking an immediate court challenge by reproductive rights advocates. A similar court challenge is under way in Kentucky, which in April enacted a ban on a common abortion procedure from the 11th week of pregnancy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/05/violence-israel-palestine-jerusalem-us-embassy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T19:48:13Z","webTitle":"Israel fears ‘explosion of violence’ as US prepares to open embassy in Jerusalem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/05/violence-israel-palestine-jerusalem-us-embassy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/05/violence-israel-palestine-jerusalem-us-embassy","fields":{"headline":"Israel fears ‘explosion of violence’ as US prepares to open embassy in Jerusalem","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Police in Israel have started patrols and security sweeps of a southern Jerusalem neighbourhood, anxiously preparing for a US embassy inauguration that Israelis and Palestinians fear may launch a week of violence. The move on 14 May will mark the start of a potentially volatile week when Israel will celebrate its 70th anniversary and Palestinians mark the “catastrophe”, or Nakba, of their displacement on the 15th. Nakba day has previously seen violence as the Israeli army responds to demonstrations in the occupied territories. This year, tensions are far higher than usual. Six weeks of protests along the Gaza border, during which Israeli soldiers have shot dead nearly 40 people and wounded hundreds, will culminate that week. There are fears that those attending the rallies may attempt to breach the perimeter, a move that could lead to mass casualties as Israeli snipers are operating under rules of engagement that permit live fire. “The situation between Israelis and Palestinians could not be more delicate,” wrote Ilan Goldenberg, who served as part of the US team during the 2013-14 Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, in an opinion piece for the Israeli paper Haaretz. The embassy move, he said, may pass without significant violence, pointing to the lack of anticipated instability following Donald Trump’s December announcement to relocate the embassy. “Or it could explode – and we could find ourselves in the middle of a new war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Nobody knows, but it is irresponsible for the US to be dumping gasoline on this potential fire,” he said. Israel’s police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said officers were assessing the level of security needed for theopening, including deploying CCTV cameras and guards in the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Arnona, where the current US consulate is being retrofitted to become the embassy. “We’re still waiting to see if the US president will come here for the opening move. The level of security will be raised accordingly,” he said. Trump has hinted he may attend, while Israeli media have speculated he will send his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Israeli police had not received information of any specific warnings, Rosenfeld said, but security forces were “taking into consideration the period we’re going to be in and other events, including Jerusalem celebrations and Nakba day. There are implications around the Gaza strip area, and of course the move with the American embassy as well. We’re talking about an intensive week,” he said. Jerusalem’s status has been a critical obstacle in peace negotiations, and international consensus is that sovereignty over the city should be agreed between the two sides. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as a capital of a future independent state, but Israel captured it in 1967. It later annexed the city and claims the entire area as its “eternal and undivided” capital. On the weekend ahead of the embassy opening, thousands of Israelis are expected to mark what they say is the city’s reunification in a Jerusalem Day rally. Often made up of religious settlers, tThese marches pass through Muslim district of the Old City and in previous years groups have chanted anti-Arab insults. In the south, demonstrations in Gaza have been supported by Hamas, which rules the enclave and has fought three wars with Israel. With two-thirds of Gaza’s 2 million people being refugees or their descendants, protesters are demanding a “right to return” to their ancestral homes. “The intensity of these marches will reach its zenith on 14 May,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University. He said opening the embassy in a week in which Palestinians remember what they see as their defining tragedy is misguided. “It’s like the US is insisting on making the Palestinians remember this day as a very sad day in their history and in their struggle against the Israeli occupation,” he said. A week ago, a crowd of people moved towards the frontier, attempting to rip away barbed wire and set sections of the security fence on fire with burning tyres. Israel, which has rejected UN and EU calls for investigations into its use of live ammunition, accuses Hamas of exploiting civilians to break into its territory. “When you have tens of thousands of people around the border there is no control over them,” said Abusada. “It would be my assumption that some protesters will try to breach the fence, will try to infiltrate into Israel. ” The US embassy move will be preceded by the 12 May deadline for Trump to decide whether to walk away from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and reinstate sanctions on Tehran. Pulling out of the deal would add pressure on the Iranian leadership at a time when Israel has warned of open war and engaged in direct confrontation, targeting Iranian military sites in neighbouring Syria. Goldenberg said the “flood of huge events” could be overwhelming: “A toxic witches’ brew of political instability and further potential violence is stewing in the Middle East.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/08/texas-elections-female-candidates-first-time-blue-wave","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"Texas elections: first-time female candidates aim to ride 'blue wave' to victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/08/texas-elections-female-candidates-first-time-blue-wave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/08/texas-elections-female-candidates-first-time-blue-wave","fields":{"headline":"Texas elections: first-time female candidates aim to ride 'blue wave' to victory","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For Jana Lynne Sanchez, America’s new dawn felt like a plunge into darkness. She recalls exchanging stunned messages with friends in the hours after the result of the 2016 election was known. Now, she’s spending much of her time talking to strangers. Sanchez is one of many first-time female candidates motivated by the rise of Donald Trump and aiming to surf the so-called “blue wave” that, Democrats hope, will see the party retake the House and offer meaningful resistance to the real-estate mogul’s administration. Because she lives in small-town Texas, Sanchez knows this wave will not be a tsunami, submerging Republicans in November’s midterms. The electorate is more energised than normal but she still has to provide the spark. And so on a recent Sunday afternoon in suburban Fort Worth, she set out to make the kind of below-the-surface moves that might just make the difference: going from home to home, working from a dated database of likely Democratic voters. When there was no answer, Sanchez scribbled a message with her phone number on a hanger and attached it to a door handle. When a door opened, she spent almost as much time correcting contact details as she did asking if she could count on residents’ votes in the runoff on 22 May. It was a reminder that the wheels of the Democratic machine could use some grease. Texas’s sixth district stretches from Fort Worth and Arlington near Dallas south-east for about 100 miles into rural parts like Navarro County, where Trump harvested 73% of the vote. Any Democrat cannot hope to win purely on anti-Trump momentum. Sanchez does not mention the president in speeches. A campaign video shows her shooting a handgun and wearing cowboy boots with a Texas flag motif. “I’m an entrepreneur, a Christian, a gun owner and a Democrat,” the voiceover says. She is in favour of renewable energy and affordable healthcare and reforming criminal justice and immigration. The Republican incumbent, Joe Barton, has held the sixth since 1984. In 2016 he finished more than 19% ahead of the Democrat, Ruby Faye Woolridge, who will face Sanchez in the run-off. But Barton is not seeking re-election, after a nude photograph of him appeared on the internet, leading to reports in the Washington Post that while separated from his wife he sent sexually explicit messages and video to a woman he met on Facebook then threatened to report her to police. So this might yet be the right time for Sanchez, one of about 25 female Texas Democrats in a support group called Women on Fire. Some voters have told her they will only choose a man if there are no women on the ballot. “I think there’s an advantage to being a first-time candidate, I think there’s an advantage to being a woman,” she said. “It’s a really anti-incumbent year and most incumbents are men.” Sanchez or Woolridge will battle Jake Ellzey, a former navy pilot, or Ron Wright, Barton’s former chief of staff. Wright is best known for adding “In God We Trust” to paperwork as a county tax collector and citing Hitler when discouraging fundraising linked to Planned Parenthood. Texas sends 36 representatives and two senators to Congress: currently, 11 are Democrats. Three of the 38 are women, a far lower proportion than for Congress as a whole, which is only about 20% female. Neither party has sent a new congresswoman to Washington from Texas for a full term since 1996. But this is an unprecedented year for Democratic women in Texas. In the House races, the field of 40 primary hopefuls was four times bigger than in 2016. With seven female versus male runoffs ahead, 15 women have made it to November’s election compared with 14 men out of 68 primary candidates. Among Republicans the numbers are almost unchanged: 76 men and 10 women, leading, so far, to a field of 28 men and two women. Sanchez’s grandfather was an undocumented farm worker from Mexico; her father was one of 27 children. Born in the sixth, she lived for 18 years in Britain and the Netherlands, working as a journalist and co-founding a PR firm. When she returned to Texas she was alarmed. “My family, despite being Hispanic, are Trump supporters for the most part,” she said. ‘It’s time to be more involved’ Laura Moser, a writer and progressive activist, decided to stand in Texas’s seventh district after Trump beat Hillary Clinton despite his ugly comments about grabbing women “by the pussy”. “He won in spite of that,” she said, “or perhaps even because of it, and that for me was like, it’s time to be more involved and more active, because we’re half the population, getting no representation and our president talks about women in this alarming fashion. “So the only way to change the conversation is to grab a seat at the table.” Moser spoke at her campaign HQ, a former bridal shop in west Houston where mannequins share space with posters bearing slogans such as “ELECT MORE WOMEN”. More than 700,000 people live in this mostly affluent part of Houston, touted as a realistic target for Democrats, but only a few thousand are likely to vote in the run-off between Moser and Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, an attorney. They beat five men in the primary. “We have 1,700 volunteers in a district that averages 9,000 voters in a Democratic midterm,” Moser said. “We’re using them to call people every second of the day and to knock on doors and sometimes the unsexy low-tech things are what works. “When Bill Clinton was running for president it was the soccer mom, that was the key swing vote. He’d be in suburban Philadelphia getting the soccer moms, and now it’s like the mothers of daughters caucus. “I do not want my daughter to grow up in a world where people like Donald Trump are allowed to call the shots. And I do not think that I am alone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/06/qatar-blockade-unexpected-new-vision-isolation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T05:05:11Z","webTitle":"From Qatar’s blockade, a bold, unexpected new vision is emerging","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/06/qatar-blockade-unexpected-new-vision-isolation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/06/qatar-blockade-unexpected-new-vision-isolation","fields":{"headline":"From Qatar’s blockade, a bold, unexpected new vision is emerging","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For most of the past year the city-state of Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatar’s closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf state’s role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade. Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were diverted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatar’s sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics – 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated. The stated aim for the blockade – which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands – was a protest against what was seen as Qatar’s singular role in “funding terrorism” (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded. Far from destabilising Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an “us against the world” authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capital’s six-lane corniche. Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis’ stated goal has been to create a diverse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money – and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup – solves only some of those skills shortages. “It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work,” she said. “But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.” Qatar’s modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hind’s parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of “Education City” and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation. From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen “partner universities” that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A&amp;M for engineering, and so on. The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaas’s idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the children’s library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once. Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim. There is a blatant “look at us” attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard – and splashing out ostentatiously on the world’s most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezanne’s The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power. That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down. The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeera’s reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Doha’s ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas; hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood; offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates. For Qatar’s detractors, al-Jazeera has become the symbol of the hypocrisies of that self-styled radicalism. In Doha it is rather an emblem of independence and sovereignty. As Sheikha Hind suggests: “Imagine [another nation] telling Britain to close the BBC – you would be shocked.” She makes a strong case for the liberalising effect the broadcaster has had. “I think when we are talking about where we want our region to be, al-Jazeera is an important part of that … ” she says. “Maybe a lot of people are not happy with things that have come out from the darkness, but if you want to build a civil society and allow people to think for themselves and be critical, every story has to come out.” The apparent effort to embed that muck-raking spirit more deeply in Qatari society is rooted in the Education City campus of Northwestern University – an outpost of its Medill School of Journalism. The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estate’s role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that “there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it – the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here”. Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions). There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN. In the dean’s view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City. In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural divide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis? “I won’t lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade,” Sheikha Hind says, “absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it – whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in.” She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, “if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now.” The goal has not changed, she suggests, “but now we are running rather than walking”. • The author travelled to Qatar as a guest of the Qatari government’s culture department."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/05/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-point-at-chelsea-top-four-confirmation","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T21:30:03Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp seeks top-four slot and end to stupid questions at Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/05/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-point-at-chelsea-top-four-confirmation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/05/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-point-at-chelsea-top-four-confirmation","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp seeks top-four slot and end to stupid questions at Chelsea","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Liverpool need to take a point or more from their visit to Stamford Bridge this afternoon in order to secure their place in the top four, leave the rest of the season free to concentrate on the Champions League final and give Jürgen Klopp a break from answering stupid questions. The German has become adept at either widening his eyes or letting his jaw drop in response to some of the inanities that come his way during media duties, though to his credit he usually manages a reasoned answer. “Yes of course it is important to this club to play in the Champions League next season,” he said slowly, as if examining the query for a catch it did not contain. “We are strong enough to compete against the very best teams in Europe so that is what we want to do. We are ready for this challenge.” Clearly it is not only Sybil Fawlty who specialises in the bleedin’ obvious, though Klopp was not being flippant and neither should his reply be dismissed lightly. How many other English clubs could currently say the same? In under three seasons at Anfield Klopp has turned the club into a force in Europe to such an extent that clubs with bigger budgets and more experienced squads – Chelsea and the two Manchester sides, say – ought to be vaguely embarrassed. Since he was last in the Champions League final, with Borussia Dortmund in 2013, no Premier League side has gone as far, and now he is back with a club that managed qualification only twice in the previous eight seasons. Klopp’s Liverpool are strong in a way that few sides from this country have been in Europe since Manchester United were in their pomp. When Chelsea became the last English winners of the Champions League in 2012 they were a fading force, not really hitting the heights they threatened under José Mourinho or (briefly) Guus Hiddink. United went to the 2009 and 2011 finals as clear underdogs and were duly humbled twice by Barcelona. Those versions of Chelsea and United were certainly not sides others were hoping to avoid in the draw, which is what Liverpool have just become. After seeing what they managed against the English champions and the last Italian side in the contest, even a team of Real Madrid’s pedigree and experience will be careful not to make any assumptions. Klopp has turned Mohamed Salah into a Ballon d’Or candidate, made Manchester City think twice about the wisdom of letting James Milner go, reinvigorated his back-line options with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson and, perhaps most impressively of all, compensated for the loss of Philippe Coutinho by making the team revolve around the outstanding Roberto Firmino. Klopp has bought well, built a side that can hurt just about anyone and he has not yet finished. Naby Keïta arrives from RB Leipzig in the summer – Liverpool might even take him as a guest to the Champions League final in Kiev – and Klopp expects to make one or two more signings before the start of next season. “Naby has the quality to have a big effect on the team immediately he arrives,” the manager said of the Guinea midfielder. “He is not playing the World Cup so he will have a full pre-season with us, which will help him a lot. We will probably sign a couple more players in summer because we need more depth in the squad. “To bring in players who are 200% better than what we have will be difficult but we had a problem when Coutinho left and Adam Lallana and then Emre Can became injured. You can never remove all injury risk and the boys still did brilliantly, but of course we will try to strengthen the squad because that’s how it is.” Klopp is refusing all invitations to get carried away by the achievement of taking Liverpool to an eighth European Cup final – “I am not interested in reaching finals, I am more interested in winning them” – though he will admit that one of the reasons he would prefer to strengthen rather than stand still is because the English league is so tough. “I do think this is the hardest league,” he said. “The intensity is hard, the fixture schedule is hard. In England every team fights for everything every week. “If there is a reason why English teams have not been doing so well in Europe I would say that is the most important one. I have spoken about this before and I am not looking to complain or make excuses but I think we all know that the schedule you give to your teams is not made for being successful in summer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/05/the-week-in-patriarchy-twilight-zone","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T12:00:51Z","webTitle":"How does it feel to be a woman today?

Perkins said he told Raptors player and his former teammate Serge Ibaka at halftime that the Cavaliers were going to beat them. “Drake butted in, talking shit to me,” Perkins told ESPN. “He said something slick, so I said something back: ‘Sit your ass down and watch the game.’” Toronto Star sports columnist Bruce Arthur claimed: “This went all the way into the tunnel, with Drake calling Perkins a ‘fucking pussy’ and calling for him to come out.” After the game, the Cavaliers’ security personnel spoke with Drake’s bodyguard as the rapper said: “I didn’t say shit.” Drake later wrote on Instagram: “I just said I liked the hem on his capris.” The Raptors lost the game by a single point, 113-112, and also lost the second in their playoff series 128-110, leaving them needing to win four of their five remaining games. In 2013, Drake became a “global ambassador” for the Raptors, a partnership that expanded in 2016 when his label OVO Sound donated $1m (Canadian) to fund the refurbishment of community basketball courts in Toronto.

A few weeks ago, I suggested that because of unexpected increases in taxation revenue and with an election due in the next 12 months, the budget would see the treasurer “doling out the pork”. Two days later, the leader of the National party rather confirmed this by referring to the treasurer in an interview with the Daily Telegraph as “Scott Santa Claus Morrison”. Morrison quickly tried to dampen these expectations but the cat was well and truly out of the bag, and since then all the pre-budget drops have been about new spending or tax cuts with little sense of the need for restraint. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday This has actually brought with it some problems for the government as they discard what they once told us were sacredly held beliefs. Last year, Morrison for example, was adamant that the NDIS needed to be fully funded, and could only be done so by raising the Medicare levy a half a per cent. He did this, he told the nation, because “it’s time ... we give disabled Australians and their families the guarantee they deserve”. But now? Guarantees? Pfft. That’s so 2017, we have a strong economy, don’t you know! Morrison told the Today Show’s Karl Stefanovic this week that, “I’m pleased as punch for people with disabilities that we can guarantee them those funds from a stronger economy”. You would have to be as dumb as Punch to believe a strong economy is guaranteed. The point of the Medicare levy increase was that the NDIS is not some one-off project. It is ongoing – when the economy is doing well and when it is not. Now Morrison would have us believe the economy will always be doing well. The only reason the government has dumped the Medicare levy increase is because back in 2016 it had imposed a dopey cap on tax revenue of 23.9% of GDP. So great is the influx of revenue coming via improved export prices and employment growth that it looked set to break through this cap in the next few years – and thus they needed to reduce the tax take. But why not just bank that money and reduce the deficit and government debt?After all, that was what Morrison said he would do in last year’s budget. Now, instead, extra revenue will be spent – or foregone as is the case with the rescinding Medicare levy increase. This is what happens when your budget policy is framed more by politics than economics. There is not one iota of evidence that the economy suffers if tax revenue goes above 23.9% of GDP. When tax revenue rises it does so for pretty much one reason only – the economy is doing well. That is why in 2004-05 and 2005-06 at the height of the mining boom, tax revenue was equivalent to 24.3% of GDP. And that is why when you do get an unexpected influx of revenue, blowing it on tax cuts is about the dumbest thing you can do, because while you might be able to afford it while things are unexpectedly doing well, you cannot when things are unexpectedly doing poorly. And no one ever expects the economy to do poorly. In Peter Costello’s last budget in 2007, the Treasury predicted that “the world economy is expected to continue to expand at a strong rate” and that “growth in the United States is expected to ease in 2007, before strengthening in 2008”. Instead it went backwards into the deepest recession since the second world war. Morrison’s position also highlights just how hollow is the Liberal party’s talk on debt and deficit. During the Rudd-Gillard years the cries about rising government debt were unending. And yet government net debt is now higher than it has ever been and five years into government, the Liberal party are yet to deliver a budget deficit smaller than it was in 2012-13. Now that isn’t to say the government should have been reducing the deficit or debt faster than they have – it just highlights how stupid it is to make debt and deficits your key measures. The reality is both are important but are subject to the requirements of the economy. When the economy is weak and tax revenue is low, cutting spending to get back to surplus is a fool’s errand that is only good if you believe the country should experience a recession. Morrison, like Joe Hockey (and Costello) before him, has discovered that the path to a budget surplus is paved with revenue growth, not spending cuts. But now that he has the revenue of which Wayne Swan could have only dreamed, the desire for a surplus, or to reduce debt, has become less important. In the 2014-15 budget, the government planned for a budget surplus of “at least 1% of GDP by 2023‑24”. That was a bit too specific for Morrison, who last year watered-down the commitment to “as soon as possible”. Now that “as soon as possible” is, as Morrison told reporters this week, “conditioned by ensuring taxes do not rise more than 23.9% of the economy.” You could argue given the current low inflation and income growth that the economy is not actually strong enough for a faster return to surplus than previously planned. But Morrison is not making that case. For him the economy is strong – and will ever be so. He is just using the 23.9% line as an excuse for dolling out tax cuts because an election is coming. It’s about politics, not economics. And it reveals just how disingenuous the Liberal party’s decade-long preaching on the evil of debt and deficit has been. And that should never be forgotten.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, have emphasised that message before next week’s economic statement, which is expected to deliver income-tax cuts, a significant infrastructure spend, and investments in aged care and health, including a modest rise in the Medicare levy for GP visits. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Following on from a decision last month to dump an $8bn increase in the Medicare levy that was supposed to help fund the national disability insurance scheme, there is also speculation the government will use the budget to ditch a decision to scrap an energy supplement implemented at the time Labor legislated the carbon price. Cormann made it clear on Friday the government would persist in trying to land its politically unpopular tax cut for big business, despite the complications posed by damaging revelations in the banking royal commission. Tax measures The centrepiece of next Tuesday’s budget is expected to be personal income-tax cuts, with speculative reports saying these will be spread over 10 years with a modest start. Labor has already indicated it will offer voters something similar by way of tax relief. Australia’s resources groups expect the Coalition will – apart from keeping the proposed tax cuts for big companies despite the lack of parliamentary support – use the budget to adjust the uplift rate of the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax – a shift that could affect deductions that gas companies can carry forward. The government has also confirmed it will change the rules so that all beer kegs larger than eight litres will be taxed at the same rate, a decision costing the budget $85m over the forward estimates. Large beer producers have previously enjoyed more advantageous tax treatment than craft brewers. On Friday, Morrison could not guarantee the price of craft beer would decrease as a result of the change, but he said he was “taking the tax monkey off the brewer’s back and the distiller’s back all around the country because I want to see those businesses grow”. Infrastructure In the countdown to the budget, there has been a debate inside the government about winding back current levels of migration on the basis that Australia’s big cities are too congested, and infrastructure is not keeping pace. The prime minister and the treasurer have been resisting calls to cut the immigration rate, and have stepped up the public focus on infrastructure projects, including $5bn to help construct the long-awaited rail link from Melbourne’s Tullamarine rail link to the city. In the run-up to Tuesday night’s budget, Malcolm Turnbull has unveiled a $3.2bn infrastructure package for Western Australia, where the Coalition has been in trouble politically. It includes $1.67bn for road projects, an extra $1.05bn for Metronet, $189m for hospital infrastructure and $140m for a water project. With Queensland being critical to the government’s electoral fortunes federally, given the swag of marginal seats in the state, there has also been a Queensland package, including $800m for a rail upgrade on the Sunshine Coast, and $1bn for an upgrade of the M1 motorway on the Gold Coast. As well as road and rail investments, on Friday, the government confirmed that $140m would be set aside from 2019-20 for a location incentive to attract blockbuster films for production in facilities on the Gold Cast. The proposal will increase the location offset rate from 16.5% to 30% for eligible large budget international productions that film in Australia from 1 July 2018. The government also committed $155m this week for a four-lane bridge over the Shoalhaven river at Nowra, in the marginal seat of Gilmore in New South Wales. The Liberals hold that seat with a wafer-thin margin of 0.73%. Aged care The budget is expected to confirm $100bn for aged care over five years, with a focus on 103,000 people on the waiting list for in-house care, increased focus on training to build the aged care workforce, and improvements to how services are accessed. In health, a report in the Daily Telegraph suggests the Medicare rebate for GP visits will go up by 55 cents per visit from July 1, ending a four-year freeze – but there will also be cuts to some services. Rivers of revenue ‘gold’ and return to surplus With the economy finally turning a corner, Morrison used a speech delivered in late April to confirm the 2018 budget would benefit from stronger than expected revenue collections. He noted that tax receipts until February were running $4.8bn higher than forecast by the Treasury last December, including a $1.2bn boost to income-tax receipts and a $3bn increase on company tax. “Our economy is finally shaking off the dulling effects of the downturn in the mining investment boom,” he said. The respected forecaster Chris Richardson predicts that revenue in 2017-18 will beat the official forecasts by $7.6bn and in 2018-19 by $6.7bn. This improvement translates to underlying cash deficits of $16.6bn in 2017-18 and $13.3bn in 2018-19. While there has been speculation that the budget may include an earlier return to surplus than the forecast time of 2020-21 despite the big outlay on personal tax cuts – Morrison has refused to guarantee that the government will run budget surpluses of at least 1% of GDP, which has been the Coalition’s previous commitment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/04/google-facebook-not-playing-by-the-rules-news-corp-tells-accc","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T04:36:40Z","webTitle":"Google, Facebook not playing by the rules, News Corp tells ACCC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/04/google-facebook-not-playing-by-the-rules-news-corp-tells-accc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/04/google-facebook-not-playing-by-the-rules-news-corp-tells-accc","fields":{"headline":"Google, Facebook not playing by the rules, News Corp tells ACCC","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Google, Facebook and Apple have too much power and are engaging in anti-competitive practices that are having a detrimental effect on journalism, News Corp Australia has told the competition regulator. “Digital platforms impose restrictive contract terms and engage in aggressive mergers and acquisitions in order to neutralise emerging competition and extend their market power,” Australia’s biggest media company said in a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s digital platforms inquiry. The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, has said consumers are concerned about the survival of quality news media as well as the harvesting of their data by dominant digital platforms. News Corp said legislative change might be required to stop the digital giants swamping local news organisations, and proposed an algorithm review board to “remedy algorithmic distortions”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Its submission said Facebook and Google directly influenced about three-quarters of internet traffic, “exerting a strong influence on how readers access and engage with News Corp Australia’s content”. “Prior to the advent of digital platforms, the creation of news and journalism followed a virtuous circle whereby readership drove subscription revenue, which drove advertising spend, which, in turn, drove investment in content,” the submission said. “While digital platforms have had some positive impacts, they must be balanced against the significant negative impacts. Fundamentally, digital platforms have undermined this virtuous circle by treating news as an add-on to the consumer-facing services and showcasing as much content for free as possible. As consumers gravitate to the platforms so too do advertisers, further undermining the sustainability of publishers’ business models.” Australia has lost about 3,000 journalists’ jobs since the growth of digital platforms escalated about 10 years ago, according to the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance submission, one of 57 published on Thursday. The job losses have come at a significant cost to media companies – Fairfax Media, publisher of the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, has spent $490m on redundancies in the past 10 years. It now has 3,917 full-time journalist positions compared with 7,126 a decade ago. About 1,400 positions have been shed at News Corp’s Australian titles during the same period. Fairfax has echoed the concerns of its biggest newspaper competitor, saying its advertising revenue for the capital city mastheads has shrunk dramatically since 1999: from $800m to $225m, without taking into account the effects of inflation. According to Fairfax’s submission, Google and Facebook captured three-quarters of Australian online advertising expenditure in 2016 and could capture 84% of the global digital ad spend in 2017, excluding China. Fairfax said Google and Facebook should take their share of responsibility for fake news and filter bubbles, and the consequent impact on social cohesion and democracy. “It is our assessment that the role played by digital platforms today is not entirely dissimilar to the traditional role of publishers as controllers of physical distribution networks,” Fairfax said. “Just as publishers are required to take responsibility for the content accessible through their products, platforms should be responsible for the content they amplify and distribute.” News Corp criticised the strategies employed by the digital platforms, including undermining paywalls with free content or the promotion of free content that has been repurposed from exclusive articles behind a paywall. The news agency Australian Associated Press said in its submission it had lost clients and the impact on the business had resulted in bureaus being closed and reporters losing jobs. “For AAP the changing commercial dynamics have resulted in the loss of clients, specifically broadcasters, who have cancelled AAP subscription services worth hundreds of thousands of dollars because in the words of one TV media executive: ‘We just Google it’,” it said. In its submission, Facebook said it was helping journalism by providing a free global distribution service for publishers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/04/local-elections-how-night-unfolded-key-races","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T05:54:51Z","webTitle":"How local election night unfolded in key races","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/local-elections-how-night-unfolded-key-races","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/04/local-elections-how-night-unfolded-key-races","fields":{"headline":"How local election night unfolded in key races","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Wandsworth: Labour gains but Tories hang on to crown jewel A much-touted Labour attempt to wrestle control of Wandsworth – controlled by the Tories since 1978 – was foiled after the Conservatives successfully concentrated resources in key strongholds amid a significantly increased turnout. However, Labour came close on a night when it gained seven seats on a flagship Tory council that has been known for its low council tax and outsourcing of local services. The final results left the Tories on 33 seats, Labour on 26 and one held by Malcolm Grimston, a former Conservative-turned-independent who had the largest personal vote of the night (4,002). Even before the results started to come in, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, sought to manage expectations when he arrived at the count in south London, where his party had needed to take 12 Tory seats to win outright control. “Of course we may not win councils but I think winning councillors who are Labour is a fantastic achievement,” he said, when it was put to him by reporters that he and other Labour figures had “talked up” the possibility of winning Wandsworth. While Labour did make gains at the expense of the Tories, the latter fended off the challenge by increasing its vote to retain control of all seats in wards such as Fairfield, Thamesfield and Southfields. Ravi Govindia, the Tory leader of the council, said: “The strategy was to take the message to every household, to every door, to every resident and convince them that this was a council that had not run out of steam.” Another story of the night was the irrelevance of explicitly anti-Brexit parties, despite 75% support for remain in the area during the 2016 referendum on membership of the EU. Both the Liberal Democrats and Renew, a new party seeking to carve out ground in the centre, failed to make any inroads in the Toriy or Labour vote in what was entirely a two-horse race. Ben Quinn Trafford: Greens take Tory seats to make Labour biggest party Labour became the biggest party in Trafford, winning four seats from the Tories to take their total to 30. After a surprise double win by the Green party in the Altrincham ward, the Conservative party was left with 29 seats, down from 33. “I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group on Trafford council. “This is far beyond our expectations. We hoped to tip the council into no overall control tonight, but to have become the largest party at the same time is a fantastic bonus.” He added that, as the picture for Labour across the country was mixed, the result in Trafford was “a damning indictment of the local Conservatives”. The Conservative former council leader Sean Anstee said elections in Trafford were often tight. “Clearly, as the only Conservative-majority council in Greater Manchester, surrounded by a number of Labour councils, we’ve seen significant opposition activity into the borough over the last six months or so.” Anstee said there was also a significant increase in turnout in wards that had changed hands. “A number of voters who ordinarily perhaps haven’t voted, turned out,” he said. “We’ll need to reflect on the reasons why they turned out in the way that they did and why they voted in the way that they did.” While it didn’t surprise many to see the Conservatives lose overall control of Trafford council, it had not been predicted the Greens would land the final blow. Geraldine Coggins, one of two Green candidates to take seats from the Tories in Altrincham, said while their campaign went below the media’s radar, they were not surprised to have won. “I spoke to a number of people in their 80s who said they had always voted Conservative but were going to vote Green for the first time in their lives, and a number of Labour members who said they were going to vote Green this time. There was a lot of momentum,” she said. Frances Perraudin Swindon: Labour disappointed in bellwether contest Labour suffered a major blow in Swindon, where it failed to force the Tories out of power despite a well-resourced campaign and a string of visits from Jeremy Corbyn and other senior figures. Corbyn’s party gained one ward from the Lib Dems but none from the Tories, who hung on to control of the Wiltshire council by one seat. The Labour group leader, Jim Grant, said he was bitterly disappointed. “We need to sit down and analyse the figures. Turnout was up all round. We got as many votes as we thought we would need to win. “Clearly the Conservatives were able to increase their vote. How, I don’t know. It may be the collapse of the Ukip vote and that has gone back to the Tories. “But we are still in the game here. The majority is reduced to one. Next year, one last haul and hopefully we will break the Tory monopoly on control. Jeremy [Corbyn] has inspired our activist base and that is why we have got so many votes.” At general elections, Swindon is seen at a bellwether – whoever holds the two seats wins power at Westminster. Labour was hoping a good showing in Wiltshire would be a sign that it could make inroads across the south of England. The Tory group leader, David Renard, said: “We got our positive message across. Labour ran a very negative campaign here. They have thrown a lot of resource, brought in a lot of people and spent a lot of money trying to take up to six of our seats. They failed to take every one. We have shown the Labour party is a long way from forming a government and on the doorstep there is a lot of anti-Jeremy Corbyn feeling.” Robert Buckland, the Tory South Swindon MP and solicitor general, added: “Labour, for all their kitchen-sink approach to this election, just aren’t ready. This is a town that for generations was a Labour town. They’ve had generations to prove themselves and they were rejected. Labour were expecting to take control or for there to be no overall control. They failed.” Steve Morris Kensington and Chelsea: no upset despite Grenfell factor Kensington and Chelsea’s Conservative-run council has faced a year of relentless criticism for its handling of the Grenfell Tower fire, resulting in the resignation of council leader and contributing to the departure of many long-serving councillors. But the disaster did not stop the London borough’s voters rewarding the Tory administration with another overwhelming majority in Thursday’s election. The council has been controlled by the Conservatives since it was formed in 1964 and Labour went into this year’s election in a distant second place. But last June’s catastrophe, combined with the unexpected victory of Emma Dent Coad in the Kensington parliamentary constituency during the general election, had raised hopes of an upset. This did not come to pass. Instead the Tories finished on 36 councillors, with Labour gaining just one extra ward to win 13 councillors. The Liberal Democrats took the final seat. Labour gained votes in the wards near the burned-out remains of Grenfell but it struggled to main any inroads in the wealthier parts of the borough, even in wards they had been confident of taking from the Conservatives. “We have piled up votes in Labour-held wards,” said the Labour group leader, Robert Atkinson, saying his party’s gains would be limited because the Conservatives had managed to “frighten out” their vote across the west London borough. The Conservative leader, Elizabeth Campbell, used her victory speech to declare her party had a lot of work to do following last summer’s disaster. “We all recognise we still need to rebuild trust,” she said. “We must be and we will be open to all voices of our communities. “We all live in the shadow of Grenfell. Grenfell was,Grenfell is, and Grenfell will be our first priority.” The Kensington and Chelsea results also served as a cursory warning for individuals tempted to set up a new political party. Advance Together, which had been compared to the French President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche movement, ran candidates in most wards but came consistently last.

Alfred Keating, 58, was a commodore in the New Zealand navy and was one of the country’s most senior naval officers before he resigned last month. Keating was serving as a defence attache embassy in Washington in July 2017. On 27 July a small covert camera was discovered in a unisex bathroom in the embassy when it fell out of a hiding spot in a heating duct. It had been positioned to capture images of anyone using the toilet. The embassy toilet was generally used by approximately 60 embassy staff. New Zealand police travelled to Washington to investigate, and brought the recording device back to be forensically examined. The investigation revealed the device had been in place for some months, as the homemade platform it was mounted on was covered in a thick layer of dust. On the day it was discovered the camera had been activated at 9am and had captured 19 images over a five-hour period of people using the bathroom. A search warrant of Keating’s home in New Zealand led to him being charged with attempting to obtain intimate visual recordings. The prosecution alleges that Keating’s computer contained software to operate the camera, and also that his DNA matched that found on the SD card inside the camera. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Keating joined the navy in 1976 and has studied engineering in the UK; worked as a team leader on the Australian and New Zealand Anzac frigate project; served as New Zealand’s assistant naval attache and senior technical officer in the US; and worked as the assistant chief of navy in Wellington."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/04/friday-briefing-local-elections-how-england-voted","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T05:32:53Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: May survives first big test since general election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/04/friday-briefing-local-elections-how-england-voted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/04/friday-briefing-local-elections-how-england-voted","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: May survives first big test since general election","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Have we passed peak Corbyn’? Hello, it’s Warren Murray filling you in about Friday’s news. Results are coming in from the local elections. The Labour party has made gains in London, while the Conservatives have had the best showing in the rest of England. We’ve had a reporting team up all night and our live coverage continues this morning, while our interactive page lets you keep track of all the results as they arrive. At time of writing, with results in from 87 of the 150 councils in England holding elections, all three main parties have achieved net gains in numbers of seats. Labour was on 1,072 seats (+30), the Conservatives 642 (+16) and the Lib Dems 278 (+24). Labour had won 44 councils (-1), the Conservatives 27 (no change) and the Lib Dems 3 (no change). Ukip were the biggest losers of the night. With results in from 87 councils, they had lost 35 seats, and won just two. Here is how the night unfolded in some of the key races. The results mean Theresa May has emerged unscathed from her first major electoral test since the general election. Preliminary analysis suggests that outside London there was a swing from Labour to the Conservatives. In London the trend was different, but Labour failed to secure high-profile gains that some in the party had hoped for. A much-touted attempt to seize control of Wandsworth was foiled by the Conservatives, who have held it since 1978. On the BBC election programme Justine Greening, the Conservative former education secretary and MP for Putney, said: “Maybe we are beginning to see something akin to peak Corbyn happening.” The Tories have also held Westminster, and Labour has conceded it can’t win Kensington and Chelsea. The Conservatives gained control of Basildon and Peterborough, both from no overall control. Jonathan Carr-West, CEO of the Local Government Information Unit, said: “At present it looks like a better night for the Conservatives than many would have anticipated, while Labour results have not quite lived up to expectations. The Lib Dems made big strides in terms of numbers of councillors and swept away the Conservatives in Richmond, presumably benefiting from being the only major party opposed to Brexit in the borough that recorded one of the highest remain votes in the country. “Overall though, we seem to be seeing an entrenchment of the status quo: a divided Britain in which big cities vote Labour and everywhere else votes Conservative,” said Carr-West. * * * Novichok was made to kill – Up to 100 grams of liquid nerve agent may have been used in the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, according to the world chemical weapons watchdog. The quantity of novichok used in the Salisbury attack was much more than would be kept for research purposes, indicating it was made to be used as a weapon, said Ahmet Üzümcü, head of the OPCW. The poison was of a high purity and “very persistent” where it had been spread. Almost 200 military personnel in protective suits and boots are spending months decontaminating nine sites in Salisbury. * * * Storm over Trump ‘hush money’ – Donald Trump is being accused of breaking campaign finance law after admitting he reimbursed the money paid by his lawyer to Stormy Daniels in the run up to the 2016 election. He previously said he didn’t know about it. The US president has insisted “no money from the campaign” flowed to the adult film actor who alleges an affair with him. But watchdogs and experts argue that Trump still broke the law by failing to include the $130,000 payment in campaign financial disclosures. Walter Shaub, former director of government ethics and Trump critic, said: “It is absolutely stunning that we’ve reached the point where the president of the United States appears to have lied to the US Office of Government Ethics about a payoff to a porn star.” * * * Twitter password warning – Twitter has advised all its users to change their passwords after a security flaw was found. There was “no indication of breach or misuse” of the passwords, which had been stored as plain text on internal system logs when they should have been encrypted. Olivia Solon’s report explains the bug and what you should do if you’re on Twitter. * * * Indian Ocean’s lonely graves – The seabed search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370 may have found no trace of the airliner. But it has potentially solved the mystery of two 19th century shipwrecks. Maritime historians have published a short list of possible identities of the wrecks that were found in the initial search of 274,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean, where MH370 is thought to have gone down with 238 people on board. One is thought to be the brig W Gordon, bound for Australia from Scotland in 1877; or the Magdala, lost in 1882 while sailing from Wales to Indonesia. The other wreck is likely the barque West Ridge, which vanished in 1883. Both are more than 3km down and unlikely to be researched further, says Ross Anderson from the Western Australian Museum. “These are the deepest wrecks so far located in the Indian Ocean – they’re some of the most remote shipwrecks in the world.” * * * Some of us still walk – A backlash is taking place against charging stations for electric cars, with pedestrians complaining they block their way. Islington council in London has been clever enough to install them in lamp-posts, but in many localities they have just been plonked on footpaths. Meanwhile Vélib – the pioneering Paris bike share scheme copied from London to Seattle – is in ruins after its new operator ripped out perfectly good bikes and docking stations. The once hugely popular scheme has lost nearly a third of its 290,000 subscribers. Lunchtime read: What to do about Russia Britain is calling time on Russia’s disinformation campaigns with a major international push to counter the Kremlin’s propaganda efforts. British politicians and counterparts in Europe say traditional diplomacy no longer works with Russia because its government simply lies whenever it’s got any explaining to do. “Putin is waging an information war designed to turn our strongest asset – freedom of speech – against us,” said Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee. You should spend some time today getting to grips with how the Russian government wages war on the truth – a prime example being its embassy in London, and the foreign minister himself, spreading conspiracy theories about the Salisbury poisoning. RT, Russia’s Kremlin-backed 24-hour news channel, is being investigated by the UK regulator Ofcom for breaches of impartiality rules –but the bigger story is its internet operation. Here’s how it uses viral videos, humour and meme culture to spread fake news. Something to think about before liking or sharing one of their posts.

The Pirates of the Caribbean character is, after all, a drunken pirate who sails through fiascos and misadventures. It is Johnny Depp, however, not Sparrow, who is accused of presiding over such mayhem in a drama playing out not on screen but in court. Two bodyguards made the allegations in a lawsuit this week which piled fresh acrimony on Depp’s reputation, renewing doubts over his future as Hollywood’s quirkiest and possibly most beloved leading man. The multi-claim lawsuit over unpaid wages and working conditions detailed a lifestyle of dysfunction and chaos. Eugene Arreola and Miguel Sanchez alleged that a “financial hurricane” and a “toxic” environment enveloped Depp’s Hollywood Hills compound from 2016. The suit alleges: “Often times plaintiffs were forced to protect Depp from himself and his vices while in public. An incident at a local nightclub involved plaintiffs alerting Depp of illegal substances visible on his face and person while preventing onlookers from noticing Depp’s condition.” More damning allegations can be expected if the ex-employees obtain a jury trial in Los Angeles superior court. Depp’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment over the latest allegations. It is a puzzle straight out of Hollywood Babylon: how can a star who has reputedly earned more than $650m struggle to pay his bills? The question may be better addressed to psychologists than accountants. The money is not missing. Depp, 54, spent it. Even Captain Sparrow might wince at such excess. Profligacy barely counts as vice in Hollywood but Depp’s epic expenditure – in addition to fast cars and planes he bought a French village, a $22m yacht and a string of Caribbean islands while allegedly blowing through $2m a month, including $30,000 a month on wine – rivals that of the castle-collecting Nicholas Cage. In recent years this has led to Depp clashing with, firing and suing a rotating retinue of managers and lawyers, who in turn have sued him over allegedly broken contracts and unpaid fees, draining more funds from the Depp treasure chest and dumping more revelations about his private life overboard into the public maw. Financial troubles alone would not necessarily dent the mystique of an actor who stole teenage hearts in 21 Jump Street, then stole adult hearts in Cry-Baby, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, Edward Scissorhands, Chocolat and the Pirates franchise. Droll charm and offbeat roles in films like Corpse Bride and Sweeney Todd cemented an image of a rogueish misfit who tripped into stardom and ended up dating Winona Ryder, Kate Moss and Vanessa Paradis. Bizarre episodes like firing the ashes of Hunter S Thompson from a cannon (cost: $3m) and smuggling his Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo into Australia only burnished the kooky vibe. The glow survived even commercial and critical duds like The Lone Ranger and The Tourist – box office analysts said he was overpaid – and fatigue with Pirates sequels. From 2016 the picture darkened. Amber Heard filed for divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order, alleging physical and verbal abuse. A leaked video showed him raging in their kitchen. The couple settled their divorce in a $7m deal and issued a joint statement saying their relationship was “intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love”. This did not appease Harry Potter fans, who launched petitions demanding that the makers of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, the sequel to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, drop Depp as the film’s villain. It was an unfamiliar sting for a star used to basking in affection at the People’s Choice awards. Warner Bros and JK Rowling have stuck with Depp for Fantastic Beasts, sparing him banishment to the ranks of #MeToo blackguards. “The film-makers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,” Rowling said in a statement. But in a climate where actors such as Kevin Spacey and Kian Lawley are being replaced after misconduct, some observers worry about the long-lasting effect of his role. Forbes’ Scott Mendelson suggests that his place in the film “will poison the entire franchise’s legacy” while Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe, has said they he can “see why people are frustrated” with the situation. Depp’s career – and bank balance – will partly hinge on whether Disney gives Captain Sparrow a sixth Pirates film (the last outing was a disappointment domestically but made $794m worldwide). But with each controversy, will audiences still turn up to watch him?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/speedy/1187","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-30T23:00:23Z","webTitle":"Speedy crossword No 1,187","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/speedy/1187","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/speedy/1187","fields":{"headline":"Speedy crossword No 1,187","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/yohan-cabaye-joel-ward-crystal-palace-contract-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T22:06:00Z","webTitle":"Talks may come too late to keep Yohan Cabaye and Joel Ward at Crystal Palace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/yohan-cabaye-joel-ward-crystal-palace-contract-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/yohan-cabaye-joel-ward-crystal-palace-contract-talks","fields":{"headline":"Talks may come too late to keep Yohan Cabaye and Joel Ward at Crystal Palace","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Crystal Palace are to hold talks with Yohan Cabaye and Joel Ward next week to clarify their plans for the future, with Roy Hodgson expecting to lose the experienced pair under freedom of contract this summer. Palace go into Saturday’s game at Stoke six points clear of the relegation places and, while not mathematically safe, with thoughts turning to next season. Talks with five players whose deals expire on 1 July have been on hold while Hodgson’s side sought to stave off the threat of relegation but the sporting director, Dougie Freedman, will meet those concerned next week to discuss the future. As it stands, Cabaye and Ward – a member of the side promoted from the second tier in 2013 and a veteran of 205 appearances for the club – will depart. Cabaye has proved a key performer under Hodgson, and has excelled over recent weeks, but would need to accept a considerable cut to his £100,000-a-week salary to extend his stay into a fourth campaign. Marseille have been credited with an interest in the former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder. “We need to get our preparation and recruitment right because we are going to be losing some very good players at the end of this season,” Hodgson said. “There are several out of contract. You can’t talk with people like Yohan Cabaye, Joel Ward, Julián Speroni, Damien Delaney or Chung-yong Lee until you know where you’re going to be and what you’ve got to offer. So this is going to be hard work in the coming days for myself and Doug Freedman. “There’s no doubt we are losing players, not least [the loanees] Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tim Fosu-Mensah, quite apart from anyone who might leave the club for other reasons. We’ll have to canvas those players and find out their plans.” Hodgson would expect to recruit replacements to ensure his 25-man senior squad is filled. The Spanish goalkeeper Vicente Guaita is joining from Getafe, and Palace have looked at Fulham’s right-back Ryan Fredericks and could revive interest in the Anderlecht midfielder Leander Dendoncker. The manager said he was “fairly confident” Christian Benteke would be retained, despite a disappointing season, and stressed he saw his own future at the club next term.

Romain Sauron, a French national, said he turned up to vote at the Mile End ward in the London borough of Tower Hamlets to find a “G” alongside his name. The officials at the polling station told him this marked him out as an EU citizen and meant he could not vote. “They were quite difficult. I have been here for 13 years and always voted, but I had to haggle with them for about 10 minutes. They checked their leaflet and told me: ‘No, you can’t vote’. I suspect they didn’t read it properly and their training was very poor. They then made a phone call to someone and after 10 minutes they said ‘that’s fine, you can vote’,” Sauron said. “I was tagged as an EU citizen. I think many people would have walked away, would have felt ashamed.” Another EU citizen, also voting in Tower Hamlets, had a similar experience. Dragos Serban, a Romanian who has lived in the UK for eight years, said: “I made my way to my designated polling station and as expected they asked for my name and address. “On their checklist, the letter G was next to my name and I was shown a leaflet which said that G means ‘certain EU citizens cannot vote’. “I was then asked to wait a few minutes while they made a call to double check my eligibility to vote. When they came back, they said that the leaflet was in regards to the general election and does not apply to today’s local one. Once that has been cleared up, they were happy to cross my name off their checklist and was allowed to proceed with the vote.” Serban added: “While my experience has been positive, I am left wondering just how many EU citizens are in the same situation and have left the polling station without exercising their voting rights.” A Tower Hamlets spokesman said: “We’ve not had reports of people being turned away across the borough but anyone with concerns should report them to this address: www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/electoralfraud or @towerhamletsnow.” In general elections, EU citizens are not entitled to vote – with the exception of citizens of Ireland, and those from the Commonwealth countries of Cyprus and Malta. However, EU citizens are allowed to vote in local and European elections. On social media, many EU citizens expressed sadness that this year may be the last time they will be able to vote in the country in which they live. One, Anna Brostromer, said only a miracle could save her right to vote after 23 years in the country. Another EU citizen, in the country for 34 years, wrote that after Thursday’s elections he felt “devalued” and a “commodity” who just earns and pays taxes. “My foreign name will become a wall, my badge of difference, a reason for someone to say, ‘You have no right to be here’.” British citizens in Europe will also lose the right to vote in local elections and European elections and some, who have been out of the country for more than 15 years, will not be allowed to vote in British general elections either. • This article was amended on 9 May 2018 to make clear that citizens of the EU countries of Cyprus and Malta are allowed to vote in British national elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/18/tmz-royal-wedding-celebrity-gossip","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T13:15:47Z","webTitle":"TMZ: the celebrity gossip site that crashed the royal wedding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/18/tmz-royal-wedding-celebrity-gossip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/18/tmz-royal-wedding-celebrity-gossip","fields":{"headline":"TMZ: the celebrity gossip site that crashed the royal wedding","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"TMZ originally stood for Thirty-Mile Zone, a swath of Los Angeles covering the entertainment industry, but now the abbreviation means something else and is prompting howls 5,000 miles away in Buckingham Palace. TMZ.com took its name from the cartographic reference, but the news website is in the business of getting global clicks through scoops on celebrities, athletes, tycoons – and royalty. Its clout was on neon-flashing display this week with a series of exclusives about whether Meghan Markle’s father, Thomas Markle, would attend her marriage to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle on Saturday. The will-he-won’t-he saga (conclusion: he won’t) gripped readers, upended the British royal family’s choreographed preparations and sent other media outlets scrambling to follow up TMZ’s daily updates. The House of Windsor and the hounds of Fleet Street, humbled by an operation based at a former post office distribution centre with darkened windows in an unhip part of LA – how did that happen? The short answer: Harvey Levin. The lawyer turned TV journalist is TMZ’s founder and svengali, a driven force who oversees a legion of reporters, videographers and producers tasked with uncovering gossip, scandal and occasional agenda-setting journalistic coups. Sources seem to be everywhere – courthouses, hospitals, ambulances, airports, airport gift stores, hotels, motels, police stations, lawyers’ offices, elevators, beaches, limousines, nightclubs, streets outside nightclubs. And they often bear documents, photographs, audio recordings or videos. This surveillance apparatus has remade the rules of celebrity. Drip-drip revelations about Lindsay Lohan’s trial for theft in 2011 prompted one judge to compare TMZ to the CIA. The site is respected, imitated, feared and loathed – but never ignored. “Harvey has amazing contacts and they just keep plugging away,” said David Thompson, a former LA-based editor for OK! magazine who now runs a public relations firm, Cavalry PR. “They have the manpower. They’re not just about repeating gossip because they don’t stop until they get to the source of the story.” Fobbing off TMZ tends to not work, said Thompson. “With someone like TMZ you’re usually not helping the client if you’re a publicist and all you do is say no comment. It’s going to turn out better in the long run if you’re able to work with them.” That wasn’t an option for Buckingham Palace after it left Markle’s father, a retired lighting director, unprepared and ill-equipped to handle the paparazzi who staked out his home in Mexico. The 73-year-old cracked under the strain, collaborated in clumsily staged photos and suffered heart problems and emotional agony, putting in doubt whether he would walk his daughter down the aisle. TMZ swept in and got a scoop on each twist, turning TMZ into the Thomas Markle zigzag chronicles – essential reading for royal watchers and the palace’s hapless wedding planners. “We didn’t pay him anything, he didn’t ask for anything,” Levin said in one of the site’s daily syndicated TV shows. A reporter contacted Prince Harry’s future father-in-law and won his trust, simple as that, said Levin. TMZ’s founder is more circumspect with reporters. Contacted for this article, Levin referred the Guardian to a publicist who said no company representative was available for interview. Much of TMZ’s success has a simple explanation: boots on the ground. In an era of shrivelling newsrooms it stations teams in courthouses to scan dockets and deploys others across LA, chasing tips and rumours for celebrity news big and small. “TMZ are out there on the street with video cameras pouncing on B/C/D-list celebs,” said one former reporter for Mail Online’s LA office. Other outlets, in contrast, “mainly just write around sets of pics that come in from freelance photographers”. TMZ cultivates multiple sources – defence lawyers, prosecutors, court clerks, bellhops, chauffeurs, chambermaids, barmen, police, paramedics – and lubricates, when necessary, with cash. Levin, 67, founded the site in 2005 with a resolve to smash, as he saw it, a corrupt cocoon of fixers and enablers who hushed up celebrity crimes, follies and misdemeanors. Scoops flowed: Mel Gibson’s antisemitic rant, Michael Richards’s racist diatribe, Michael Jackson’s death (reported 18 minutes after he stopped breathing), Chris Brown beating up Rihanna, Prince’s death, Solange Knowles assaulting Jay-Z. A 24-hour ticker-tape of revelations that stoked anxiety in Hollywood. Rumours spread of a TMZ vault with salacious material withheld from publication as long as celebrities gave up other secrets. One bodyguard, speaking on condition of anonymity, assumed – not necessarily correctly – that TMZ was the main client for the paparazzi who stalk his client, a singer. “Whenever she’s ready to leave, they’re there.” Some celebrities and publicists have adapted by discreetly collaborating with TMZ, which sometimes sheathes the sword for fawning stories and flattering photos. Others wage a cold war and denounce Levin as Frankenstein, or worse. “He is a festering boil on the anus of American media,” Alec Baldwin told the New Yorker. Prince Harry may have had choice words in 2012 after TMZ published pictures of him partying naked in Las Vegas. Levin, a fitness fanatic who works out before dawn, takes special pride in consequential scoops, such as a video of US marines urinating on dead insurgents in Afghanistan or a bailed-out bank blowing millions on a party. Some stories fuel national debates, such as Kanye West declaring slavery to be a choice, or the NFL star Ray Rice knocking out his fiancee. Some TMZers, as staffers are known, describe a febrile atmosphere, gruelling hours and a tough culture in their Playa Vista headquarters, with Levin directing operations from a raised desk in the middle of the newsroom. “Make sure you have a thick skin and a tolerance for insanity,” advised one post on Glassdoor, a website which lets employees and ex-employees rate workplaces. “This is a one-man show, and all authority and decisions flow through him.” An absolute monarch presiding over a digital kingdom, Levin doesn’t need to show up at Windsor Castle.

Authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are rushing to contain an outbreak of Ebola that has reached the major city of Mbandaka, infecting dozens of people along the way. Several deaths have occurred so far in Bikoro, a rural area about 150km from the city. Local authorities and the World Health Organisation were hoping the remoteness would help contain the spread. Now, the WHO is considering whether to declare an international health emergency, which would ramp up foreign assistance. The biggest ever outbreak of Ebola killed 11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2014 to 2016. A yet-to-be-licensed vaccine proved effective during that epidemic, and thousands of doses are being sent to the DRC’s capital, Kinshasa. “We are entering a new phase of the Ebola outbreak that is now affecting three health zones, including an urban health zone,” said Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the DRC health minister. Peter Salama from the WHO said health workers had identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease. “We are now tracing more than 4,000 contacts of patients and they have spread out all over the region of north-west Congo, so they have to be followed up and the only way to reach them is motorcycles,” Salama said. * * * Peers all round – The prime minister is poised to appoint about 10 new members of the House of Lords in what is being seen partly as an attempt to end repeated defeats of her plans for Brexit. The senior Labour peer, Lord Adonis, said: “This is a classic example of packing the Lords to try and make Brexit easier to endorse.” Adonis has complained that Labour is legitimising the move by making three new peers of its own at the same time. Meanwhile in a round of meetings with EU leaders, the PM has struggled to rally support for her “backstop” plan on customs and the Irish border. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, said he had heard “new thinking from May” but warned: “I very much emphasised that resolving the issue of a hard border requires more than customs.” * * * ‘Total decimation’ – Donald Trump has muddied the waters further over North Korea by appearing to suggest its leader might share the grisly fate of Muammar Gaddafi if he doesn’t make a deal for denuclearisation. The president did add, though, that “if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy … He would be [still] running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said the North Koreans had continued “negotiating like nothing happened” despite an outburst from Pyongyang triggered by talk of a “Libya option” for dealing with the situation. Bill Gates, meanwhile has told how Donald Trump didn’t know the difference between the HIV and HPV viruses. “I was able to explain that those are rarely confused with each other.” The Microsoft founder suggested that at more than one meeting he was left unsettled by the president’s behaviour, including the “scary” level of detail in which he described his daughter’s looks. * * * ‘Withdrawn immediately’ – Ecuador is to remove the additional security surrounding Julian Assange at its London embassy where he is living under political asylum. “From now on, it will maintain normal security similar to that of other Ecuadorian embassies,” said a statement from the office of President Lenin Moreno. The WikiLeaks founder was taken in under the presidency of Rafael Correa, but his successor Moreno has described the situation as “a stone in his shoe”. Moreno’s move was announced a day after an investigation by the Guardian and Focus Ecuador revealed the country had bankrolled a spy operation costing at least £3.7m to protect and support Assange. * * * ‘Unusual and controversial day’ – Speaker John Bercow has been heard by MPs calling Andrea Leadsom a “stupid woman” during exchanges in the House of Commons. Leadsom, the leader of government business, was said to have not heard the comment at a session in which the Speaker chastised the Conservative frontbench for breaching conventions during opposition debates. Bercow has been the subject of claims of past bullying and intemperate behaviour, but supporters believe it is a campaign to damage him from within Conservative ranks. * * * Just to let you know – Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are getting married on Saturday at Windsor Castle. Here is our visual guide to the big day. The addition of a biracial member to the royal family is cause to celebrate, so what do the black community in her former Los Angeles neighbourhood think about it? “No biggie,” is the consensus among people interviewed by Rory Carroll. The question of whether Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, will be able to attend has been answered in the negative; and with the FA Cup on at the same time, Britain and its broadcasters are gearing up for the biggest TV day of the year. Before, during and no doubt for some time after the event, you will find everything else you need to know at our royal wedding page. * * * Gammon-gate – Been wondering about all the pork-based insults flying around? Stephen Poole explains the history of “gammon” – which in current usage has come to mean “a ruddy-faced, middle-aged Brexit proponent”, but since the 1600s has been used variously as a personal insult, or as the term for a thief’s accomplice, or simply to decry something as nonsense. (It’s also good with pineapple on top.) Lunchtime read: Door to EU stands ajar but not open While Britain is having a hard time disentangling itself from the European Union, Balkan states are having their own battle to get in. There is an urgency to guard against Russian influence by bringing the likes of Montenegro and Serbia closer to the EU fold – but it is being outweighed by reticence and “enlargement fatigue” among current member states, driven partly by the deteriorating state of democracy in several recent new members. “With Hungary, Poland and Croatia going the way they are going, there is no appetite to import new countries with the same issues,” one European diplomat working in the western Balkans tells Shaun Walker. “But if you stop the EU integration process it’s very hard to revive it, and there is a lot to lose if you push the countries towards China and Russia.” Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, said things became “very argumentative” at a lunch with EU leaders in Sofia, Bulgaria. He likened the EU’s vague commitments to the communist promise of a bright future that was always just around the corner. “We lived for 50 years with a red horizon which we never reached. We don’t want to live with a blue horizon now.” Sport “I haven’t emptied my desk and in a way I am still in shock.” In his first major interview since leaving Arsenal, Arsène Wenger discusses his future, not being consulted over his successor and whether Mikel Arteta has the qualities for the job. Eddie Jones expects Owen Farrell to rule through fear as captain in South Africa next month but believes the playmaker cannot repair the north-south divide within the England squad alone. Allyson Felix, the American sprinter who has the most medals in Olympic and world championship history, has told the Guardian she never wants to be satisfied with losing. Joe Root feels ready to make a success of England’s troublesome No 3 position after a year spent adjusting to the demands of being Test captain and premier batsman. Chelsea have become the first club to issue a payout to an alleged victim since the full extent of football’s sex abuse scandal was exposed but risk drawing criticism for not making the compensation deal public. And Britain’s Kyle Edmund was beaten in Rome by Alex Zverev but the match served as a thrilling insight into the future of tennis. Business Oil prices hovered around the $80 a barrel mark overnight after playing a big part in pushing the FTSE100 share index to a record closing high of 7,787.97 points on Thursday. Shares in BP and Shell soared as the commodity pushed through $80 in the trading session – its highest since November 2014. The multinationals have also been helped by the falling pound because they report their profits in US dollars. Sterling was flat overnight at $1.35 and €1.144. The papers There are pictures of Harry and Meghan on nearly every front page including our own with headlines about their “loving smile”, her engagement ring, her mum, her ailing dad, how they’re letting nothing spoil their big day, and on and on it goes. Unsurprisingly it gets especially big play in the likes of the Sun and the Mail – but there is other news happening too. Today’s i says: “Britain on collision course with US”, because the UK along with Europe is sticking to the Iran nuclear deal – in defiance of American sanction threats. The Times splashes with “Hundreds more troops planned for Afghanistan” as Donald Trump calls on allies including Britain for more support. As detailed above, the Guardian reports how Theresa May is struggling to find EU support for her post-Brexit “backstop” plan on customs and the Irish border. The FT’s version: “May concedes on tie to customs union until Irish border resolved”. Meanwhile in the Telegraph: “Ireland says UK must keep single market ties”. The Express splashes with former attorney general Dominic Grieve’s call for CCTV cameras in care homes to protect residents.

And, despite the paeans that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, paid to the strength of the ties between the two countries, those images highlighted a rot eating away at the US-Israel relationship. Even before the violence in Gaza and the embassy opening, on my trip to Israel last week, the duality of the US-Israel relationship was stark. As I stood in the Golan Heights on the border with Syria, it was easy to see the value of the partnership. Just one day earlier, the Iron Dome missile defense system (developed jointly by the US and Israel) had protected Israel from rockets fired from Iranian bases in Syria. Just a few days before, as I stood in an Israeli settlement in the Palestinian city of Hebron, it was difficult to understand how the United States can provide support for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) that protect Israelis committing illegal acts in taking Palestinian land – in some cases acts that are condemned even by Israeli courts. These two experiences were emblematic of two vastly different versions of the US-Israel relationship trying – and increasingly struggling – to coexist. One version of the US-Israel relationship is all sunshine and rainbows: deep political and military bonds between governments, extensive trade, special ties between peoples, and America’s backing for the historical justice of safeguarding a democratic homeland for the Jewish people. The other version of the relationship is one of deepening polarization in both countries: the rightwing Israeli government cozies up to US Republicans and pursues extreme policies, while American views of Israel are increasingly divided along partisan lines. Israel wants to be judged on its thriving democracy and economy, for which it deserves real credit. But one cannot ignore Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza where a combined almost 5 million Palestinians live. Government-supported settlements in the West Bank are expanding, slowly taking over Palestinian land in what appears to be a creeping annexation. In America, views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are more partisan than they’ve been since 1978, according to one study, which revealed that 79% of Republicans say their sympathies lie more with Israel than with the Palestinians, while only 27% of Democrats are more sympathetic to Israel. Another study revealed that, while a large majority of Democrats see Israel as a strategic asset, 55% of Democrats also see Israel as a strategic burden, and 60% of Democrats believe the United States should impose sanctions or take serious action in response to Israeli settlements. The political fight in the United States over the Iran nuclear deal illustrates the partisan divide. In 2015 there was a Democratic uproar when the Republicans invited the Israeli prime minister to speak to Congress in opposition to the Iran nuclear deal being pushed by a Democratic president. This growing link between Israeli and American rightwing parties was reinforced by Netanyahu’s recent presentation supposedly showing Iran’s previous nuclear ambitions, which was just days later referenced by Donald Trump as justification for violating the deal. The same goes for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump is backing Netanyahu’s government with hardly a critical word of Israeli activity towards the Palestinians. The embassy move is a case in point – it gains nothing for the United States, makes it impossible for the Palestinians to view this administration as a neutral mediator for peace talks, and stoked violence. Israel has genuine security concerns, and the second intifada left deep scars on the Israeli psyche. For Israelis who remember wondering each day if their children were going to be killed by a suicide bomber on the way to school, the occupation allows Israelis to keep the Palestinians out of sight and out of mind. This is no small part of the reason why rightwing parties promising security have run Israel for almost two decades now. But Israel cannot remain a democracy in the long run while continuing to rule millions of Palestinians who do not have any say in their governance. As I stood in the settlement in Hebron next to a young Israeli soldier guarding Israeli settlers, it was clear that while Israel is good at solving short-term problems – say, protecting Israeli settlers – it is not good at figuring out long-term solutions, like preventing Israel from becoming a perpetual occupier. As one Israeli journalist told me in response to a discussion of the myriad challenges facing Israel, “we’ll schlep through”. Surely, the US-Israel relationship will also schlep through – but what kind of relationship will it be? On my trip, I repeatedly heard the claim that fewer American Jews support Israel because they are moving away from Judaism, not because of Israeli policies towards Palestinians. As an American Jew who strongly supports Israel, but not necessarily Israel’s policies, this deeply offended me. Instead of criticizing American Jews for how they choose to live their personal lives, Israelis should recognize that, whatever the reason, falling support for Israel among a younger generation of American Jews will fracture the US-Israel relationship. Fueling the fire in America are radicals such as Sheldon Adelson, who funds the largest Israeli daily newspaper “Israel Today” to support a rightwing agenda, and who has offered to pay for the new US embassy in Jerusalem. The Trump administration chose Pastor Robert Jeffress as one of the speakers at the opening of the Jerusalem embassy – the same Jeffress who once said: “Mormonism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism – they lead people to an eternity of separation from God in hell.” There are no obvious perfect solutions. But if the United States and Israel don’t work together to confront longer-term trends, the relationship could become unrecognizable, with a hyper-partisan segment of America supporting an Israel that has lost much of its claim to democracy. And that would be devastating for both countries. Michael H Fuchs is a contributing opinion writer for the Guardian US.

The company has effectively been without an official CEO since Roger Ailes was ousted in 2016 amid sexual harassment allegations, although Rupert Murdoch had stepped in to run the channel during the interim. In their press release about the news, Lachlan Murdoch – recently announced as CEO and chairman of Fox, Fox News’s parent company – made much of Scott being the organisation’s first female CEO. However, many are concerned that Scott is a member of Fox’s old guard and her appointment is not a break from the toxic workplace culture that led to so many harassment and discrimination claims being made. Scott herself is mired in the many harassment claims. Staff were apparently aghast when she was promoted last year, as she had been the executive tasked with enforcing Ailes’s miniskirt dress code for women. One anonymous former staff member told the Daily Beast how Scott would enforce a “skimpy” dress code in coordination with the wardrobe and makeup departments. Scott is also cited in lawsuits brought by the former Fox News staffers Andrea Tantaros and Julie Roginsky, as one of the executives at the company who either did not respond to or covered up their complaints of harassment. According to Roginsky’s suit, Scott responded to host Gretchen Carlson’s sexual harassment claims against Roger Ailes by seeking to recruit on-air talent and contributors “to retaliate against Carlson by publicly disparaging her”. The suit says she “characterised this retaliatory onslaught as supporting ‘Team Roger’”. Through a Fox News spokesperson, Scott has previously denied enforcing a dress code or corralling support for Ailes. Scott had previously worked as an executive assistant to Chet Collier at CNBC, before moving with Collier to Fox News when he helped launch the station 22 years ago. She was promoted to president of programming last year after Bill Shine was ousted from the company amid multiple allegations that he had helped to cover up sexual harassment. Her appointment comes two days after Fox News paid about $10m in a settlement that they hope will resolve many of their outstanding racial and gender discrimination lawsuits. According to documents seen by the New York Times, the terms of the settlement included employees promising to drop their claims and leave the company, suggesting Fox News was keen to draw a line under the scandals before Scott’s appointment. Scott has not said much about the direction she is planning to take the channel, but she was influential in promoting Sean Hannity, the network’s star who has the ear of Donald Trump, to a 9pm slot. So it is likely her first job will be trying to keep the presenter on the channel, with rumours that rival organisation Sinclair is attempting to poach him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/17/culture-secretary-bookies-fobts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T09:33:08Z","webTitle":"Culture secretary deserves credit for cutting maximum FOBT stake to £2 | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/culture-secretary-bookies-fobts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/culture-secretary-bookies-fobts","fields":{"headline":"Culture secretary deserves credit for cutting maximum FOBT stake to £2","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was New Labour, during its brief and bizarre flirtation with “supercasinos” as a tool for urban regeneration, that gave the green light to fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) on the high street. The only generous interpretation is that ministers didn’t know what they doing when they set maximum stakes at £100 and spin speeds at 20 seconds. The main game on the machines is roulette, which even irregular casino-goers know is a properly nasty game. The addictive quality lies in the high 97% return rate to the player. Yet the house’s edge is mathematically certain and, over time, a player can only lose. From the operators’ point of view, it’s the perfect product. Allowing four roulette machines to be placed in every bookmaking shop was grossly naive. Yes, as far as possible, we must all be free to lose our money as we wish, but the fallout from problem gambling hits others, not least social services. FOBTs are not the only cause of problem gambling, of course, but the high rates of addiction to the machines are undeniable. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, deserves huge credit for facing down the bookmakers and opting to limit stakes to £2 on the grounds that FOBTs are “a social blight”. He still has to find a way to tackle the online problem but imposing a sense of moderation on the high street is a good place to start. Perhaps Hancock, as a horseracing man, could see what New Labour didn’t: that roulette isn’t real gambling, and inevitably involves gouging the vulnerable when offered in souped-up electronic form on the high street. As for the bookies, they consistently refused to acknowledge the difference between a casino game and a flutter on the 4.30 at Ripon. Maybe that is why their lobbying was so poor. It is certainly a reason why they deserved to lose this fight. Well done, Mr Hancock. Ocado finally grows up When the Ocado chief executive, Tim Steiner, said 15 months ago that “we expect to sign multiple deals in multiple territories in the medium term”, he provoked guffaws. He’d been making similar promises for three years and had nothing to show. Nobody’s laughing now. Ocado’s technology deal with Kroger in the US is as eye-catching as they come. Kroger has 8% of the world’s biggest grocery market – it is second only to Walmart in the US – and the idea is to open 20 distribution centres in three years. For context, Ocado, under its own steam and via a partnership with Morrisons, currently serves the UK from just three warehouses. The Kroger alliance follows deals with Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and ICA in Sweden – all big players on their home patches. The “multiple territories” boast has been met and the “medium term” promise exceeded. How did it happen so quickly? Ocado’s kit has clearly impressed a lot of people but the new factor may be the fear Amazon caused in boardrooms around the globe when it paid $13.7bn (£10.1bn) to buy Whole Foods Markets in the US last year. That takeover was a firm signal that Jeff Bezos, in between saving civilisation with his space projects, plans to colonise the grocery market on Earth. Ocado’s technology is now seen as anti-Amazon device for traditional supermarkets in distress. It’s not a bad marketing pitch. It is still hard to believe that ol’ Ocado, after the astonishing 44.4% pop in the share price, can be worth £5.3bn. Since outsiders don’t know the terms of the licensing deals, the valuation is taking an awful lot on trust. The sale of £183m-worth of new shares to Kroger, in exchange for a 5% stake, gives comfort that Ocado can handle the upfront capital costs, but the City’s long-term profit projections are basically guesswork. Still, Ocado is plainly now a serious grownup company, not the “charity” that Sir Terry Leahy used to call it when he was he was running Tesco a decade ago. Indeed, even if Ocado’s American adventure turns out not to fulfil the highest hopes, it can’t go as badly as Tesco’s expensive flop. Mothercare’s change of heart What’s got into the baby milk at Mothercare? Last month, a board chaired by Alan Parker ousted chief executive Mark Newton-Jones and appointed a new boss. A couple of weeks later Parker retired. Now Newton-Jones has been reappointed under the new chairman, Clive Whiley. Maybe the independent non-executive directors who oversaw the firing and rehiring of Newton-Jones can explain their thinking. Or do they just do whatever this week’s chairman tells them to do?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/19/lessons-in-love-and-violence-review-george-benjamin-royal-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"Lessons in Love and Violence review – a bolder, angrier, more tender George Benjamin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/19/lessons-in-love-and-violence-review-george-benjamin-royal-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/19/lessons-in-love-and-violence-review-george-benjamin-royal-opera","fields":{"headline":"Lessons in Love and Violence review – a bolder, angrier, more tender George Benjamin","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“Stop the music. I SAID STOP THE MUSIC NOW,” shouts the King in Lessons in Love and Violence, the latest collaboration between the composer George Benjamin and the playwright Martin Crimp, which has been given its world premiere by the Royal Opera, one of seven international companies to commission it. No weapon in music is more powerful than silence. Benjamin uses it, throughout this 90-minute work, with surgical skill. The command comes in the midst of controlled chaos in the third of the opera’s seven scenes. The King, the Plantagenet Edward II, is engaged in a desperate inquiry about love with his adored adviser, Gaveston. Isabel, the queen, played with chilling hauteur by the indefatigable soprano Barbara Hannigan, enters with royal offspring, ready to bait her unfaithful husband. With near-farcical timing, courtiers bustle in to watch an entertainment. Two women are singing David’s lament for the death of Jonathan, from the Old Testament. All takes place in the royal bedchamber. No wonder the King loses his cool. This sort of multilayered emotional pile-up is the stuff of opera. Public and private drama clash while different musical ideas play simultaneously. Think of the end of Act I of Tosca. Benjamin, not surprisingly, handles things entirely differently, reining in rather than spilling out, tightening harmony and counterpoint to breaking point. It’s a tense moment in a work that locks you in from its opening conflict – the King’s banishment of his political scourge, Mortimer. There is no let-up, no smile. It’s dark, callous. The Royal Opera had a formidable success with the first two Benjamin/Crimp operas, the chamber-sized Into the Little Hill (2006) and Written on Skin (first staged at Aix-en-Provence in 2012). This new piece, using the same production team led by director Katie Mitchell and designer Vicki Mortimer, returns to the distant past as its wellspring. Christopher Marlowe’s 1594 play Edward II, stripped of dramatic and verbal flesh, provides a skeletal blueprint for Crimp’s short but verbose and oddly elliptical text. If the words act as a straitjacket, Lessons in Love and Violence breaks free in Benjamin’s music, especially in the orchestral interludes between scenes, at times explosive, at others poetic, empathetic. It’s here that you find the warmth so absent in the text. Despite murder and blood, the violence is chiefly psychological. Mitchell’s use of slo-mo movement compounds the tableau effect. The “lessons” might also be called limits, in love, desire, transgression, political responsibility. Love itself is in short supply. Passions are icy, calculating or, in the case of the King towards Gaveston, abusive and wretched. In this modern-dress production, the King’s weakness is implied in the opening minutes when he changes his clothes in front of his court. “I am king,” he sings, impotent in his underpants. The fixed set, a box painted dark blue with a bed, some Bacon paintings and a large tank of shimmering, quivering tropical fish (Edward II kept a pet camel and a lion; who knew about fish?), is seen from different angles as the work progresses. This intensifies the claustrophobia. Eventually the tank is empty, leaving only a bare rock. Benjamin’s rich score, which he himself conducts, is more ambitious than Written on Skin: bolder, angrier, more self-revealing, more tender. The large orchestra, dominated by low clarinets, bassoons and trombones, is used sparingly but with big, noisy brass outbursts. Each scene has a different musical identity. The work may be dissonant, but major and minor chords harness the action. Characters are loosely associated with leitmotifs or particular instruments. Early on, Mortimer (Peter Hoare) has a menacing aural joust with the twanging cimbalom, prominently used throughout. Four percussion players create atmosphere with some 40 different varieties of gong, drum, bells, cymbals, castanets, güiros, temple blocks. The cast is outstanding: Hannigan alluring and manipulative; Stéphane Degout sympathetic and hapless as the King; Gyula Orendt overweening as the velvet-smooth Gaveston. Hoare’s Mortimer is sniping, self-righteous. Samuel Boden is firm yet delicate as the Boy/Young King. To witness a newborn opera is to meet a creation that alters with each encounter. I went on first and second nights (both of which were enthusiastically received). Passages that had seemed slow moved fast. Details in the score came into focus. The text remains unyielding yet already the music, or I, had changed. Let’s watch it grow. • Lessons in Love and Violence is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London, until 26 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/27/bullshit-jobs-a-theory-david-graeber-review-laboured-rant","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"Bullshit Jobs: A Theory review – laboured rant about the world of work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/27/bullshit-jobs-a-theory-david-graeber-review-laboured-rant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/27/bullshit-jobs-a-theory-david-graeber-review-laboured-rant","fields":{"headline":"Bullshit Jobs: A Theory review – laboured rant about the world of work","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Five years ago, the LSE anthropologist David Graeber wrote an essay for a radical magazine called Strike!. Its title was On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs. It argued that by now we should, as the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted in 1930, be living in a world of a 15-hour working week. Technology was sufficiently advanced that most of the labour of Keynes’s day could be done by machines and the rest could be distributed across a large workforce, leaving greatly increased leisure time for all of us. As you may have noticed, that isn’t how things have turned out. Instead, the working week remains stuck around the 40-hour mark and computer technology now means that work often extends into our free time. Why are we still filing into offices in our millions and checking emails around the clock, when we could be reading Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire or watching Homes Under the Hammer? The answer, claimed Graeber, is that a great many jobs in the managerial, clerical, sales and service sectors are not real jobs with genuine utility, but, rather, ones whose purpose is unclear to almost everyone, including those doing them. These jobs Graeber termed “bullshit jobs”. In the tradition of internet sensations, Graeber’s essay went viral. The Strike! site crashed under the weight of interest and within weeks, the author tells us, the essay was translated into at least a dozen languages and reprinted around the world. Clearly Graeber had hit a nerve. And indeed, in a YouGov poll commissioned after the essay’s publication, 37% of British respondents believed that their job did not “make a meaningful contribution to the world”. From this, another poll conducted in Holland with similar findings, and his own social-media-based research, Graeber establishes a statistical basis on which to build his new book, Bullshit Jobs: A Theory. Taking this data into account, Graeber suggests that around two-fifths of jobs in the developed world are of the bullshit variety, not including those done by workers – for example office cleaners – that service the bullshit jobs. As the phrase “meaningful contribution to the world” attests, we are in the realm of definitional blurriness. Who gets up each morning believing that they’re about to make a meaningful contribution to the world? I’ve met doctors who question their purpose. And certainly, if we doubt our own contribution, it’s even easier to dismiss the role of others. As Graeber acknowledged in the original essay, there isn’t anything “necessary” about the job of anthropology professor – “a lot of tabloid readers would take the existence of my job as the very definition of wasteful social expenditure”, he wrote. That use of “tabloid readers” is revealing of a slightly condescending attitude that Graeber can’t quite suppress. Although his sympathies are with blue-collar workers, who often have “shit jobs” (and, of course, may well read tabloid newspapers), he is often contemptuous of white-collar workers with their “bullshit jobs”. These are people, we learn, who fill their empty lives with “consumer toys” and are probably an “exasperating little man in a suit”. To get round this type of subjective social observation, and ground his theory in something more concrete, Graeber relies on self-definition. If someone believes their job to be worthless, it probably is worthless. It may not be the most empirical approach, but it’s a working method. In his well-received 2011 book, Debt: The First 5,000 Years, Graeber made a strong case that debt was less understood as an economic phenomenon that maintained inequalities of wealth than as a moral principle involving sin and guilt. Indeed, in German debt and guilt are the same word: schuld. The same insight informs Graeber’s theory of bullshit jobs. One of the reasons they proliferate, he argues, is because as a society we see work as an end in itself, regardless of whether it produces anything of worth. I think this is true and it’s a reality that demands much more critical attention. As things stand, as Graeber writes, “‘More jobs’ is the one political slogan both the left and right can always agree on”. With its snarky tone and laboured arguments, I’m not sure this is the book to ignite a larger debate. Despite its length, it doesn’t develop a theory that’s notably more sophisticated than the Strike! essay. Too much time is spent on nailing down flip typologies. According to Graeber, there are five different kinds of bullshit job, which he labels: flunkies, goons, duct-tapers, box-tickers and taskmasters. On closer inspection, they seem like arbitrary distinctions that add little to our understanding. But Graeber is clearly right when he notes that as individuals we crave something more than social acceptance – we also hanker after meaning. He is at his most interesting when he grapples with that age-old economic problem of “value”, the idea related to skilled labour that many of us continue to think of as inherently meaningful. He describes a postmodern world in which those whose jobs are most vague and divorced from a discernible end product are often the best remunerated, with alienated workers pushing around consultation papers and sending off unread emails, and all secretly possessed of the demoralising knowledge that if they and their colleagues ceased to exist, the rest of the world wouldn’t bat an eyelid or be inconvenienced for a moment. We can all think of offices thick with middle managers overseeing doomed initiatives, the kind of scenario lampooned by W1A. But while inefficiencies are an inevitable aspect of complex working environments, it’s still a big leap to imagine that if 40% of jobs were stripped away, the rest would remain, untouched and ready to be shared around. As the world grows increasingly automated, the question of what to do with the surplus workforce is one that is going to grow ever more pertinent. Graeber believes that our governments remain complacent because it suits them, for reasons of social control, to see people occupied in full-time employment. But all of us will have to reconsider the meaning of work. Graeber, at least to his own satisfaction, has identified the characteristics of pointless jobs. Whether they really are pointless and how society will organise itself without them are questions that require further investigation. • Bullshit Jobs: A Theory by David Graeber is published by Allen Lane (£20).

The review of building regulations undertaken and just published by Dame Judith Hackitt as part of the response to that tragedy, was conducted in the shadow of a 24-storey tomb. Survivors, relatives and friends, the surrounding community who must still face the charred ruins every day, all have the right to expect a clear and unambiguous commitment to action to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. Everyone now living in a high-rise or complex building has a right to know that their future safety will be protected, and how. I suspect most residents in high-rise buildings would be astonished to know how weak the regulatory framework that they rely on for their day-to-day protection is, as the review makes abundantly clear. This is even more the case, given the lessons that should already have been learned from the fatal fire in Lakanal House, Southwark, in south-east London, in 2009. We may still be some way away from knowing precisely what caused the Grenfell fire to spread so quickly and with such devastating consequences – we must await the findings of the official inquiry for that – but we already knew from Lakanal that the system of building regulation was not fit for purpose. Yet no action was taken post-Lakanal, and fears of further delays in order to undertake yet more consultation and implement what will inevitably be a complex and prolonged legislative process are entirely justified. If some people are worried about the extensive representation of the building industry on the Hackitt review working groups, that is understandable as well. Its expert contribution is important, but the industry is part of the problem too, and there must not be any suspicion that its interests outweigh those of the residents of the buildings it constructs. The Hackitt review, like the interim review before it, published last December, provides a powerful critique of the regulatory framework and the practices that were widespread throughout the building industry. Don’t take my word for it. Read the report and I challenge you not to be struck by the frequently damning nature of its findings. In her introduction, Hackitt identifies the key issues of “ignorance. Indifference. Lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities” and “Inadequate regulatory oversight and enforcement”, saying that: “These issues have helped create … a cultural issue which can be described as a ‘race to the bottom’.” Much that is set out in the details of the report makes complete sense – not least the fact that we need “systemic change” not just a “shopping list” of individual actions. Yet some of the Hackitt proposals significantly underestimate the complexity of the task ahead, in the real world of buildings with many different types of lease and tenancy. Grenfell Tower was not unusual in comprising not just council flats, but others bought under right to buy, some then privately rented out, along with housing association flats used as temporary accommodation, and so on. Any measures to improve the physical infrastructure in relation to fire safety, or to alter the legal responsibilities of residents, are fraught with complications, and no one is well served by a over-simplified view of the challenges. Although ultimately the report is a strong critique of the problems, the real concern about it, and the government’s response to it, is less to do with what it contains than what it leaves out. The report’s failure to come down firmly on the side of banning the use of combustible materials is bitterly disappointing. Confusingly, and despite not having made such an unambiguous recommendation in the report, Hackitt immediately indicated that, should the government proceed to such a ban, she would support it. Recognising the impossibility of this unfolding situation, the local government secretary James Brokenshire subsequently confirmed that there will indeed now be a consultation on a complete ban. This is welcome – but more welcome still would have been to just go ahead and ban these materials. All this is even more worrying given that it has been precisely such a lack of clarity around responsibility and accountability that has bedevilled building regulations for many years. Of course a ban on the use of combustible materials is insufficient. Of course we also need a change of culture, revised and tougher guidance on the entire system of building and fire safety, progress on the retrofitting of sprinklers and much else. The point is, none of these things are mutually exclusive. The government can ban the use of combustible materials on buildings and still have more than enough to do across a wide-ranging safety agenda. This week, and just a month before the Grenfell anniversary, the government made a late but welcome commitment to fund the removal of dangerous cladding from social housing blocks. Now ministers must take another decisive step. Ban the use of combustible materials and let that important step be just the start of a fundamental and lasting change to building safety. • Karen Buck is Labour MP for Westminster North"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/robot-waiters-beef-dresses-and-hello-kitty-soup-dining-at-spice-world-hotpot","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T02:07:34Z","webTitle":"Robot waiters, beef dresses and Hello Kitty soup: dining at Spice World hotpot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/robot-waiters-beef-dresses-and-hello-kitty-soup-dining-at-spice-world-hotpot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/robot-waiters-beef-dresses-and-hello-kitty-soup-dining-at-spice-world-hotpot","fields":{"headline":"Robot waiters, beef dresses and Hello Kitty soup: dining at Spice World hotpot","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you choose to eat at Spice World hotpot restaurant in Haymarket, the most important thing is not to go up one level too far on the plaza escalator and walk into the upstairs massage parlour by mistake. The confused security guard holding a list of women’s names will usher you through the sealed glass door into a suspiciously lavish reception area, only to mutter into his earpiece and summon a superior who will politely but firmly tell you to leave. Spice World’s Sydney restaurant, which opened in February, is one of more than 600 the Sichuan hotpot chain has opened worldwide since launching in 2003. Gimmicky, Instagram-friendly servings such as metre-long lamb, yin-yang soup and winter melon bowls have contributed to the restaurant’s success and attracted diners to try the south-west Chinese cuisine. •Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Besides the success of the Spice World brand, Sichuan hotpot in general has become something of a global phenomenon thanks to high-profile devotees such as David Beckham and Orlando Bloom. Former British prime minister David Cameron visited the original Spice World in Chengdu during an official visit in 2013, prompting the chain to rename one of its dishes the “Prime Minister’s meatballs”. When you do enter the restaurant, you will be greeted by a pair of robot waiters that are much friendlier than the men upstairs. Their duties are restricted to bearing trays of Mentos mints and small cans of sesame oil, suggesting they are a way off from gaining sentience and going on a Westworld-style rampage. A human waiter will usher you to your seat, bring you a large pot filled with soup base and fire up the hotplate embedded in the table. If you have ordered a communal pot, the stock cube will be in the shape of Hello Kitty, or another animal of your choice. As the soup heats up, Hello Kitty will gradually lose form and sink beneath the surface, her button eyes telling you something unnameable. If it is your first time at Spice World, you will likely order the wagyu-dressed Barbie. She will arrive pageant-ready, swaddled in a beef gown. Someone will make a Lady Gaga joke. You will silently, profusely apologise to Barbie as you peel strips of raw meat off her swimsuited body with your chopsticks. Her smile will offer no forgiveness. You will wonder how they wash the Barbies, but won’t know how to ask. You will be encouraged to create your own custom dipping sauce from a row of 23 different sauces, oils, chilli powders and chopped vegetables. If you were raised in the Anglo-Australian cooking tradition, the helpful and easy-to-follow mixing guides will not overcome the ignorance instilled by your upbringing of sweet and sour pork and Mongolian lamb. You will make a mess. In your eagerness to eat, you will drop meat, vegetables and noodles pell-mell into the soup, only to realise fishing them out is far more difficult than putting them in. A waiter will direct your attention to the large metal spoon clearly designed for this purpose. The food will cook in the soup, a rich mixture of Sichuan peppers, dried chillies, fennel and the radioactive orange sodium Hello Kitty has dissolved into. If you are eating with someone who has a more discerning palate than yours, they will correctly point out that the flavours of the individual dishes, excellent as they are, have been overwhelmed by the soup base. Determining what exactly you are eating ‒ strips of beef, mashed prawns, sweet potato ‒ will become more a matter of texture than of taste. Thankfully, the soup base will be delicious, so everything tasting of it won’t be a problem. It will thoroughly clear your sinuses and, depending on your heat tolerance and skin tone, turn you bright red under Spice World’s unforgiving lantern lights. When you pay the bill, you will be handed several tokens and directed to an arcade-style play area. The arcade machines boast more than 250 separate games, of which you will have only heard of Street Fighter. You will select Street Fighter. Your initial resolve not to waste tokens in the claw machine will waver when you notice a Captain America plush toy with what appears to be a small white penis poking through the front of its blue pants. The penis has little black eyes, like those of a shark. You will use the remainder of your tokens trying to retrieve Captain America so you can confirm what you think you have seen. You will not succeed. As you leave, you will be encouraged to use a steamer by the door that claims to remove the smell of hotpot from your hair and clothing. Do not be fooled. The hotpot smell has burrowed deep into your epidermis, and will not be dislodged for several days. Shower before you go to bed, or you will awaken in a fine coating of Hello Kitty particulate dust. In this way and others, eating at Spice World will stay with you for some time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/18/australia-is-obsessed-with-opinion-polls-why-do-we-take-them-so-seriously","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T06:23:26Z","webTitle":"Australia is obsessed with opinion polls.

Why do we take them so seriously?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The only thing more dispiriting than opinion polls may be writing about how dispiriting, even corrupting, they are to our politics, but let’s give it a go. Monday morning was a heart-sinking moment. Two front pages of daily newspapers, two opinion polls, multiple earnest columns interpreting what these single surveys of less than 2,000 people might mean. The Australian, with its Newspoll, trumpeted: “Turnbull rating soars as voters back tax cuts.” In Fairfax papers, an Ipsos poll came to the opposite conclusion: “Coalition on slide despite tax cuts”. So the federal budget was received well, or it was received badly, or perhaps people were having a lend when questioned by a human on the telephone, or by a computer-generated “robopoll”. The Newspoll “builds momentum for the government,” said the Australian, while Fairfax’s findings “dash Coalition hopes” for a budget bounce. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The two-party preferred vote – the trend that matters – saw no change in the latest Newspoll from the previous one – 51 to Labor, 49 for the Coalition. Over at Ipsos, there was a jump for Labor by two points in a month, to 54-46, a thumping lead. There are no doubt reasons for the discrepancies, with psephologist William Bowe pointing out that how pollsters ask about preferences can influence the result. But that can’t account for all of it. Opinion polls close to election day have a good record for accuracy in Australia, mostly due to compulsory voting. But between elections, they are at best a rough-as-guts snapshot of how a government or opposition is tracking over time, or how grumpy people are, or whether a particular policy has public support – the approval of same-sex marriage was so high in every opinion poll that there was no arguing with it. There are too many examples of mid-tier slumps meaning little when it comes to election day to take our regular polls too seriously. But we do take them too seriously. So seriously that there is an argument that the mainstream arch of Australian political coverage is dictated by opinion polls, a shorthand for the politics of politics, who’s up, who’s down, how something will “play”, the breathless interpretation of each one. You can blame politicians. You can blame journalists. You can blame the frenzied information age. You can despair at the erosion of civic trust and faith in institutions. All of us involved in the dance know in our hearts it is hopeless, but our resolutions to do better are short-lived. There are many exceptions, those who look beyond polls to the substance of an issue and try to put their oar in, but the noise, the current of our politics, is about polls. The dominant mainstream political story, at least since Kevin Rudd’s demise at the hands of Julia Gillard in 2010, has been about leadership – rumblings, speculation, scheming – and the reason is the heavy weight of opinion polls, deadly to a less cynical view of politics and policy. We do not need reminding that our prime ministers are disposable. We do not need the former New York Times’ Australian correspondent, Nick Bryant, to tell us that our politicians and journalists are uniquely obsessed with opinion polls. Polls dictate the day’s political “story”, prompt instant analysis, and give context for the coverage of issues. The endless reporting of whether Turnbull will survive as leader goes back to his foolish, and telling, declaration that one reason he toppled Tony Abbott in 2015 was because the government had “lost 30 Newspolls in a row”. He sowed, so he reaped. “Dumping a leader is being discussed again as Malcolm Turnbull crashes into his own Newspoll benchmark”, wrote the ABC’s Louise Yaxley last month. Fairfax’s Peter Hartcher concluded that while nothing would happen on the 30-poll anniversary, it would “signal open season on Turnbull”. “Quietly, the Liberals’ expectation now is that Turnbull will not be leading them to the next election”. There was even a Twitter hashtag #LibSpill amid false rumours of an imminent leadership challenge. Each poll is over-interpreted, especially at the Australian, which again this week proclaimed that Turnbull had “strengthened his position as the preferred prime minister” compared with Labor leader Bill Shorten. But preferred prime minister is an unreliable indicator of election outcomes. Polling analyst Kevin Bonham calls it “a bugbear of Australian poll commentary, which would probably be more informed if such questions did not exist.” Each poll is groundhog day. After last year’s budget, the Australian’s Dennis Shanahan declared that everyone was eager for the following week’s Newspoll, “because it will determine the future of Turnbull and (Scott) Morrison, the outcome and timing of the next election, as well as the tenure of Shorten as Labor leader.” Really? According to Ipsos, Labor has a big lead. But according to Newspoll, the 51-49 split may be 32 losses in a row, but that’s good news for the government, because it’s the second poll where the result is this tight (although one point up or down is well within the margin of error). So there has to be another story. What could it be? Of course – Shorten’s leadership! Shorten has headaches, the bungling of his MP’s dual citizen status among them. His leadership was questioned before the Batman byelection in March, but Labor won that. But what about these polls! The Australian’s commentator, Peter Van Onselen, was quick to see the angle. A close Newspoll after months of consecutive fails “just might see Labor turn on its leader and descend into internal divisions of its own”. How exciting! But who wins here? Are voters interested in this? Our love affair with opinion polls is only one reason our politics is so dispiriting, but it’s a crucial one. What’s sad is that we know it, but find it impossible to rise above. So, as meaningless as it is, I predict that if the polls dip, Shorten is gone before Christmas. If polling stays bad for the government, Turnbull’s history. If polls change, I’ll change my mind, so you’ll never prove me wrong. • Gay Alcorn is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/19/indonesia-blasts-surabaya-family-from-good-neighbours-suicide-bombers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T05:29:55Z","webTitle":"The bombers next door: how an Indonesian family turned into suicide attackers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/19/indonesia-blasts-surabaya-family-from-good-neighbours-suicide-bombers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/19/indonesia-blasts-surabaya-family-from-good-neighbours-suicide-bombers","fields":{"headline":"The bombers next door: how an Indonesian family turned into suicide attackers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was through food that the family of the Indonesian church bombers demonstrated neighbourly affection. Over the years, plates of fried bananas or steamed packages of rice stuffed with vegetables and chicken, were exchanged countless times over the fence. From their gardens in the Javan city of Surabaya, handfuls of moringa leaves or a few starfruit were passed over. The afternoon before 42-year-old Puji strapped on a bomb-laden belt and walked toward the Indonesia Christian church in the city, she was again in the kitchen. Wery Tri Kusuma and his wife last saw their next-door neighbour buying vegetables just hours before she blew herself up. “My wife asked her what she was cooking,” recalls Wery, “‘Nothing special,’ she replied, ‘Just something for the kids.’” It is these seemingly mundane moments that Wery has played over in his head since the news emerged that Puji and her husband, Dita Oepriarto,were terrorists who were willing to use their own children as suicide bombers. How could she do this to her children? On Sunday morning last week the couple and their four children carried out three attacks on churches in the city of Surabaya, in the worst terrorist strike Indonesia has seen in more than a decade. After dropping off his wife and two daughters – Fadhila, 12, and Pamela Rizkita, nine – at the Indonesia Christian church, Dita drove a car bomb into the Central Pentecostal church, sending it up in flames. At the same time their two sons, Yusuf, 18, and Firman, 16, laden with explosives, rode a motorbike into their target, the Santa Maria Catholic church. The attacks, carried out over half an hour, killed 18 people, including the bombers. Residents of the middle-class Wisma Asri housing complex are struggling to reconcile the facts. “I knew them every day for years. Puji was a nurse but she quit her job at the hospital because she felt nauseous at the sight of blood, and didn’t like seeing people in pain. So how can it be that she did this to her children?” asks Wery. To his neighbours, Dita and his wife appeared normal. They were friendly and polite, reserved but involved in neighbourhood affairs. “Everyone was surprised,” says neighbour Annie Dhani, “They were so far from the profiles of what you would think a terrorist would be.” In the afternoon their children would ride their bikes up the street, the youngest daughter would play on the swing. Their father wore unremarkable clothes, jeans and T-shirts, nothing overtly Islamic, and ran a small business selling almond, sesame and caraway oil. Nurul Ihsan, a tailor in Dita’s old neighbourhood of Tembok Dukuh, remembers the bomber as pious but not radical. He does recall one telling detail though: when Dita held events no Christians or Hindus were ever invited. Birth of a new tactic The church bombings were the first in a wave of extremist violence that has wracked Indonesia this week, and marks a new jihadist phenomenon – whole families, including young children, working together to carry out suicide bombings. It is the first time a suicide bombing has been carried out by an entire family in Indonesia, and this week it happened twice, in the space of about 24 hours. After the church strikes, a family of five, Tri Murtiono and his wife, Tri Ernawati, and their three children rode two motorbikes into the Surabaya police headquarters where they detonated explosives. Everyone died except their daughter Ais, aged eight, who was seated between her parents but wasn’t wearing a bomb herself in the attack on Monday. Hours before, on Sunday evening, another bomb appears to have exploded prematurely in the Wonocolo apartments in Sidoarjo, in the home of Anton Febrianto, his wife Puspitasari and their children. In this case both parents and their 17-year-old daughter died. Three other children survived. Police believe the three families were members of the pro-Isis Indonesian militant group Jamaah Anshurat Daulah (JAD) and met every Sunday for an Islamic study group where they watched extremist footage from Syria and Iraq that glorified violent jihad and martyrdom. According to police, several children were homeschooled to limit their outside exposure. The group was also influenced by the radical ideology of Kholid Abu Bakar, a former member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah, now with JAD, who police say mentored Dita and who remains at large. None of the three families went to Syria but Bakar attempted to go early last year, although he was deported from Turkey en route. The direct involvement of women and children in the Surabaya suicide bombings comes as a “natural development” in Indonesia’s terrorism landscape, says Nava Nuraniyah an analyst from the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC). “It is shocking, yes, because it is the first time, but if you think about it we have had women suicide bombers and we’ve had children fighters in Syria, so now it is all those things combined.” In December 2016, an Indonesian woman planned to blow herself up at the presidential palace but was arrested a day before. A few months earlier, a convicted terrorist allowed his 12-year-old son Hatf to go to Syria with relatives. He died in combat alongside a French Isis unit, after which his father penned this eulogy: “Farewell, my little mujahid, Daddy and Mummy are proud of you.” The ‘disease’ of terrorism Former terrorist Ali Fauzi says the the children involved in the Surabaya attacks were probably indoctrinated over time. “There would be a process of shaping those attitudes over time. It’s what I would call early radicalisation,” says the brother of the Bali bombers. “I am 100% sure the family agreed on what they did, that there was no coercion or lying. The motive would not be worldly but ideological, that they were all in it together for the sake of paradise.” The reformed terrorist likens religious radicalisation to a “disease”. “I used to have it too,” he says, over a plate of biryani, “When I saw someone like you, a white woman, I would think: should I aim for the head or the chest?” Authorities believe JAD was behind the deadly attacks this week but is unclear who directed them. Some experts believe there could be a direct link to Isis while others say their actions were triggered by an extraordinary prison siege this month. On 8 May more than 150 prisoners detained on terrorism charges rioted and seized control of three prison blocks in the maximum security Mako Brimob jail in West Java. Five police hostages were killed in the 40-hour standoff while a sixth officer was released alive. Social media lit up with celebratory messages and calls for more attacks in the wake of the riot. Pictures later showing cuffed inmates being fed by police have also enraged extremists, who are said to want revenge. In Tembok Dukuh village where he grew up, Dita’s old neighbours are still coming to terms with what happened. One of the churches that was bombed is less than two kilometres away. “Maybe he picked those churches because he knew them well,” says Karyono, a retired teacher who has known Dita and his family for more than 40 years. When Karyono saw Dita’s face flash on TV on Sunday night he ran directly to the family home. They were a mess of tears. But after a devastating few days there was a moment of deep altruism he says, when the village leader, a Christian man called Eric, accompanied the church bomber’s parents to the police station to see about releasing the remains. Karyono’s eyes well up as he speaks: “It broke my heart that after everything that’s happened, he was still willing to help.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/17/england-joe-root-no3-jos-buttler-pakistan","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T20:59:40Z","webTitle":"Joe Root ready for ‘more responsibility’ with return to England No 3 spot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/17/england-joe-root-no3-jos-buttler-pakistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/17/england-joe-root-no3-jos-buttler-pakistan","fields":{"headline":"Joe Root ready for ‘more responsibility’ with return to England No 3 spot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Joe Root feels ready to make a success of England’s troublesome No 3 position after a year spent adjusting to the demands of being both Test captain and premier batsman. Trevor Bayliss has long argued for it to be the Yorkshireman’s ideal berth but while the England coach had his way for the bulk of 2016 – a career-best 254 against Pakistan resulted – Root’s replacing of Alastair Cook as captain last year prompted a move back down to No 4. After a chastening winter that brought series defeats to Australia and New Zealand, and with Ed Smith bringing fresh ideas as the new national selector, Root returns to first drop in place of James Vince as part of revamped batting order to face Pakistan at Lord’s next Thursday. “It’s an opportunity for me to take on a bit more responsibility,” Root said. “I’ve had a year in the captaincy now and I feel I’ve gained enough experience to feel comfortable doing that. “For me it was getting used to the captaincy and making sure I could separate the two; that my full focus was on my batting when it came around. Ultimately nothing will change the way I go about my batting. I will look to have that hunger and desire to make really big runs.” Smith stressed it was Root who pushed for the promotion, with the reshuffle chiefly about getting Jonny Bairstow up to No 5 while still retaining the gloves. Jos Buttler, fresh from a marauding time in the Indian Premier League slots in as a specialist batsman at No 7 some eight months since his last first-class outing for Lancashire. Root, speaking at the launch of England’s latest New Balance kit, said: “It is really important Jos does not put too much pressure on himself. It is about expressing himself and finding consistency. It is exciting but it might take a bit of time to come right. If he bats for any period of time, especially the way he’s played recently, it’s going to be very exciting.” The second of the two-match series with Pakistan will coincide with Virat Kohli’s arrival for a month-long spell at Surrey. It includes three championship matches against the red Dukes ball for the India captain before his side take on England over five Tests. Root’s verdict? “He’s got to play against Yorkshire at Scarborough so that might get him out of nick. Steve Patterson might nibble him out a couple of times.” In the Royal London Cup, Tom Westley gave a reminder of his ability to the England selectors in Essex’s six-wicket win over Middlesex at Radlett. Westley, who won five Test caps last summer before being omitted for the winter tours, hit 134 and shared a second-wicket partnership of 153 with Varun Chopra as last year’s semi-finalists won with 7.2 overs to spare. Sussex were also comfortable Group B winners with a seven-wicket victory over Kent at Hove. Luke Wells produced a man-of-the-match show as his leg spin helped dismiss Kent for 188, opener Daniel Bell-Drummond the last out for 90 from 115 balls. Wells took two for 30 and then anchored Sussex’s response with 62 from 89 balls. Derbyshire proved too strong for Group A rivals Warwickshire with a 57-run victory at Edgbaston. Captain Billy Godleman hit a career-best 137 from 116 balls as Derbyshire hit 357 for eight. Sam Hain struck a classy 108 in response - his sixth list A century in only 30 games - but he received little support other than an unbeaten 48 from Keith Barker. Leicestershire eased home by 72 runs at Northamptonshire after Paul Horton’s 103 in 126 balls guided them to a challenging 265 for seven. Northants have been badly short of runs so far this season and Gavin Griffiths (4-30) and Ben Raine (3-31) did the damage as the home side slumped to 124 for eight. Only late resistance from Graeme White and Brett Hutton, sharing 64 for the ninth wicket, avoided a complete humiliation before the hosts were dismissed for 193 in 38.2 overs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/17/north-korea-trump-latest-warning-kim-jong-un-gaddafi","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T06:01:17Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump's threat to Kim Jong-un: make a deal or suffer same fate as Gaddafi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/17/north-korea-trump-latest-warning-kim-jong-un-gaddafi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/17/north-korea-trump-latest-warning-kim-jong-un-gaddafi","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's threat to Kim Jong-un: make a deal or suffer same fate as Gaddafi","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump has threatened Kim Jong-un with the same fate as Muammar Gaddafi if the North Korean leader “doesn’t make a deal” on his nuclear weapons programme. The US president issued the threat at the White House when he was asked about the recent suggestion by his national security adviser, John Bolton, that the “Libyan model” be a template for dealing with North Korea at a summit between Trump and Kim planned for 12 June in Singapore. The model Bolton was referring to was Gaddafi’s agreement in December 2003 to surrender his embryonic nuclear weapons programme, which included allowing his uranium centrifuges to be shipped out to the US. But Trump appeared to be unaware of that agreement, and interpreted the “Libyan model” to mean the 2011 Nato intervention in Libya in support of an insurrection, which ultimately led to Gaddafi’s murder at the hands of rebels in Tripoli. “The model, if you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation. We went in there to beat him. Now that model would take place if we don’t make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy,” Trump said, suggesting that the regime’s survival could be assured if Kim agreed to disarm. “This with Kim Jong-un would be something where he would be there. He would be running his country. His country would be very rich,” the president said. “We’re willing to do a lot, and he’s willing … to do a lot also, and I think we’ll actually have a good relationship, assuming we have the meeting and assuming something comes of it. And he’ll get protections that will be very strong.” Asked whether his comments meant that he disagreed with his national security adviser, the third of his administration, the president said: “I think when John Bolton made that statement, he was talking about if we are going to be having a problem, because we cannot let that country have nukes. We just can’t do it.” Joel Wit, a former US negotiator who is now a senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said: “This is probably the wrong time to be making threats, three weeks before the summit.” The inflammatory comments come at a time when the June meeting is in doubt. The regime in Pyongyang reacted strongly against statements by Bolton over the weekend, who insisted North Korea would have to dismantle its nuclear arsenal completely and immediately. A senior official said on Wednesday that Kim would not take part in a summit with such “one-sided” goals. Pyongyang has also complained about joint military exercises being conducted by US and South Korean forces. The regime’s mission to the United Nations issued a statement on Thursday claiming that nuclear-capable B-52 bombers and F-22 fighter planes were taking part in the exercises. He described it as “an extremely provocative and ill-boding act”. However, Trump said that despite Pyongyang’s threats to call off the summit, “they’ve been negotiating like nothing happened”. The state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said: “We are continuing to push ahead and plan our preparations. Those continue at this time for a meeting between the president and Kim Jong-un in June.” At a meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday, a senior state department official suggested that a substantial but partial disarmament by North Korea might be acceptable as the first stage of a deal with North Korea. Speaking to a meeting of business executives in Tokyo organised by the Wall Street Journal, Susan Thornton, the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, said that in Kim’s conversations with South Korean officials, he had said “there will be a big downpayment, a big up-front demonstration of his intention” to dismantle the North Korean nuclear weapons programme completely. “The question is: what could be front-loaded in a process that’s inevitably going to go on for some time? And then what would be acceptable to the North Korean side in return for that front-loading?” Thornton said. It was unclear whether Thornton’s remarks had been coordinated with Bolton, who has suggested that North Korea would have to dismantle its nuclear weapons completely before receiving any benefits. Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America thinktank who has played a lead role in back-channel talks with North Korea, said: “Given the high degree of distrust between Pyongyang and Washington, anything short of a phased approach with confidence measures built in along the way is pure fantasy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/17/93-year-old-golfer-hole-in-one-ben-bender","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T19:16:31Z","webTitle":"Golfer hits first-ever hole-in-one at age of 93 then retires from game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/17/93-year-old-golfer-hole-in-one-ben-bender","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/17/93-year-old-golfer-hole-in-one-ben-bender","fields":{"headline":"Golfer hits first-ever hole-in-one at age of 93 then retires from game","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ben Bender decided to go out on top.

Bender took up golf at the age of 28 but had never aced a hole until his last round. “I’d come close to some hole-in-ones, but this one was level on the green before it curved towards the hole and went in,” Bender told the Zanesville Times Recorder. “I was in awe watching it. I played a few more holes, but my hips were hurting and I had to stop. It seemed the Lord knew this was my last round so he gave me a hole-in-one.” Bender’s shot came on the 152-yard third hole at Ohio’s Green Valley golf course. His form had been patchy until then – he had shot an eight and a seven on the first two holes. Bender was an accomplished golfer in his prime and said he played off a three handicap at one point. “I was lucky to play golf this long, but I never expected [a hole-in-one],” he said. “It was the last time I was able to play, and I think God had a hand in this.

The president had referred on Wednesday to US members of the vicious El Salvador-based gang, MS-13, during an immigration meeting in Washington. But the comment was made during a bigger discussion with California elected and law enforcement officials, and was taken in some quarters as a broader smear suggesting that undocumented migrants pose a violent threat. Speaking at the White House press briefing on Thursday afternoon, Sanders said: “I don’t think the term the president used is strong enough.” She added: “Frankly I think the term animal doesn’t go far enough and I think the president should continue to use his platform and everything he can do under the law to stop these types of horrible, horrible, disgusting people.” At the meeting about sanctuary cities on Wednesday, Trump said of members of the gang: “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.” Trump has long made the gang, based in El Salvador, a target of his rhetoric. He visited Long Island to talk about the gang in 2017 and even explicitly mentioned the group in his 2018 State of the Union speech. However, Trump’s comments sparked controversy. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democratic senator from Nevada, tweeted “@realDonaldTrump, would you speak that way about your ancestors? Let me tell you something: When you attack immigrants, you’re attacking me. You’re attacking my grandfather who crossed the Rio Grande to pursue the American Dream. RT to tell Pres. Trump you stand with immigrants!” This was echoed by the Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell of California, who tweeted: “IF you are a decent person and were in a meeting where @realDonaldTrump called immigrants ‘animals,’ you will denounce him NOW. Otherwise, what makes you any different?” However, Sanders seemed to welcome questions on the topic in the White House briefing room on Thursday. “If the media and liberals want to defend MS-13 they are more than welcome to,” said the spokeswoman. She noted that the organization is “one of the most vicious and deadly gangs that operates by the motto ‘rape, control, kill’.” Shortly afterwards, Trump returned to the subject when questioned by reporters at another event at the White House. He said: “I’m referring, and you know I’m referring, to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in … And if you look a little bit further on in the tape you’ll see that. So I’m actually surprised that you’re asking this question, ‘cause most people got it right.” He went on to say: “MS-13 – these are animals … We need strong immigration laws. We have laws that are laughed at on immigration. So when the MS-13 comes in, when the other gang members come into our country, I refer to them as animals and, guess what? I always will.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/canadian-doctor-wounded-gaza-israel-palestinians-gaza","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T16:04:08Z","webTitle":"'Appalled' Trudeau calls for inquiry after Canadian doctor wounded in Gaza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/canadian-doctor-wounded-gaza-israel-palestinians-gaza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/canadian-doctor-wounded-gaza-israel-palestinians-gaza","fields":{"headline":"'Appalled' Trudeau calls for inquiry after Canadian doctor wounded in Gaza","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, has deplored the shooting of a Canadian doctor by an Israeli sniper on the Gaza border and added his voice to calls for an independent investigation into Israeli fire that killed 60 Palestinians and injured thousands more during mass border protests. The violence erupted during demonstrations at the Gaza border fence on Monday, coinciding with a ceremony to mark the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Most of the Gazans who died were shot by Israeli snipers, according to Gaza’s health ministry. They included eight children under the age of 16, it added. At least 2,700 people were wounded. Trudeau described the reported use of excessive force and live ammunition as “inexcusable” in a statement. “Canada deplores and is gravely concerned by the violence in the Gaza strip that has led to a tragic loss of life and injured countless people,” he said. “We are appalled that Dr Tarek Loubani, a Canadian citizen, is among the wounded – along with so many unarmed people, including civilians, members of the media, first responders, and children.” Loubani, who works as an emergency physician in southern Ontario, said he was treating injured Palestinians on the Gaza Strip when he was shot in both legs on Monday. He was in Gaza as part of a medical team that is field testing 3D-printed medical tourniquets. The shooting happened during a lull in the protests, said Loubani. He was wearing a green surgeon’s outfit and was standing with orange-vested paramedics about 25 metres from the protesters. There were no fires or smoke and he was within clear lines of sight to three fortified sniper posts. “It’s very hard to believe I wasn’t specifically targeted, considering that there was a lull in activity, considering the fact that I was so clearly marked,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation earlier this week as he recovered from the shooting. Another 16 paramedics were injured. The doctor who rescued Loubani, Musa Abuhassanin, was later killed as he was trying to reach another patient. Trudeau said his government is working with Israeli officials in an attempt to determine how Loubani was injured. While Trudeau’s statement ranked as his government’s strongest criticism of Israel to date, it did not mention Israel by name. The prime minister said Canada will work closely with international partners and institutions to address the situation. “It is imperative we establish the facts of what is happening in Gaza,” said Trudeau. “Canada calls for an immediate independent investigation to thoroughly examine the facts on the ground – including any incitement, violence, and the excessive use of force.” The killings have prompted international condemnation with Theresa May, the British prime minister, and the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, among those calling for an independent investigation. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, joined the US in blaming Hamas for the deaths. Netanyahu defended his country’s use of force, saying: “Every country has the obligation to defend its borders.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/18/that-summer-grey-gardens-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T09:00:54Z","webTitle":"That Summer: the story behind the 'other' Grey Gardens documentary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/that-summer-grey-gardens-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/18/that-summer-grey-gardens-documentary","fields":{"headline":"That Summer: the story behind the 'other' Grey Gardens documentary","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This summer, the East Hampton mansion Grey Gardens is 121 years old – exactly half the age of America itself. Its 28 rooms have welcomed the titans who’ve shaped the country: coal barons and newspaper titans and, most famously, the wildling relatives of Jackie Kennedy. Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale moved into Grey Gardens in 1924 and stayed there for over five decades. Outside, the United States was upended by massive cultural shifts: the Great Depression catapulting into the second world war; the civil rights protests and Haight-Ashbury fever sweating out its fury into disco decadence. Inside, wayward vines blocked out the sun – really, the world – as Big Edie and Little Edie gathered cats, fed raccoons and curled into themselves, abandoning the uninhabitable parts of the house room by room until they were crowded into just three. The two beauties moldered, as did the walls around them. Until June 1972 – the That Summer of Göran Olsson’s new documentary – when the Studio 54 era came to them. Big Edie’s niece Lee Radziwill (Jackie Kennedy’s sister) and her photographer boyfriend Peter Beard vacationed at the beach with their famous friends such as Truman Capote and Bianca Jagger. (Andy Warhol, too, in one of his rare jaunts out of the city, seen nervously peering at the sun from underneath a wide-brimmed hat.) Radziwill and Beard visited Grey Gardens with the vague idea of making a documentary about the history of the Hamptons, perhaps narrated by, as Radziwill puts it, “my extremely eccentric aunt”. To help, Radziwill hired Albert and David Maysles, two brothers she knew from the Rolling Stones scene who’d just shot the concert film Gimme Shelter. Over a couple weekends, they shot an hour of Big Edie and Little Edie squabbling with each other and the health officials threatening eviction. Ultimately Radziwill saved the house and scrapped the movie. Rumor was she was embarrassed by the evidence of the Bouvier clan’s disintegration. “No, not at all,” deflects Olsson, on the phone from Switzerland. “They were super busy. They went to Europe and Africa, they did exhibitions, they didn’t know exactly what to do about it, and they had other things on their mind.” As for the Maysles brothers, they’d return to Grey Gardens for the 1975 documentary (called Grey Gardens) that would make them, and the Beales became legends in a film so groundbreaking it announces its own existence in a newspaper clipping in the opening credits. That Summer, Olsson’s new film, represents that lost footage. Consider it a Grey Gardens prequel. Big Edie is more physically and mentally intact; her home is more trashed with cat urine and rot. We see the inspectors barge in brandishing court papers as Radziwill frets over what to save. The rattan furniture, yes. Anything upholstered, absolutely not. And there’s Little Edie – fashion icon, delirious dancer, homebody goddess – leaning into the camera with never-before heard pronouncements, delivered in that urgent whisper that seems to bore through the lens and into your skull. “Cats don’t fit into having a house redecorated,” she hisses. And later: “I think any of us would be happy to have raccoons who look upon us as friends.” “The Beales really paved the way for YouTubers – I certainly know that they paved the way for the Kardashians,” says Olsson. “Documentary has always been way ahead of the mainstream media or social phenomena.” True, but this deeper excavation of Grey Gardens still seems like a surprising fit for the Swedish-born filmmaker of the Sundance award-winning documentary The Black Power Mixtape 1967–1975, which charted the rise of black nationalism as an army fighting three wars: Vietnam, poverty and heroin addiction. In those same years, the Beales were, well, at home fighting over lipstick and who needs to feed the cats. Same America, different universes. Yet to Olsson, both films are about freedom – and they’ve always been intertwined. As a boy growing up in Lund, he’d bicycle from his anti-apartheid club meetings to the public library to flip through Interview magazine. “Everything about the art scene and music scene in Manhattan in the 70s, Bianca, Halston, the Factory, Max’s Kansas City, it was an obsession of mine, and I was totally alone in that interest,” says Olsson. When Peter Beard invited him to see his old Hamptons tapes and photographs, which open That Summer and sets up the spotlight everyone in the film is, or will be, under, Olsson was delighted that he recognized everyone in the background. Finally, his childhood fixation paid off. “I know that I romanticize it, and that it was not true because of the drugs and the economic problems, but still to me it’s the greatest place in terms of tolerance, where people could blend, meet other class, and gender, and ethnic backgrounds.” Freedom eludes Little Edie, who spends That Summer and Grey Gardens yowling her desperation to escape to New York. Cut into four raw reels, this early footage of the then 55-year-old stings. Big Edie nags her to wear makeup, stop crossing her arms and change her costumes every two hours so she can look pretty for the construction workers tramping through the house – potential husbands we know she’ll reject. In a startling aside, the two chat about Little Edie committing “incest” with her Uncle Jack. Big Edie shrugs: “Well, you had to find out about men sometime,” and the conversation charges on, cross-talk, arguments and interruptions in dissonant harmony. In the film’s cruelest line, Big Edie cackles: “The only vermin was you, Edie!” Watching That Summer, I thought of Albert Maysles’ 2014 Grey Gardens Q&amp;A where he said: “I hope that most people who see it are shocked by it and don’t want to see any more.” Or as Little Edie says here: “I think its very cruel to dig up the past.” Yet, we do want to see more – so much that Grey Gardens has already been spun into a TV movie, a play and a musical. “I’m not saying they’re exploiting them in Grey Gardens, but I think a beautiful thing about this footage is that Lee is there,” says Olsson. Radziwill isn’t just the link between the Beales and the Maysles – she’s the last in a line of people who knew them as more than kitsch icons. She’s That Summer’s soft-spoken, camera-indifferent, stabilizing force – she gets the electricity and the hot water working, she charms the inspectors into leaving them alone, and she reminds you that the Edies were genuinely loved. In a casual moment, one of the Edies reaches out to stroke her hair. “It’s so nice, it’s so intimate,” says Olsson. “It’s an organic connection to this environment.” Radziwill didn’t participate in That Summer, though she did allow Olsson to use an audio interview she’d previously recorded with Sofia Coppola. Olsson shrugs it off as “bad timing”, though it’s hard not to wonder if she was spooked by her aunt and cousin’s example that audiences are startled to see glamorous women age. (Though Radziwill remains stunning.) But This Summer adds her quiet, steely spirit to home already “oozing with romance, ghosts and other things,” as Little Edie says in Grey Gardens. This mansion still has corners to explore. That Summer is released in the US on 18 May and in the UK on 1 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/26/10-best-seaside-town-uk-coast-hotels-restaurants","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"10 of the UK's best seaside towns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/26/10-best-seaside-town-uk-coast-hotels-restaurants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/26/10-best-seaside-town-uk-coast-hotels-restaurants","fields":{"headline":"10 of the UK's best seaside towns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Falmouth, Cornwall Politicians and entrepreneurs, pirates and outlaws, Falmouth’s founding family, the Killigrews, lurched over the centuries between respectability and infamy. And though they’re long gone, Falmouth retains something of the Killigrews’ dual nature. From the town’s three beautiful beaches the dirty smudge of tankers can be seen on the horizon. Commercial ships in the harbour tower over the sails of picturesque Falmouth working boats. The best views are from the water, and there are plenty of opportunities to explore the sheltered Carrick Roads (the Fal estuary) by kayak, paddleboard, dinghy or on the small ferry that links Falmouth with St Mawes. Landlubbers can watch the boats from the back windows of the Star and Garter on the High Street and enjoy excellent nose-to-tail dishes from the kitchen’s wood-fired oven. The town has an fiercely independent streak and is home to some exceptional food and drink enthusiasts. Dolly’s Tea Room and Wine Bar stocks more than 200 gins; Espressini (two branches) takes its coffee more seriously than most; and tucked away in a small courtyard, Beerwolf combines dark wood and pale ale with an excellent selection of books. You may have to search for it but the Killigrews’ maverick spirit persists. Falmouth is lively, rough round the edges in all the right ways and still not quite respectable, and for those reasons alone, I love it.

Wyl Menmuir, author of Man Booker prize-longlisted novel The Many Rothesay, Isle of Bute What you must do, straight off the boat, is go to Zavaroni’s on Argyle Street and buy a Top Hat – an ice-cream cone topped by a marshmallow snowball. Rothesay is not a place where pleasure ought to be deferred, and in any case, it will give you something to walk off. While eating, wander over to Fraser Gillies, the gents’ outfitters at 30 Montague Street, and admire the window display with its Ivor Cutler-ish signs: “Socks for feet”, “Cavalry twill trousers – must supply own horse”, and so on. Rothesay, the main settlement on the Isle of Bute, is the archetypal Scottish seaside town from the days when Glaswegians went “doon the watter” for their summer holiday, and some of that gaudy atmosphere persists. It’s beautiful, though. The view across the bay to the Cowal hills is the best seaside panorama in Scotland. You get there by ferry, a 35-minute crossing from the terminal at Wemyss Bay railway station. This a wee marvel in itself, its Edwardian canopy a swirl of steel and glass. Make sure and leave enough time to pick up something to read from the secondhand bookshop in the former first-class waiting room. That’s a trip to Rothesay: a day of Top Hats and tales. Stay Chandlers Hotel in nearby Ascog Bay has views over the Clyde to the Ayrshire coast, and doubles from £110. Peter Ross, author of The Passion of Harry Bingo: Further Dispatches from Unreported Scotland Herne Bay, Kent I fell in love with beach huts at Herne Bay. Watching their pointed shadows march along the shingle back in 1998 inspired me to pursue a career as a seaside historian. Though Herne Bay has long played second fiddle to neighbouring Whitstable, on a recent visit I see it has undergone some impressive improvements. The Georgian clock tower that dominates the promenade is looking spruce, and the playground next to the beach is a hit with my children. Stepping into the enclosed bandstand felt like stepping back into the 1930s and amid the art-deco details, Makcari’s ice-cream parlour is the perfect place to stop for refreshment. The pier was once the third-longest in the country but these days its seaward end is an island of iron marooned in the Thames estuary. Its landward end, however, has been revived, with beach hut-style retail and craft units, and its railings yarn-bombed with a joyful parade of nautical knits. The Oyster and Chop House on the High Street specialises in locally caught lobster, or for a touch of London-on-sea, try the Herne Bay Traditional Pie and Mash (72 Central Parade). Stay: Evening Tide Guesthouse on the seafront, opposite the bandstand, has doubles from £79 B&amp;B. Kathryn Ferry, author of Sheds on the Seashore: A Tour through Beach Hut History Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire I have bittersweet memories of Saltburn. Yes, it’s a charming seaside town, designed by a Victorian philanthropist, on a sandy stretch of coast. Yes, it has a genuine 16th-century smugglers’ tavern, the Ship Inn, which still echoes with the ghosts of the past. And yes, it has a pretty pier, untroubled by tourist tat, where I surfed by moonlight one clear November night, in head-high waves that shimmered as they broke. But my memories are clouded by the 17-day flat spell I sat through as I attempted to surf every beach in Britain. That’s 17 days staring out to sea from Saltburn’s brief-but-charming promenade; 17 days sitting in various delightful tea houses (until I was ejected for vagrancy). Living in a van, I used the Sitting Room, a cosy cafe by the station, as, well, my sitting room. It does a good line in mismatched 1970s furniture, delicious cakes and interesting cocktails. Most of the time, Saltburn feels like a proper surf town, where you can fall out of bed, pad through the streets, grab a board at the surf shack and dive straight in to its beginner-friendly waves. Add this to its charm and friendliness, and the great fish and chips at the Seaview Restaurant, and Saltburn could almost claim to be the Biarritz of Britain. Stay If you can’t sleep in your van, Brockley Hall Hotel, a neo-gothic mansion overlooking Skelton Beck, is a short walk from the station and has doubles from £95 B&amp;B. Jonathan Bennett, author of Around the Coast in Eighty Waves Portstewart, County Derry Whenever there’s a blink of summer sun in these parts, Portstewart Strand, the two-mile Blue Flag stretch of sand west of town, is transformed into a pleasure ground, jam-packed with daytrippers. My preferred route (the dog’s, too) takes us off the beach, up one of the “sand ladders” into the dunes, where the wind immediately drops and the Atlantic roar softens to a purr. I can spend hours in there over a carpet of pansies and wild thyme, hunting for fritillaries and bee orchids or watching at the Barmouth, where the Bann river empties into the sea, as the sanderlings do their comic dance at the water’s edge. The more energetic carry in their boogie boards and surf down the tallest dune. (I’m told that in the 1950s, locals used to do the same on tea trays.) There’s fresh seafood on offer at Harry’s Shack at the head of the beach, from where you can take the coastal path up into town. For a lighter bite, stop off at the Paper Fig, just before the Fisherman’s Cottage at The Berrins on Berne Road. By the time you reach the prom you’ll be ready for a “poke” (ice-cream cone). Try the salted caramel from Morelli’s, which also does dairy- and gluten-free versions, or, closer to the harbour, Roughan’s does a delicious mango and passion fruit ice-cream. Further along the prom, stock up on Young Buck blue cheese and Corndale Farm chorizo to bring a taste of the local fare home at Warke’s Deli . Stay Saltwater House has doubles from £110 B&amp;B, is within easy reach of the coastal path and has views along the coast to Mussenden Temple and the hills of Donegal. • The National Trust’s next Orchid Walk on Portstewart beach is on 18 June, and its next Butterfly Safari is on 14 July (adult £2, child £1, booking essential, nationaltrust.org.uk) Bernie McGill’s latest novel, The Watch House, is set on nearby Rathlin Island Appledore, Devon At the end of a short peninsula on the north coast of a long one lies a village on the road to nowhere – and for that I love it. My first sight of Appledore, three miles north of Bideford, was eight years ago when the Beaver Inn emerged from the swirling December mist like the world’s last hostelry. Inside, most customers seemed to be playing a strange local card game. Observing from the bar, I had no idea this would soon be my local – at least for the duration of every visit. Mist rolling up the Torridge estuary to Appledore Quay is a regular feature, but when the sun comes out, the village looks a different place. With views of dunes and the open sea, it’s a time capsule from a 1950s summer: children rock-pooling, parents sampling Mr Hocking’s local ice-creams. Other pubs include The Champ, for local real ales and The Beaver for live music. You’re spoilt for choice of cafes: both the Market Street Kitchen and the award-winning Coffee Cabin do excellent cappuccinos. The nearest sandy coastal beach is a couple of miles away but what keeps bringing me back is the ever-changing river scene. Stay The Seagate is a 17th-century waterfront pub with doubles from £85. Richard Guise, author of Over the Hill and Round the Bend, and Two Wheels Over Catalonia Barmouth, Gwynedd At first glance, Barmouth is a shabby fairground arcade, a candyfloss-and-Carling type of town. It can feel tacky, inflated dinghies bobbing on shop walls above stacked displays of plastic paraphernalia. But it’s also the seaside town of my childhood, and layers of repeated visits have distilled down into memories of a pure and perfect sunny beach holiday – running past the rock shop and over the railway line down to the sand, the elation of sunshine on bare legs, digging sand near a cluster of folding chairs carefully set out behind striped windbreakers. The beach has wide flat sand at the estuary mouth, then turns to half a mile of dunes before splitting into short stretches between groynes. The hills and edges of the mysterious Llŷn peninsula lie far away across the water. Look inland and you see mountains: both Cadair Idris and the Rhinogs are easy to reach for days out in wilder land. South of town, the wooden planked railway viaduct offers a wonderful view over the Mawddach estuary. From the bridge you can bike the 16-mile loop of the spectacular Mawddach Trail between Barmouth and to Dolgellau. The arts centre and coffee shop in the Ebeneezer Chapel on the High Street has nice gifts and cakes but for a good meal head towards the harbour. The Last Inn on Church Street is good for local fish or black beef. And the Mermaid Fish Bar on nearby Jubilee Street does the best chips in town. Stay Beautiful Wales has luxury self-catering barn conversions with wonderful beach views in Llanaber, a mile or so just up the road from Barmouth, from £290 for two nights (sleeps two). Ursula Martin, author of One Woman Walks Wales Southport, Merseyside Visiting every pleasure pier in England and Wales was a fine way to see our coastal resorts, from the grottiest to the greatest. Southport had just the right combination of modern town bustle and buckets and spades to make it one of the best. The huge beach is great for walks and wildlife, although walking to the sea itself might take a while. Even the second-longest pier in the UK doesn’t, for most of the time, reach the water: Southport has one of the biggest tidal ranges in the world, and the sea is often away in the distance. Even the locals get excited when there’s a high tide. The pier itself is the hub of seaside activities, a fab retro arcade at the pier head, with love testers, penny falls and a terrifying automaton called Laugh with Jolly Jack. At the land end, there’s a great hall of mirrors, which doesn’t reflect badly on the town at all. Just along the prom, with views across Marine Lake to the beach, is the Lakeside Inn, once Britain’s smallest pub. The Bottle Room a short walk away on Lord Street is a cosy craft beer haven with live music every weekend, while A Great Little Place behind the Town Hall combines the warm glow of good food with the warm glow of a social enterprise helping people with autism. A cumberland sausage bap with beer-braised apples and mushrooms is filling for around a fiver. Stay The Grade II-listed Bold Hotel has just had a multimillion pound refurb and has doubles from £68 room-only. Jon Bounds, co-author of Pier Review, A Road Trip in Search of the British Seaside Tynemouth, Tyne &amp; Wear I first heard of Tynemouth when a friend explained why there was a surfboard in his room at Newcastle University: “We’re just down the road from Longsands, the best surfing beach in north-east England.” I was intrigued, so we took the metro out to the coast, where I rented a board from Tynemouth Surf Co and caught my first North Sea wave. I also caught the surfing bug that autumnal afternoon, and it happened in the right place at the right time: as winter draws in, the swells start pumping. Deepest, darkest January is my favourite time in Tynemouth – not just for the waves, or the camaraderie among cold-water surfers, but for the shocked expressions from dog walkers as they watch you dive into the ice -cold water. Little do they know we’re toasty warm in head-to-toe neoprene. As winter eases into spring the swells calm down and activities in Tynemouth change. Surfing is replaced by swimming in the cove, barbecues in the old tidal pool and beers in the Gibraltar Rock pub overlooking the ancient castle and priory. These immaculately maintained ruins are on a cliff-edge at the end of Front Street, which is packed with places to eat. My favourite dish is scampi from Longsands Fish Kitchen, devoured in our campervan on the hill overlooking the mouth of the Tyne. From there, you’re surrounded by exciting places to explore – from the glittering lights of Newcastle upriver, to the wild expanse of Northumberland up the coast. Stay: Tynemouth’s Grand Hotel overlooks Longsands Beach, with doubles from £98 B&amp;B. William Thomson, author of The Book of Tides and The World of Tides Ventnor, Isle of Wight A freshly grilled bacon sandwich on the top deck of the ferry heralded my childhood holidays to the Isle of Wight. Zipped up in cagoules as the wind gusted around us, my brother and I had tasted nothing finer. Our destination was Ventnor, a seaside town with everything a six-year-old could desire: a huge paddling pool with a 3D map of the island rising from its centre, a muddyish beach to splash about on, and bags of chips to eat as my feet dangled from a deckchair. They’ve stopped serving bacon sandwiches on the top deck of the Red Funnel, but pretty much everything in Ventnor is reassuringly the same. The hairpin bends of the Cascade Road – actual name Shore Hill, which pitches visitors into the Victorian seaside town – still slaloms past colourful municipal bedding and steadfast granite villas. Much of the architecture survives from Ventnor’s 19th-century heyday as a health resort, and original bathing machines (without wheels) are now available to hire as beach huts. Chips are still the snack of choice at Haven Fishery on The Esplanade, although these days they are accompanied with inventive crab options (samosas, croquettes). A 20-minute walk along the seafront takes you now, as then, to the subtropical Botanical Gardens, a safe place to get lost in, much like Ventnor itself.

There is nothing funny about it now. For 15 months Theresa May has groped her way towards an approach that could reconcile her party’s Europe-loathers with her party’s Europe-pragmatists. All too predictably, none of her efforts have succeeded. Mrs May now has a month before the June European council at which the UK and the EU are due to review progress. She has five months before some kind of deal is struck. Progress? Deal? These words have lost all meaning. Getting two pandas to mate in captivity turns out to be a cinch compared with getting the Conservative party to agree what it wants. Mrs May’s latest suggestions for turning Brexit dross into an agreement that can be marketed as golden is a so-called “time-limited goods arrangement”. Essentially, this is an attempt to keep the UK within the EU’s external tariff system after Brexit until it can come up with an effective technological alternative to a post-Brexit hard border in Ireland. That way, the loathers would get their Brexit, the pragmatists would get something they could call a frictionless Irish border, Mrs May would have a united party for a few weeks and the UK would not crash out of the EU unprotected. The problem with all this is … well, where do we start? In the first place, this agreement is not nailed down yet. Boris Johnson, who is trying to get sacked in the hope this will help his dwindling leadership ambitions, opposes it. Michael Gove, attempting to position himself as the civilised alternative to Mr Johnson, does too. Outside the government, pragmatic pro-Europeans like Damian Green think the plan could be a starter. However, Jacob Rees-Mogg dismisses it as a vision of “perpetual purgatory”. Second, although actually more important, the rest of the EU has not been consulted. Even if the Tory party improbably comes together behind the idea, the real negotiation is with the EU and, on the key issue, with the Irish government. These talks have not taken place yet – not a small point. According to our Brussels correspondent, EU reactions range from the charge that the UK’s ideas are magical thinking to the view that they are “less use than a deodorant”. Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, meanwhile, says none of it “remotely approaches” the kind of terms that would avoid Britain’s trade relations with the EU plunging over a cliff at high speed in March next year. This could all be brinkmanship. It could also be true. There are also the small (not) matters of parliament and the people. Neither has been consulted yet. Both have to be taken seriously. Mrs May has to let MPs into the process at some point if she wants the much amended EU withdrawal bill to become law. Both the parliamentary numbers and the mood suggest she could lose a vote on the customs union, the very issue on which she is trying to strike a compromise in the cabinet. That’s why Mrs May has not definitely decided when to bring the bill back to the Commons. And then there’s the people – in two contexts. One is that MPs may still decide to put the eventual deal – if there is one and even if there isn’t – to a second referendum. The other, reportedly in Mrs May’s mind when she confronted Mr Rees-Mogg on it this week, is that Northern Ireland voters might reject a hard Brexit and, in effect, go in with the Republic on a soft border basis. People like Mr Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg don’t think about such possibilities. They are real not imaginary. Their consequences would be immense. That is reason enough to say that the time for laughter, if it ever existed, ended long ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/may/19/train-timetables-rail-passengers-journey-times","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"Off the rails: Train timetable shake-up sparks anger among passengers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/19/train-timetables-rail-passengers-journey-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/19/train-timetables-rail-passengers-journey-times","fields":{"headline":"Off the rails: Train timetable shake-up sparks anger among passengers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Commuters could be in for a chaotic start on Monday morning as they struggle to come to terms with the biggest change to timetables in living memory. The biggest upheaval will be across the Southern, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern networks run by GTR, which account for a quarter of all UK rail journeys, but services in and out of Manchester and Hull are also set for a major overhaul. For the first time, trains will run through the capital, offering no-change services between Cambridge to Gatwick and Brighton. The new timetables will see every train time change on the GTR-run services, and in some cases trains will start and terminate at different stations. TransPennine services in the north of England also face big timetable changes that experts warn will make a huge difference to passengers’ lives. Some trains will no longer stop where they used to, making some journeys untenable. GTR dismisses claims that services will deteriorate. “We are adding almost 400 more trains a day to our timetable (a 13% increase), with a huge uplift in capacity across the region, especially at peak times when it is needed most,” it says. “We strongly refute the claim that this is a ‘serious downgrading’, and are confident it brings a radical overall improvement in services. Passengers will see huge benefits as a result of the changes, with space for an extra 50,000 passengers travelling into London in the morning peak, and new through-London routes serving 80 more stations.” But passengers who live in some commuter towns have described “decimated services”, much longer journeys, and more time spent standing where they now get a seat. Others say timetable changes will force them to start travelling in the pre-9.30am peak period, when tickets are much more expensive. Across the board, journey times are rising to allow passengers to get on and off trains – up from 30 seconds to a minute – and to create a timetable that operators can stick to. Some off-peak journeys will take 12 minutes longer. Critics say some of the changes are to help train operators avoid “delay repay” costs. Operators first published proposed timetables last year for consultation. Passenger groups say the exercise now looks as though it was designed to soften them up so that when the companies reinstated lost trains, passengers would fail to spot by how much the overall service had been downgraded. Anthony Smith of passenger group Transport Focus says the changes will be hugely disruptive. “Many passengers have built their lives around current timetables in order to get work, pick up kids or simply make their lives work,” he says. “Changes which mean longer journey times, fewer trains or having to catch an earlier peak fare train will hurt. While other passengers will be pleased by the new services and destinations, the fairness of the overall timetable will need to be kept under close review.” Below we examine some of the communities most affected. Bedfordshire Changes to the Thameslink timetable mean that East Midlands Trains (EMT) to St Pancras will no longer call at either Bedford or Luton at peak times. Trains between Bedford and Wellingborough will be replaced by buses. The Bedford Commuters Association says the new timetable is a major backwards step and claims the EMT “bombshell” was announced with no proper consultation. This also affects those further down the line, with the resulting removal of existing services to Flitwick, Leagrave and Harpenden. Harpenden users were promised eight trains an hour but will only receive six. Hertfordshire The seven peak-time trains to London that originate at Royston now are being reduced to three. When the timetable changes were first announced, Edward Carder who lives in Royston and commutes each day to London, says he felt “physically sick and thought the only solution was to move house”. He formed the local rail user group and joined forces with other areas to fight the proposals. Govia has reinstated some of the “lost” trains, but he says the new service is still a major downgrade and many more passengers will have to stand. Royston commuters pay £6,000 a year. In Letchworth, Leanne Stott, who runs the garden city’s passenger group, talks of a decimated service that will hit off-peak users particularly hard. Lots of fast trains that used to run into London in 30 minutes will no longer stop there. Working parents who used to drop kids off and then take the 9.45am train into London face a 55-minute journey into town rather than the 30 minutes currently. Returning trains are similarly longer, adding several hours to weekly commutes. Passengers returning from a night out in London face 50-minute journeys rather than the current 30. In Welwyn Garden City, Govia says there will be a big improvement from next week – but Malcolm Cowan of the local users’ group says the changes are a “major step backwards”. Peak trains to London will be slower for many; trains back currently take 26 minutes, rising to 35 next week. “It’ll be quicker to take a fast evening train to the tiny Welwyn North station and a connecting train back to WGC. We have 2.6 million passengers each year; the small Welwyn North has just 600,000, but they have kept their fast service. It’s crazy,” he says. Manchester Transport Focus says delays to electrification between Manchester and Bolton, and a shortage of diesel rolling stock, mean many of Northern’s planned improvements have had to be deferred. Commuters from Levenshulme and Heaton Chapel into Manchester are going from four trains an hour to three at off peak. Peak-time users face waits of up to 49 minutes for a train. Passengers on the Southport line will see almost all trains switching to Manchester Victoria rather than Piccadilly. Hull Currently passengers taking the early evening train from King’s Cross to Hull can link to a train to Bridlington and on to Scarborough. Northern has brought forward its departure, meaning its passengers will miss it and face a 90-minute wait. TransPennine Express trains that start in Hull and head over to Manchester have been downgraded, according to the local rail user group. TPE claims the additional four stops will only add four minutes to journey times, but the group expects this to be significantly longer. Sussex and Surrey Brighton could be said to be a winner of the timetable shake-up, with the new through-service to Cambridge, more destinations and more trains, but one unintended consequence is fewer trains to Clapham Junction on the line into Victoria. One Brighton commuter, Henry Hughes, says the changes will force him to stop commuting altogether. He says: “There used to be two direct peak-time Clapham Junction trains, 6.45am, 8.45am, and returning 5.12pm and 6.37pm. Now the first is at 9.33am, and the first in the evening is 7.30pm. I’ve moved into an office in Brighton and will be handing in my season ticket.” Redhill is another big loser. Campaigners says fast services to London Victoria are being removed and replaced with a slow train taking 40% longer. They are furious because in 2015 Southern justified cutting 50% of peak services from Redhill to London Bridge by saying that they would get an improved service in May 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/17/libertarian-betting-curbs-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-gambling","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T17:11:25Z","webTitle":"I’m a libertarian, but still I say betting curbs are long overdue | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/17/libertarian-betting-curbs-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-gambling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/17/libertarian-betting-curbs-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-gambling","fields":{"headline":"I’m a libertarian, but still I say betting curbs are long overdue","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The most cynical sign I know hangs in my local betting shop. It reads, “When the fun stops, stop.” The sign is sponsored by a consortium of William Hill, Ladbrokes Coral and Paddy Power, and is meant to imply their “awareness” of gambling addiction. What it really means is: when the fun stops, profit starts. It reminds me of the doctors who used to appear before congressional committees pleading that cigarettes were good for your health. The government’s reduction to £2 of the maximum £100 stake in fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) is welcome, if shockingly overdue. It represents a rare and emphatic rebellion by ministers against the awesome power over government of commercial lobbying. Gambling addiction is a specific and savage curse, mostly on the poorest section of the community. There are an estimated 430,000 people who consider themselves addicts, and 2.3 million who admit they are “at risk”. Almost half of those who use the machines admit to being addicted. Some surveys put this proportion as high as 80%. Under the late Tessa Jowell’s bizarre 2005 Gambling Act, the old one-armed bandits were upgraded to become gambling’s “crack cocaine”. Jowell promised they would not lead to “a British Las Vegas”. They have. The only retort from the gambling industry is that the change will close hundreds of betting shops, “threaten 21,000 jobs” and cost the government £400m in tax revenue. It stresses how much it spends from its £13bn a year in profit to warn about “responsible gambling”. Yet the best Betfred’s Mark Stebbings could do today was to accuse the government of “playing politics with people’s jobs”. That surely is better than playing profits with people’s lives. These are exactly the wails that we heard from the tobacco companies as they fought against curbs on nicotine. In truth, the measure is a mere slap on the wrist for an industry that is now rampant online. Here is where the secret addict can plunge the depths of despair, and where the most at-risk group are 18- to 30-year-olds. Here is where, when the fun stops, addiction takes hold. It tends to be hidden, until its consequences are unleashed on often unsuspecting families. The online industry has turned Britain’s colony of Gibraltar into gambling’s narco-economy. A phenomenal one-third of the entire global gaming industry is estimated to emanate from massive servers buried under Gibraltar’s celebrated rock. Here they can accrue profit, blessedly free of UK taxes other than remote gaming duty. It is a stain on Britain’s name. The hope must now be that the government can start to address the online problem. Much of Britain’s gambling industry is so offshore as to lose some of its political clout. If you employ few Britons, you can hardly threaten unemployment or loss of taxes. The hundreds of thousands of Britons who must be claiming social benefits through gambling addiction may be hidden from the fat cats of Gibraltar who put them there. But the cost to society must be in the billions. I am a libertarian who would normally object to the state preventing people doing what gives them pleasure. But a sign of civilisation is that it protects individuals from cynical exploitation by others, and the wider community from consequent harm. Such protection need not mean prohibition. It can mean discouragement through regulation. “Nudge economics” is an acknowledged weapon of social policy. There can be no doubt that curbs on smoking, rightly short of prohibition, have slashed consumption and made public spaces more tolerable for all. The new sugar tax – long held at bay by lobbyists – is finally reducing the addictive sugar content of soft drinks. Gambling machines are clearly a menace whose harm spills over into families and the community. One of the most alarming sights I know is a Las Vegas FOBT hall, with rows of people punching machines in zombie-like rhythm, clearly fixated. These machines are far worse than, for instance, betting on sport or the lottery in that they are programmed to induce addiction. Hints at possibly imminent winnings are like wraps of cocaine, suggesting the next snort will be even better than the last. John Stuart Mill’s doctrine of liberty held that: “Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.” So long as others are not harmed, said Mill, we should be beyond the reach of society and can do as we please. Nothing is that simple. The boundary between pleasure and addiction that is harmful to others is the hardest boundary for government to police. Alcoholism hovers over social drinking, cancer over cigarettes, obesity over fast food and bankruptcy over a mild flutter. The border is no easier to detect between the odd spliff and the path to Narcotics Anonymous. All we know is that the British state’s policing of these boundaries lacks any rationale. It is dictated by prejudice, corporate lobbying and political hypocrisy. Even in the hypocrisy, governments have been random. They decline to use nudge taxes seriously to discourage drunkenness or obesity, as if our bodies were indeed our personal property – free for others to exploit. Yet governments are savage towards such taboos as drug use or assisted suicide, while all forms of health and safety have become ruling obsessions of the nanny state. There can be no argument that, where a vested interest is clearly causing harm to large numbers of people for its private profit, the logic is for intervention. But liberty demands that reform customarily be to regulate rather than prohibit. That is the message of these gambling changes. Next the principle should be extended to Britain’s even vaster drugs economy, where prohibition is clearly counterproductive and regulation even more desperately needed. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/17/pep-guardiola-signs-contract-extension-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T17:13:00Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola signs two-year Manchester City contract extension","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/17/pep-guardiola-signs-contract-extension-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/17/pep-guardiola-signs-contract-extension-manchester-city","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola signs two-year Manchester City contract extension","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola signed a new contract to commit himself to Manchester City for another three years and immediately warned the rest of English football that his intention was to make his record-breaking team even more formidable opponents. Guardiola has agreed a two-year extension to his present deal, which had another 12 months to run, meaning he will have until 2021 to achieve the club’s ambition of winning the Champions League for the first time. “I am so happy and excited,” he said. “It’s a pleasure to be able to work here. I enjoy working with our players every day and we will try to do our best together in the coming years. “I will focus on the desire of my players to become a better team and every day that’s what I will try to do – to improve on the pitch and improve our players. We have a young squad with an average age of 23 and we want to keep taking steps forward and maintain the levels we’ve achieved this season.” Guardiola’s decision to commit himself to a new deal means, in theory, he will spend longer managing City than he did either Barcelona or Bayern Munich. His team won the Premier League by 19 points last season, setting a number of records in the process, and his new deal will almost certainly make him the highest paid manager in English football. “Pep’s contract extension is fantastic news for Manchester City,” Ferran Soriano, the club’s chief executive, said. “We have all been privileged to witness how we have played beautiful football, won titles, broken records and reached the incredible mark of 100 Premier League points. Pep has shown this style can succeed in the Premier League in a way it has never been done before. This season has been another step of our strategic plan and the continuous effort to improve the football we play. We are very pleased with the progress.” Gareth Southgate, the England manager, also paid tribute to Guardiola’s work, describing the 47-year-old Catalan as an inspiration for the whole of English football. “Who coaches our youngest players? It’s dads and parents and the impact of seeing that Barcelona team five to seven years ago was enormous. He’s been an innovator. When I watch kids’ football now, I see them playing out from the back. “I don’t see [coaches] with heads in their hands saying ‘get it forward’. I think that’s an impact of his [Barcelona] team, with the likes of Andrés Iniesta and Xavi.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T06:30:45Z","webTitle":"Natives by Akala review – the hip-hop artist on race and class in the ruins of empire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review","fields":{"headline":"Natives by Akala review – the hip-hop artist on race and class in the ruins of empire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What was it like to grow up poor, mixed race and politicised in the Britain of the 1980s and 90s? Why is the structural racism that so evidently determines the life chances of so many non‑white people virtually invisible to some of their fellow citizens? Why do the majority of people in Britain today remain convinced that the empire was a force for good in the world, despite the growing weight of evidence to the contrary? And how does a bookish youth with dreams of becoming a scientist turn, in just a few years, into a knife-carrying teenager? These, and multiple others, are the questions at the centre of Natives, the first book by the hip-hop artist and performer Akala. The bookish youth is the author, who, when exposed to the full force of British racism, went from being a “wannabe Max Planck to a wannabe gangster”. For a while, as he himself acknowledges, he became the stereotype. That he later made another remarkable transition, becoming an entrepreneur, poet, recording artist and increasingly significant voice in British public life, explains why there is a buzz about the book and its author, an artist in the process of expanding his horizons and extending his range. Natives is not an easy book to categorise and for some it will not be an easy book to read, full as it is of uncomfortable statistics about the effects of race and equally disturbing truths about British history. It has been described as a polemic, which in certain respects it is, but it is also a form of biography, a work more interestingly and experimentally structured than any out-and-out polemic. Its more introspective passages create the impression of someone who walks through the world thinking, and for whom self-education and self-awareness have long been survival strategies. The book it best resembles is The Autobiography of Malcolm X from 1965; the memoir that wasn’t, as it was co-written by Alex Haley (later of Roots fame) and based on a series of intense and revealing interviews. Both books begin with powerful accounts of childhood and the experience of racial awakening. Some of Akala’s character sketches, in which he describes men from his London neighbourhood who might have been academics or generals had their life-chances not been so prescribed by race, are redolent of Malcolm’s descriptions of the Harlem gangsters he knew in his years as a hustler. The poignant and critical difference between the two books is that Malcolm X’s escape from the life into which American racism had channelled him took place only after he had become a Harlem hustler and ultimately a convict. Akala’s story is different, but avoids falling into a common trap. Too many biographies of musicians, athletes and actors slide, lazily and almost unthinkingly, into a conventional rags-to-riches narrative, detailing an escape from hardship to the bright lights of show business. Natives avoids becoming a Horatio Alger tale reimagined through hip-hop. There is too much self-awareness here for self-attribution fallacy. Akala carefully picks apart two pervasive and inter-connected myths; the delusion that we live in a meritocracy and the fantasy that the exceptional achievements of some black people are proof that the obstacles of poverty and race can be overcome by all. He takes his escape from poverty not as proof of personal exceptionalism but of the vagaries and chaotic injustice of race, class and privilege. There is no blindness to the fact that a different fall of the dice might have led to a radically different outcome. Reading Natives in the same week that Kanye West clumsily suggested that the 400 years of American slavery “sounds like a choice” makes Akala’s almost clinical level of self-awareness all the more powerful. “Class affects everything, even racism”, he writes – and race and class are given equal billing in his subtitle. The emergence over recent years of the dubious concept of the “white working class” has led to the notional expulsion of impoverished black Britons from the working class identity they had previously occupied – a new form of divide and rule. Natives graphically demonstrates how class and race intersect; there are the struggles of the author’s Scottish mother to get her children educated and the deluded ramblings of his white grandfather who, despite a life in which little was achieved, took comfort in the fact that he at least was “not a nigger”. Elsewhere are cameos by figures who unknowingly act in near perfect accordance with the workings of race – the teacher who demands that the young Akala recognises William Wilberforce as the “white saviour” who freed his black ancestors from slavery; the Brazilian police marksman who – unable to conceive of a young black man as anything other than a favela drug-dealer – comes close to shooting him during a Rio de Janeiro traffic stop. Natives ranges widely across history and contemporary politics but its more analytical and impressively footnoted sections will be overshadowed by the biographical passages. Black British people tend not to talk or write much about their own direct and personal experiences of racism and racial violence, in part because the platforms to do so have rarely been available. As a consequence when books emerge that recount such experiences, they become the main focus of reviewers and interviewers, at the expense of the politics and history. This would be especially regrettable in a book with this much to say. • Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton.

Britain has about 600 troops in Afghanistan at present, mainly based in Kabul training officers and not engaged in combat. There is also a small contingent of special forces. The new deployment could see hundreds more return to Afghanistan. The UK withdrew almost all of its combat troops from the country in 2014. Faced with a Taliban resurgence, the US, which has about 15,000 troops in the country supporting the Afghan military, asked the UK and other Nato countries last summer to send reinforcements. Britain responded with an extra 85. Later in the year, Trump renewed the plea and the proposed new UK deployment is in response to that request by the US president. The hundreds more British troops are expected to be involved in training rather than combat. The Ministry of Defence, which usually does not discuss troop deployments in advance, said only that the UK’s contribution was kept under constant review. An MoD spokesperson said: “The support the UK provides Afghanistan on security, development and governance is crucial to building a stable state and reducing the terrorist threat to the UK. We remain committed to Nato’s non-combat Resolute Support mission, in which we play an important role, and keep our contribution under constant review.” In spite of pressure on the defence budget, the UK is engaged in 25 operations overseas. It is also struggling to retain and recruit personnel, a problem that was highlighted in new MoD figures published on Thursday showing the army shrinking, down to 77,120, well short of its supposed strength of 82,000. The overall size of the armed forces, including navy, air force and army, stands at 194,140, down by 2,900 from last year. The army, down from 78,410 a year ago, is at its smallest since the 17th century. Recruitment is traditionally harder in peacetime. The reduction is down to factors including a series of budget squeezes, computer glitches on the part of Capita, to which the MoD outsourced recruitment, and low morale. The MoD’s annual armed forces continuous attitudes survey revealed that 61% of service personnel described morale as low. The shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffiths, criticised the government for its “shocking failure to recruit and retain armed forces”. An MoD spokesperson did not directly address the shrinkage, but said: “We are currently active on 25 operations in 30 countries around the world and have enough personnel to meet all our operational requirements. In the past year, we have recruited over 13,000 people into a variety of posts and we have a range of initiatives to make sure we attract and keep the personnel we need. “We remain committed to ensuring we have the right skills at every level of the armed forces, so that our world-leading military can continue to face intensifying global threats.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/18/nfl-nba-cheerleaders-lawsuits-sports","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T08:00:53Z","webTitle":"'Dancers live in a world of fear': why cheerleaders are taking on the NFL and NBA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/18/nfl-nba-cheerleaders-lawsuits-sports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/18/nfl-nba-cheerleaders-lawsuits-sports","fields":{"headline":"'Dancers live in a world of fear': why cheerleaders are taking on the NFL and NBA","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One dollar. That’s the amount former NFL cheerleaders Bailey Davis and Kristen Anne Ware offered to settle for in exchange for a four-hour sit down with Roger Goodell, the commissioner of their league. Both athletes have accused the NFL of discriminating against women. Last season, Davis claims she was fired from her position cheering for the New Orleans Saints after sending a private Instagram photo of herself in a one-piece bathing suit. Ware alleges she lost her job with the Miami Dolphins when she showed up to work wearing a ring that signified she was a virgin. Both were underpaid, subject to extreme control over their lives, and expected to adhere to anti-fraternization rules that applied to them but not the players they devoted their lives to cheering for. Accounts like theirs are surfacing frequently, bubbles of scandal rising in fast succession: markers of a rolling boil. Since 2014, five other NFL teams – the Raiders, Buccaneers, Bengals, Jets, Bills, and one NBA team, the Bucks – have faced lawsuits from their dancers, each alleging severe labor violations, and offering glances into the secretive and manipulative world of professional cheerleading: mandatory diets; forced beauty regimens paid out of pocket; countless hours of work for which the super-rich teams they cheered for refused to pay them. Perched atop of this mountain of alleged mistreatment, and riding the rocky aftermath of a recent New York Times story that revealed that in 2013 Washington cheerleaders were required to pose topless and act as unpaid escorts to the team’s sponsors, Goodell chose not to meet face to face with Davis and Ware. He sent his lawyers instead. “I really do believe that they want to work together in a cooperative manner and that they have good intentions,” Sara Blackwell, attorney for both Ware and Davis, told the Guardian of her recent call with representatives for the league. “If they’re playing me, or patronizing me, that’s fine, too. We can deal with it though the legal process.” Blackwell has filed a suit on behalf of her clients against the league but is not actively pursuing it for the time being. While it remains unclear whether Goodell is playing the cheerleaders, he has, in the past, given lip service to treating them fairly. At a press conference ahead of Super Bowl 50 in 2016, Goodell told reporters that underpayment of cheerleaders in his league, was “Not a new issue for us … I think the cheerleaders perform a very valuable function for us … I think they should be properly compensated, and I am encouraging that and discussing that with our clubs on a regular basis.” Goodell’s belief in the importance of compensating cheerleaders had not been evident in previous years. His own signature appears on this 2009 contract between the Buffalo Bills and its broadcast affiliate, Citadel Broadcasting, in which it was stipulated that the team’s cheerleaders would not be paid for the eight-plus hours they spent working game days. They would also be subject to intensive control of their behavior and appearance by the Bills. They would additionally be subject to the rules and regulations of the NFL. They would not hold the league or the team responsible for any harm that befell them while working for the team. They would not be, as Goodell claimed in his Super Bowl 50 press conference, employees of the team. The NFL is also named as a defendant in the ongoing suit against the Bills. While much of the focus has been on NFL cheerleaders, rampant mistreatment of dancers appears to be endemic to the NBA as well. “I know the NBA has the same problems because I hear from them,” said Blackwell. NBA cheerleaders, like their NFL counterparts, are often required to sign arbitration agreements, which force employees claiming damages into highly confidential settlement talks. Often, said Blackwell, when employees settle in arbitration “they have to sign a gag order saying ‘You can never tell anyone about your story; that we settled. Nothing.” Blackwell noted that the same week Davis lost her job with the Saints, the New Orleans Pelicans fired three cheerleaders for allegedly dating a player. (At the time, both the Pelicans and Saints were owned by late billionaire Tom Benson.) Lauren Herington, the lead plaintiff in a recent class suit against the Milwaukee Bucks, which settled in 2017 for $250,000, believes that the issue of cheerleader underpayment spans far beyond the Bucks. Herington’s nightmarish experience working for the 2013 Bucks, as detailed in her contract, notes, and emails with her then-coach and trainer, included extreme diets, countless hours of mandatory exercise that left her with stress fractures, and anti-fraternization policies that included a ban on making eye contact with players. Though the Bucks settled with Herington, she does not believe the team made any amendments to their policies as a result of her suit. “I feel like [the Bucks] just thought it was a joke,” Herington told the Guardian. “They really didn’t have any respect for us. They didn’t have any regard to whether they paid us or whether they didn’t. They thought that they didn’t do anything wrong.” (The Bucks did not reply to a request for comment on their current policies.) “If I was standing before [NBA commissioner] Adam Silver, I would ask, ‘If this was your daughter, would you be happy that somebody is degrading her, or that she’s having to work four jobs, and not eat because she can’t afford it? It might seem like like, ‘OK, these are just other girls.’ How would how would you feel if that was your family?” In the case of the Buffalo Bills, Russell Brandon, the team’s then-CEO, repeatedly insisted while deposed that the team’s dancers, the Buffalo Jills were “inconsequential from a business standpoint to [him].” Though Brandon was one of two people on the Bills’ team responsible for drafting the agreement with Citadel, he insisted that the Jills meant so little to him that he hadn’t reviewed the portion of the contract pertaining to them before signing alongside Goodell. “If I spent one collective hour in 20 years thinking about the Buffalo Jills,” Brandon said, while under oath, “that would be about 58 minutes more than I have.” This month, Brandon was released from his position at the Buffalo Bills over alleged inappropriate relations with his female co-workers. Manoucher Pierre-Val, who was the lead plaintiff in the case against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which settled for $750,000 in 2015, was surprised to hear about Brandon’s statements. She cited a juniors camp, as an example of the way she and her team-mates brought in revenue for her own team, the Bucs. The camp was typical throughout the league, in which aspiring cheerleaders can train with the team’s dancers. Pierre-Val was not paid for the eight-hour days she worked as an instructor at the camp. “Those [aspiring dancers] pay $100, if not more each. If you have 300 people, that’s $30,000. I didn’t get a paycheck. So if it’s not benefitting them, I’m not sure who it’s benefitting.” Teams often make dancers feel worthless. “The girls I hear from, every single one of them, live in a world of fear,” Blackwell said. “They’re told ‘There’s a million girls who will do your job. You’re not special. You can be fired.’ That’s why no girls are speaking out. They’re terrified.” Pierre-Val believes that these sentiments kept her own squad members from negotiating a better rate. “I do think a lot of the cheerleaders don’t see themselves as assets to the team so much as, ‘I’ve been given a chance.’ In actuality, you are bringing money and other assets to the team. I think it’s the culture.” Both Pierre-Val and Herington reported that over the course of their suits, women who originally wanted to act as co-plaintiffs dropped out over fear of publicly addressing their grievances. After a notice was sent out to members of the class in the Jills’ case, one plaintiff testified that she felt pressured via texts and Facebook messages to opt out of the suit. Just as individual cheerleaders are led to believe firmly in their own irrelevance, so too, are dance teams threatened with the specter of annihilation. In an email to Bucks Dancers five weeks after the regular season ended, Herington’s then-coach reminded dancers that they were “still employees of the Milwaukee Bucks” and told them to show up to mandatory unpaid appearances because they had “no idea what changes the new owners would bring.” In Buffalo, the threat was followed up two weeks after the Jills plaintiffs filed their suit, when then-director Stephanie Mateczon indefinitely suspended the team. According to Herington, the same Facebook and Twitter trolls who argue that cheerleaders aren’t real athletes or should be done away with are “also the people paying $50 extra a ticket to have VIP passes to come hang out with us. The people who are paying for the calendars. The people who are there to take pictures with us. It’s all about the team experience. And if you’re going to get rid of us, then you better get rid of the popcorn stand or the alcohol.” Accusations of the uselessness of cheerleaders come at a time when the sport has recently attained provisional approval for inclusion in the Olympic games. In popular culture, dancers are increasingly recognized for their athletic merits. American Ballet Theatre’s principle dancer Misty Copeland is sponsored by Under Armour and the ballerina Dusty Button is endorsed by Red Bull. Cheerleading requires intensive exercise and mental acuity. NFL and NBA dancers perform for crowds of tens of thousands of people at a time. Professional dancers in unions, who perform for audiences of this size or smaller, bring home exponentially higher salaries than their cheerleading counterparts. Working as a Rockette, for example, earns dancers around $1,500 a week. It hardly seems sufficient for hands to be dusted off and “Mission Accomplished” banners to be raised over the settlements of suits that award dancers with what usually amounts to around $2,000 in back pay, and may compel some teams to cease their practice of violating basic labor and minimum wage laws. In order for cheerleaders to work in a safe environment, and to earn what truly amounts to fair pay, the women will have to organize. While Blackwell says she would be happy to help cheerleaders unionize, she does not foresee that happening in the near future, while the athletes remain in an insular, fear-based culture. For the time being, Blackwell is focusing her efforts on her individual cases against teams, as well as where she sees the solution: at the very top of the NFL. She believes that coming to an agreement about changes is necessary for the protection of her clients, but also for the NFL and its teams. In reference to the recent Washington cheerleaders story, Blackwell asked: “What happens if a girl got raped in that situation? And they were well aware of the situation? Of the risk? Because they are.” The NFL and the NBA did not initially reply to requests for comment for this story, but an NBA spokesperson issued the following statement to the Guardian after it was published: “Team dancers are valued members of the NBA family and, as for all employees, we work with our teams to ensure they’re provided safe, respectful and welcoming workplaces.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/17/west-ham-approach-newcastle-rafael-benitez-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T21:23:40Z","webTitle":"West Ham ready to approach Newcastle for Rafael Benítez","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/17/west-ham-approach-newcastle-rafael-benitez-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/17/west-ham-approach-newcastle-rafael-benitez-manager","fields":{"headline":"West Ham ready to approach Newcastle for Rafael Benítez","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"West Ham are ready to make a formal approach for Rafael Benítez and are giving serious consideration to triggering the £6m release clause in the Newcastle United manager’s contract. Benítez is the first choice to replace David Moyes but West Ham want to keep their options open and retain a strong interest in Manuel Pellegrini. While they have denied a report in Chile claiming that the former Manchester City coach is set to be unveiled in London, they want to speak to him. Newcastle’s manager, however, remains West Ham’s No 1 choice and there is increasing concern on Tyneside that Benítez will move if he receives a satisfactory offer. Although West Ham have misgivings about how much it will cost in compensation there is an increasing belief Benítez would represent value for money. Given he is in the final year of his Newcastle contract, lawyers may end up ensuring the release clause is less than £6m, his annual salary. West Ham have long admired Benítez and almost appointed him after parting company with Sam Allardyce three years ago, only for Real Madrid to step in. The two parties have remained on good terms and West Ham are hoping to capitalise on Benítez’s growing dissatisfaction at Newcastle, who have yet to commit to giving him more transfer backing. There will be complications to iron out before a deal can be agreed. West Ham are concerned there will be further compensation if Benítez ends his spell on Tyneside and have been told the Spaniard wants his contract to contain a large severance package. They would also have to convince him that he will receive funds to strengthen an unbalanced squad. It is understood that Moyes was dissatisfied with the money available for summer signings. West Ham have said they expected to appoint a manager within the next seven days. Benítez is well aware of the sometimes poisonous politics at West Ham but any semblance of trust in an always remote relationship with Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, has been eroded after a series of transfer-market promises were broken last summer. Ashley is desperate for Benítez to remain and extend his contract, not least because having the former Champions League-winning manager in place could help him in his ambition to sell Newcastle for as much as £400m. In order for him to stay put in the north-east, Benítez would need guarantees as to his transfer budget and proposed improvements to Newcastle’s training ground and academy. His desire to sign some experienced players over the age of 26 has long been a sticking point with Ashley, who prefers to recruit younger professionals with greater sell-on potential. Benítez and Ashley have not met for talks, with negotiations being conducted by phone and email between the former Liverpool manager’s representatives and Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s managing director. David Sullivan, the West Ham co-chairman, interviewed Paulo Fonseca at his Essex home on Monday but it has emerged the Portuguese has extended his contract with Shakhtar Donetsk. West Ham have also been offered a chance to speak to Claudio Ranieri. The Italian, who led Leicester City to the Premier League title in 2016, is available after being sacked by Nantes. West Ham will consider Ranieri if they cannot attract one of their favoured candidates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/metoo-and-the-woke-generation-didnt-happen-overnight","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T16:01:55Z","webTitle":"#MeToo and the ‘woke’ generation didn’t happen overnight | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/metoo-and-the-woke-generation-didnt-happen-overnight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/metoo-and-the-woke-generation-didnt-happen-overnight","fields":{"headline":"#MeToo and the ‘woke’ generation didn’t happen overnight","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Moira Donegan (#MeToo and the rift within feminism, The long read, 11 May) appears to believe that it is the current “woke” generation who first noticed that “meaningful liberation from misogyny will only be achieved collectively, with changes at the structural, cultural and institutional levels”. And yet it was exactly this understanding that fuelled the women’s liberation movement of the 1970s. There is nothing new about bitter ideological rifts between women who identify as feminists, and yes, some “famous western feminists” have promoted an individualist agenda, oblivious to race and class privilege. But lots of non-famous feminists, black and white, have argued and campaigned tirelessly for decades in exactly the spirit of solidarity that Donegan identifies as the hallmark of #MeToo. All the feminists I know of my age (60-plus) are cheering on the #MeToo movement: at last, the outrage that has fired us up for nearly 50 years has reached the mainstream. But cultural change on this scale does not happen overnight: it has taken two generations for the insights of the second wave of feminists – mostly dismissed at the time as the ravings of extremists – to become mainstream. It is second-wave feminists and their allies, striving away as campaigners, lawyers, lawmakers in parliament, trade unionists, journalists, academics, psychotherapists, writers, artists (you name it!) who have created a world where #MeToo eventually became inevitable. Above all, second-wave feminists, working as teachers in millions of classrooms and mothers in millions of homes, have raised a generation who take equality and diversity for granted and can’t imagine how anyone could ever have accepted anything less. Yes, there is still rampant sexism and racism, and many other injustices, at large in our society. And there will always be counter-revolutionaries in any revolution. A luta continua! Lucy Whitman London • It was odd for a British reader of Moira Donegan’s article not to see any mention of the impact of the book Everyday Sexism by Laura Bates on the current wave of feminism. The book, and the blog that started it, gathered together the different male prejudices to provide absolute proof of their existence, in a way that had never been done before. It made a huge impact on feminists of all ages and types in the UK; yet it seems as though US feminists such as Moira Donegan have never heard of it. Can this be true? They only seem to have #Me Too, which, as a loose alliance, is already under attack. Everyday Sexism is a fact-finding feminist project that must be maintained, and Laura Bates deserves a knighthood (er, ladyhood? Damehood?).

But it’s been painful","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Over the past month I’ve tried my best not to use Google. I deleted my Facebook account. I’ve gone through all my phone and iPad apps, closing down the “permissions” that give them access to my calendar, camera, contacts and location. And I’ve switched to DuckDuckGo as my (home) web browser. Like millions of others I was astounded not just by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, but the industrial-scale data harvesting by Google revealed in that extraordinary article by Dylan Curran in the Guardian. After reading it, I picked a random day in 2014 to find out what Google had on me – and was astonished at the intensity of location tracking and snooping on all my movements. But my trial separation has been tough. I’ve (almost) completely finished with Facebook. But living without Google has been far harder. My partner calls me “iPaddy” for the amount of time I spend on the bloody thing – mostly reading and checking news sites. But a good thing about the iPad is that in “settings” it’s simple to switch out of Google and into DuckDuckGo as your default browser. DuckDuckGo, if you don’t know, is the search engine that promises not to intrude. “It’s sort of creepy that people at search engines can see all this info about you,” it says. Unlike Google, it doesn’t attempt to track you. It doesn’t store IP addresses or personalise your search results according to what past data it has built up on you. But does it work? There is nothing I’ve not been able to find while using it although, as I haven’t put every search request into Google and DuckDuckGo at the same time, it’s not an entirely scientific comparison. Results are displayed and ranked in a similar fashion to Google. There are ads, but you can go into settings and turn them off. The biggest drawback was mapping – DuckDuckGo puts you through to Apple’s service – although images aren’t great, either. Until you are off Google, you don’t realise what a beautiful thing its mapping features are. And my determination not to give away my location means I’m now assailed by pop-up boxes once I click on a site. Last Sunday I searched for films at my local Omniplex cinema. Google would probably know where I was, and send me to the page with listings appropriate to my local area. Now I have to click into the general cinema site, click past the location pop-up request, then manually select which cinema is my local. But these are small gripes and I’m very happy to continue with DuckDuckGo on my iPad. Changing ad settings has been enlightening. We’re warned that if we turn off personalised ads, we get a weirdly untailored experience. You do – but so what? Cutting free from Google on a smartphone is another matter. If, like me, you have a company paid-for Android-based phone linked to Gmail, you can hardly hide from Google. But I’m not prevented from turning off location services, and since my phone is the main way it tracks me, it's a small triumph. I was never a Facebook fan, so deleting it was entirely painless. But it doesn’t let you go without a fight. It said it would hold the door open for me to return, and not delete all my data, should I come back within a short while. It worked. A week later I came back on, as I needed to contact a Facebook group for work. But that has been the sum total of my Facebook life since. But then there’s WhatsApp, which has become the key way our wider family connects. It is, of course, owned by Facebook. Some companies you can’t escape from. p.collinson@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/may/17/its-brex-benedict-but-can-cumberbatch-make-vote-leave-sexy","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T15:37:45Z","webTitle":"It’s Brex Benedict – but can Cumberbatch make Vote Leave sexy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/may/17/its-brex-benedict-but-can-cumberbatch-make-vote-leave-sexy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/may/17/its-brex-benedict-but-can-cumberbatch-make-vote-leave-sexy","fields":{"headline":"It’s Brex Benedict – but can Cumberbatch make Vote Leave sexy?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Should you ever decide to compile a list of everything the world needs, in the order it needs it, you would do best to start from the bottom and work your way up. Because everyone already knows what the world needs least – the thing that’s even less essential than a magma bidet or a rotating statue of Piers Morgan. That’s right: what the world needs least is a two-hour television drama about Brexit. What a hideous idea that would be. Two hours of your life, taken up with a recap of the thing that has already stolen two years of it. Imagine anyone getting excited about a Brexit television drama in 2018. Imagine anyone reacting to this news with anything other than a queasy thud, or a gnawing outbreak of nit-nurse waiting-room dread. Brexit is the enemy of good television, being simultaneously boring, awful and so comprehensively picked over that everybody already knows every horrible speck of every horrible detail off by heart by now. And yet here we are. It was reported this week that Benedict Cumberbatch is set to play Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings in a Channel 4 docudrama that currently has the working title Brexit. Now, even if you self-identify as something of a Cumberbitch – or the male counterpart, a Cumberbastard – there’s a strong chance this news will leave you colossally unaroused. The thrill of Cumberbatch is watching him condense a full decade of capital-A acting into a single episode, as he does so well in Sherlock and Patrick Melrose. Unless Cummings decided to implement his new Voter Intention Collection System software while injecting his eyes with heroin during a motorcycle backflip over a burning bus, we’re unlikely to see that here. And he probably didn’t. Cummings is not a rock star. Ultimately, the man is a number-cruncher, someone who derives joy from writing long blogposts about the benefits of integrating physicist-dominated data science in decision-making processes. And, with the best will in the world, that isn’t the stuff of great drama. It’s the stuff of 20,000-word long reads that you begin to drift away from after three paragraphs. Historically, the world doesn’t like it when Cumberbatch plays uncharismatic real-life figures who use technology to sway the court of public opinion. You may remember his turn as Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate, a film that was partly set in the Guardian’s offices and at last count has been watched by fewer people than work here. And, make no mistake, Cummings is no Assange. He has never enjoyed cosy tete-a-tetes with Pamela Anderson or put a little blue diamond on his Twitter bio to fool people into thinking his account was verified. He rubberstamped a lie on a bus. That’s his one big selling point. Worse still for Cumberbatch’s Brexit, there’s a far more suitable Brexit dramatisation in the works. Last August, it was reported that Arron Banks’ book The Bad Boys of Brexit was set to be turned into a TV series. That is immediately a much more appealing prospect, in that it sounds like the sort of low-budget, straight-to-DVD, self-unaware Britflick that comes wrapped in a Brannan-filtered cover and is primarily composed of footage of Danny Dyer furiously bawling “I’M DOING ME NUT!” into a Wetherspoon’s toilet mirror. At least The Bad Boys of Brexit sounds pleasingly gormless. At least there will definitely be a shot of Nigel Farage wearing Aviators, drinking room-temperature beer and doing finger-guns in slow motion while The One and Only by Chesney Hawkes blares in the background. The Bad Boys of Brexit is a series about winners based on a book written by a winner, so it is guaranteed to be a solid-gold work of genuine knuckleheadedness. It might as well star Steven Seagal. The same cannot be said for Cumberbatch’s Brexit. It sounds – and this should be enough to send a chill down the full length of your spine – accurate. It sounds just as morosely bone-dry as Brexit itself, like the sort of thing that will grind everyone down into a loose pulp of kill-me-now apathy, regardless of how they voted. True, it could be livened up with some stunt-casting – Mark Wahlberg as Michael Gove, maybe, or Nicolas Cage at his boggliest as George Osborne – but even that won’t be enough to save it. In fact, 2018 probably isn’t the time to make a Brexit drama at all. Christopher Nolan didn’t make Dunkirk before the siege of Dunkirk was over. Chances are that a fictionalised account of a death-filled military retreat would have been seen as distasteful had it been released slap-bang in the middle of the real-life death-filled military retreat itself. And so it is with Brexit. Nobody wants to watch a docudrama about Brexit now. They want to watch it 50 years from now, in the comfort of the caves they have had to dig out of mud to escape the irradiated poison cloud that will cover most of the country as a direct result of us leaving the European Union. That’s when Cumberbatch should unveil his Brexit masterpiece to the world, not now while we’re all still drowning in it. Keeping up with the Kardashian endorsements Call me paranoid, but I’m starting to suspect that Kim Kardashian might not be the entirely virtuous role model I thought she was. There was something about her Instagram post this week – the one where she was paid to endorse an appetite-suppressing lollipop to her 111 million followers, using the hashtag #suckit – that briefly made me wonder if she was effectively promoting an eating disorder to an audience largely made up of impressionable young females. But Kardashian would never exploit her fans like that. Sure, last year she tweeted an advert for a brand of “weight-loss tea” and in January, she Instagrammed another advert for a meal-replacement milkshake in the guise of an underwear photo. And in 2014, she used Instagram to promote a waist trainer, which is basically the thing that Chinese child gymnasts use to bind their feet, but for your tummy. And, sure, she once appeared in an advert for QuickTrim diet pills, and was subsequently sued for $5m (£3.7m) by customers convinced that the pills didn’t work. And, true, seven years ago, she appeared in another advert, this time for shoes that claimed to do the same work as a personal trainer, and the advert was deemed to be so misleading that the shoe company had to pay $40m in customer refunds . And, fine, in 2015 she was paid to use Instagram to advertise a morning sickness pill, but was lambasted by the FDA for omitting risk information on her initial post, leading her to subsequently post a 311-word caption full of nothing but dire medical warnings. And I suppose there was also the Kardashian Kard, Kim’s short-lived 2010 venture into the world of pre-paid debit cards, which ran into trouble when it was revealed the cards cost nearly $100 to buy, $7.95 a month to maintain and $1 any time you wanted to add funds to it. That last charge was called “pernicious and predatory” by Connecticut’s attorney general, but he was probably just jealous of Kim’s hourglass figure. Listen, who can blame her? Everyone has to make a living, whether it’s by sweeping floors or getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to promote dangerous or useless products to millions of people stupid enough to watch your awful reality programme. We’re all the same, deep down. And that’s why I vow to buy the next thing that Kardashian is paid to promote on Instagram, whether it’s leeches or colon cleanser or just a big bucket with the word “Bulimia” written across it in Swarovski crystals. Which, in fairness, it probably will be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/may/19/cannes-film-festival-2018-search-for-meaning-on-the-croisette","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T09:00:24Z","webTitle":"Cannes 2018: A search for meaning on the Croisette","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/19/cannes-film-festival-2018-search-for-meaning-on-the-croisette","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/19/cannes-film-festival-2018-search-for-meaning-on-the-croisette","fields":{"headline":"Cannes 2018: A search for meaning on the Croisette","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At the closing stages of this year’s Cannes film festival the guests gather to watch Under the Silver Lake, a shaggy-dog tale that sends Andrew Garfield reeling across an LA suburb in thrall to cults and comic books and movie-star memorabilia. He has some urgent questions relating to a missing girl, the subliminal messages on his records, and some parrot-related mystery the exact details of which I’ve already forgotten. “But what does it all mean?” he wails at one point, and the line sends ripples of laughter through the cinema. Ostensibly the audience is laughing at Under the Silver Lake (David Robert Mitchell’s follow-up to his excellent It Follows), which finally doesn’t amount to a hill of beans. But they’re also giggling at themselves and at the great, pressing question suddenly bellowed down from the screen. What does it all mean? Cannes grows weird during these dying days. The films turn confusing and the punters start flagging, and the boundaries between art and life have a tendency to break down. Every other old man on the street looks like Francis Ford Coppola, and the soldiers with assault rifles might possibly be actors in a publicity stunt. The programme is no help; it keeps messing with our heads. In one 36-hour spell it lays on screenings of a film called The Angel, a film called Angel Face and a third called Sorry Angel. If we catch the wrong one, will we even notice? What a curious, fascinating festival this has been – a stumbling first step on the road to redemption – away from the old guard, belatedly into the new century. Gallons of fresh blood have been poured into competition, while the organisers are at least recognising that they need more women in the lineup. So the direction of travel has largely been decided. It remains to be seen how far and how fast we can move. What does it all mean? Don’t ask Jean-Luc Godard, the chain-rattling ghost from Cannes days gone by. Appearing at a press conference via FaceTime, he was asked about his decision to include a clip from Michael Bay’s 13 Hours inside The Image Book, his predictably perplexing latest film. Godard, it seemed, was at a loss. Not only was he unaware of the clip’s inclusion, he claimed to have never even heard of Michael Bay. What does it all mean? Surely the films have the answer, although some of this year’s crop were found wanting. Hopes were high for Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman (about an African American cop who joins the KKK), but it’s an underpowered, complacent affair that only explodes into life with its closing footage from 2017’s Charlottesville protests. Elsewhere, Ash Is Purest White was a gorgeous state-of-modern-China romance with too much fat on its bones, while Eva Husson’s Girls of the Sun (about a female Kurdish combat unit) split the audience down the middle. Personally, I found it heavy-handed and cheesy. The fact that a woman can make a big, crude, Hollywood-style war movie might be progress of sorts, but Kathryn Bigelow has trodden similar terrain to better effect and, anyway, it isn’t in and of itself radical. What does it all mean? Never ask Lars von Trier; the man can’t be trusted. Ejected from Cannes back in 2011, the one-time enfant terrible returned to serve the festival with its one bona fide shock film. The House That Jack Built stars Matt Dillon as a clench-jawed psychopath (and would-be architect) who claims to have murdered upwards of 60 people. Its gleeful bloody violence provoked mass walkouts. Those who remained found themselves dragged through hell. “Jesus Christ!” yelled the man in the seat behind mine. But not even the messiah could save us from Lars. There were no British titles in competition and so we clambered upstairs to catch sight of Whitney, Kevin Macdonald’s devastating portrait of the pop superstar, apparently beloved by Nelson Mandela and Saddam Hussein alike. Watching Whitney Houston’s decline was like witnessing a slow-motion car crash. The driver swings heedlessly into traffic and is hit again and again until everything’s been knocked loose and scattered. Except that Macdonald brilliantly manages to trace the root of Houston’s problems to her Baptist childhood, uncovering a long-buried tale of familial abuse. One comes away with the sense that the woman might have been doomed from the outset. Outside the Palais is where Cannes almost meets the real world. The red carpet hosts a protest by 82 women calling for more female representation in film; another by 16 BME actors highlighting institutionalised racism within the French film industry. Yet both protests play out behind steel cordons, with the crowds kept at a distance. Security has been tightened and tension runs high. Not long ago this place was a free-for-all. There were street vendors and rookie film-makers screening their product inside a van. Representatives from the Troma movie studio would march past, invariably dressed up as zombies and screaming into loudhailers. These days the main drag is largely out of bounds, given over to police bikes and sleek black limousines. The new, improved Cannes would benefit from some zombies. Best in show at this year’s festival? Happily there are a number of titles to choose between and the closing stretch saw the arrival of some tardy instant classics. Keep an eye out for The Wild Pear Tree, a windblown bildungsroman from the Turkish film-maker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, in which an arrogant graduate shuttles between a series of mentors and muses, and Lee Chang-dong’s Burning, which spins a Murakami short story into a simmering thriller spotlighting South Korea’s underclass. I also adored Shoplifters, which follows the fortunes of a makeshift family of rogues before bowing out with a heartpiercing finale. Few directors seed their stories with as much subtlety and grace as Japan’s Hirokazu Kore-eda. His films initially look rather bare and spindly, only to burst into flower like late cherry blossoms. Other pictures screen early and then cling to you for days. It’s now a week since I caught Cold War and I still can’t shake it off. Paweł Pawlikowski’s postwar love story is strung between the eastern bloc and the west, hotwired to the sounds of Polish folk music and seductive American jazz. Cold War isn’t cold; it’s positively burning with passion and its lead player, Joanna Kulig, is a star in the making. And then there’s Happy As Lazzaro, Alice Rohrwacher’s time-bending rustic fable; roughage for the soul that comes sugared with magic realism. This plays out in a crumbling village mired in a semi-rural past before a sudden reveal pulls the stage-flats away and sends us off in a completely different direction. It might not be the greatest film in the lineup, but its rich humanism seems to speak to the moment – the right film for right now. Maybe that’s enough. In the middle of the week the Cannes heavens open. There are violent cloudbursts across town and forked lightning out over the Med. Then, when the rain has abated, comes more rolling thunder as wheelie-cases are dragged down through town to the bus-stop. One by one, the festival’s guests have begun packing up and shipping out. In the dog days of this festival, there is no sound more melancholic than the rumble of plastic wheels on tarmac. It means that the circus is closing and it’s time to go home. Cannes 2018 – the best and worst Cannes controversy Gaspar Noé played up the coast with his nightmarish Climax and won the best reviews of his career. Lars von Trier played inside the Palais with The House That Jack Built and came away with his worst. Lars wins by a mile. Hollywood hits and misses Ramin Bahrani’s Fahrenheit 451 proved idiotic and heavy; Ron Howard’s Star Wars prequel, Solo (below), was light, noisy and zippy. So we’re voting with the Wookie. Inappropriate musical cues Bad enough that a gathering of 82 female protesters on the Palais steps is accompanied by Roy Orbison’s Pretty Woman. Still worse when fearsome Cate Blanchett is ushered on to the strains of Just Like a Woman... “but she breaks just like a little girl”. Yeah, right she does. Films in the market We’re obviously intrigued by A Dysfunctional Cat and Help, I Shrunk My Parents. But our Marche Palme d’Or goes to the gloriously titled Snake Outta Compton. Quote of the festival “Keep away from the pool, the fucking pump’s gone insane!”: yelled from the garden at Lars von Trier’s rented villa on the far edge of Cannes.

But they were found with digital technology and are now published. The dead girl who wanted to be a journalist had one more unwilling, posthumous scoop. “Anne Frank’s secret diary entries reveal more thoughts on sex and prostitution,” said Newsweek. I am squeamish about Anne Frank’s diary. I prefer to read Holocaust memoirs by adults who knew the ending to their stories: Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel. Frank didn’t write for publication – in fact the idea of it disgusted her – and I do not want to know the ending to her story if she didn’t. That is not enlightenment, or empathy. That is frisson, and sentimentality. Writers use, and summon, pain for their art. That is normal. But Frank had no such agency. Her pain was inflicted on her and, whatever apologists might say, her voice was heard against her will. Young enough to move us but too young – or too dead? – to choose for herself? Where does that leave her? I can forgive her father, Otto Frank, who lost his whole family and published the diary, but no one else. But it is out now, and defended, in cold, banal, dehumanising language by the trio of institutions that made the discovery. They acknowledge that Frank’s musings about sex are, by themselves, worthless – how could they not be? – by invoking the development of the writer she would never grow up to become, and comparing her to Rembrandt, and Franz Kafka. “It’s not always good to follow the wish of an author,” said a spokeswoman. “It’s important sometimes for scientific research and also good to know for the public what she didn’t want to publish.” There is nothing “good” about this story, I don’t care about the public here, and if we are really talking about “scientific research” – that is, if the diary is now more important than the child who wrote it – then what was it ever published for? But it is done, and so the least we can do for Anne Frank is to ask: is it meaningless? Does her diary have anything to teach us? It is easiest to say that it could have done, but it hasn’t. Like the little girl in the red coat in the film of Schindler’s List who was not a character but a signpost, if you need to see a face, or read a diary, to learn humanity you are probably unteachable. Look around: African-Americans fear for their lives doing ordinary things. Islamophobia is called a myth. Holocaust Memorial Day is marked each year by a grumble that the Jews take all the victimhood for themselves, in order to more effectively murder others. Anti-racist education has failed, and those who practise it are in despair. One educator I know well feels her life’s work has been for nothing because, when economics intrudes we revert, always, to the old and familiar furies. Dehumanisation of the other is the essential component of genocide and it is endemic even among the fortunate, fuelled by new ways of communicating, which are actually the opposite: “snowflake”, “zio”, and now “gammon”, an anti-white slur used by people who call themselves progressive but in this instance aren’t. In this babble, we are supposed to hear the clear, innocent voice of the child from her attic, and understand our evil and repent. But there was no such happy epilogue. If the diary was taken, and used, to demonstrate humanity, it has, in every sense, failed. • Tanya Gold is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/may/09/world-weatherwatch-dust-storms-in-india-driven-by-downbursts","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T20:30:53Z","webTitle":"World weatherwatch: dust storms in India driven by downbursts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/09/world-weatherwatch-dust-storms-in-india-driven-by-downbursts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/09/world-weatherwatch-dust-storms-in-india-driven-by-downbursts","fields":{"headline":"World weatherwatch: dust storms in India driven by downbursts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An intense dust storm swept across north India last week, owing to a surplus of moisture over the Bay of Bengal in the east colliding with destructive winds carrying dust from the west. India is no stranger to dust storms but this one was made worse by the exceptionally strong winds, known as downbursts, which developed within a cluster of thunderstorms. This occurred as falling precipitation evaporated before it reached the ground and subsequently cooled the surrounding air. This cooler air then blew radially and intensely towards the ground, produced powerful straight-line winds, and kicked large amounts of dust up from the surface, with speeds of more than 75mph recorded. Pakistan has been sweltering in record-breaking heat recently as temperatures reportedly hit 50.2C (122.4F) on 30 April, narrowly beating the previous year’s record of 50C (122F) – the highest temperature ever recorded across the continent. A “heat dome”, or area of high pressure, enveloped the country and prevented the hot air from escaping as it continued to cyclically warm at the surface. Record-breaking rains also lashed the Italian island of Sardinia, as more than 160mm (6.3in) of rainfall occurred within two days last week. That was more than four times the average monthly rainfall for May, and rivers broke their banks, triggering severe floods and landslides."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/07/labour-mps-revive-campaign-for-progressive-alliance","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T16:18:04Z","webTitle":"Labour MPs revive party campaign for progressive alliance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/07/labour-mps-revive-campaign-for-progressive-alliance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/07/labour-mps-revive-campaign-for-progressive-alliance","fields":{"headline":"Labour MPs revive party campaign for progressive alliance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"MPs from different wings of Labour have reopened the debate on a progressive alliance within the party. Clive Lewis and Jon Cruddas have co-signed a letter in the Guardian calling for the reinstatement of three party members who were summarily expelled for supporting a National Health Action party candidate in Jeremy Hunt’s constituency at the last election. Nearly 30 other party members have backed the call. Lewis is a frontbench Treasury spokesman on the left of the party, and Cruddas, a former aide to Tony Blair, has been a leading thinker in the party for most of the past decade. Neal Lawson, who chairs the pressure group Compass, which campaigns for a progressive alliance, argues that cooperation with other progressive parties at last Thursday’s local elections could have tipped the balance in close-fought councils. In the south London borough of Wandsworth, Labour came within a handful of votes of toppling the Conservatives. The Tories lost eight councillors, leaving Labour just seven seats away from what could have been a defining result for the party. Campaigners also point to the Liberal Democrats’ victory in Richmond, where, with the Greens, they gained a total of 28 seats to win the council back for the first time since 2006. In their letter, Cruddas and Lewis argue that a progressive alliance could have delivered as many as 60 seats for Labour at last year’s general election. That would have given Jeremy Corbyn a working majority in the Commons. But Labour has long rejected all local arrangements with other parties. The three members in Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency who were expelled last year – Steve Williams, Kate Townsend and Robert Park – were not alone. In Hastings, a Labour party member, Nicholas Wilson, who campaigned against Amber Rudd on an anti-corruption ticket, was also expelled. He won more votes than Labour needed to unseat the former home secretary, who had a majority of 346. Lawson said: “Politics in Britain is in a stalemate. Labour must give local parties the ability to negotiate progressive alliances as the best way to break the stalemate; it worked in 2017 and again in the local elections last week.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/blind-date-rory-emma-embarrassing-tattoos","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Blind date: ‘I wish I hadn’t brought up my embarrassing tattoos’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/blind-date-rory-emma-embarrassing-tattoos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/blind-date-rory-emma-embarrassing-tattoos","fields":{"headline":"Blind date: ‘I wish I hadn’t brought up my embarrassing tattoos’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rory on Emma What were you hoping for?

A few metres away, through the door to the left, Ernesto Valverde took a seat and came straight out with it. “Decaffeinated,” he said dead pan, the hint of a smirk of his face. There was a bit of a laugh then too. Everyone knew what they meant, the irony not lost on anyone, Valverde’s first word, the word of the week, sent right back at them. Outside, the confetti had settled all around the Camp Nou, billions of bits of colour everywhere, and it was quiet now, midnight approaching and 97,797 people heading home, but still their minds raced and their hearts too, trying to make sense of it all, picking their way through what they’d just seen. “Bloody hell, what a clásico!” Barcelona’s manager said. Well, quite. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Decaffeinated was the word, but it was wrong. All week, it had been repeated endlessly: Barcelona were champions and double winners already while Real Madrid were preparing for the European Cup final, happy just for no one to get hurt. There was nothing to play for, or so they said, but there was: for Barcelona, history called, the chance to complete a first unbeaten season for 86 years – and back when Madrid did it in 1932 and Athletic Club did it in 1930, there were only 18 games, so you could pretty much call it the first ever. With four matches left, it felt like only Madrid could deny them and they would do all they could. Besides, football tends to find a way, a momentum all of its own, and in a clásico there’s always something to play for. So, they played – the way they so often do in this game, the match that always seems to deliver, even when it’s not supposed to. Set up to be “as exciting as a hospital dinner,” as David Gistau wrote, instead it was very, very tasty. Decaffeinated? Aye, right. “There was plenty of caffeine,” Valverde said. “Caffeine? It was pure taurine,” wrote Marca. They called it “war”; and “in war there is no peace,” insisted Manuel Jabois in El País, likening it to “fishing with dynamite”. It was explosive, all right. There were 28 shots, chances at one end then the other, seven yellow cards given and a penalty not given, maybe two. A red card, a goal disallowed, controversy and confrontations everywhere. Sergio Ramos and Luis Suárez, Luka Modric and Jordi Alba, Sergi Roberto and Marcelo. Messi went in on Ramos, the world upside down. There was an argument in the tunnel as they headed off at half-time, Barcelona having just been reduced to 10 men and Messi recriminating the referee, and another one as they headed back out again at the end of it, Nacho shaking his head and muttering “unbelievable” at Gerard Piqué. Which was one word for a night that ended with the players embracing, spent but smiling, the final score 2-2. There were four goals, all of them superb– one each for Suárez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Leo Messi and Gareth Bale – and enough to keep everyone going for weeks, AS suggesting that it bordered on the days of Mourinho v Guardiola. Not least when it came to the thing some of them love best of all: the referee. “It’s a good job there’s no VAR or we’d still be out there,” Valverde joked. In the first half Alejandro Hernández Hernández ruled out a goal from Suárez for offside and sent off Roberto for hitting out at Marcelo; in the second he didn’t give a penalty when Marcelo was fouled by Jordi Alba and didn’t blow when Suárez left Raphael Varane on the floor, hooking his ankle as he passed to make the second goal, later admitting: “It was a bit of a foul.” Above all, it was a bit good. “A mad house”, Marca said. “Mucho clásico, not much of a referee,” AS insisted. “Surrealism takes the clásico,” declared El Mundo. “Colossal,” El País’s headline called it, capturing it best. Because for all the controversy there was football too; the clásico it lived up to its usual billing again, if not the billing it had been given in the week before. The speed of it, the skill, the quality. The commitment, too. Yes, it was edgy at times, and there were complaints too, but there was also a dignity in the way they competed, as if everything was at stake, not nothing. “It was a great game, with no one worrying about whether there was nothing to play for. Everyone who likes football should be happy, and the football is the most important thing – more than all the controversy some want,” Zidane insisted. The match that “didn’t matter” was tense, open, exhilarating, Ronaldo growing ever more nervous on the bench, players falling and hearts racing, Barcelona withstanding all the way to the finish when Nelson Semedo dived to head clear, safe at last. The players embraced, and Madrid made way. Confetti shot into the air and the Barcelona squad did a lap of honour. Some headed back to the dressing room but they were soon back out for more. The stadium almost empty now, Piqué took the mic. “Seeing as we didn’t get a guard of honour [from Real Madrid], the staff should give us one,” he said, so Barcelona’s coaches lined up and clapped off the double winners, still unbeaten, that record within their grasp. “You only have to look at history to see how hard that is to do; there are only two teams that have ever done it [in Spain],” Valverde said. “And we’re the only team still unbeaten in Europe.” They might even have won, breaking away to make chances – the “Alamo” in the words of Santi Giménez. Rakitic ran and ran and then when he had finished he ran some more, Semedo shot up the right, and Messi multiplied, Zidane admitting that Madrid had played better against 11 than 10. But a draw would do, the record still alive. “At this point, it would have hurt to have lost that record to anyone,” Valverde admitted. It would have hurt even more to lose it to Madrid. With 10 men, Barcelona resisted, and “to resist is to win,” ran the headline on the front of Sport, missing the opportunity to accurately apply Juan Negrín’s famous – and ultimately flawed – war-time slogan. “Heroic and undefeated,” read the cover of Sport. The end is in sight now. For Andrés Iniesta, especially – and he wanted to hold on to it for as long as he could. Withdrawn after an hour, this was his final meeting with Madrid. “You think it never ends but it’s ending now. These are different games; there’s nothing like a clásico and I tried to enjoy it from the first minute. I’ll take it all with me,” he said, a little sadly, standing there in the tunnel, where Zidane stood and waited quietly in the shadows to embrace him. Talking points • I’ve looked at the players’ eyes and at their bollocks, which are red and white,” Joaquín Caparrós said. Which kind of suggests that they might be better seeing a doctor than a new manager, but at least Sevilla won at last. A questionable penalty, scored by Éver Banega, puts them back in contention for the final European place. Thirteen years after he was last in charge at the Sánchez Pizjuán, it was like Caparrós had never been away, leaping and bounding on the touchline, furiously chewing gum, seeking every advantage, however small and however sneaky, the fans chanting his name. “This place is the hostia [the dog’s bollocks],” he said afterwards. • “Yes, we can!”, sang the Celta fans, precisely because they knew that already-relegated Deportivo can’t – not any more. It was derby day in Galicia and time for them to wind up their rivals, oléing passes, pleading for Depor’s next derby next season to be against their B team and campaigning for Depor striker Lucas Pérez to make it to the Spain squad. Which he won’t, of course, but he did at least get a little revenge with the equaliser. • Something strange happened this weekend: Betis lost, and let in two. Not that it will stop them making it to Europe – although it did confirm that Valencia will be in the Champions League, despite them losing to Villarreal. A superb game at San Mamés, marked by the presentation of the One Club Man award to Carles Puyol and four shots that hit the bar, a couple of them threatening to break it, ended with a 2-0 win for Athletic that carried a hint of what might have been. “This could be a great team,” coach Cuco Ziganda said.

If so, examine your prejudices","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"#hotpersoninawheelchair may sound like a niche side-effect of Britain’s sweltering weather, but it is actually a campaign fighting disablism on Twitter. YouTube star and wheelchair user Annie Segarra started the hashtag after seeing a four-year-old tweet from author Ken Jennings that said: “Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair.” Segarra responded with the hashtag, adding: “Cry about it, babe,” and including a photo of herself in knee-high socks and red lipstick. Other Twitter users with disabilities promptly shared their own photos, including Australian para-athlete Robyn Lambird. Jennings’ remark embodies a stubbornly negative cultural attitude towards disability – one that too often equates wheelchairs as prisons and disabled people as abnormal, ugly and sexless. Expressing pity that a hot person is using a wheelchair achieves two insulting feats: it suggests that being disabled somehow ruins an otherwise attractive person while perpetuating the idea people with disabilities exist, not as fully formed humans, but as objects to please the non-disabled public. The “nothing sadder” is even more patronising, simultaneously offering (unwanted) pity for the disabled person while expressing a sense the non-disabled person has somehow been inconvenienced in all this. “I’m so sorry my disability ruined your ability to find me attractive!” is the apology that never was. Segarra’s hashtag is gender neutral, but there’s a clear sexist element. In his original tweet, Jennings, best known in the US for winning the classic TV gameshow Jeopardy! 74 times in a row, embodied an attitude particularly imposed on disabled women, whether that is the “gentlemen” gallantly informing us they would “date you anyway” or strangers asking disabled women on dating sites if they are able to have sex. The latest hashtag is not the first to poke fun at the idea disabled people aren’t attractive, with #babewithamobilityaid and #disabledandcute showcasing positive humour and gorgeous photography, including YouTuber Annika Victoria living out her “Mario Kart dreams”. Others tackle disability generally. When one Twitter user stated that disabled parking should only be valid between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday – “because I cannot see why people with genuine disabilities would be out beyond these times” – it went viral. “We’re disabled, not werewolves,” replied one disabled woman. Perhaps the most telling thing is how some young women using the #hotpersoninawheelchair hashtag admitted they almost couldn’t join in: they had few photos to choose from that showed their wheelchair because they had for so long felt self-conscious about using one. Jennings’ old tweet is an ill thought out, offensive comment that should swiftly be ignored. But the response to it – largely young, disabled women proudly showcasing their bodies, style and lives for their own enjoyment – is worth all our attention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/07/ermanno-olmi-palme-dor-winner-for-tree-of-wooden-clogs-dies-aged-86","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T13:04:42Z","webTitle":"Ermanno Olmi, Palme d'Or winner for Tree of Wooden Clogs, dies aged 86","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/07/ermanno-olmi-palme-dor-winner-for-tree-of-wooden-clogs-dies-aged-86","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/07/ermanno-olmi-palme-dor-winner-for-tree-of-wooden-clogs-dies-aged-86","fields":{"headline":"Ermanno Olmi, Palme d'Or winner for Tree of Wooden Clogs, dies aged 86","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ermanno Olmi, the Italian director who won both the Cannes Palme d’Or and the Venice Golden Lion, has died aged 86. Italy’s ministry of culture announced the news, describing the director as “a giant, a great master of Italian cinema” and that his death was a “great loss to Italian culture”. Olmi died in hospital in Asiago, near Vincenza; no cause of death has been confirmed but Olmi had been ill for some time. Italy’s culture minister Dario Franceschini said Olmi was “a deep-thinking intellectual who explored the human mystery, and described, with the poetry that characterised his work, the connection between man and nature, the dignity of labour, and its spirituality”. Olmi’s best known films were both major award-winners. In 1978 The Tree of Wooden Clogs won the top award at Cannes: a quasi-documentary study of 19th-century peasant life in the Lombardy region of northern Italy (where Olmi was born and brought up). It was acclaimed as the last great work of Italian neo-realism, and praised by fellow film-makers such as Mike Leigh, who described it as “an incredibly human film, such a fundamental film in terms of what we’re looking at, the whole span of human experience”. On its recent re-release in the UK, Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw called it “a dark, slow and mysterious masterpiece”. A decade later, in 1988, his adaptation of Joseph Roth’s novella The Legend of the Holy Drinker, starring Rutger Hauer as a homeless alcoholic whose life changes when a stranger offers him a loan of money, went on to win the top prize at Venice as well as best film at the David di Donatello awards, Italy’s version of the Oscars. Olmi was given a lifetime achievement Honorary Golden Lion at the 2008 Venice film festival. Born in Bergamo in 1931, Olmi made his first film in 1959, Time Stood Still, a study of the growing friendship between a man and a teenage boy cut off by a snowdrift on a construction site in the Italian Alps. In what became a lifelong commitment to absolute realism, Olmi used non-actors in the lead roles. Il Posto (1961), starred Loredana Detto and Sandro Panseri as teenagers taking menial jobs in a big corporation: the film made a major impact at Venice and Olmi and Detto married in 1963. Olmi also made a string of films exploring religious themes, including And There Came a Man in 1965, about Pope John XXIII, the 1985 TV movie The Seven Last Words of Our Redeemer on the Cross, and in 1994 Genesis: The Creation and the Flood. Olmi is survived by Detto and their three children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/07/juventus-serie-a-title-nearly-won-but-fight-elsewhere-is-hotting-up","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T11:13:32Z","webTitle":"Juventus have Serie A (nearly) in the bag but the fight elsewhere is just hotting up | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/07/juventus-serie-a-title-nearly-won-but-fight-elsewhere-is-hotting-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/07/juventus-serie-a-title-nearly-won-but-fight-elsewhere-is-hotting-up","fields":{"headline":"Juventus have the title (nearly) won but the fight elsewhere is hotting up","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For the seventh season running, Juventus will be champions of Italy. The Scudetto is not officially theirs just yet, but we are into the realm of technicalities. A 3-1 win over Bologna, accompanied by a draw for Napoli, extended their lead to six points with two games left to play. The first tie-breaker, head-to-head results, would be split with the Partenopei, since each beat the other 1-0 away from home. Next is goal difference, where Juventus are ahead by 16. Realistically, it will not come to that anyway. The Bianconeri’s final game of the season is at home to relegated Verona. They might cross the line even sooner. A draw with Roma at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday would seal the deal. Coincidentally, that same result would suffice to secure Champions League football for the Giallorossi. Talk of a mutually beneficial ‘biscotto’ is inevitable, though perhaps presumptuous. Roma could hardly thrill to the idea of the Old Lady starting the party in their back yard. In any case, there will be time to reflect on Juventus’s achievements once they become official. There is also the small matter of a Coppa Italia final against Milan to attend to on Wednesday. Massimiliano Allegri is seeking a fourth consecutive domestic double since he took over from Antonio Conte in 2014. For now, there is so much else to talk about – from the tears shed by Jorginho after Napoli’s last hopes were dashed, to the mounting tensions of a relegation scrap in which five teams are separated by a mere two points. Not to forget the battle for European spots, on a weekend when Inter’s hopes of a Champions League berth were renewed. So let us start at the Stadio San Paolo. Most observers might have felt that the title race was over even before Napoli kicked off against Torino on Sunday, thanks to Juventus taking all three points against Bologna (though the reigning champs did concede first in that game, and very nearly fell behind for a second time when Emil Krafth hit the post midway through the second-half). Yet Jorginho had been adamant in a half-time interview that he and his team-mates still believed. They led 1-0 at that point, but would be pegged back twice by a Torino side who, much like Fiorentina a week earlier, refused to let their own rivalry with Juventus diminish their efforts. Perhaps it was fitting that Walter Mazzarri, the manager who steered Napoli to their first major trophy of Aurelio De Laurentiis’s ownership – the 2012 Coppa Italia – should be the man to deliver this final blow. The fear for Napoli is that the end of this season will also bring the end of an era. Jorginho continues to be linked with a move to Manchester City and even more pressing questions surround the future of Maurizio Sarri. De Laurentiis gave an interview to Radio Kiss Kiss last week in which he expressed hope that the manager would stay but also suggested that he had been surveying the alternatives since January. Sarri, for his part, was non-committal on Sunday. He did not rule out a departure, but did remind us of his €8m release clause whilst stressing his love for Naples and its people. Asked directly about De Laurentiis’s remarks, he said: “I don’t need to reply. He has allowed me to live an extraordinary adventure, that of coaching the team I supported as a boy.” As disappointing as Napoli’s late-season fade has been, this remains an extraordinary campaign. One win from their remaining two games would set a new club record points tally in the top-flight. Two would take them past the 90-point threshold. They are guaranteed Champions League football next season. How Lazio would love to say the same. Only a series of impressive saves from Thomas Strakosha allowed them to hang on for a 1-1 draw at home to Atalanta. They stay fourth for now but their advantage over Inter, whom they face on the final weekend, is back down to two points. Worse, Lazio lost Luis Alberto to injury along the way. The Biancocelesti were already missing Serie A’s leading scorer, Ciro Immobile, and it appears that both players might be done for the season. Between them, they have scored 40 of Lazio’s 85 league goals. Inter, for their part, looked buoyant in a 4-0 rout of Udinese, thought that might speak more to the desperate state of their opponents. On 10 February, the Zebrette were ninth in the table. They have taken a single point from 13 games since, with the appointment of a new manager, Igor Tudor, at the end of last month appearing not to have halted the slide. Fans were singing for his predecessor, Massimo Oddo, before full-time. By contrast, Chievo promoted their academy coach Lorenzo D’Anna to take over the first team after they dropped into the relegation zone last week, and he immediately delivered a 2-1 win over direct rivals Crotone. Many had been sceptical of the appointment – even in a caretaker capacity – of a man whose only senior managerial experience was short-lived and unsuccessful at Südtirol, but perhaps it was wise to go with someone who already knew this group of players well. D’Anna got the best from his attack by restoring Emmanuele Giaccherini and Valter Birsa as the two wide men behind Roberto Inglese in a 4-3-2-1. His team was perhaps helped, too, by a crowd bolstered by the club’s decision to drop ticket prices to €1. Spal gave their survival hopes a huge boost, too, beating Benevento and rising to 14th in the table. The Ferrara club have only lost a single game since 18 February, yet their survival is far from assured. They have 35 points now, where 18th-placed Cagliari, who lost to Roma on Sunday night, have 33. Chievo, Crotone and Udinese all have 34. For Juventus, a seventh consecutive title is in the bag. For many other Serie A teams, though, this season is a long way from done. Talking points • A touching moment shared from the Fiorentina after their win away to Genoa, as players sang for Davide Astori in the changing room. The Viola will be hoping Juventus beat Milan in the Coppa Italia final, ensuring that all three Europa League spots are awarded based on teams’ league finish. They are currently eighth, but only three points behind the sixth-placed Rossoneri – whom they face on the final weekend. • Giuseppe Rossi was on the scoresheet for Genoa – claiming his first Serie A goal since 2014. I’d like to dedicate a little piece of this goal to [Sir Alex] Ferguson,” he said. “I hope he recovers quickly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/07/world-snooker-championship-final-mark-williams-v-john-higgins-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T21:03:54Z","webTitle":"Mark Williams beats John Higgins 18-16 in World Snooker Championship final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/07/world-snooker-championship-final-mark-williams-v-john-higgins-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/07/world-snooker-championship-final-mark-williams-v-john-higgins-live","fields":{"headline":"Mark Williams beats John Higgins 18-16 in World Snooker Championship final – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So there we are ... but what the blithering heck are we going to do tomorrow? Any ideas, hit me up, but otherwise thanks for your company and comments - night-night. Williams goes for a typically laconic one-armed lift, then gets set for some family photos. Higgins collects his silver medal. His family look proud of him - I wonder what that feels like - and now here comes Williams to take the trophy! Here’s Barry. Hazel is fill of dirty tricks and goes for Kian, Williams’ youngest son. She then reminds Williams that he promised, if he won, to do his press conference in the nud. He agrees that he said he would, so he must. Williams is as laconic as you’d hope and says Higgins is the best at clearing up that he’s ever seen. And he’s right to say that - Higgins was amazing in that aspect today. He says that last year he watched the final in a caravan with some beers, so Hazel goes for the kids, who weren’t even alive the last time he won here, in a bit to get some emotion. Williams, though, is having no such thing, but Jo his wife, is going for it like nobody’s business so Hazel goes for the low-hanging fruit and brings her out. Williams says she told him he couldn’t spend all day sitting about and now he’s looking forward to next season. Higgins says unbelievable a lot, and notes that the red which starts the crucial run was “a joke”. He says he was worried he might lose with a session to spare, then hoped to put pressure on, but lost to an “unbelievable champion”. This has been amazing. Mark Williams is amazing. John Higgins is amazing. Can Hazel make either of them cry? He coaxes home a long red - beautifully - and what a match that was! What a tournament this has been! Snooker, yeah?! There’s no way Higgins is getting three snookers.... Down it goes, except he then misses a brown after the next red and Higgins comes back to the table 70 behind with 59 left! Williams has a tricky red to the middle that he glides home, but the angle on the black isn’t ideal. It goes down, but forces him to take on the toughest red down the rail ... just this black! On 32, Williams has the angle to go into the pack off the blue and opts to do so gently. It’s hard to see him missing now, but it was hard to see him missing ten minutes ago. Oh mate! Ohhhhhh maaaaaate! Williams, left on the top cushion, somehow strokes a red into the middle. Amazing! The crowd go wild and they’ve every right to go wild - the way the balls are, the way the match is, this is a chance. I’m not sure I’ve seen a final in any sport that’s maintained a standard as high as this, from both players or teams. Feel free to suggest any I’ve missed, but usually the ascendancy of one means the descendancy* of the other. *No that isn’t a word, but it is now. Williams in in first with a long red, but finishes on nothing. Williams nips out. Maybe to be sick. I feel sick. Steve says that he should’ve stunned the pink instead of playing for position I’m spent. I have no idea what to do with myself. I’ve not seen many finals in any sport remotely like this. I am absolutely buzzing my arse off. GET ON YOUR FEET! CRY! LAUGH! SHOUT! SCREAM! DO SOMETHING! In Williams’ box his wife has her heed in her hands - they thought it was done and it was ... except it wasn’t. Remorselessly, Higgins is trotting around the table - he’s making this look mortifyingly, inspiringly easy. Which it is for one of the greatest players ever to play the game, except if he misses he loses. Immediately Higgins is away. I can barely feel my fingers, and these lads have got to perform the equivalent of microsurgery or whatever, or something. Red and a colour needed now, and THERE’S THE RED! That’s a lovely pot, clipped into the top right ... BUT HE’S MISSED THE PINK PARALLEL TO THE TOP THE RAIL! HAVE A LOOK! ARE YOU KIDDING ME! Williams only has 20 and needs 69 to become champion of the world, but I think he’s going to do it. He is cueing beautifully, removing balls gently, but now has the angle on the blue to split the pack ... it’s not perfect but he’s on one, and here we go! He is bousting now, what a buzz this must be. Williams nearly chucked it all in a couple of years ago, but his wife persuaded him to have one last go and here we are! I’m feeling emotional, how in the name of lovemaking is he holding it down? He’s up to 57... Higgins messes up a safety and Williams sends home a red, but dead thin so the white is now on the bottom cushion. The blue, though, is over the right middle, so the brea continues and yerman is cruising round the table like it’s nothing. It is not nothing. Williams breaks nicely, forcing Higgins to leave the chwhite close to the top cushion. What a man! Williams rustles another century, the sixth of the final, and he’s nearly there! Both these lads are unbelievable under pressure, but in different ways. Higgins is fighting and you can see aggression and testicles emanating from every pore. Williams, on the other hand, is oblivious, the same now as always. That’s why he’s about to go two up with three to play. Williams is working this out well, but then finds himself in a difficult position with a red to the top left, black close to the road. Down it goes, then a pink, and he’s 36 ahead with 59 left. Email chiding: “Watch hyperbole,” says Kola Cielencina. “Comebacks ... the awful unfolding of Jimmy in 94 as Hendry won 10 on the spin from 8-14 down!?........or that America’s Cup thing with Ben Ainslie..? Brilliant snooker this though....Needing two or indeed three frames is huge ... When are we going to get some Dott v Ebdon frames?..now that would be a late night!” Outta here with your sailing, but the reason this woiuld be special is the standard of play maintained by both players during the period. Williams didn’t collapse like Jimmy did, Higgins just found a barely fathomable level. ...in it goes, and this is a chance! Did Higgins relax when he drew level? He misses another pot he’s been making all night, and Williams doesn’t need asking twice. He’s back at the table and after a red and a pink, has a fine cut to the right middle... Aaarrrgggh! Williams misses a tight pink into the middle - he’s used the pockets brilliantly this fortnight, but they’re beginning to forsake him now - and Higgins is automatically in. He’s making sure to pot everything and deal with any consequences as and when they arise, which seems a decent ruse. Williams misses a pot but plays it as a shot to nothing. Higgins then leaves him another, and he attacks it with prejudice, sending it from above the blue spot into the the very middle of the top right. This is a chance to go one away, and what’s incredible about this match is that even when Higgins was on one, he maintained his equanimity. “For my money, you can’t beat darts for drama,” says Greg Phillips. “But neither can you beat the last session of a close Crucible final for tension. Blimey. I’m just sitting at my desk, but this is exhausting to watch, in the best possible way.” What you get with darts is the ability to see the action and reaction in the same shot; what snooker gives you is extended drama. If I may quote myself quoting Hitchcock on this point: Alfred Hitchcock once explained that if two people are talking and a bomb explodes without warning, it constitutes surprise; but if two people are talking and all the while a ticking bomb is visible under the table, it constitutes suspense. “In these conditions,” he said, “The same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene. The audience is longing to warn the characters on the screen: ‘You shouldn’t be talking about such trivial matters. There is a bomb beneath you and it is about to explode!’” Such is snooker. In more or less every break, there will at some point be at least one difficult shot, loss of position or bad contact – and there will always be pressure. Add to that the broken flow of things – time spent waiting for the balls to stop, time spent prowling around the table, time spent sizing up the table, time spent cleaning the white, time spent waiting for a turn – and the ability for things to go wrong is constantly in contemplation.” Anyway, luckily we don’t need to choose #blessed I dion’t know and neither do you. Well that’s Williams’ first in five, and he needs just two more. The reds are farshmeered all over the table, and Williams is sliding them away in typically laconic style. In his box, his younger son is nervously prodding his wife, but as far as this frame is concerned, he can relax. And this is Higgins’ problem; he was so far behind that it seemed impossible he could stop Williams for as long as he needed to. No one knows anything. Williams plays a red to the green pocket and misses, but gets lucky with a cannon, leaving a difficult long red. Higgins tries for it, missing thick and by a fortnight. Williams has a chance to clinch the frame now. Williams must have a t-shirt on underneath because there are still nae patches. He races to 41, but then misses a difficult blue into the right centre, leaving nowt. He’ll take that. Higgins loses concentration and gifts Williams a starter. That’s me being speechless, but I’m not here to be speechless, but I’m speechless, but here we are. This isn’t just one of the greatest comebacks in snooker ever; if Higgins pulls it off, this is one of the greatest comebacks in sport ever. Drink it in, because you may never see such ilk again. ............ Higgins plays a careful black - it’s close to the final red - screws back for the black again, and this is the crucial shot coming up, to get to the yellow. He plays it perfectly, and Higgins is now favourite for the match! Can someone please explain to me what in the absolute merry expletive is going on, please? Earworm for Williams. This was a frame-winning opportunity. Williams ran out of position ever so slightly and each shot thereafter was a bit off, until he had to pot a red close to another and hit the wrong one first. So Higgins bounces up and takes an opener to the green pocket and works his way down for the teef. I’m not sure Williams made a smart decision to wear a blue shirt - I fully expect some Camacho sweat patches to announce themselves in the near-to intermediate future. In the meantime, though, there’s some seriously nifty cue-work going on, the break 32 without the any blacks - but yerman is now in commission and this is a frame-winning opportunity. Drama! Williams can’t find his exension, but I’m not sure there’s any hair to tie it to. Williams fouls and Higgins thinks there’s a pot on ... there’s a pot on! He panels it in from the baulk line down the throat of the top right ... but misses a pink into the centre! I think that was a kick, but Williams won’t care - he’s back in the balls and will need to do something. Williams takes on a red because it’s the only one he can leave, and misses but doesn’t leave it so Higgins sends him back to baulk. Williams breaks nicely and sticks Higgins on the bottom cushion. “Prediction,” emails Greg Phillips. “Williams 18-16 Higgins. Williams bounces back to win the next two, then Higgins wins another two, then Williams makes it across the line. Of course, Higgins could just sweep the next four.” No one knows anything. But the chaps are here, so we’ll soon find out. So that’s the mid-session. Pour yourself something, or just take it out of the bottle - you’re going to need it. WHAT A SESSION THAT WAS! It’s not just the comeback, but the nature of it - Higgins has played near-perfect snooker. Can individuals regroup? Apparently that’s what Williams must do during the interview. Williams hasn’t potted a ball for 26 minutes when Higgins catches the brown, makes it unsafe, and leaves a red. He misses it, Higgins sidles back to the table, and surely that’s end of frame. Higgins pots a red and expects to cannon another on the side cushion to sort his position but what looked like a natural angle turned out not to be. So with a lead of 52 points, he puts the brown safe and plays close to the yellow too - Williams appreciates the snide and taps the table as he continues the safety. This really is some of the greatest snooker you’ll ever have the privilege of seeing, never mind the greatest snooker you’ll ever have the privilege of seeing in a world final, never mind the greatest snooker you’ll ever have the privilege of seeing in a world final from 10-15 down. Resourceful, meticulous, clever and dangerous -pour it into your eyes and your soul. The break is currently 37 - a kick intervenes, but oughtn’t to be too damaging. Ba-boom! Williams leaves a tempter, a long red to the top right, and Higgins delivers it right into the gaping bosom of the pocket. Williams makes it, and we have some safety, which works well because snooker is safe. This is getting silly. Higgins works out an absrud plant, then lays a snooker behind the green. Williams plays off the side cushion but too slowly, so back he goes. A reminder that the score was once 7-14. Higgins has won six of the last seven frames; came he sweep the mini-session? His pot success so far is 99%. I cannot wait to see another frame. Luckily I’m not going to have to. Down they go, the pink as well, then the black, and WHAT IS GOING ON! WHAT A PERFORMANCE THIS IS, WHAT A FINAL WE ARE HAVING! LOOK AROUND, LOOK AROUND, HOW LUCKY WE ARE TO BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW! Ohhhhhh, what a shot! Higgins sinks the pink with power and confidence, gets perfect position on the last red, up for the yellow, and all he needs is three more balls. He is playing like God’s dad. Just as I publish that, Higgins lets the white run too far - he’s got the rest out, and a normal shot has become a bastard. He gets down, gets up, and puts the rest away. These last three frames have been an absolute lesson in cue-ball control (if only I was capable of learning such a thing). It’s looking like a late-arse, nauseating, regretful night, exactly what we’re after. Well! Higgins sticks home the green from close to the baulk line, then comes into the pack off the side cushion, catches pink half-ball when he wanted full but things run well for him and he’s now a strong favourite to close the gap. The way Higgins is putting these breaks together is special. I said this earlier, but because he’s such a competitor, we forget that, at heart, he’s a break-builder. Frequent exposure to the overhead camera does his barnet no favours, but. Higgins leaves a difficult red - the white is on the side cushion - and Williams strikes it well, but the ball teases and tantalises before staying out. “Fine margins”, they don’t say, but luckily I am well versed in commentator’s cliche and am here to redress the cosmic balance by saying it for them. Higgins then takes out the rest and this time uses it well ... Williams will be thinking about things. Williams is a specimen - a klee, as they say in Hebrew. He just keeps obliviously rolling, coaxing home reds and blacks ... but then runs out of position after playing a decent split. “If anything, it just arced a little too much for him,” says Dennis with a straight face, and the chwhite goes onto the bottom cushion with the lead now 47. An error from Higgins sets Williams away, and chwhat a pot on the pink follows it! It’s on its spot and touching reds ... but Williams finds the angle from the side cushion to send it into the opposite middle pocket. “Clearance of the tournament so far,” tweets Silver Fox. It was up there - Higgins’ nearly-147 earlier was incredivle, and that Trump one to set up a re-spotted black against Higgins was also rrrridiculous. World Snooker never disappoints! What a skank! We have ourselves a ball-game! That clearance from Higgins was special - perfect, even. He forces the brown, goes off the bottom cushion, in behind the yellow, “and it’s there!” He then has to pot along the baulk line to take the green of its spot ... and he does! Then the brown itself, “right into the heart of the pocket”, and the pink and black are sitting pretty for another to Higgins! WHAT A SHOT! So Higgins goes up off the final red, but doesn’t have a great angle on the broon to get behind the yellow... The yellow is on the side cushion, halfway between baulk line and pocket. That, and it to green, will be the shots which decide this frame and Higgins is already planning them. Higgins goes too hard at a red but very quickly he’s back in perfect position. This would be a phenomenal tax and one of the great clearances. Have a look! Williams gets to 58 and frame ball ... then hesitates and pushes a red towards the midde, which ducks over the edge the nips back over to wind him up! He’s left everything! Williams finishes the wrong side of the pink - which is on the blue spot - so has to go in and out of baulk. He hits it too hard, but gets out of trouble with a plant ... of course he does. He comes down the table, pots the red to bring the black into play, then spanks home a pink with bare top and splits the pack. What a shot! Very quickly, he’s fashioned a chance. And he’s left a red. There’s not much else on, so after this green, Williams will have work to do. Williams clips the blue off the break - Ken blames someone coming back to their seat - and Higgins has a red to the bottom right, so comes over to see what’s doing with the black. “Nothing” is the answer, and the pot is hit too hard for the pink, meaning it’s yellow with the rest ... he misses. That’s exactly what we wanted. It wasn’t as good as his frame-winner earlier today, but it didn’t have to be because the balls were nicely spread and the control was so good. Higgins raises his ton with a delicate black down at baulk, and he’s purring like George Galloway without all the awful bits. And there goes the final black, 131, using I think all the colours - most of them for sure! A conundrum for you: I’d like this match to finish so I can stop working. What I’d like to do when I finish work is watch the snooker. Come on Iggzy! 67 to the Wiz, and that’s the frame. I refrained from giving it a “first frame is crucial”, because I’m a writer, baby, but the first frame was and is crucial. By amazing coincidence, so too will be the second. Higgins is up to 51, 50 ahead with 83 remaining. He’s making this look a cinch, so let’s repair to an affirming opening bar, courtesy of Niall Mullen. Breaking news from our man at the Cruce: “Mark Williams just came into the press room on his way to the final session, played some warm-up mini snooker. ‘I’m good at this’ he said, though he did miss a couple.” I know it’s minor, but this is the kind of thing that makes it hard to see Williams losing - he’s just so calm, so won’t chuck it away, and I don’t think Higgins can play well enough to do take it away. And Higgins is doing the business right now, patiently compiling a break of 21 and looking rock solid for a sizeable contribution. “Evening Daniel!” exclaims George Wright. “This evening really is great isn’t it? Probably Sunday at Augusta and the first day of the first test of the summer are the only annual sporting things that run it close. As for this session, it’ll be interesting to see how JH thinks. When he was seven back, it was obvious that he decided to go for everything and not worry about the consequences. While he’s five back that’s still viable, but when does he revert to playing not to lose? Either because he’s back in it or on the brink. What d’ya reckon?” It’s always, always special, which is what makes it so special - Augusta wasn’t great this term, but luckily for us we don’t need to choose. Higgins will need to take on the pots because he can’t afford to let Williams near the table - if he does, he’ll lose. And he wobbles it down! That was not a generous angle, and the angle on the black is also difficult, coming from the side-top cushion ... and he floats it over, but it doesn’t drop! What can Iggo do? Higgins breaks well, and looks to have taken control of the safety exchange, but then leaves one to the left middle... Is there a single song that has every hair on your body bouncing on end from just the first bar? Apart from this one... Williams is out, and here’s Higgins - he’s changed from black trousers, black shirt and black bowtie to black trousers, black shirt and black bowtie. Choon! The crowd have started clapping along. I take it back. A variety of talking heads are talking about the wonder of the trophy. Steve talks about the moment after the presentation when he showed it his mates and family. Imagine that! Stephen, meanwhile, says one of the greatest moments is when you don’t win it. “You’ve got the trophy but ma name’s there as well!” Amazing. “Higgins winning the first session 3-1 would be a decent result for him and put some pressure on Williams.” says Sheila O’Connell. “It’s not impossible.” No it’s not, and Williams isn’t impervious to pressure – he just wears it brilliantly. He’s such a good potter that it’s hard to see him missing many chances - I don’t think Higgins can keep him off the table for long enough. “Mark Williams messing it up from here,” begins Greg Phillips. “Don’t see it happening. Higgins is deservedly noted for his mental toughness, but in 2003 Williams saw Ken Doherty come back from 10-2 to 12-12 and stay with him over the next eight frames, but didn’t lose his nerve.” I feel you. He looked amazingly calm earlier today, and taking that final frame was gigantic. He is ridiculously equanimous. Quick bit of reading: me on why world snooker is the greatest (and like Sopranos). Evening all. If you missed this afternoon’s magnificence, Mark Williams won the first four frames playing beautiful, frictionless snooker. But then after the mid-session, John Higgins dug deeper than the earth’s core to steal one frame, take another with what I’m certain is the greatest 147 that never was, and win a third. Had he made it a sweep and reduced his arrears to four, he’d have a hope; to come back from five down with Williams now back on track, would represent a miracle. But snooker is a miraculous thing, so. So there we go - join me at 7 and we’ll see. If Higgins gets a start it’ll be a bazzer; if Williams pulls this off, it’ll be incredible. Basically, we can’t lose. I guess Higgins would’ve took that at the mid-session, as Ryan Giggs would say, but that final frame of the afternoon was crucial. It’s hard to see Williams messing it up from here, but you never know. The black is close to the pocket he’s going for, but probably isn’t close enough to play off ... and he looks to play off it, missing. Williams is back to roll it in, and there are plenty of points available before things get tough. I’ve just been informed that there’s a deceased baby bird on my fake grass. I could do with this frame going on for 14 hours, because I’ll be removing it when we’re done. And Mark Williams has smiled upon me, because he’s just missed a red at 50-8... Williams leads 34-8, and the balls aren’t so nicely placed as to make this a formality, but you’d rather be him than Higgins. “The standard is unbelievable ... my heart is leaping with joy watching this,” coos Alan McManus. That makes me very happy, and he’s right - Williams was good in the last mini-session, but this second one has been a level above. Higgins catches a knuckle playing safe and forces Williams to play a pot. He misses long into the top left and follows in with the white, but luckily for him, the red comes back up the table and catches the blue making the next pot difficult. Higgins misses, but leaves a thin cut into the yellow pocket ... Williams isn’t refusing that, and has a lovely angle on the blue to get in amongst it. Safety. The snooker we’re seeing, and snooker in general. This time it’s Williams with the quality break-off and Higgins who has to come off the cushion - he’s pretty tight behind the yellow. He feathers the pink en route to the pack, and Williams puts him back. Ach! Higgins misses the next red, but what a break that was - one of the very best you’ll ever see. Under that sort of pressure, to deliver brilliance of that sort ... we are privileged to be watching. This is breathless, compelling, invigorating stuff. Down goes the black, and he makes damn sure to extinguish the red ... but can get to the black ... and it’s there! One more black and red will secure the frame... This really is fantastic stuff from Higgins. If he can pull it off, it’ll be as great a 147 as you’ll see, Ronnie’s five-minuter aside, because the balls were not inviting. He’s up to eight and eight now, but somehow the white doesn’t respond to his side and he’s got to play the next red to the yellow pocket ... OR THE DOUBLE INTO THE MIDDLE! HE’S GOT IT! But Higgins doesn’t get the luck thereafter and plays a tricky red with the rest ... he eschewed an easier one to do it too ... was he trying to keep the 147 alive? A black of its spot from the top cushion goes down, and that was a so difficult and nerve-wracking. He plays it beautifully, he’s on the next red, and it plus a black go down. That’s five of each. Higgins is such a competitor that it’s easy to forget he’s a break-builder at heart. And he’s working this one out beautifully, picking balls with gentle cueing. He’s up to 25, but has to screw back for his next black when he wanted to run through. This is tricky... It’s not easy but Higgins plays it well ... he’s not on the red he’s targeted, and will need the extended rest, but he ought to stick it away. And the excellence of Iggo’s safety forces an error from Williams. The white is close to the blue spot and down, just about, goes the first red ... and the black is available! Higgins sticks Williams behind the yellow off the break, so he comes off the cushion into the pack. He can’t get back into baulk can he? If not, we could be in re-rack territory, but he requests the spider and plays an excellent shot close to the bottom cushion. What a clearance that was! John Higgins has stanes the size of Stenhoosemuir. He’s not perfect on the blue, but stuns it in and comes off the cushion perfectly... Black to yellow, the key shot ... and “right in the heart of the pocket!” He needs all the colours, but suddenly that looks likely and they’re all on their spots.... I’m at work, which is to say I’d not mind an early finish here because I get to pack up and go downstairs early. Except I’d detest an early finish because if you stand for nothing what would you fall for? This is the final of the World Snooker Championship, and it owes us all the drama in the world. Higgins taps the table in appreciation after Williams plays a decent safety at the second time of asking ... BUT WHAT A RED HE EXPLETIVE SPANKS IN! AND HE CUTS A TRICKY BLACK, SEPARATES A PAIR OF REDS, AND THE TAX IS ON! Oh! Williams pots a blue and comes down to open the remaining reds, but he’s forgotten to impart requisite power and when the white sticks in the reds he slaps up the table. That’ll teach it, and his run of 65 ends with 75 remaining; if Higgins gets the next chance, the balls are well set for a steal. Here we go ... five reds, four blacks, and the power on that last one opens the pack. Williams decamps for blue, the strokes through a red to get back involved down the business end, and it’s hard to see him botching this. Williams is so sly in the safety and leaves Higgins a right evil one, forcing him to play a lone red. He catches it far too thick, and that gives Williams a chance. In goes the red, a black follows it down, and John Williams is playing again. Can Higgins win another? A break of 57 is enough! We’ve got waselves an evening session, and Enry Iggins is back in business. Higgins then kicks off with a lovely red! That had a long old way to travel to the pocket, and he takes the buzz and extends it, quickly opening the pack. This is going to be his first frame of the day, sure Lee? Williams errs! Higgins bounces out of his chair and plays a decent safety - he must’ve thought that was an eighth frame in the hole. Alan McManus has just described a “seismic mini-session”, which made me snigger ... but this didn’t. Higgins misses a black off its spot - he might’ve played the unmissable pink instead - so returns to his place with sad shake of the heid and a tut-tut. You’d not be shocked to see Williams clear up from here, and it’s quickly now 25-15 as yerman gets going. Higgins goes into the pack off the next red, and he can’t be making a mess of this. He’s now about to pot his third red-black combo, and the balls are invitingly spread (if you’re not a moron like me). ...and he plays it beautifully! Well that’s one! Williams misses a red and a double-kiss gives Higgins an easy starter. Can he parlay it into a break? He plays for a tricky black along the top rail ... Here we go... The boys are back with us... So, if Williams wins, or Higgins loses, the next four frames, we’ve got no evening session. That potential embarrassment of that Davis-Parrott situation will be nausing the arse off of Higgins, and will be his first target because it’ll entail winning a frame, something he’s not experienced in the last seven played. Mid-session fun: This is extraordinary stuff from Mark Williams. He’s floating around the table and cooing home balls like you can scarcely believe. What a story, if, when, when, if he wins this - when he came through, he was a long-potter, but what’s been great about him here is his potting in the balls. Higgins has barely had a chance, and if he gets one, you wouldn’t bank on him taking it. Frame-ball, a red that needs tickling along the top cushion, looks tricky. It is not tricky. It looks like he’s run out of position. He hasn’t. He leads 37-7, the run 25, with five reds remaining. Williams is back in. Yes he is. Higgins goes into the pack off the blue but it’s just not working out for him, and the next red is harder than he’d like ... he’s low on it, the black and pink are out of commission ... and he’s overcut it. Oh dear. Higgins plays a containing safety and Williams clunks a long red without much conviction. This is a chance. But whaddaya know, he misses ... but whaddaya know, everything goes safe. Williams leaves Higgins a red to the yellow pocket, but the chwhite ends up between brown and green. He decides he’s no choice but to force the brown into that same pocket and come of the cushion into the pack. The second part works ok, which is to say Williams is back at the table potting balls. Higgins needs this. As he needed the last three. “Are you on the beach soaking up the sun and the snooker?” asks Andrew Benton. “Could you be if you wanted to be?” Sun, sea, ... snooker. Er, I guess if i had one of those laptops with a glare-proof screen it’s possible in theory. But I’d end up with a crowd scene - thrill of the game, thrill of watching me blog. it’s not fair on everyone else. Mark Williams is playing like God. It’s really is that simple. A lovely red down the cushion clinches the frame, so after a colour Williams tries a plant - softly, with safety in mind. He misses so Higgins, needing a snooker, comes back to the table. He tries a plant, misses, and there’s another frame smack, bang in the lobster pot. It’s not that Higgins is playing badly, but he’s not been able to take any half-chances and that’s all he’s been offered. This is cabriolet stuff from Williams, absolutely roofless. Williams is cruising about the table now! He’s looked so good today, more so than yesterday, though he won the last three frames then. Quickly, he strokes his way to 32, and in a few minutes it’ll be six in a row. Higgins leaves a red and Williams pushes it home, but doesn’t get the connection he was seeking so has to try the black from close to the top cushion. He overcuts though ... only for Higgins to miss the only red available. Again, it wasn’t easy; again, he sees it home if he’s not struggling to hold it down. Perhaps in that knowledge, he brings the white up t near the green ... only for Williams to spend a while psyching himself up to play a red to the top right, close to the side cushion ... and what a shot that is! Higgins is desperately seeking. A run of 56 and when Williams misses, Higgins stays sat down. This is looking ominous. Has anyone else noticed that from above, Mark Williams’ hair looks like the Batman sign? And also that his head is symmetrical down the middle? Williams thinks he can swerve around a red to pot a red. He gets down on the shot ... he gets up ... he gets down ... he gets up ... he gets down for a different plant ... he gets up ... he gets down and down it goes! This is beginning to look a lot like 12-7, as Johnny Mathis once sung. He can’t get through to it, so plays to tickle one off the side cushion. He misses, but gets it second time, thicker than intended - that describes us all really - and he’s left a plant that Williams coaxes home. A gently-cut pink follows, but I’m not sure there’s any position left... An error from Williams forces him to play safe, and he leaves the cue ball close to the baulk cushion. Most of the reds are between the black and top right ... Iggins thinks he’s spotted a plant... Foul and a miss from Williams, looking for a thin contact, and Higgins has a pressure pot from around the baulk line to the top left ... it’s not pips, but it’s not nails ... but four frames down, he misses, and Williams is in! Williams espies a red and clunks it into the middle, but runs out of position off the blue. More safety ensues. Hendry Reckons Higgins is what I’m going to call my ironic sixth-form band, when I’ve completed my full regression. Hendry reckons Higgins can’t go into tonight’s session more than four behind - I’d say he does, he’s did. FYI we all like to see the big breaks, but you can’t beat a tactical frame. Did you know? Oh maaaate! Higgins has to cue down onto the white from close to the side cushion, and that, along with the pressure of the chase, causes him to miss the pot. He’s not left anything, mind, and Williams initiates some safety. Williams leaves a red loose and Higgo panels it hame to the top left. The chwhite is back in baulk, so a yellow comes next, then another red, a blue and this is still tricky. The pink is separated from the reds, so will need to go into them full ball and hard ... and he’s absolutely nailed it! This is a chance now. Hazel has bought crisps for the lads, after Williams asked for food off the audience yesterday. Oh ho ho, how they laughed. This looks ominous for Higgins. He badly needs the next frame because if Williams wins it he’ll begin to smell the finish, whatever that smells off. Just look at it! Well! Higgins sticks Williams tight on the top cushion behind the black, forcing him to play a cut to the middle ... [JV]and it’s there! Right in the heart of the pocket![/JV]. He is cueing beautifully, and as i type that he plays a pot with his eyes closed! Rrrrrrridiculous. Williams fouls carelessly and that’s good for Higgins who now has 77 points available with a 56-point deficit. Williams tries a double but as a shot to nothing. It misses, and Higgins has the chance to put the cue ball behind the black - not tight - but causing difficulty because three reds are below the pink, one between blue and yellow and one in baulk. But Higgins flukes the red to no avail - he can’t take a colour and there are now fewer balls left for him - and a safety exchange ensues. This really is a superb break, of course it is, and he’s just missed a red ... ah, that’s a huge kick. Williams leads by 61 with 75 remaining, and that’s the return of luck Higgins needed. Good news and bad news: the good news and main thing is that I can now bold up the first few words, which means I am no longer on my phone and back on my computer. The bad news is that my phone cut out in the process and I missed Williams fluking a red, but he’s in, the run is 44, and he’s going to go four ahead. He’s gliding around the table right now, and Higgins will not be at all happy - he needed a start. He hasn’t got one. And that’s a terrific opening - Williams is tight on the bottom cushion and has to play off the side. The boyz are on the baize! Hands and smiles are exchanged; frame 18, John Higgins to break. Higgins has left his dressing room. He’s wearing a summery black syoot with black shirt and black bow-tie. Williams is in blue shirt - I’ve no idea what’s prompted this revolution. Possibly a tribute to his pastely fellow countryman, Doug Mountjoy. We’re seeing the story of last night. For those of you watching in black and white, Williams leads 10-7. Hazel Irvine is standing outside the Crucimecca, where it is hot. It is sunny. She likes the sun. Not as much as she likes asking post-match questions to elicit tears, but that’s a high standard indeed. Hopefully we’ve got that to look forward to - this term, Williams is the more likely candidate, but the less likely character. Well the good news is that my internet is down. But on the plus side, it is hot. It is sunny. I like the sun. Do you like the sun too? In Britain we spend a lot of time talking about the weather, but not as much time talking about talking about the weather. Aren’t we great. Oh us. It is hot today. And sunny. So, with that out of the way in classically understated, self-aware and ironic style, let us now talk about snooker. It’s been another jazzer of a Crucible fortnight; of course it has, because that is just what happens, every single year. In this unpredictable world, full of unpredictable people, unpredictable politics and unpredictable British weather, the reliable joy of world championship snooker takes on even greater meaning. This term, this are slightly different – and yet very much the same. Generally, the identity of the world champions tells us not just the identity of the world champions, but the identity of the best player in the world; the extended format is the ultimate proving ground. I’m not so sure that’s the case today, but what we get instead is two old heads slugging it out yet again. Both are fantastic, neither will Neil Foulds, and whoever wins will have learnt it. John Higgins has, in late career, earned the big pots that were kept away from him at his peak by Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O’Sullivan. He has a phenomenal all-round game, is solid under pressure, and doesn’t care at all for the exposure of his napper by the overhead camera. But during last year’s final he led Mark Selby 10-4; that will doubtless still be stinging. His opponent, Mark Williams, will feel, er, blessed just to be here. Not long ago he was about to chuck it all in, and didn’t even qualify last year, but an intervention from his wife saved him, he rediscovered his most definitive long pots and nicest safety, and here we are. You get the impression that if Williams is to do this, he’ll have to do it from the front; Higgins might almost be relieved he’s behind, to spare himself the ignominy of chucking it away again. The truth is, that didn’t really happen – Selby was just better – but a competitor of his mettle is never going to see things that way. So, more or less, the score is exactly where we’d have put it to guarantee ourselves the finest drama, the latest night, and the least bank holiday social interaction.

Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, 17, was killed and three other people were shot over the weekend. In Wealdstone, north-west London, two boys aged 13 and 15 sustained head injuries, and in Lewisham, in the south of the capital, a 22-year-old was shot. None have life-threatening injuries. A 43-year-old man was stabbed in Perivale, north-west London, on Sunday and two men and a boy were taken to hospital after an acid attack in Hackney, east London. Rhyhiem’s mother, Pretana Morgan, called for the violence to end. “Let my son be the last and be an example to everyone,” she said. “Just let it stop. What must be, must be. “It’s not about race, it’s not about nation, it’s not about culture. Nothing. It’s just a human race. Just one human race. So children, please let my son be the last.” She said her son was not in a gang and he had been “trying to make a difference” by learning to work with children. He was also an aspiring architect and had “so much potential”, Morgan said. Paramedics and police were called to reports of gunshots on Cook’s Road in Kennington, south London, just after 6pm on Saturday. Rhyhiem was found on nearby Warham Street with a gunshot injury. His death is the latest in a spate of violent crimes in the capital. Police are investigating more than 60 alleged murders since the start of the year. In Wealdstone, the 13-year-old hit by shotgun pellets is being treated by police as an innocent bystander who was walking with his parents when he was struck by shots aimed at the 15-year-old victim. Sadiq Khan, who has faced criticism from some for the increase in violence since he became London mayor, tweeted that he was “doing all I can to compensate for the failure of government ministers” on the issue. Last month, in one of her last actions as home secretary, Amber Rudd launched a serious violence strategy to clamp down on violent crime, which has been rising since 2014. The strategy is to be backed by £40m of Home Office funding and a new offensive weapons bill to ban the sale of corrosive liquids to under-18s and introduce tougher restrictions on buying knives online. It will focus heavily on the links between illegal drug markets, particularly for crack cocaine, and violent crime. The strategy was launched amid controversy over the potential link between dwindling police numbers and the rise in violence. The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, wrote on Twitter: “Appalling to hear about children being killed and injured on our streets this bank holiday. Serious violence is robbing too many young people of their futures. I will work with anyone determined to tackle it.” Police said extra patrols would be working on bank holiday Monday to keep the capital’s streets safe. DCS Simon Messinger said officers were using search powers to seize knives and to stop cars carrying weapons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/07/football-transfer-rumours-anthony-martial-to-juventus-or-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T08:04:35Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Anthony Martial to Juventus or Chelsea?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/07/football-transfer-rumours-anthony-martial-to-juventus-or-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/07/football-transfer-rumours-anthony-martial-to-juventus-or-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Anthony Martial to Juventus or Chelsea?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Having failed to impress against Brighton after being given a rare start on Friday night, Anthony Martial looks headed for the Old Trafford door marked “Do One”. While he didn’t refer to the 22-year-old or his fellow forward Marcus Rashford by name in his post-match moan, José Mourinho was stinging in his criticism of both and is now reported to have given the thumbs-up to a deal that would take Martial out of his sight and off to Juventus this summer. Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham are also believed to be monitoring Martial’s situation with varying degrees of interest. If Chelsea do decide they want him, they may have to offer as much as £80m and Willian in return. A bucket of icy cold water has poured all over speculation that United have agreed an £80m deal to make a Premier League player of Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinković-Savić. Mateja Kezman, the player’s agent, told the Serie A side’s website that “Lazio have three big games to go and nobody has talked about any negotiations at this moment.” So there. German TV station Sport 1 have reported that Borussia Dortmund are cooling their interest in Chelsea flop Tiémoué Bakayoko as they feel the Premier League club’s valuation of £53m for the player is way too high. Bakayoko has failed to impress since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Monaco last summer, but that hasn’t stopped Chelsea looking for £13m more than they paid for him. Following Liverpool’s defeat at the hands of Chelsea yesterday, Jürgen Klopp sarcastically dismissed speculation that the club have agreed to take Nabil Fekir (along with his young brother, Yassin, as a sweetener) from Lyon in a £61m transaction. “During the game, we agreed a deal?” said Klopp with faux surprise in his post-match debrief at Stamford Bridge. “I would be surprised about that to be honest. No comment.” Liverpool are also being linked with Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembélé, who has struggled to make an impression at the Camp Nou since moving from Borussia Dortmund last summer. Wilfried Zaha is another player reported to be on Liverpool’s radar, while Chelsea are also understood to be interested in securing the services of the £50m-rated winger. Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke has been identified as one of Steven Gerrard’s first targets as he prepares to begin life in the Rangers hot-seat. The 20-year-old will be offered a loan deal that would see him get regular first-team football after starting just four games for Liverpool this season. And finally, with Leicester’s players going about their business with all the enthusiasm of a dog who knows he’s being taken to the vet, the managerial jig looks up for Claude Puel after just over six months in charge. After losing four of their past five matches and with games against Arsenal and Tottenham to come, the club’s season is ending with a whimper and David Wagner is the latest name being tipped to take over at the King Power Stadium. The Huddersfield manager has not yet secured his side’s Premier League status, but yesterday’s hard-fought point against Manchester City could make all the difference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/07/indonesia-jakarta-court-rejects-hizb-ut-tahrir-attempt-to-reverse-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T12:48:25Z","webTitle":"Jakarta court rejects attempt by Hizb ut-Tahrir to reverse its ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/indonesia-jakarta-court-rejects-hizb-ut-tahrir-attempt-to-reverse-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/07/indonesia-jakarta-court-rejects-hizb-ut-tahrir-attempt-to-reverse-ban","fields":{"headline":"Jakarta court rejects attempt by Hizb ut-Tahrir to reverse its ban","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A legal attempt by the Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir to overturn a decision that saw it outlawed in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country has been rejected by an Indonesian court. Reading the verdict at Jakarta state administrative court, the head judge, Tri Cahya Indra Permana, said the lawsuit was “rejected in full”. Hizb ut-Tahrir was banned in Indonesia on the basis of a 2017 presidential decree that gives the government powers to disband groups deemed a threat to national unity. The ruling on Monday upheld that decision, with the judicial panel stating that the government had acted according to procedure and Hizb ut-Tahrir runs counter to Indonesia’s state ideology. The Islamic group, a global organisation that had an estimated 10,000 members in Indonesia before it was dissolved, supports the establishment of a global caliphate. Under heavy guard from police and military personnel, hundreds of hardline supporters dressed in white skullcaps gathered outside the courtroom, where they conducted a mass prayer before the verdict was announced. Ismail Yusanto, a former Hizb ut-Tahrir Indonesia spokesman, said it would appeal. “If we accept, that means accepting injustice, that we allow injustice and we accept that preaching our ideals is wrong. Are you willing to let the teachings of Islam be blamed?” Yusanto was quoted as saying by CNN Indonesia. The ruling is a clear political victory for the administration of Joko Widodo, but there are doubts that it will help curb radicalism. Todd Elliott, a political analyst at Concord Consulting, said: “There is no guarantee that former members of HTI [Hizb ut-Tahrir Indonesia] are simply going to give up their extremist beliefs now that their former group is outlawed. There is a plethora of other hardline Islamist groups.” Hizb ut-Tahrir was one of several Islamic groups involved in mass rallies that led to the downfall and imprisonment of the former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok, on charges of blasphemy last year. Elliott said the group, which has been banned in several other countries, was an easier target than some Indonesian organisations that have a demonstrated pattern of violence. The decision to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, he said, could backfire. “HTI was unique in that it strictly adhered to a policy of non-violence, so now there is a risk of these 10,000 former members saying, ‘OK, well we were a legal mass organisation, we played by the rules and that didn’t work.’ So some of them could gravitate towards violence,” Elliott said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/09/which-footballers-have-been-made-to-shave-by-a-manager-or-chairman","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"Which footballers have been made to shave by a manager or chairman? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/09/which-footballers-have-been-made-to-shave-by-a-manager-or-chairman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/09/which-footballers-have-been-made-to-shave-by-a-manager-or-chairman","fields":{"headline":"Which footballers have been made to shave by a manager or chairman?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Has any player ever been made to shave his beard off by a manager or chairman?” asked Sam Holden last week. As is frequently the case with questions like this, we begin with Brian Clough, who ordered striker Garry Birtles to defuzz his face before the 1979 European Cup final. “The story goes that as the players congregated in the hotel foyer prior to boarding the coach to the stadium, ‘Ol Big Ead, in one of the many examples of his brilliant man-management, noticed that Birtles looked nervous,” writes Duncan Wilson. “Cloughie ordered him to go back to his room and shave before boarding the coach – the theory being that by concentrating on shaving, his mind would be taken off the upcoming match. Naturally the player did as he was instructed, and the team could then make their way to the Olympic Stadium in Munich to defeat Malmö, lift their first European Cup, and cement theirs and Clough’s place in folklore.” Önder Susam reminds us that in 2014 Ilhan Cavcav, chairman of Turkish club Genclerbirligi, promised to fine any player wandering around like they ran a cereal cafe. “I am 80 years old, and I shave every single day,” boomed Cavcav. “Man, is this an Imam Hatip school? You are sportsmen. You should be a model for the youth.” He unsuccessfully attempted to convince the chairman of the Turkish FA, Yildirim Demiroren, to extend his beard ban across the league. “He [Demiroren] told me that they could not impose such a restriction because Uefa would not let them do it. I am fed up with this Uefa. I wish we had some other place to play our football.” Daniel Passarella famously instructed his players to cut their hair when he was in charge of the Argentina team, but one of his predecessors did encourage the removal of facial fuzz. During the 1978 World Cup, César Luis Menotti suggested Mario Kempes have a shave, with impressive results. “I couldn’t be bothered with the whole shaving-every-couple-of-days routine,” Kempes said in 2007. “After nearly three weeks I had a pretty decent beard and moustache going. I played like that in our first two games, but shaved the beard off before our third. We were heading back to our camp after that match, thinking ahead to our next assignment in Rosario, when the coach said to me: ‘Mario, why don’t you get rid of the moustache and see if your luck changes?’” Kempes went on to score six goals in four games, including two in the final as Argentina won their first World Cup. Florian Labrouche nominates Gaël Givet’s experience with Evian in 2014. Givet told Le Parisien: “Three days before my first game, I was called into the president’s office for something that seemed crazy and that had nothing to do with football. I was completely disgusted. The problem was that I let my beard grow. At Evian, they wanted to force me to shave because it was too long. At 33, you cannot treat me this way. They took me for a jihadist, while I haven’t even converted to Islam.” Givet made just one appearance for the Ligue 2 side. David Poza nominates Roy Greenwood, who played at Sunderland from 1975 to 1978. “Bob Stokoe, then the manager of the team, asked Roy to shave his beard in order to appear in the team photo. Greenwood refused, and didn’t appear in any more team photographs.” Finally, there’s Celtic’s Danny McGrain, who nearly came a cropper of Albanian leader Enver Hoxha making beards illegal at the time of their 1979 European Cup first-round first leg tie against Partizan Tirana. McGrain’s tale was the subject of a Knowledge from way back when. In the city “With Madrid having a team in each European final,” begins Josh McGarry, “I wondered if both trophies have ever been won by teams from the same city in the same season before?” Yes they have. In 1994 Milan was the place to be, with Fabio Capello’s side having won the Champions League by getting the better of Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona, while across town Inter beat the admittedly less glitzy Casino Salzburg to lift the Uefa Cup. If we throw the sadly departed Cup Winners’ Cup into the mix, no two teams from the same city have ever won that and one of the others in the same season, but if we spool back to 1989-90 then all three resided in northern Italy: Milan held the big pot, Sampdoria won the Cup Winners’ Cup and Juventus beat Fiorentina in the final of the Uefa Cup. Knowledge archive “If Edwin van der Sar plays for Manchester United in the Champions League final, it will be 13 years since he appeared for Ajax in the 1995 final,” wrote Firat Topal, this week back in 2008. “Is this the longest run between two finals for a player?” “You have to look no further than the great Paolo Maldini,” wrote Rich Limb. “He first played in the Champions League final, or the old European Cup as it was then, with Milan in 1989. “His last appearance in the final was last year (and on both occasions he lifted the trophy). So his record, which is particularly amazing for an outfield player, is 18 years.” Lest we forget, Rich, the same applies to Alessandro Costacurta who, despite not playing in the 2007 final at the age of 41, received a winner’s medal. Take a trip to the font of nerdvana in our archive Can you help? “Virgil van Dijk started the season at Southampton, who could go down, and ends it with Liverpool who could be European champions. Has anyone played for a team that have gone down and won the European Cup in the same season?” asks Mike Coxon. “Two players were sent off following a scuffle in Swindon’s win over Accrington” notes Paul Fulcher. “They were James Deane of Swindon and James (or Jimmy) Deane of Accrington. Have two namesakes been sent off together before?” “If Tony Pulis gets Middlesbrough through the Championship play-offs, will he be the first manager to be promoted and relegated in the same season?” muses Dominic Piper. “Due to the timing of Premier League kick-offs, the team in 19th place, Stoke, was relegated before the team below it in 20th. Has this ever happened before?” wonders Steven Higgins. • Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/may/07/nestle-starbucks-rights-sell-coffee-chain-products-global-alliance","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T12:48:59Z","webTitle":"Nestlé pays Starbucks $7.15bn for rights to sell coffee chain's products","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/07/nestle-starbucks-rights-sell-coffee-chain-products-global-alliance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/07/nestle-starbucks-rights-sell-coffee-chain-products-global-alliance","fields":{"headline":"Nestlé pays Starbucks $7.15bn for rights to sell coffee chain's products","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Swiss-based food giant Nestlé is paying Starbucks $7.15bn (£5.3bn) for the rights to sell the US coffee chain’s products around the world in a global alliance aimed at reinvigorating their coffee empires. The deal for a business with $2bn in sales reinforces Nestlé’s position as the world’s biggest coffee company, with brands such as Nescafé and Nespresso. The Seattle-based Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, said it would use the proceeds to return money to shareholders by speeding up a share buyback programme. The transaction does not involve any Starbucks cafes and will involve selling Starbucks bagged coffee, drinks and Nespresso-style pods. The Nestlé name will not appear on Starbucks products. “We do not want the consumer to perceive that Starbucks is now part of a bigger family,” a Nestlé source said. “This global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestlé,” the Starbucks chief executive, Kevin Johnson, said. Nestlé and Starbucks are joining forces in a highly fragmented consumer drinks category that has been involved in a string of deals lately. JAB Holding, the private investment firm of Europe’s billionaire Reimann family, has fuelled the consolidation wave with a series of deals, including Douwe Egberts, Peet’s Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, narrowing the gap with Nestlé. Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks. A willingness to pay up for exotic beans and specialty drinks means companies can generate stronger profit margins than in mainstream packaged food. The Nestlé source said it would pay market-linked royalties to Starbucks after the initial fee. It will not buy any industrial assets as part of the deal but could step in to produce in markets where Starbucks is not present. “Nestle is far and away the largest hot drinks company globally, with more in sales than the next five largest hot drinks companies combined,” Matthew Barry, an analyst at Euromonitor, said on Friday when the tie-up was first mooted. “However, Nestlé’s leadership position is less secure than it once was.” Other big players are growing as well, including Italy’s Lavazza, which is the world’s No 3."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/windrush-illegal-migrants-immigrants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T14:19:00Z","webTitle":"After Windrush, stop talking about ‘illegals’.

Start talking about people","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Words matter. That is perhaps the simplest lesson delivered by the Windrush scandal. When placed next to the terms immigrant and asylum seeker, language such as “floodgates”, “swarm” and “bogus” have a real world impact. In 1995, the then Conservative home secretary, Michael Howard, helpfully talked of Britain as an “attractive destination for bogus asylum seekers and other illegal immigrants”. Since then tabloids and broadsheets alike have repeated that sentiment ad infinitum. Howard was himself only repeating ideas by people like Enoch Powell and Winston Churchill before him. In the seminal There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack, academic Paul Gilroy wrote that “at the suggestion of Churchill, a Conservative cabinet discussed the possibility of using ‘Keep Britain White’ as an electoral slogan as early as 1955”. We may well recoil at the blatant racism behind the words but they merely serve as a precursor to language and a way of viewing immigrants that sees them as the other against which the nation must be secured. Twenty years on from Howard’s intervention, David Cameron would describe migrants in Calais as a “swarm of people”, while the Sun complained that European judges had opened the “floodgates to illegal immigrants”. Such language acts as a supporting structure, stoking our basest of emotions – fear and hatred. These are sentiments translated into policy which institutionalises inhumanity. We shouldn’t be surprised, as Mishka from the group Freed Voices puts it, “to see things like the Windrush scandal, or the six deaths in [immigration] detention last year, or Grenfell, when the people at the heart of these tragedies are portrayed as either a threat to society or completely disposable to it”. The triumph of the Windrush scandal has been in seeing “those” people tell their once ignored and undervalued stories. Hearing about their plight in their own words has generated the power to topple a home secretary and plunge the prime minister into further crisis. Always, though, within that telling is the emphasis on legality. And it is perhaps no surprise that the consequence of that has been to turn the focus on those that are perceived as underserving of our sympathy – illegal immigrants. Amber Rudd herself, as she struggled to answer a straightforward question on removal targets, was nevertheless at pains to make a distinction between “Windrush, who are legal migrants” (despite many never having been migrants in the first place) with “people that are here illegally”. Cue David Goodhart opining that Windrush isn’t a “simple tale of goodies and baddies”. It is, in fact, “minorities … who are most likely to be disadvantaged by illegal immigration”. It is only immigrants that are deemed good or bad when it comes to Windrush, not the political policies that precipitated the scandal. Undocumented migrants are considered criminals first, human beings with a relatable journey last. But they live among us. They may be a high-level academic researcher unaware that they didn’t have the right stamp in their passport to renew their work permit, or the engineer who made a minor amendment to their tax record. Or it could be a neighbour who, like 33-year-old Michael, from the detention action group Freed Voices, “grew up in the East End, loves pie and mash and supports Chelsea”. He arrived in the UK with his father and younger siblings when he was 12. By the time he was 16, his father had abandoned them. Michael was told that because he was over 16, he was “no longer a social services problem”, and was left destitute. Michael would eventually use someone else’s identity to work in order to provide for himself. His younger siblings have a legal right to remain in the UK. After 21 years living in the UK, Michael is still considered an “illegal” immigrant. He has been caught in the same bureaucratic quagmire typical of cases from the Windrush scandal. What is our moral responsibility to people who are de facto citizens but who are treated as though they belong elsewhere? How can our language and, more broadly, our immigration policy treat them with the dignity they deserve? On the same day that Rudd finally resigned for misleading the country – or for not being fully aware of the facts (take your pick) – Piers Morgan on ITV’s Good Morning Britain could be seen “grilling” Diane Abbott on Labour’s policy regarding “illegal” immigrants. For Morgan, “It’s not a difficult question”. In reality it seems a simple answer only when the language employed dehumanises thousands, enabling a culture of casual brutality and neglect that we have seen typified in each Windrush story. In their case, as in that of many more undocumented migrants, becoming “illegal” had nothing to do with criminality but was instead about a bureaucratic process that turns people into targets who must be deported. A “hostile environment” has become a fitting response to “illegal immigrants” because the label embodies criminality and disorder (which, we’re told, we must be protected against) while also obscuring the humans behind the term. Targets can be set to deport and detain because the reality of human suffering that they necessarily cause has been obscured by the word “illegal”. This is the moment to challenge that noxious discourse. We must use this opportunity, this rare moment when immigrants can be seen as human, to think about all those who come to this country – and consider an amnesty for all. • Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and columnist focusing on race, politics, education and feminism"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/tim-dowling-wife-talking-about-marrying-after-my-death","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: my wife’s listing all the men she’d marry if I ‘sadly passed’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/tim-dowling-wife-talking-about-marrying-after-my-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/tim-dowling-wife-talking-about-marrying-after-my-death","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: my wife’s listing all the men she’d marry if I ‘sadly passed’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s the middle of the bank holiday weekend, and for the first time in many months I am in the garden without having to do anything about the garden. It’s all finished; it only remains for the plants to grow a bit. I stand and stare, willing them to hurry up. The day turns warm – record-breaking warm. A neighbour drops round for a drink on her way elsewhere. We sit outside, listening to the birds and the leaf blowers, while my wife indulges in one of her favourite pastimes: listing all the things she would do if I died. “The thing is, if Tim sadly passed,” she will say, with a strange light in her eyes. She will then name some of the men she would sadly go on to marry. Sometimes she’ll talk about sadly chucking out all my stuff, or sadly buying a horse, as if my continued existence were the only barrier to such a plan. Today, however, we are discussing the difficulties involved in re-entering the singles scene in middle age. “The thing is, if Tim sadly passed, I’m not sure I could be bothered with all that,” my wife says. “Sadly passed?” our friend says. “It sounds hideous, having to go out and meet strange old people,” my wife says. “Who are actually your age,” I say. “Exactly,” she says. “I think I’d rather be alone.” “You’ll still have The Archers,” I say. “That’s true,” she says. “That’s all I need. Hang on.” She gets up and walks into the kitchen. A light breeze drags the last of the cherry blossom to earth. Tiny butterflies loop drunkenly through the freshly planted beds. A few houses along, someone is hard at work with an angle grinder. “I’m fine, as far as I know,” I say. “That’s good,” our friend says. “Unless she’s opened a letter from the GP or something…” “More wine!” my wife says, emerging with an open bottle. After another glass of wine my wife’s prospects for future romance in the event of my demise seem to brighten: she names a name. Then another. “Actually, if you were to sadly pass, I might have to marry him,” she says. “He’s already married,” I say. “Obviously she would have to sadly pass as well,” my wife says. “Are they aware of this arrangement?” I say. “They know.” “I have to go,” says our friend. “I never think about what I’m going to do when you sadly pass,” I say. “Don’t you?” she says. “I do.” It turns out she has a mental file of women I should marry next, in ranked order. “To be honest, I always imagined I would use the time to catch up on my reading,” I say. “Seriously, if I were to sadly pass, you could do a lot worse than…” “Just put the list on the fridge or something,” I say. After our friend leaves, my wife decides it’s too hot to sit outside, and goes upstairs for a nap. I decide I might enjoy sitting in the shade with an iced coffee, but there is no shade, or ice, or coffee. The youngest one walks into the kitchen, looking bleary-eyed. In one hand is his phone, which is playing a YouTube video at top volume. His other hand, I notice, is holding an iced coffee. “Did you just put an empty ice tray back in the freezer?” I say. “I did indeed,” he says. “That’s a sin,” I say. “But is it, really?” he says. “People go to hell for less,” I say. I fill the ice tray with water, and settle for an inch of cold wine in a hot glass and a seat in the scorching sun. In the garden next door, people are having lunch outside. From the other direction I hear the bright laughter of small children. Directly behind me someone is having the sort of party that combines a barbecue with the repeated use of a pneumatic tyre changer. I look down at my reddening arms, and for a terrible moment I feel utterly alone: alone with my thoughts, my inch of wine and my ever-changing moles. I hope the moment passes before I do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/07/from-degas-muse-to-modern-aerialist-exhibition-charts-black-women-in-circus","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T16:09:47Z","webTitle":"From Degas muse to modern aerialist: exhibition charts black women in circus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/07/from-degas-muse-to-modern-aerialist-exhibition-charts-black-women-in-circus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/07/from-degas-muse-to-modern-aerialist-exhibition-charts-black-women-in-circus","fields":{"headline":"From Degas muse to modern aerialist: exhibition charts black women in circus","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Miss La La was the star of the show when Edgar Degas painted her in 1879 hanging by her teeth from the roof of the Cirque Fernando in Paris, but in 2018 she will share the spotlight with another young black aerialist, Blaze Tarsha, who had never heard of her nor had any idea of the long tradition of black performers in some of the most famous shows. Tarsha, a performer with NoFit State circus, is creating a film to be shown beside the painting, which will travel on a rare loan from the National Gallery in London to Sheffield’s Weston Park Museum for an exhibition in July on the hidden history of female and black circus performers. Tarsha’s circus career began when she mastered the unicycle in a week while hanging around bored as her mother, a professional chef, was cooking for a juggling convention. Both mother and daughter now tour with NoFit State. Tarsha performs a spectacular aerial act in a suspended ring, while Miss La La’s show-stopping finale was slightly more eccentric. Although Degas portrayed her in a relatively conventional pose, her most famous trick – repeated when she and her troupe visited London – came when a bronze cannon was lifted into the air suspended from a strap held in her teeth while she hung from the trapeze. “When I told her about Miss LaLa, Blaze said: ‘But I thought I was the only one,’” said Prof Vanessa Toulmin, the joint curator of the Circus! exhibition and founder of the National Fairground and Circus Archive at Sheffield University. “The history of black performers is there but it’s not always obvious. You have to look for it.” Toulmin pointed out that Degas had been interested in the athletic human body almost as an architectural element silhouetted against the roof of the circus, and that it was not clear in the painting that Miss La La was black – though that is obvious from some 19th-century circus posters and in the only photograph Toulmin has been able to find of the performer. Degas, who produced several paintings and drawings of Miss La La, referred to her in letters as “my beautiful negress”. Her real name was Olga Brown and she is said to have been born in Prussia – present-day Poland – in 1858 and placed with a circus by her mother at the age of nine. She performed a flying trapeze and a human cannon ball act with the Kaira Troupe, at the Cirque Fernando and in circuses and music halls across Europe, including appearances at the Folies Bergère in Paris, Royal Aquarium in London in 1879 and the Gaiety theatre in Manchester. She moved to the US where Toulmin – who believes Brown may well have changed her name once or several times again – loses track of her. The exhibition opens in Sheffield and versions of it will be seen later in Great Yarmouth and Newcastle. It is part of the Circus 250 festival, celebrating the anniversary of a British art form that went on to conquer the world of entertainment. Circus!

Far from being an innocent defence of Enlightenment values, the protest seemed more a Trojan horse for the ideas of the far right to insert themselves into the political mainstream. The demonstration was a response to former EDL leader Tommy Robinson’s permanent ban from Twitter, and featured figures such as Anne Marie Waters, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Gerard Batten of Ukip. I’m not sure that British mainstream politics has quite taken the growing presence of the far right across Europe and the US seriously enough, or indeed the fact that British far-right and socially conservative groups are overtly and deliberately adopting the tactics of their allies across the pond. Claiming freedom of speech as a value is something the American far right has been doing for years (aided and abetted by liberal dupes, naturally); Britain has also recently had an escalation in protests outside abortion clinics. “They are starting to resemble more and more the tactics that you’d see in the United States: graphic imagery, more aggressive approaches to people,” said John Hansen Brevetti, clinical operations manager at a clinic in Ealing, west London. It’s important to understand that these protests aren’t simply individual opportunistic acts, but part of a growing narrative embraced by social conservatives and the far right that the nation has been corrupted by elites, who are simultaneously destroying the economy and damaging society with their decadent liberal values. These elites, argue these protesters, are censoring ordinary people from expressing reasonable opinions, and forcing women to abort their children when other options might be available. Or as Tommy Robinson put it when he addressed the rally: “The people of this country have been silenced for 20-30 years with the tag of racists. They have managed to silence people so that they are too scared to speak up when they see things that are wrong.” Robinson is tapping into that hoary old Nixonian trope, “the silent majority”. Central to these culture wars, then, is who “the majority” is and which groups can claim to speak for it. No one can claim to have found the perfect oppositional response to the culture wars, but in light of Robinson’s argument, it’s probably a bad idea for the opposition to set itself up as a group that represents only minorities. Instead, perhaps the aim should be to redefine who the majority are, through collective struggle, solidarity and a movement that makes itself welcoming to, and represented by, all demographics in society. Whatever the response to the weekend’s rally is, it can’t come soon enough. Nigel Farage’s triumphalist meetings with Marine Le Pen, the far-right AfD in Germany, and Donald Trump should tell us all that this is a concerted international nationalist project that correctly sees itself as insurgent. And preceding every far-right victory is a political mainstream that didn’t take it seriously enough. Let’s not allow that to happen again. • Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a freelance columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/07/police-gang-violence-matrix-strategy-haringey-london-assessments","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T15:29:40Z","webTitle":"Police gang strategy 'targets people unlikely to commit violence'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/07/police-gang-violence-matrix-strategy-haringey-london-assessments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/07/police-gang-violence-matrix-strategy-haringey-london-assessments","fields":{"headline":"Police gang strategy 'targets people unlikely to commit violence'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Metropolitan police strategy to tackle gangs appears to have caught up a significant number of individuals who according to secret police assessments do not pose a danger of committing violence. Under the so-called gang violence matrix, suspected gang members are given a score assessing how dangerous they are and can be targeted for “Al Capone-style” disruption tactics. According to an assessment seen by the Guardian, more than 40% of young people on a list from Haringey in north London are scored as posing “zero” risk of causing harm. Some are assessed as being much more likely to be victims than offenders. The data also shows the majority of those registered on the matrix are young black men. It is the first gang violence matrix to be seen outside the police and their partners, allowing the first informed public debate about the tactic. The Guardian has also learned that the information commissioner has launched an investigation into the matrix to see if it breaches laws covering the use of data. The Met says the scores are based on intelligence they consider reliable from two sources. With political backing, it says the matrix helps to thwart violence, saves lives and can help prevent people from being drawn into gang violence. Critics say those on the matrix can be subject to punitive measures across the public sector, covering employment, housing, driving licences and education. They also say the role posed by gangs in violence is inflated and a US-style model is being imported to the UK with no evidence that it is needed. Police felt they needed better tools to deal with gangs following the 2011 riots that spread across England after starting in the Tottenham area of Haringey. The then Conservative-led government blamed gangs for the violence, despite police believing only a minority of those involved were in gangs. The list seen by the Guardian assessed 85 people in Haringey suspected of gang activity, so called gang nominals, and was carried out in 2016. Those on the list were given a score based on how much danger they posed and their chances of being a victim. Seven people on the matrix were assessed as posing a high risk of causing harm – meaning committing violence. Twenty-eight were assessed as medium riskand 50 as posing little or no risk. There were 37 individuals with a matrix harm score of zero, including two with a score of 0.32. Fifteen of the individuals in the database were considered more likely to be a victim of crime than cause harm, and one person had not committed any offences in five years. The Met said: “The gang violence matrix is an intelligence tool used to identify and risk-assess gang members in every London borough. It is informed by intelligence, but it is primarily based on violent offences. The overarching aim of the matrix is to reduce gang-related violence and prevent young lives being lost.” Stafford Scott, a veteran community activist from Tottenham, said: “Clearly these people should not be on this database, but they are and this fact is shared right across the system. For the local authorities, simply being on the gang matrix is taken as evidence of a person being a gangster. “Once labeled as such, all services to this individual and his family is slowly withdrawn. This is what is helping to create an environment where black youths are so disenfranchised and angry that they are resorting to ever-increasing levels of violence. They feel that they have nothing too lose and they are right.” Similar gang violence scoring systems are believed to be in use by forces covering Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. Across London, about 3,800 people are on the gang violence matrix. Few would see anything improper in police keeping intelligence on violent gang members with convictions for crimes that blight communities and cause public alarm, but the inclusion of so many young people without such convictions has caused concern about intelligence-gathering and the use of tactics that co-opt the public sector. Critics say those on the gang matrix face punishment away from the criminal justice system, such as having to promise in order to get a driving licence that they are not using drugs. The Guardian revealed in 2016 that the vast majority of people in London suspected of gang involvement were black. Figures for 2016 show that of the 3,626 people listed on the gang matrix, 78% were black and 9% from other ethnic minority backgrounds. Ethnic minorities make up 40% of London’s population. Police say hundreds of people have been taken off the matrix by showing they have turned away from gang activity. In a statement, the Information Commissioner’s Office’s deputy commissioner for operations, James Dipple-Johnstone, said: “We are in contact with the Metropolitan Police Service as part of an investigation into their use of a ‘gang database’. “As part of this, we’re considering how the database is used and if any aspects of it constitute a breach of the Data Protection Act. At the conclusion of our investigation, we will communicate any resulting recommendations and enforcement actions.” Amnesty International is expected to publish a report on the gang matrix shortly.

Britain must help","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"None of us can be ignorant of the desperate situation facing the Rohingya people – it is one of the greatest humanitarian crises of recent times. I have been to the refugee camps on Bangladesh-Myanmar border, where almost 1 million Rohingya refugees are in temporary shelters. I met refugees who have fled unspeakable levels of violence and systematic abuse, including the murder of entire villages by the Myanmar military. This latest atrocity is the result of a sustained campaign of marginalisation and discrimination that started decades before the August 2017 genocide. I support a referral to the international criminal court. The UK government doesn’t. In Bangladesh, these people now face a second tragedy as the monsoon season hits and threatens to wipe out even more lives. Aid agencies estimate that 100,000 people are at severe risk of mudslides and flooding in the largest camp I visited, Kutupalong. Their shelters – which are actually just bamboo and tarpaulin – will be no match for monsoon rains and will simply be washed away. The lack of clean water and inadequate sanitation also increase the risk of water contamination and outbreaks of diseases, such as cholera, that could devastate the camp population. Basic services are also in danger; 32% of health facilities could be lost, and a quarter of the nutrition centres are threatened, putting the lives of the 60,000 women reported to be pregnant – many of them as a result of rape – and their babies at risk of malnutrition and subsequent difficulties through birth and in feeding their newborn children. The rapid and unplanned growth of the camps makes the response challenging. But there are opportunities to improve the situation. That is why I am leading a debate in parliament on Tuesday and I will be pressing the Foreign Office minister to take urgent action, before many tens of thousands of people, including children, lose their lives. The UK has been, and continues to be, a leader in the financial response in Bangladesh, having given £59m to help the global efforts, and pledged a further £70m. Money alone, however, will not solve this immediate crisis. This reality demands the UK takes a position of political leadership in addressing the crisis on both sides of the border. UN and other aid agencies are being held up by red tape as they try to gain access to the camps. We must work with the government of Bangladesh to register international organisations more quickly so they can work and deliver services in the camps. This will allow technical experts to support the Bangladeshi response. Without this expertise, almost half a million people will continue to be unable to access services such as health facilities, food support and education. The Rohingya have an inalienable right to return to Myanmar and this must be protected. It is vital therefore that steps are taken to address the conditions that have forced, and continue to force, people to flee. The findings of the Annan commission on Rakhine provide a nationally and internationally endorsed framework designed to address the marginalisation of the Rohingya. It is vital that the UK, in partnership with regional actors, supports the progressive implementation of the findings by the Myanmar government. Progress on ensuring Rohingya citizenship must be a priority. In the longer term, the international community must work with the government of Bangladesh to define, agree and finance a response to the crisis that supports both refugees’ self-reliance as well as contributing to improved conditions for host communities and to Bangladesh’s own development objectives. Agreements reached with other refugee-hosting nations, including Jordan, Lebanon and Ethiopia, provide an indication of what can be achieved with the right package of support combined with strong partnerships. The UK government has paid lip service to some of these issues, but now is the time for action. The monsoon season is already beginning. For many tens of thousands of refugees it will soon be too late. • Jo Stevens is Labour MP for Cardiff Central"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/07/may-day-bank-holiday-weather-breaks-temperature-record","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T15:41:58Z","webTitle":"Early May bank holiday weather breaks temperature record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/07/may-day-bank-holiday-weather-breaks-temperature-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/07/may-day-bank-holiday-weather-breaks-temperature-record","fields":{"headline":"Early May bank holiday weather breaks temperature record","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Record-breaking temperatures have been reported as people across the UK enjoy a sizzling bank holiday Monday. Temperatures in Northolt, west London, reached 28.7C (83.6F), making it the hottest early May bank holiday weekend on record, the Met Office said. The record for an early bank holiday Monday was broken earlier in the day when a temperature of 24.2C was recorded at Herstmonceux, in East Sussex. The early May bank holiday was introduced in 1978. The hottest early May bank holiday weekend was in 1995 when temperatures hit 28.6C on the Saturday. The Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: “We have smashed the warmest bank holiday Monday for early May.” The maximum average temperatures for May are 13C in the north and 16C in the south. This weekend’s hot conditions have been created by a mix of low pressure, light winds and consistent sunshine. But not everyone enjoyed blue skies – it was forecast to be cloudier across Northern Ireland and Scotland, the Met Office said. And low cloud, mist and sea fog is affecting the northern coast of Devon and Cornwall. Looking at the long-range forecast, the Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: “It looks like we should be prepared for some pretty changeable weather throughout the second half of May. “We’re still going to see some dry days, but there’s still going to be some wet days mixed in as well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/07/private-hospitals-england-jeremy-hunt-cqc-damning-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T21:42:38Z","webTitle":"Private hospitals warned over failing safety and quality standards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/07/private-hospitals-england-jeremy-hunt-cqc-damning-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/07/private-hospitals-england-jeremy-hunt-cqc-damning-report","fields":{"headline":"Private hospitals warned over failing safety and quality standards","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Private hospitals have been given two weeks to come up with a plan to “get their house in order” on safety and quality or else face tough sanctions imposed by the government, the Guardian has learned. On Tuesday, Jeremy Hunt will write to the chief executives of 206 private hospitals across England following a damning report into the sector by the safety regulator last month. The Care Quality Commission found that two in five private hospitals are failing to meet safety standards intended to protect the public from harm, intensifying concerns among ministers over patient safety. Thousands of patients are thought to be moved during emergencies to the NHS every year from private hospitals, which rarely have intensive care beds or dedicated resuscitation teams, with the state then left to pick up the pieces. In a letter seen by the Guardian, the health and social care secretary is calling for fairer remuneration for NHS organisations if they have to deal with the consequences of poor care or mistakes made in the independent sector. Private healthcare groups are understood to be particularly fearful of the introduction of a compensation scheme for patients who have to be transferred as a result of negligence, as it could hit their profits. Hunt’s warning comes during a national inquiry into the sector, expected to be published next summer, after the case of Ian Paterson, the breast surgeon who was jailed for 15 years last year for carrying out unnecessary operations in NHS and private hospitals. In his letter, Hunt threatened those independent hospitals rated inadequate with the same robust and rapid action currently restricted to failing NHS hospitals, including special measures, enforced changes to leadership teams and extra oversight. Of the 206 independent acute hospitals inspected in the CQC’s first comprehensive analysis of the sector, 62% were given a “good” rating overall and 8% were described as outstanding. However, 30% of private hospitals were deemed to need improvement. Four that were previously rated inadequate had improved. However, the CQC said it was particularly concerned about safety, with 41% of hospitals rated as requiring improvement in this area and 1% as inadequate. Almost a third were rated as requiring improvement and 3% as inadequate in terms of how well they were led. Hunt told the chief executives he expected greater transparency when patient safety mistakes had been made, for example by publishing patient outcomes by clinician as well as details of avoidable deaths, bringing the sector into line with the NHS. The health secretary also called for better governance procedures to make sure private hospitals took responsibility for the work and standards of private consultants, even if they were not technically employees. Ministers are concerned that some private hospitals currently avoid liability by saying a clinician is not an employee if something goes wrong. They also want clearer processes in place for managing a patient if their health deteriorates in private care and they have to be transferred to the NHS in an emergency. Hunt wrote: “Like many of my predecessors on both sides of the political divide, I believe that the independent sector can play a useful role in adding capacity, promoting innovation and offering patients choice. “However, if the sector is to partner with the NHS and benefit from our world-leading medical training, we need urgent assurances that the independent sector will get its house in order on safety, as well as a commitment to take rapid action to match the NHS’s world-recognised progress on transparency.” Whitehall insiders told the Guardian that if the providers failed to come up with an action plan within the two-week deadline, the Department of Health would press ahead with developing new policies to clamp down on poor practice without their cooperation. Some measures could be brought in within weeks but the whole package is likely to take several months to put in place. Health department officials believe they can proceed without legislation as they have a range of other mechanisms at their disposal. These could include leveraging the independent sector’s reliance on securing NHS contracts and treating NHS patients, as well the CQC’s licensing regime that enables hospitals to practice. Labour is expected to be broadly supportive of the plan. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has previously criticised the government for not doing enough to ensure private hospitals are as transparent about the quality of care they are providing as NHS hospitals. Although the CQC report found most of the hospitals were providing good quality care to patients, the regulator raised serious concerns about safety and leadership. The commission said the lack of effective oversight of consultants working for these hospitals but not formally employed by them was a major concern. It also found that some private hospitals had failed to learn from incidents and that there was a weakness around reporting. Also that where systems were in place, they were not as robust as required. One example highlighted operating theatres, where inspectors saw informal practices and instances where the World Health Organization surgical checklist was not being followed rigorously. The CQC said that where problems were identified, private hospitals were quick to make improvements, but acknowledged that there was still scope for action to be taken to address concerns in vital areas. The report provided the first comprehensive analysis of the quality of care provided by independent acute hospitals since the CQC introduced an inspection programme in 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/07/county-championship-cricket-nottinghamshire-set-hampshire-469-to-win-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T17:25:37Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Durham record historic win over Leics, Notts beat Hants – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/07/county-championship-cricket-nottinghamshire-set-hampshire-469-to-win-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/07/county-championship-cricket-nottinghamshire-set-hampshire-469-to-win-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Durham record historic win over Leics, Notts beat Hants – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Close of play round-up Division one Notts v Hampshire Notts 302 &amp; 389 for 9 dec; Hants 223 and 265 (Amla 112; Broad 3-57, Ball 3-64, Gurney 3-57) Nottinghamshire win by 203 runs.

Close of play scores to follow. ...but they might now, ninth man down, Parkinson to that man Weighell again, and IT’s OVER. Leicester all out for 101, Durham win by 46 runs and for the first time in their history following on. James Weighell takes what I’m going to hazard a guess is a career-best 7 for 32. What a game!

Weighell now has five for 32. ...and a seventh.. Raine for four. A fourth wicket for Weighell (4-31). Leicester need 49, Dexter not out 20 Leicestershire lose a sixth wicket, Eckersley c S Poynter b Weighell 15, now need another 60. Ah, just discovered that Trescothick was padded up and ready to bat if needed. All hail the Banger! And Leicestershire are making a bit of a balls-up at Durham, 70 for 5, chasing another 78. But, Rushworth, who had 3-12, is off the pitch with a suspected groin injury. Match drawn at The Oval too. Surrey 173-3 declared. Borthwick 82 not out, Foakes 11 not out. Morris 2-21. Disappointment for Stoneman again. Yorkshire travel to south London next week - get there if you can. Handshakes at Old Trafford. Somerset 269 for 8, Liam Parkinson 5-101. Smashing little rearguard action by Somerset after a post-lunch wobble. Super 66 not out from Leach - his highest first-class score. It’s all over at Trent Bridge. A heroic 317-minute Amla masterclass of 112 finally defeated by Jake Ball. Hampshire 265 all out; Ball 3-64, Broad 3-57. A third victory for Notts this season - could Pete Moores really lead a third club to the Championship title? And Leach is out finally, 131 balls, b Parkinson for 66, playing for spin and for his highest first-class score. And the left-field Lancashire decision to bowl Parkinson and Livingstone with the new ball has conjured up a wicket. Somerset 266 for 8, lead by 203 And FOUR DOWN at The Riverside. Rushworth 3-12. Leicester need 92 more. Leicestershire lose another, Cosgrove for 10, and at 40-3 need another 108. Getting tenser by the passing second there, but all tension has dissipated at Old Trafford as the players drift towards a 4.50pm handshake. Somerset 265 for 7 lead by 202. Another fifty-wicket partnership for Somerset, this time between Leach and Groenewald. And time is running very short now for a Lancashire run-chase. And Notts are just one wicket short of a third win. Amla 104 not out. And another one down at The Riverside - Leicestershire 30/2, a second for Rushworth. And Leicestershire 29 for 1, chasing 119. A wicket for Rushworth, Horton for 9. A wicket down at The Oval. Patel for 25, Surrey 145 for 3. And a hundred for Amla, can he really save Hampshire against his old club? 257 for 8. New ball to Clark and Livingstone. Whither Anderson? Ask the crowd (silently) Lots of sunburnt necks and lobster thighs still wandering about bank-holiday-bamboozled on the OT outfield.

Pakistan won by 9 wickets A second wicket for Harry Gurney leaves Hampshire holding on by a fragment of rope. At 241 for 8 they need 228 to win. And that is fifty for Jack Leach off 82 balls,in 102 minutes, a very irritating little innings for Lancashire, and a match-saving one for Somerset. Somerset lead is now 160 and time is starting to steal away. Sussex have done it! A great three-wicket win for them against Middlesex and a cohesive second innings of bits here and bobs there, in particular Ben Brown with 65 not out propping up the tail. Borthwick 52 not out, Surrey 126 for 2. Hampshire 231 for 6, needing 238, Amla 87 not out. No, make that seven down, Abbott c Wessels b Ball 10. Hampshire 236 for 7. Durham are all out (Griffiths 6-49) - Leicestershire need 147 to win. And Pakistan have won by 9 wickets. Sorry, bit delayed there by a bank holiday Magnum. Sussex have just lost a wicket - Burgess lbw Malan 22. Sussex 215 for 7, need just 15... And fifty for Ben Brown at Sussex - is it just me or have wicketkeepers got lots of runs this year? Sussex need just 25 to win. A WICKET! Just after the fifty partnership off 92 balls, Overton lbw Bailey for a very slow 5. Somerset 197 for 7(8) with a lead of 134. What an afternoon to spend at Hove. Hope the seagulls are soaring, Sussex need just 43 to win. And a huge six by Leach off Parkinson sails straight underneath the press box. Pakistan need just 45 to beat Northants, and Sussex inching closer against Middlesex - just 53 needed now, with four wickets in hand - a priceless little 49-run partnership between Burgess and Brown. Hampshire are struggling at 202 for 6, needing another 267, and Liam Dawson retired hurt with a hand injury. And an overheated listlessness hangs over Old Trafford. The first swifts of the year scream in the chalk-blue sky above the Old Trafford car park. No second-innings heroics for Rory Burns, c Barnard b Twohig 30. Surrey 74 for 2. And McManus out at Trent Bridge, a third for Broad. Hampshire 195 for six. Amla 65 not out. Sussex slowly knocking off the runs, just 64 needed now. And another one down for Durham, Poynter lbw Griffiths 13. Griffiths 4-43. Durham now 345 for 7. And as I write that’s ANOTHER - Rimmington for 0- and another for Griffiths, 5 wickets since lunch - Durham now 345- 8 with a lead of just 89. And while I wasn’t looking Durham have now lost three wickets since lunch: Smith, Richardson and Collingwood, all to Griffiths (3-35). Durham lead Leicestershire by 74. Lordy, That’s a fourth WICKET for Parkinson: Abell lbw Parkinson 13. Somerset 145 for 6, which is 7 really with the injured Trescothick hobbling about with a crutch, with a lead of just 82. So no cashing in for Stoneman after all, lbw Morris 20. Surrey 38 for 1. And the prize for first wicket to fall after lunch goes to Will Smith: c Dexter b Griffiths 74. And another one! This time at Old Trafford, Gregory c Livingstone b Mennie for 13, first ball of the second over after lunch. Somerset lead not in three figures yet and plenty of empty seats at Old Trafford...

Pakistan need 129 to win And in other news - Susie Bates has scored a hundred for Hampshire and a marmite question: An eventful last over before lunch from Anderson. Young Abell dug out a yorker at the very edge of the last second, then responded next ball with a nudge for four. Somerset 143 for 4, lead by 80. Batting looking vulnerable at Hove and Trent Bridge (excluding Amla 50 not out). Lunch scores to follow. A sixth wicket at Hove - a third for Harris! Finch c Simpson b Harris 11. Sussex thinking about lunch at a precarious 129 for 6, needing 98 to win. In fact we think this might be the first Championship game that Jimmy has bowled from the James Anderson end - any corrections welcome! And a spitting ball from Parkinson, who can blow ham sandwich and chicken korma in the same over. And Anderson has been hauled back before lunch at Old Trafford to break this crucial Abell-Gregory partnership. He replaces Joe Mennie at the James Anderson end, which must be very weird even now. His first spell this morning: 7-3-13-1. And as I send that Durham lose a third, Clark for 25, and Sussex a fourth, van Zyl for 45 and GOSH! a fifth. Luke Wright c and b Cartwright for a duck. Sussex 125 for 5: 105 to win. Hampshire are wobbling:161 for 5 - Amla 40 not out but Rossouw c Wessels b Broad 7 - need 308 more to win. Sussex were cruising but just lost Briggs for 39. Now 118 for 3, van Zyl 44 not out - they need 112 to win. Durham 304 for 2 on one of those Riverside wickets that gets better during the match: Will Smith 65, Graham Clark 25 Northants 295 for 8 against Pakistan. Abbas 4-62 - and just seen that Robert Newton got 118 before being lbw Abbas. Right: here are Virdi’s wickets. And another WICKET for Parkinson! Hildreth lbw Parkinson 26, plum as it comes. Parkinson visibly pumped, and Somerset 120 for 4 with a lead of 57.... hmmm getting a bit tasty And with a gung-ho sweep off Parkinson, Steve Davies brings up his fifty: 121 balls, seven fours. Somerset now 113 for 2 -no make that 3 - Davies now pushing forward gets an inside edge straight to short leg in the same over. c Croft b Parkinson 54. And a sixth for Virdi! 6-105, Barnard c and b for 66. Worcestershire 526 all out, lead by 92. A good chance for Stoneman to iron out the anxieties and pocket some easy runs this afternoon. This Old Trafford pitch really does look bootiful to bat on. Last week Glenn Chapple said that it was the best pitch in the country - not sure anyone here would disagree. It is a darn shame Hameed hasn’t been here to score some juicy runs on it in the sun, but in the game he played for Fornby against Wallasey on Saturday he made just 5 (1 x 4). He was lbw to a Matthew Wilcox - who had an excellent day, also dismissing Karl Brown and Stephen Parry in the same match. At Hove Sussex looking good still, need just 131 to win. And that’s a fifth for Virdi, who keeps just reeling them in.A maiden five-wicket haul. Josh Tongue c and b 9, Worcestershire 523 for 9. And a wicket at Durham : Cameron Steel lbw Raine 86; while Sussex have started well at Hove 85 for 2. At Old Trafford there’s a sweet little four off the hips from Davies - Somerset 85 for 2, t00 - and considerable sun, though no-one in the crowd has yet had the gumption to whip off their kecks and strip down to the nippy speedos that were spotted yesterday. And a fourth wicket for Virdi at The Oval: Leach c Borthwick b Virdi 18. Worcestershire 511 for 8. Yikes, somehow missed this, sorry. A wicket at Trent Bridge one of the first balls of the day: Wood b Ball 13, Hants now 123 for 4. And a wicket for Anderson! Bartlett forgot to move his feet and lbw Anderson 6. Somerset 67 for 2 - and a wicket at last for Burnley’s blond bombshell. And a wicket down at The Oval too, too much sun for 11 o’clock in the morning. Twohig a third wicket for Virdi: Worcestershire 469 for 7. And a wicket down at Old Trafford already, Parkinson’s second ball, a full-toss very well taken catch by Tom Bailey. Renshaw c Bailey b Parkinson 20. Somerset 51 for 2 Good morning from a serene Old Trafford on a beautiful Bank Holiday Monday. Hope you had a wonderful weekend –it was glorious at Hartington YHA - with some enthralling little contests to dip in and out of on the field too. The gateman here told me that I’d missed a wonderful innings from Dane Vilas - first double century by a Lancashire wicketkeeper -and a hardworking one by Keaton Jennings. Looks to be a draw here unless Lancashire can make a quick breakthrough on a wonderful batting strip - no wickets yet for James Anderson, who has beaten the bat now and then but looks a little match-weary as if the old body could do with a drop of oil in the joints and some nip in the shoes. Elsewhere, there were centuries for Joe Clarke, Nick Gubbins and Dawid Malan (first Test player to a hundred this season); and six wickets for Steve Patterson to skittle champions Essex in the thriller at Chelmsford. Baring surprises, the games to keep an eye on today are at Hove and Trent Bridge. Division one Notts v Hampshire Notts 302 &amp; 389 for 9 dec, Hants 223 and 111 for 3 Hampshire need 358 to beat Notts.

From multiple shorter races through the summer to a bucket list of events I’d love to do (yesterday’s Prague marathon coming high up that list) it’s sometimes a hard to keep track of what I’ve entered, how long it is until race day, and what’s coming up I like the sound of. Do you get old school with pen and paper and a calendar, or do you have a fancy app that tracks down to key races? I’d love your top tips, as I’ve yet to find something that works for me. One date for your diaries, however - at least if you are in or near to London - should be the upcoming Night of the 10k PBs on May 19th, this year featuring the European 10,000m Cup. It’s a fantastic afternoon and evening of top level running, from club runners through to the elites, which you watch right up close in lane three, beer in hand. This year race director Ben Pochee has added in a bridge over the track and a fly past by two Typhoons to boot. I mean really, what more can the man do do tempt you? Oh, and it’s all free. Well, not the beer, you’ll have to fork out for that. So, as always, over to you.

Four volunteer researchers have spent a year searching through the 35,000 books and files held in the library and archives of the Flemish abbey, first founded in 1128 by Saint Norbert of Xanten, and they cannot find the original recipe. The monks last produced their dark brew in 1797, at which point the French Revolution shattered the monks’ communal life and their abbey’s walls. They reinstated their home on the same site, in the province of Flemish Brabant, six miles (10km) north of Brussels, shortly afterwards, but the monks did not brew again. In 1958, they came to a deal for the Belgian Maes brewery to use their brand, and today the beer is produced by the Alken-Maes brewery for Belgian drinkers and by a Carlsberg-owned brewery in Strasbourg for foreign markets. The abbey’s subprior, Karel Stautemas, said: “It is an old dream to start again. Four men have been looking for that document for a year … “Every day we get visitors who ask where the brewery is. And if you come from abroad, they do not understand that we do not brew beer. This is how the idea of re-establishing that tradition came to fruition.” Stautemas said the abbey had received the support of Alken-Maes and Carlsberg for a micro-brewery “in the same place as where the brewery stood here until 1797”. “Because we know the location, we have already found it in our archives,” he said. “We also have documents showing that the fathers then bought barley from local farmers. We even know all the ingredients. The only thing we do not know is how much we have to take from each. The composition is unavailable for now.” Stautemas said he was still hopeful that the team of researchers would be successful in time. “They are not even halfway through [the records],” he told the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. “It is not such an easy job either, because those texts are in Old Dutch. But there is good hope that the recipe will turn up. And then there is the question: do we still like that medieval beer today?” He added: “If everything goes as we hope and if we find the recipe quickly, we will drink our new Grimbergen at the New Year’s reception in 2020. “The other types will also continue to exist. We can’t handle mass production. It will be a nice addition to the existing offer. And from then on, we will be able to show and offer the visitors something from the house.” The Norbertine monks of Grimbergen use the phoenix as their symbol, in reflection of the abbey’s perpetual rebirth, and the motto “Ardet nec consumitur” (burned but not destroyed)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/07/get-your-hands-off-my-double-entendres-is-the-smutty-pun-now-under-attack-carry-on-great-british-bake-off","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T12:28:50Z","webTitle":"Get your hands off my double entendres!

Is the smutty pun now under attack?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If you want a double entendre, I’ll give you one. They pop up all over the place: on risque chat shows hosted by Graham Norton and Alan Carr, on the Radio 1 mainstay Innuendo Bingo and on Mrs Brown’s Boys, the hit BBC sitcom saturated in smut that attracts seven million viewers. You can’t watch an episode of The Great British Bake Off without having soggy bottoms, moist ladyfingers and manhandled dough balls shoved down your throat. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins may have gone, taking with them such exclamations as “Time to reveal your cracks!”, but Noel Fielding has cheerfully filled their hole. “If there’s an opportunity for exposed bottoms, we should embrace it,” he said during his debut season. With 11 million viewers, he certainly enjoyed a big opening. Looking farther back, the late Terry Wogan incorporated highly suggestive Janet and John stories into his breakfast radio show, while the long-running Radio 4 quiz I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue prides itself on innuendo. The double entendre is a robust cultural fixture, having endured since at least the 10th century. (The Exeter Book, circa AD990, includes several phallic-oriented riddles. What is “stiff and hard” and “hangs by the thigh of a man”? A key, of course.) It allows us, in our squeamishness, to talk about sex at one remove, to approach the flame without singeing our extremities. At its cleverest, it provides opportunities for linguistic inventiveness and dexterity. It is there in several decades of Carry On films, more than 100 years of music-hall and thousands of saucy seaside postcards by the much-prosecuted, frequently banned, George Orwell-approved Donald McGill. It is there when a corporal tells Blackadder as he bravely faces the firing squad: “I must say, Captain, I’ve got to admire your balls.” “Perhaps later,” comes the reply. And it has penetrated popular music from Chuck Berry’s ding-a-ling to Kelis’s milkshake. Though if it’s parochial British innuendo we’re talking about, there is no beating East 17’s quaint spin on Prince-style seduction: “Yeah, I’ll butter the toast / If you lick the knife.” The question now, though, is whether this tradition can survive in the necessarily sensitive climate of #MeToo. An early indication that its days could be numbered came in Staffordshire recently, when a butcher called Pete Lymer was reportedly ordered to remove signs advertising “big-breasted birds”, a “big fresh cock” and the chance to “have your rump tenderised before you leave”. Arguably more offensive was his flagrant use of the greengrocer’s apostrophe (“ladie’s”, “chicken’s”), though police appear unwilling to take action over that. There is also the problem that not all his smut was intelligible. An offer of a “horny sausage” surely fails to qualify even as a single entendre. Can a penis itself be horny, independent of its owner? Logic would suggest not. And who would buy a sausage that had sprouted horns anyway? But the point stands. In a society only now beginning to acknowledge a widespread culture of male sexual entitlement, can smut really continue to be considered harmless? “I wonder if we’re not becoming too sensitive about it,” says Stephen Bailey, a gay Mancunian comic whose own use of double entendres is restricted to the title of his current standup show, Can’t Think Straight. “It seems completely different to #MeToo, which is about men in positions of power sexually abusing their victims. Where is the abuse of power in a butcher’s blackboard? He’s using the correct terminology. It’s only our filthy brains that have made ‘cock’ a dirty word. And there’s a big difference between him putting out a sign about ‘big breasts’ and him making lewd remarks at a woman or rubbing his thighs.” Bailey’s show contains explicit sexual material but again it’s all about context: the same jokes told by Roy Chubby Brown or the late Bernard Manning would sound aggressive, whereas Bailey’s ejaculations are far easier to swallow. If the double entendre is endangered, it is news to Simon Thorp, who has been writing for Viz magazine since 1985. Among his best-known creations is the comic strip Finbarr Saunders and His Double Entendres, the everyday story of a boy alert to the sexual meaning in the most innocent exchange, while remaining largely oblivious to actual sex between his mother and Mr Gimlet that is occurring right under his nose. “I can’t remember what inspired me,” Thorp says. “I’d probably just watched a Carry On or something. I’ve always been endlessly impressed by how they squeeze all those double entendres in. When Finbarr started out, it was usually things like, ‘Ooh, I’ve got a big one.’ Single entendres, really. You can’t keep doing that for ever, so I started making them ruder and more convoluted. Now a character will spend several frames building the setup to one. I see how long I can keep it up.” A cursory glance at recent examples bears this out. Four panels in one strip alone are devoted to setting up a payoff involving Fanny Cradock, King Kong and a bowl of Eton mess. In another, Mr Gimlet’s visit to a pet shop inspires tales of horse-riding (“On a recent holiday in Morocco, I paid £10 for the privilege of being tossed off by a frisky young Arab”) and hedgehog care (“I had to use an old sock to wipe the sticky gunk out of my hog’s eye”). But the strip stops just short of an Are You Being Served? homage. Asked if his wife has ever owned a particularly hirsute cat, Mr Gimlet answers anti climactically: “Not really, no.” But then if a US presidential candidate can talk shamelessly about grabbing women’s genitals and still end up in the White House, perhaps there is no place in the world any more for allusions to Mrs Slocombe’s pussy. (Coincidentally, a widely panned revival of Are You Being Served? appeared a month after Donald Trump was elected.) For the double entendre to persist, there needs to be a sense it is using code to say the unsayable. Without some social etiquette and politeness in place, we lose the comic thrill when they are breached. As the category of the taboo shrinks, the need for innuendo has shrivelled up along with it. At its most effective, it can be a tool for the powerless. Mainstream audiences in the mid-1960s chortled at examples of Polari, the coded gay language of Julian and Sandy ( Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Williams, respectively) on the radio show Round the Horne. When the couple claimed to be lawyers, and to have “a criminal practice that takes up much of our time”, listeners knew exactly which practice they were referring to: homosexuality had yet to be decriminalised. For Bailey, innuendo was often the only way to hear gay references in comedy when he was growing up. “The stuff that Lily Savage and Julian Clary got away with! It wouldn’t be allowed now. But double entendres were always a good way of getting your sexy material on TV without upsetting anyone.” Clary remains a master of the form. His New Statesman columns from 10 years ago were sticky linguistic labyrinths where every turn brought the reader slap-bang into another bodily fluid or impressive engorgement. “I have a Virginia creeper shooting up my kitchen garden wall and I have similar hopes for a frisky young hod-carrier called Brett,” he wrote in one column. Remarking on the reactions of his friends to all the fetching labourers working in his garden, he continued: “There are positive cat fights over who should mince outside with a tray of tea and ask, ‘Who could manage a chocolate finger?’” As a language to describe acts and desires that polite society deems inexpressible, innuendo can be a vital way of keeping things visible. “Sometimes I think we’ve regressed,” says Bailey. “Lily Savage was a gay man, a drag queen, doing sexual material, talking about ‘gobbling’ – and mainstream audiences loved it. The presenters of Loose Women can sit around discussing their sex lives and yet when I’ve done TV, I’ve had people behind the scenes say, ‘Can you do your working-class material rather than your gay material?’” There may be discomfort today about watching Carry On films, but the lecherous males smacking their lips and making “phwoar” noises in those comedies are hardly being held up as idealised specimens of masculinity. “Look at the men in those films,” says Thorp. “Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Williams. Even Sid James never gets any. That sums up the attitude toward sex in the Carry Ons and in British humour in general. You might want it – but if it turns up, you run away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/07/rae-sreummurd-sr3mm-album-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T10:28:58Z","webTitle":"Rae Sremmurd: SR3MM review – Outkast's would-be successors think too big","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/rae-sreummurd-sr3mm-album-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/07/rae-sreummurd-sr3mm-album-review","fields":{"headline":"Rae Sremmurd: SR3MM review – Outkast's would-be successors think too big","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"No one is ever going to accuse Rae Sremmurd of lacking ambition. It’s not so much that the duo announced that their third album was made in the image of Outkast’s 2003 album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, although that in itself obviously constitutes fighting talk: Speakerboxxx/The Love Below went 11 times platinum in the US alone, won three Grammys and so dominated pop music on release that the only thing that could depose its first single Hey Ya! from the top of the US chart was its follow-up, The Way You Move. It’s more that the Brown brothers and their producer Mike Will Made-It have suggested that it’s an improvement on Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. In addition to two solo albums, Swae Lee’s Swaecation and Slim Jxmmi’s Jmxtro, it also features a collaborative effort: “Outkast fans, we still waiting on that, the next project with both of them together,” said their producer, clearly no great fan of Outkast’s admittedly flawed but undoubtedly collaborative 2006 follow-up Idlewild. Rae Sremmurd divide up along roughly Outkast-ish lines, with Swae Lee in the Andre 3000 role as a kind of romantic, psychedelic star-child, as given to crooning as he is to rapping – the cover of SR3MM features him with a rose between his teeth and arms filled with cuddly toys – and Slim Jxmmi the keeper of the hip-hop flame in Big Boi mode. The music on Swaecation accordingly tends towards the spacey and lovelorn – waves crash, guitars jangle, everything is drenched in echo and Lost Angels sounds not unlike the hazy, hypnagogic synthpop of Washed Out – and the words follow suit: “Colours burst and all I see are shapes, sun goes away and that’s when I call your name.” Jmxtro, meanwhile cleaves to a more straightforward, sparse trap blueprint, and the lyrical concerns are noticeably more earthy: “I’mma go fuck with the strippers tonight.” The problem with the Outkast comparison is that Speakerboxxx/The Love Below was one of those rare occasions when an artist maxes out the capacity of two CDs without longueurs or recourse to filler – it had to be two-and-a-half hours long to accommodate the duo’s multiplicity of musical ideas, which stirred everything from trad jazz to drum’n’bass to 60s sunshine pop into the mix. Once Rae Sremmurd have established their two distinct personas, they’re set: their respective albums continue in the vein the opening tracks establish without really throwing any curveballs (a bizarre appearance by Pharrell Williams notwithstanding, singing in an eerie, alien falsetto on Jmxtro’s Chanel). That isn’t to say that what’s here isn’t good: it’s frequently very good indeed. The emo future-R&amp;B songs on Swaecation are lush with melodies, while Jmxto’s Mike Will Made-It authored beats are impressively tough, not least the electrifying Brxnks Truck and the swooping bassline of Keep God First. It’s just that the grandness of the presentation slightly oversells the contents. Neither of the albums are as epic a statement as the concept suggests, and the best tracks from each could happily live side by side on a single album. A similar desire for grandiosity also slightly undermines the collaborative album SR3MM. Brevity is currently having a moment in hip-hop – hotly-tipped Chicago rapper Valee’s tracks frequently clock in at under two minutes – and it’s certainly Rae Sremmund’s friend: good with tunes, but not big on lyrical depth or spellbinding storytelling, their music works best when it hits you with its hooks, then scarpers quickly. Take Close: concise and taut, based around a sinister keyboard figure and blessed with a surprisingly relaxed verse from Travis Scott, it is teeming with ideas. When it hangs around for five minutes – as on Bedtime Stories or Up in My Cocina – their talent is spread thin, and things become too repetitious for their own good. The former in particular is a really great track, complete with a guest appearance by the Weeknd, that loses its force the longer it lasts. Still, at least album highlight Powerglide justifies its five-minute length, by dint of being equipped with a fantastic, propulsive sample sourced from Side 2 Side, a 2009 single by Three 6 Mafia (whose Juicy J makes a cameo appearance) and a chorus so brilliant and addictive it’s impossible to hear it enough times. It’s followed by Rock N Roll Hall of Fame, a track in the mode of the Mannequin Challenge-soundtracking 2016 hit Black Beatles, the bragging undercut by oddly mournful music, a vague hint of hurt in the lyrics about the way Rae Sremmurd were initially received: “I’m feeling pain, but I don’t know how to show it … put a little hit on the charts and they know it.” Mocked from the start as shallow, an accusation that’s never quite left them no matter how many platinum singles they make, you can understand why Rae Sremmund might want to make an ostentatious artistic statement. The result is a decent triple album, but it would have been better yet boiled down to an eclectic single album, the best solo tracks sitting alongside the group efforts: not so much reining ambitions in as realising less is sometimes more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/08/malaysia-election-pm-najib-razak-in-fight-for-political-survival","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T23:56:51Z","webTitle":"Malaysia election: PM Najib Razak in fight for political survival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/malaysia-election-pm-najib-razak-in-fight-for-political-survival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/08/malaysia-election-pm-najib-razak-in-fight-for-political-survival","fields":{"headline":"Malaysia election: PM Najib Razak in fight for political survival","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, is facing a fight for his political survival when the country goes to the polls this week, after his strong lead over rival Dr Mahathir Mohamad narrowed sharply. Najib, who has been in power since 2009, was initially thought to be guaranteed an easy win in Wednesday’s elections. But in the past few weeks the tide has turned against him, even in the rural Malay heartlands that have long been strongholds for the ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional (BN). Many are now predicting that the government will once again lose the popular vote, though thanks to recent gerrymandering and the redrawing of electoral boundaries it will still be able to hold on to power. Figures within Umno, Najib’s party in the ruling coalition, say that if Najib wins fewer than 130 seats out of a total of 222 (BN currently holds 133), then he is likely to face a post-election leadership challenge. Most of the election narrative has been controlled by the opposition, led by former prime minister Mahathir, who led the country between 1981 and 2003, and at 92 years old has returned to topple Najib, his former protege. Mahathir was once head of Umno himself but has switched sides in this election to run against Najib. Najib has also faced growing criticism from within his own party. Last week Umno sacked two senior leaders and suspended another – all long-time loyalists of Mahathir – for speaking against Najib and attending opposition events. Much of the criticism of Najib has been focused on his role in the huge 1MDB scandal, where $2.6bn from a government fund he was overseeing was embezzled and spent around the worldand $681m of it was alleged to have ended up in his personal bank account. “I think there’s definitely momentum for change happening across the country,” said Bridget Welsh, a Malaysia expert from John Cabot University. “Najib walked into this election very strong and it was his election to lose. But so far in the campaign he has been losing the narrative and as a result there has been a lot of movement away from him.” While opposition rallies have been packed out, and the “Mahathir factor” has drawn a lot of media attention towards the opposition, the election will be decided by a large silent majority, many of whom live in remote rural areas of Malaysia and traditionally have voted for BN. Among rural farmers and ethnic Malay in states such as Sabah and Sarawak – which account for 60% of Malaysia’s land mass – Najib demands huge loyalty for the generous subsidies given out, and issues such as the 1MDB corruption scandal do not factor in their voting choices. For Najib to lose the election it would require a huge swing away from him in these areas, which is still unlikely. In a statement released on Monday, Najib took a final dig at the opposition “whose only reason for coming together is to selfishly gain power for themselves”. “Do not be fooled either by the tears and the ridiculous allegations of sabotage or even assassination,” Najib said of Mahathir. “A former dictator, as he has called himself, does not change. He has apologised sincerely for nothing. The truth is he trying to use his former allies, just as they are trying to use him. Their hypocrisy is breathtaking.” There is also concern that with the election result likely to be tight, unfair and nefarious tactics such as vote-buying might be more rife than usual. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia has had its application to monitor the election denied. Instead the election will be overseen by observers from a selection of countries with questionable democratic credentials, including Indonesia, Thailand, the Maldives, Timor-Leste, Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Kyrgyzstan. Only Timor-Leste is considered a free democracy by Freedom House, while Thailand is run by an unelected military government, and Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan are classified as authoritarian regimes. According to Welsh, the election drama and cult of personality around Najib are likely to spin out long after polling day. “The narrative is all about Najib and he has taken a risk by making it all about him, so that could come with high rewards or high losses,” she said. “Whatever happens, we are definitely heading towards a scenario of change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/07/debate-on-god-language-doesnt-mean-all-quakers-are-losing-faith","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T17:13:02Z","webTitle":"Debate on ‘God language’ doesn’t mean all Quakers are losing faith | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/debate-on-god-language-doesnt-mean-all-quakers-are-losing-faith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/07/debate-on-god-language-doesnt-mean-all-quakers-are-losing-faith","fields":{"headline":"Debate on ‘God language’ doesn’t mean all Quakers are losing faith","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Simon Jenkins has it only half right (The Quakers are right. We don’t need God, 4 May). Quakers are indeed in the process of looking at the language in their “book of words”. It is a long and thoughtful process which happens every generation or so. But discomfort with “God language”is not the same thing as the abandonment of a spiritual life. Even non-theist Quakers have a spiritual life, and certainly don’t come to meetings just for fellowship. Nor is this questioning of the terms we use anything to do with a search for “comfort”. The Quaker Testimonies (to truth and integrity, simplicity, equality and peace) by which we aim to live our lives are hugely challenging. What Quakerism offers is a space to explore on one’s spiritual journey. The range of expression we use is part of a richness, not a limitation. Helen Porter Newtown, Powys • As a long-standing Quaker, I write with some concern after reading Simon Jenkins’ article. While there is certainly a spectrum of beliefs among Quakers, including those who call themselves “non-theists”, the question is more to do with how Friends think of God than of his absence. No one denies the Christian roots of Quakerism and anyway I doubt that it’s possible to “clear God from the room”. Quakers are still officially called The Religious Society of Friends. They are more than a secular society, however therapeutic that may be. Incidentally, Quaker Oats are not Quaker, and today they wouldn’t have been allowed to appropriate the name as their trademark. Thelma Percy Bognor Regis, West Sussex • Simon Jenkins’ thoughtful article deserves a much longer treatment. As the Dalai Lama has said, “we can do without religion, but not without spirituality”. But there is a problem with the word “spirituality” in normal discourse: it usually implies some aspect of the supernatural. It is important for many of us to reclaim such “religious” language and recast spirituality in a non-supernatural way, so that it is more to do with love, compassion, harmony, forgiveness and so on – closer, perhaps, to the meaning of “enlightenment”. I have tried to do this in the book Buddhism#Now, using words such as “sublime” and “revered” in place of “divine” and “sacred”. We may get to the same state of mind in the end, just without God. Dr Nigel Mellor Newcastle • Fr Alec Mitchell’s question (Letters, 5 May) about what can be substituted for the G-word in George Fox’s “that of God in everyone” is easily answered: replace “G” with a lowercase “g” and make it a double “o”: “that of good in everyone”.

They are legacy terms from a one-off campaign that will, on Brexit day, become obsolete. Does remain then become rejoin? Will leavers turn into stay-outers? Or perhaps the labels will outlive their original function. It happens. People who describe politics in terms of “left” and “right” aren’t talking about seating arrangements in the French national assembly at the end of the 18th century, although that is where the categories were born. I doubt that the Brexit brands will be so durable, or mutate so far, but they have come a long way already. Remainer is the more elastic of the two. It applies to full-throttle revanchists who campaign to dispose of Brexit altogether. But it is also used for soft-leavers in the cabinet who have signed up to Theresa May’s negotiating agenda, and that doesn’t involve much remaining at all. Beyond Westminster, there is a tenuous link between domestic Brexit tribes and the institutions commonly (and inaccurately) called “Brussels”. Some ideological Eurosceptics read the treaties before denouncing them, but they are a minority of leave voters. Most wanted rid of the European Union for less precise reasons. Remainers and leavers accuse each other of exaggerated passion – naively romantic or aggressively paranoid – for concepts that are only tangentially connected to the actual EU. Both are right. Britain’s membership of the club has become a proxy for culture wars fought on multiple fronts: immigration, globalisation, environmentalism, even penal policy. Attitudes to capital punishment and multiculturalism were a better predictor of people’s attitudes towards the EU in 2016 than whether they voted Labour or Tory in previous elections. A misalignment of party allegiance and territorial strongholds in the Brexit culture war is wreaking havoc with conventional political models. That, in part, was the story of last week’s local elections. It doesn’t matter to leave voters in, say, Amber Valley, that Jeremy Corbyn endorses the referendum outcome. His party hums with the socially liberal, metropolitan cultural vibrations of Brexit-bashing London. So Labour did fine in the capital and other big cities, but struggled to capture more provincial targets. Many of the Tory high priests of Brexit style themselves as liberals. Boris Johnson is much more relaxed about immigration than May. Michael Gove is waging a millennial-friendly war on discarded plastic. But a Govian eco-Brexit doesn’t impress remain voters in Richmond upon Thames, who see it as a green patina only recently formed on the roof of a church whose patron saint is Nigel Farage and whose guiding creeds are social conservatism and reactionary nostalgia. Many Tory leavers resent that characterisation. But if they didn’t want their image contaminated by bitter intolerance, they should have been more careful about the company they kept in the referendum campaign, and the racially tinted messages they borrowed. Besides, backbench Eurosceptic hardliners keep the flame of nationalist grievance roaring because it burns bridges to Europe so much more efficiently than their own rarefied arguments about regulatory divergence. Jacob Rees-Mogg would not have as much purchase on the current debate over customs regimes, for example, if it were framed as the quest for a technical solution to a problem raised by May’s commitment to a very hard version of Brexit (which it is). His voice is amplified by culture warrior megaphones, rallying leave partisans to defend the one true Brexit against treasonous counterfeits. That dynamic is hardwired into the whole project. There is a mismatch between leave culture, which thrives on heroic simplifications, and leaving in practice, which is a labyrinth of unheroic complications. The deeper into the maze May plunges, the harder it gets for those who campaigned with promises of a swift and easy escape to express sincere satisfaction with the final product. Many Tories will decide that any Brexit is better than none. They will murmur their assent to May’s deal and, once Britain has been bundled out of the EU, agitate for new leadership. They will not reject May’s Brexit, but nor will they rush to own it. That is because none of the advertised benefits of leaving the EU will materialise. Leavers will experience total victory in the political battle over EU membership, but without equivalent advances in the culture war. May’s deal will not accelerate reconciliation between a younger, liberal generation that feels its future has just been vandalised by its angry elders. And, over time, the brutal logic of human mortality favours the junior cohort. I don’t like the ugly, ghoulish habit that some remainers have of mapping a route to pro-European majorities through the graveyards of ageing leavers. Still, the underlying demographic observation is not entirely false. A less macabre observation in the same vein is that the historical trend is for British provinces to look and behave more like the big cities, not the reverse. In terms of social attitudes, where London goes, Nuneaton follows. And when politics is consumed by culture wars, that is bad news for the Tories, even if Brexit passes without economic calamity. The remainer tribe isn’t going to renounce its metropolitan mores just because the cause of remaining in the EU is lost. And the leaver tribe, upon leaving, will cling to grievances that were channelled against Brussels but not caused there. Neither side will cherish May’s messy deal and, because it will be unloved in the country, few MPs will have much incentive to defend it. There may be no shortage of will to deliver Britain out of the EU now, but in time there will be a great washing of hands and collective denial of responsibility for the deed. Brexit is the adopted child of a whole generation of politicians. It will be an orphan one day. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/eea-vote-lords-theresa-may-brexit-suropean-economic-area-post-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"With the EEA vote, the Lords can set Theresa May on the right Brexit path | Stephen Kinnock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/eea-vote-lords-theresa-may-brexit-suropean-economic-area-post-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/eea-vote-lords-theresa-may-brexit-suropean-economic-area-post-eu","fields":{"headline":"With the EEA vote, the Lords can set Theresa May on the right Brexit path","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The House of Lords has so far responded in a robust, rational and highly effective manner to the government’s EU withdrawal bill. But the most important test of the peers’ resolve is yet to come. On Tuesday an amendment to the withdrawal bill will be tabled in the Lords that, if passed by the Commons, would commit the government to keeping the United Kingdom in the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA is an internal market between the EU28 and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. It was established with the purpose of allowing the further participation of non-EU states in a single market (including services), but this excludes agricultural and fisheries sectors and the EU customs union. As article 1 of its founding treaty, the EEA agreement, states: “The aim of this agreement of association is to promote a continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the contracting parties with equal conditions of competition, and the respect of the same rules.” Article 1 is pivotal, because it unambiguously confirms that the EEA is a commercial association, not a political project. There is no mention of “ever closer union”, and no reference to the post-Maastricht pillars of the European project such as the common foreign and security policy or common security and defence policy. If the UK were to commit to an EEA-based Brexit we would essentially be returning to the original terms and premise of our pre-Maastricht membership of the European Community. The Brexiteers have of course been up in arms about the unelected peers attempting to thwart “the will of the people”. But their complaints are utterly lacking in credibility, given that David Davis, Liam Fox and Jacob Rees-Mogg have consistently voted against attempts to democratise our second chamber. And the fact is that the 52-48 result of the referendum was clearly not a mandate for a reckless Brexit at any cost, a point that was then further rammed home by the result of the general election. One message should be clear: yes, we must leave the European Union so that we can secure a greater degree of control over our borders, laws and money, but we must do so without wrecking the economy, and without burning bridges with our European partners and allies. Of course, the economy is not the Lords’ only consideration. It must consider how best we can protect the terms of the Good Friday agreement by ensuring that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. The customs union amendment goes some way towards that aim, but it is not sufficient – it would not provide a framework for the harmonisation of regulations and product standards that is fundamental to frictionless trade across the Irish land border. Only membership of the EEA in conjunction with a customs union can secure that objective. And then there is the issue of time. We’re almost two years on from the referendum, and around six months from the meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement. And yet there is still a deeply entrenched impasse between the government and the EU around the fundamentals of our future trading relationship. The EEA is an off-the-shelf, ready-made package and well understood arrangement that has existed since 1993. By committing to an EEA-based Brexit the government would be providing business, consumers and our entire country with the certainty and stability that is so desperately needed. One of the arguments most frequently deployed against the EEA is that it would relegate the UK to the status of a “vassal state”. This is patently wrong. EEA countries are not subject to the supremacy of EU law. Any rules relating to the aspects of the single market that apply within the EEA internal market must be passed by the national parliaments of the EEA countries. And EEA countries are not subject to the direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice (ECJ). The EEA is overseen by the Efta court, and disputes are managed by the Efta Surveillance Authority. The Efta court routinely makes decisions and rulings that diverge from the ECJ, and it would of course have at least one British judge, if we were to join – most observers agree that there would likely be two British judges. For those concerned about EU immigration, articles 112 and 113 of the EEA agreement offer the possibility of unilaterally suspending the operation of any one of the four freedoms – including the free movement of labour – subject to the presentation of a political case to the EU27 outlining the presence of “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”. There is legal precedent for this through protocol 15 of the EEA agreement, which applies to Liechtenstein and would have been offered to the Swiss, if they had chosen to join the EEA. And Britain would only pay for what is accessed from the single market. This means it would not transgress the prime minister’s red lines on the single market or on ECJ jurisdiction, while offering veto power through the EEA joint committee, which determines whether EU laws and directives are relevant to the EEA and/or whether adaptations are necessary. It would also give us access to expert working groups and agencies, alongside EU member states. This gives EEA governments multiple opportunities to shape and influence EU regulations and directives before they are approved. EEA governments do not have voting rights in any of these settings, but the vast majority of decisions in Brussels are taken by consensus in any case, and the views of EEA countries play an important part in the decision-making process. On 13 December 2017 Labour MPs were whipped to support my colleague Heidi Alexander’s amendment to the Withdrawal Bill, which would have secured an EEA-based Brexit. It is somewhat baffling then that Labour peers are apparently being whipped to abstain on this amendment. I hope that this is simply a misunderstanding, and that consistency and coherence will have returned by the time the division bell rings. Because the fact is that the division bell is also ringing for the Prime Minister. She cannot keep kicking the can down the road indefinitely. She must now decide which path to choose: will she follow the Brexit-at-any-cost diktats of the likes of Rees-Mogg, or will she opt for a Brexit that actually reflects the real concerns of the British people? On Tuesday, the Lords can play a vitally important role in ensuring that Theresa May chooses the right path. It is imperative that it does so. • Stephen Kinnock is Labour MP for Aberavon and a member of the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/07/sir-alex-ferguson-messages-of-support-flood-in","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T15:31:44Z","webTitle":"Sir Alex Ferguson: messages of support flood in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/07/sir-alex-ferguson-messages-of-support-flood-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/07/sir-alex-ferguson-messages-of-support-flood-in","fields":{"headline":"Sir Alex Ferguson: messages of support flood in","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester United players past and present have offered support for “father figure” Sir Alex Ferguson as the football world waited for news on his recovery from a brain haemorrhage. The 76-year-old former Manchester United manager remains in intensive care at Salford Royal hospital after he underwent emergency surgery on Saturday. Neither the hospital nor the club were able to issue an update on Ferguson’s condition on Monday as messages of support continued to flood in. United previously said his operation had “gone very well” but that he needed a period of intensive care. Phil Jones, an England international who was signed by Ferguson from Blackburn in 2011, was among many current and former players to offer public messages of support for him on Monday. “He is such a legend in my eyes. He is the one who brought me to the club and gave me that opportunity to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world,” said Jones, who has made 190 appearances for United. “He’s taken me under his wing like a father and it was shocking, it’s sad, but I know his character. I know he has that fight in him. Hopefully he’ll recover well. He has got all his family and friends around him, the support from all the players and staff at Man United and football around the world. “When something like that does happen, it’s nice that the football world comes together and shows support and we are all rooting for him. I’m sure he will be fine.” The Football Association, Premier League, Fifa, Uefa and individual clubs from Britain and around the world all tweeted their best wishes. The Wales manager, Ryan Giggs, who was given his United debut by Ferguson in 1991 aged 17, told BBC Wales: “Now is the time to pray and hope he can make a full recovery. He has been the biggest influence in my career, both on and off the pitch. I know the operation has been a success – but he is a fighter and that is what makes me think that he will be able to make a recovery.” United midfielder Juan Mata said the team would channel Ferguson’s spirit in their final three games of the season, culminating in the FA Cup final against Chelsea on Saturday 19 May. The Spaniard wrote in a blogpost: “This Saturday, all of us were overwhelmed by the news about Sir Alex Ferguson’s health condition. This circumstance has had a huge impact on Manchester United, as you can imagine. “All of us are united right now, wishing Sir Alex a speedy recovery. He has been a unique and fundamental figure in the football world over the last few decades. “I’ve never been coached by him, unfortunately, yet I know well his incomparable legacy on this club, that winning mentality and fighting [gene] that we must honour in the last three games of the season, especially in the FA Cup final. To achieve that, we are going to work hard while we eagerly await good news about Sir Alex’s recovery.” Ferguson has been at Salford Royal, just three miles from United’s Old Trafford stadium, since Saturday where he arrived under a police escort after first being taken to Macclesfield district hospital near his home in Cheshire. His family – including his wife, Cathy, and his son, Darren, the manager of Doncaster Rovers – were understood to be at his bedside."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/07/ontario-non-binary-birth-certificate-canada-transgender","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T19:02:36Z","webTitle":"Transgender rights: Ontario issues first non-binary birth certificate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/ontario-non-binary-birth-certificate-canada-transgender","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/07/ontario-non-binary-birth-certificate-canada-transgender","fields":{"headline":"Transgender rights: Ontario issues first non-binary birth certificate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Canada’s largest province has issued its first non-binary birth certificate, marking the culmination of a successful human rights claim against Ontario. Joshua Ferguson had waited nearly a year after petitioning the provincial government for a new birth certificate in order to change the document from male to non-binary, as Ferguson identifies as neither male nor female. Instead, the film-maker uses the pronoun “they”. “It’s a victory for me. It’s a victory for the trans community,” Ferguson told reporters on Monday. Born in Ontario but now residing in Vancouver, Ferguson had travelled to Toronto to apply for the new birth certificate, which they said would better reflect their identity. Ferguson’s successful application follows a push by the transgender activist Gemma Hickey, whose non-binary birth certificate in Newfoundland and Labrador last year marked a first for Canada. Ontario now provides several options for gender on birth certificates. In Ferguson’s case, gender is denoted by an “X”, but petitioners can also have their gender removed altogether from the official document. Ontario issued its first gender-neutral driving licenses and health identification cards last year. The federal government has said it will soon give Canadians the options to choose a third gender option when applying for a passport, a departure from the standard “male” or “female” options. In 2017, California passed legislation to allow non-binary as an option for birth certificates, a law to go into effect in 2018. “I feel a sense of relief because I know that this policy will save lives,” said Ferguson. A study released last year showed a significant number of trans youth in western Canada had contemplated suicide. “I felt hope in my heart for the time when all of us are valued and respected as human beings,” Ferguson wrote in the caption of a photograph posted to social media. “It’s what truly matters.” “This result pleases me greatly,” said Susan Gapka, a veteran trans activist in Toronto. While indicators of skin and eye colour have been discarded, said Gapka, gender identity has until recently remained fairly rigid on government documents. “We now have an ever-expanding and ever broadening understanding gender categories. Joshua’s outcome should be seen as a success.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/08/morning-mail-budget-priorities-trumps-iran-call-hawke-in-hospital","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T20:59:28Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: voters back education and health funding above tax cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/morning-mail-budget-priorities-trumps-iran-call-hawke-in-hospital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/morning-mail-budget-priorities-trumps-iran-call-hawke-in-hospital","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: voters back education and health funding above tax cuts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 8 May. Top stories Voters rank funding for hospitals and schools, and help for job-creating industries as more important than the personal income tax cuts the government is poised to deliver as the centrepiece of Tuesday’s budget. The latest Guardian Essential poll suggests tax cuts would need to be in the order of $25 to $35 a week to make a practical difference to families at a time of stagnant wages growth. Asked to rate their budget priorities, the survey of 1,033 voters nominated increased spending for healthcare (67%), age pensions (56%), education (55%) and affordable housing (52%). The government has also foreshadowed spending on infrastructure in the states that will determine the outcome of the next federal election, and a return to budget balance earlier than forecast, on the back of a substantial improvement in revenue collections. There will also be a substantial package for aged care, including a big spend on expanding in-home care. We will have live coverage of the budget throughout the day, with full reports and analysis when Scott Morrison begins his speech at 7.30pm AEST. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has pleaded via television with Donald Trump not to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. Johnson is not scheduled to meet Trump on his US visit, and instead appealed via an opinion piece in the New York Times and a more direct channel: an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, the president’s news show of choice. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has suggested Iran and European countries could maintain the pact even if the US dropped out. Speaking live on state TV, Rouhani said “getting rid of America’s mischievous presence will be fine for Iran”. Trump has said he will make a decision by Tuesday 2pm. The former prime minister Bob Hawke has been admitted to hospital in Sydney. The reason for his admission is unknown, but the 88-year-old has been using a wheelchair for some time, as well as a walking stick. Hawke was Australia’s third-longest-serving prime minister and was in power from 1983-1991. Hawke’s wife, Blanche d’Alpuget, told the Daily Telegraph her husband was “OK”. Linda Reynolds, the Liberal senator who has spearheaded a six-month inquiry into the mess created by section 44 of the constitution, has warned there is “no easy fix”, as the government ponders administrative solutions to the quagmire. The lack of options means that only a referendum can finally resolve the citizenship crisis, despite the Coalition’s reluctance to go down that path. The committee will soon report on options to reform what Reynolds called the “profoundly undemocratic” section, which disqualifies foreign citizens and public servants from running for office. Rockets and heavy machine guns fired from Afghan government helicopters killed and wounded at least 107 boys and men attending a religious ceremony in Afghanistan last month, a UN report has confirmed. The report underlined the risks of a new strategy, developed with US advisers, which has led to a significant increase in Afghan airpower, with helicopters and attack aircraft deployed to try to break a stalemate with the Taliban. Last month, the Afghan government said the attack was intended to hit members of a senior leadership group based in the Pakistani city of Quetta. Sport The inclusion of Daniel Arzani and Fran Karačić in Bert van Marwijk’s preliminary World Cup squad betray the Socceroos’ coach’s anxieties, most pointedly over his lack of options at right-back. But the coach’s selections also offer optimism, writes Richard Parkin. Dermott Brereton, one of the greatest AFL players of his generation, joined a chorus of disillusioned voices last week when he said he didn’t love the game any more. But despite the complaints the game is arguably in as good a state as ever, writes Craig Little. Thinking time Two groups of five men are onstage, seated at computer monitors. Headphones on, hunched forward, they sit almost completely immobile save for their flickering hands and darting eyes. Their coaches pace grimly behind them, watching the screens and muttering directives into their microphones. Behind them, two enormous television monitors broadcast their onscreen actions to an enraptured crowd of 18,000 people. We’re at the Intel Extreme Masters, a three-day professional video game tournament that rivals anything Sydney’s Qudos stadium has hosted in terms of scale and spectacle. For more than a year-and-a-half, Donald Trump’s wife Melania has been a picture of absent diplomacy; but that’s about to change. Today, the first lady launched policy initiatives focused on children. For supporters, it is a welcome if overdue emergence. For critics, it is too little too late; a futile gesture by a woman who was dealt a bad hand and played it badly. Apart from the daily racism and discrimination inflicted on brown and black women, there is another type of trauma that is becoming normalised: the trauma caused by the tactic many white women employ to muster sympathy and avoid accountability, says Ruby Hamad. “As I look back over my adult life a pattern emerges. Often, when I have attempted to speak to or confront a white woman about something she has said or done that has impacted me adversely, I am met with tearful denials and indignant accusations that I am hurting her ... I either flare up in frustration at not being heard (which only seems to prove her point) or I back down immediately, apologising and consoling the very person causing me harm.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has said on Twitter he will make a decision on the Iran nuclear deal by 2pm Tuesday, Washington time (4am Wednesday AEST). Earlier in the day, Trump criticised John Kerry after reports that the former secretary of state has been promoting the Iran nuclear deal, saying on Twitter: “The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!” Media roundup The Herald Sun splashes with a crackdown on serious offenders, reporting that Victoria’s most dangerous criminals could be held for seven days without charge and be housed in two new prison units designed for the state’s high-risk offenders. The Australian reports that seniors will be the biggest winners in today’s budget, with multibillion dollar aged-care and retirement packages heading their way, with the aim of keeping older Australians looked after at home. Technology designed to clean up the great Pacific garbage patch could become a piece of garbage itself, critics have told the ABC, as the machinery could trap and kill vulnerable marine life.

Think of them as pretzels in spirit rather than appearance, as there’s no elegant twirl of dough; it was far too much of a faff to try to get a decent amount of stuffing in and still have a traditional shape. But that quintessential texture is there: a moreishly chewy crumb encased in a glistening crust, burnished with a glaze of caramelised sugars. Pretzel buns with hazelnut, dates and chocolate Poaching pretzels gives them that classic crackly crust and the all-important chew, while the malt extract gives them great flavour. Prep 10 min Rise 2 hr 15 min Cook 15 min Makes 8 For the dough ½ tsp salt 1 tbsp dried yeast 250g strong bread flour 70g whole milk 70g water 2 tbsp malt extract 1 egg, beaten Sesame seeds For the stuffing 100g skinned hazelnuts 70g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids) 125g medjool dates, seeded and chopped To poach 1 litre water 100g malt extract Start with the dough: mix the salt and yeast with the flour, stir until well combined, then add the milk, water and malt extract. Knead to a smooth, firm dough, then put in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and set aside to rise for one to two hours. Meanwhile, make the stuffing. Roast the hazelnuts at 200C/390F/gas 6 for six minutes until golden brown, then cool and chop finely. Break up the chocolate and melt in a microwave in 20-second bursts, stirring frequently, then mix with the hazelnuts and dates. Once the dough is risen and puffy, remove from the bowl and knock it back. Cut into eight portions. Make the buns by flattening each piece of dough into a disc roughly 10cm across. Put a heaped teaspoon of stuffing in the middle and bring the edges of the dough up and over to cover the stuffing. Dab the edges of the dough with a little water, then pinch together firmly to seal. Finally, roll into a smooth ball between your hands and repeat with the rest. Leave them to rise again for 10-15 minutes on a lightly oiled baking sheet covered with a plastic bag. To make the poaching liquid: bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan together with the malt extract. Once the buns have puffed up, gently poach them, two or three at a time, for 30 seconds on each side, then put back on the baking tray. They will be looking a little lumpy and misshapen at this point, but don’t worry, they’ll puff up again in the oven. Brush each bun with a little beaten egg, then sprinkle them generously with sesame seeds. Bake at 240C/465F/gas 9 for 12 minutes, until they are a deep, hazelnut brown. Food styling: Sam Dixon.

The prints on show at Sotheby’s in London from 8 June, before a sale four days later, will include some recent rediscoveries which had been in storage for decades. All are the artist’s proofs of illustrations, stage, ballet and costume designs, and commissions including his swimming poster for the London 2012 Olympics. Hodgkin died last year, aged 84, leaving works in museums and galleries all over the world, and hundreds more in his studio and stores. His partner, Antony Peattie, said the sale was to allow him to put together a collection of Hodgkin’s graphic work to be given to a museum, and to create a definitive catalogue raisonné of his prints. “Howard’s work enjoys a strong emotional link with the public. This is another step in honouring his legacy,” Peattie said. Peattie has sold hundreds of the works of art and antiques Hodgkin collected in his home in Bloomsbury, London, saying it was too sad to have the house filled with them after the artist’s death. Hodgkin spent half a century experimenting with colour, scale and technique – his prints range from postcard size to six metres long – to achieve the effects he wanted. His work included designs for the Royal Ballet, and for books by his friends Julian Barnes and Susan Sontag. Frances Christie, the head of postwar British art at Sotheby’s, said: “Howard Hodgkin was an erudite artist whose deep engagement with every aspect of the arts meant that he steered a unique course. Although best known for his paintings, Hodgkin’s works on paper reveal the sheer scope of his sources and approaches – from stage designs and book covers to a prodigious body of prints created in collaboration with master printmakers over 50 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/17/how-to-make-the-perfect-hasselback-potatoes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T11:00:27Z","webTitle":"How to make the perfect hasselback potatoes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/17/how-to-make-the-perfect-hasselback-potatoes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/17/how-to-make-the-perfect-hasselback-potatoes","fields":{"headline":"How to make the perfect hasselback potatoes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hasselback potatoes, named after the Stockholm restaurant said to have created them, are one of those dishes that tend to look better than they taste: painstakingly chiselled fans of gloriously golden carbohydrate perfect for the Instagram age, yet sadly soggy on the fork. As Ed Smith writes in On the Side, “disappointingly, some so-called hasselback potatoes turn out to be little more than roast new potatoes with a few cuts in them”, when they should be a showstopping cross between a roast potato and a fried one, both comfortingly fluffy and satisfyingly crunchy. They may be more work than a pan of mash and not, perhaps, the kind of thing you’d knock up on a Tuesday evening, but if you’re out to impress, hasselbacks are the perfect accompaniment to steak, roast chicken, meaty fish or just about anything else that might demand a helping of chips – and they’re considerably easier to execute, too. Plus, did I mention they look good on Instagram? You say po-tay-to, I say po-tah-to Not everyone thinks that hasselbacks should be fluffy: Nigella Lawson writes that she loves them made with new potatoes, too, recommending charlotte or ratte, choices echoed by Smith, Stevie Parle and Trish Hilferty in her book Lobster and Chips, which calls for “medium-sized waxy potatoes”. Ranged against them are Martha Stewart (her yukon golds, like Julia Moskin’s russets, are hard to get hold of in this country, but seem to be classified as “fluffy” by the British Potato Council, so I substitute Roosters), and Alastair Little, who calls for baking potatoes, which also get an airing in Moskin’s recipe, mainly because I can find no other spuds weighing a pound each. Alhough I don’t think such huge potatoes are the best suited for the hasselback treatment, because the crisp exterior to fluffy interior ratio is all wrong, I do prefer their fluffy texture to the smoothness of the waxy kind, which, soaked in butter, are almost too rich for my taste – more like fondant potatoes. Like chips and roast potatoes, fluffy seems the way to go. Peeling and cutting I’m pleased to discover that peeling the potatoes is traditional, but not mandatory: Little and Hilferty are the only ones to bother. In theory, it should help the exterior crisp up, but in practice it doesn’t seem to make much difference, and leaving the skins on gives the dish a better flavour. It does pay, however, to spend time on the cutting of the potatoes. Many of the recipes dictate slicing them in 5mm intervals, but, in the hope of speeding up the cooking process, I’m going to copy Smith’s 2-3mm intervals, which also have the (possibly questionable) benefit of making the potatoes look like oversized woodlice. To help you slice down, but not through them, you could run a skewer through their length, as Hilferty and Little recommend, or cut them between two chopsticks, like Parle, but I find the simplest way is to put the potatoes in the bowl of a wooden spoon, as Molly Wizenberg suggests on her blog Orangette. As potatoes are not a uniform diameter along their entire length, slicing at a slight angle, à la Little, often makes life easier. Rinsing off some of the surface starch, a tip from Hilferty, does seem to help stop them sticking together; Little’s cold water bath presumably serves the same purpose, but running water proves more effective. The cooking Moskin’s is the only recipe to pre-cook the spuds, boiling the monsters for 10 minutes, then allowing them to cool completely before baking. Athough this proves inconvenient, the idea isn’t a bad one: potatoes are dense things, and many of the recipes I try wildly underestimate the baking time, so it makes sense to give them a head start. However, I prefer Smith’s method of braising them in water in the oven itself: although the bottoms might not be quite as crunchy as those roasted just in butter, the tops still crisp up satisfactorily, and there are no questionable bits of semi-raw spud in the middle. The oven should be hot, but not too hot – Moskin’s 220C/425F/gas 7 leaves the potatoes charred on top before they’ve had a chance to cook through – and it’s essential, as most recipes acknowledge, to keep basting them throughout the cook, “in order for the butter to penetrate”, as Parle puts it. The flavourings Butter is the order of the day here – and lots of it. You could substitute olive oil, if you’d prefer to keep them vegan, or swap in duck or goose fat or even good beef dripping, but, for me, potatoes and butter are a match made in heaven. You don’t need anything else, but garlic goes well with butter, of course, and also has the benefit of helping to wedge the slices open. If you don’t like garlic, shallots or onions work just as well, or you could use bay leaves or sage, but be careful not to overdo it, because a little goes a long way with both. Smith also adds caraway seeds, and Moskin sweet and smoked paprika intended to replicate the smoky bacon she reckons the originals were wrapped in, but I find no mention of this elsewhere. It does indeed give her potatoes a “gorgeous ruddy colour”, however, and would be lovely with roast pork or barbecued meat or veg. A recipe from Swedish restaurateur Leif Mannerström calls for the baked hasselbacks to be finished with breadcrumbs and potentially parmesan cheese. I like the extra crunch the former adds, but feel free not to bother: they’ll still be utterly delicious, whether you’re serving them with a leg of lamb or on their own with a bowl of wild garlic mayonnaise. (Interested parties may like to know that, in the writing of this piece, several people recommended Yotam Ottolenghi’s hasselback gratin to me: it didn’t seem to fit with the remit, but it does look amazing.) Perfect hasselback potatoes Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Serves 4 8 medium floury potatoes, such as maris pipers or king edwards (about 800g-1kg) 6 garlic cloves, peeled 3 bay leaves (optional) 50g butter 2 tbsp dry breadcrumbs, tossed with a little olive oil (optional) Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Find an ovenproof frying pan or a heavy, hob-safe baking tin that’s just large enough to hold the potatoes in a single layer. Put each potato in the bowl of a wooden spoon and, at roughly 2mm intervals, cut carefully down, but not quite through, the potato, maintaining a slight angle towards the centre of the potato. Slice the garlic, and stuff several pieces into each potato, making sure you push them well down so they don’t burn. Tear the bay leaves, if using, into several pieces and do the same. Meanwhile, melt the butter in the pan or tin over a medium heat until sizzling. Put in the potatoes one by one, and carefully turn them in the butter to coat, then pour in enough cold water to come halfway up the sides of the potatoes. Bring to a boil, then roast for an hour and 30 minutes, basting every 15 minutes. Scatterwith the breadcrumbs, if using, for the final 15 minutes of cooking, at which point you can add any remaining garlic to the pan as well. Serve hot from the oven. • Hasselback potatoes: Scandi spud sorcery or more hassle than they’re worth?

The 32-year-old is currently competing in the Giro d’Italia with Team Sky as he bids to win a historic third successive Grand Tour. He won last year’s Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. In December the Guardian and Le Monde revealed a urine test submitted after stage 18 of the Vuelta showed excessive levels of the asthma drug salbutamol and he could yet be stripped of that title if he is found to have committed an anti-doping violation. In terms of Froome’s legacy, what happens on the roads in Italy over the next two and a half weeks of the Giro could be secondary to the recent publication of a study entitled “Futility of current urine salbutamol doping control”. The report published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology claims it is not feasible to determine a dosage level of salbutamol based on the results of a single “untimed” urine sample. Froome’s failed test recorded a level of salbutamol at 2000ng/ml, double the amount permitted by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Under new Wada rules there is an allowance made for specific gravity, in effect to take account of possible dehydration and urine concentration. It is understood Froome’s reading has been recalibrated to 1429ng/ml, which is still an adverse analytical finding and could lead to an anti-doping rule violation. The report by researchers at the Centre for Human Drug Research in Leiden, the Netherlands, claims that on a maximum dosage of salbutamol, as many as 15.4% of tests could return a false positive. It states “the current threshold inadvertently leads to incorrect assumptions of violation, whereas many violations will go unnoticed” and says that the testing should be reconsidered. Wada is standing by the test. A spokesman said: “Wada has conducted several studies on salbutamol and continues to conduct studies on beta-2 agonists. We believe the current threshold is solid considering the scientific literature published on salbutamol over the past 20 years. Based on the published and unpublished information in our possession, we see no reason to change the salbutamol threshold.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/09/ariel-dorfman-not-to-belong-anywhere-to-be-displaced-is-not-a-bad-thing-for-a-writer","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"Ariel Dorfman: 'Not to belong anywhere, to be displaced, is not a bad thing for a writer'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/09/ariel-dorfman-not-to-belong-anywhere-to-be-displaced-is-not-a-bad-thing-for-a-writer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/09/ariel-dorfman-not-to-belong-anywhere-to-be-displaced-is-not-a-bad-thing-for-a-writer","fields":{"headline":"Ariel Dorfman: 'Not to belong anywhere, to be displaced, is not a bad thing for a writer'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ariel Dorfman’s work explores, often in ecstatic detail, the trauma and torture of the human animal – nazism, Trumpism, Pinochet, Donald Duck – but the man himself has the warm, inviting smile of a Hollywood actor. I can’t think of another “serious” writer, aside from Saul Bellow, who’s so affable. Novelist, critic, poet, playwright, professor, journalist, screenwriter and activist, Dorfman’s story is complex and multifaceted. His father was born in Odessa to a well-heeled Jewish family, and his mother was of Bessarabian Jewish lineage. Dorfman was born in Argentina but moved to the US at two because his father was fleeing from Perón’s soldiers. Dorfman’s father was a UN dignitary but, because of McCarthy’s witch-hunt, the family had to move again, this time to Chile. Dorfman became a Chilean citizen in his 20s, but attended graduate school in the US, at Berkeley. He returned to Chile after graduation and, in the early 70s, worked as a cultural adviser to Salvador Allende, the president. After Gen Pinochet’s coup in 1973, Dorfman was exiled. He lived in Paris, Holland and later returned to the US. These are only a few brief highlights of his dramatic life. Roman Polanski’s 1994 film Death and the Maiden, with Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver, based on Dorfman’s play, catapulted the writer to fame. Today, he’s a celebrated writer who splits his time between the US and – because democracy has been restored – Chile. Despite his amiability and lightness, Dorfman is also a man of gravity and high seriousness. This becomes apparent from the outset when he looks out a window of the hotel cafe, pointing north-west up Massachusetts Avenue. “Embassy Row has a very special resonance for Chileans,” Dorfman begins. He discusses the car bomb, planted by Pinochet’s secret service in September 1976, that killed Orlando Letelier, the Chilean defense minister. The site, just up the street from the Chilean embassy, is nearly visible from the hotel. His new book Darwin’s Ghosts, like most of Dorfman’s work, explores the dynamics of power, identity and empire. The action begins on 11 September 1981, two decades before this date identified itself as 9/11 (and eight years to the day after Pinochet’s coup). Fitzroy Foster is 14 today. His father takes a Polaroid to commemorate the event. In the background, there’s a murky image, an apparition. It’s a man, one who’s traveled great distances. The man and his people, Foster eventually discovers, are victims of a horrible brutality. The boy, and his sweetheart Cam, set off on a 10-year voyage, like Odysseus, to find this man, discover who he is, and what can be done about the crimes, the guilt, the ghosts of the past. Dorfman sees himself as “a bridge between cultures”. Foster is a representative American – young, naive, cosseted – forced to encounter the hardships that Dorfman, and his countrymen, have experienced. This changes Foster, of course, in ways that can never be undone. Dorfman describes Darwin’s Ghosts as a work about “people transiting from one state to another”. He was hoping to capture and evoke the haunted, claustrophobic atmosphere of Kafka, the anxiety between the mundane and ethereal worlds. Dorfman succeeds in this, but the novel is much more than a Kafkaesque meditation. It’s a thriller, mystery, ghost story and sea adventure that sits easily within his collected works but which is also a departure in style and scope. Like Fitzroy Foster, Dorfman is a wanderer. It’s nearly impossible to speak with him and not address travel, exile, otherness. The Dorfman family has, over the past century, repeatedly escaped from the wars and antisemitic pogroms of Europe, but the New World has been just as problematic. “There are men in rooms who I know nothing about,” Dorfman begins, but “with a pen-stroke or piece of intelligence” they forced him into exile. According to Dorfman it’s a great luxury to be permitted to choose where and how you live because, when you least expect it, “history intervenes”. After 10 years of exile he returned to Chile, which had progressed in terms of democracy, justice and human rights. Dorfman was arrested and deported, however, so his wife Angélica prudently advised him to stay out of Chile until the political landscape became more inviting. Today, Dorfman can come and go as he pleases, but that doesn’t necessarily simplify issues of place or identity. He frequently returns to Chile but says, “I clearly don’t belong there any more.” Going home, if that’s what Chile represents to Dorfman, is returning to a place that no longer exists. Nonetheless, he’s “solved the problem” of place through marriage. “Home is where the love of my life is,” Dorfman says, “my wife of 52 years.” Dorfman reflects on the curious reality of living everywhere and feeling at home nowhere – always being a stranger, an observer. “Not to belong anywhere, to be displaced, is not a bad thing for a writer.” He pauses. “If you can deal with it. If it doesn’t destroy you.” To survive the rootlessness, he says, it helps to have a moral compass and a strong family. “More than a traveler, I’m a displacer. In other words, I’m a person who is constantly meditating on what it means not to arrive at a place, but to be on my way somewhere else.” Place and identity are inextricably linked with language. As a child, Dorfman spoke only Spanish. However, a traumatic experience changed this. Shortly after moving to New York as a child, he was hospitalized for pneumonia. When he emerged from Mt Zion, three weeks later, he didn’t speak a word of Spanish for 10 years – note the reappearance of this Homeric time-span. Later, when his family emigrated to Chile, he had to learn Spanish all over again. Dorfman calls himself “a fundamentalist of language”. After moving to Chile, he identified for years as a Spanish-speaker and rejected English. However, he eventually earned a living by writing in English and so was compelled to accept the fact that he was “deeply bilingual, deeply bicultural”. He couldn’t deny one language or the other, and certainly not both. This sense of linguistic recurrence and doubleness has marked his writing life as well. Dorfman speaks Italian, French and other languages, but writes in Spanish and English. Darwin’s Ghosts was composed in English, but he then “used Spanish to correct the English”. Each draft deploys one language to edit and inform the other. Dorfman considers himself not bilingual but “doubly monolingual”. “When I write in Spanish, the English is inside me, guiding me.” Perhaps the most impressive thing about Dorfman is that he’s an exophone, one who writes in a language that’s not his own. In this, he joins a small, select group including Conrad, Nabokov, Achebe and Leonora Carrington. Like the others, Dorfman not only writes in English, but is an impeccable prose stylist. Like early Hemingway, Dorfman’s language is absolutely clear and restrained; like Kafka and Auster, the images are potent yet eerily disembodied. “My characters have no faces,” he says. They are “apparitions, specters”. Perhaps this is because Dorfman writes about people who’ve already died, events that transpired long ago. Darwin’s Ghosts began as a short story based on historical accounts of an ethnic atrocity, but it eventually became a novel that bent itself into unlikely shapes. You have to follow where the story and its characters take you, Dorfman warns, “or you will pay the price”. He may be preoccupied by political and historical tragedy, but he’s more interested in dramatizing “the mental anguish, the aftermath. I’m interested in what happens afterward. I’m interested in ghosts, really”. The responsibility, as Dorfman sees it, is to remember, confront and perhaps in some way atone for the past. Writing is both trial and punishment for our shared history. “The past is really unknowable, but it’s got to be knowable enough so that we can seek forgiveness for our crimes,” he says. “I’m obsessed with that.” Dorfman readily admits that actors and directors have taught him a great deal. He’s learned from writers, of course – Kafka, Dostoyevsky, Melville – but also from Polanski, Gene Hackman, Juliet Stevenson, Mike Nichols, Rosemary Harris and Peter Hall. During a production of his play Purgatorio, Dorfman was challenged by the actor Viggo Mortensen, who was insistent about a line of dialogue: “This doesn’t make sense!” he kept repeating. “He wouldn’t let me go,” Dorfman says. And Mortensen was right. The actor was able to teach Dorfman something about his own play. “You learn, if there’s no aggression in an artist exchange.” If an actor or editor is generous and open, the writer can gain something. Likewise, while rehearsing a pivotal scene in Death and the Maiden, Juliet Stevenson was supposed to gag the presumptive bad-guy with a napkin or rag. Instead, she pulled down her panties and shoved them into his mouth. This was perfect, Dorfman says. It combined sex, horror, intimacy and degradation, which is precisely what the scene demanded. Political brutality and despotism are Dorfman’s recurring motifs. Naturally, the conversation keeps swinging back to Trump, about whom he has much to say. In Dorfman’s essay How to read Donald Trump, which concerns Trump and Donald Duck, neither the animated yellow character nor the Disney figure come off very well. “Clearly, Trump is for many people, but for me very specifically, a traumatic experience. Because it pulls me back.” Dorfman is referring to the Pinochet regime. “There is decency in American people,” Dorfman continues, but it’s been compromised. “There is an authoritarian tendency in this land, and a rage in this land, and an inability to deal with the past in this land which has, let’s say, ended up being embodied by Trump and his movement,” he says. “I think that is very, very dangerous. I may be wrong, but I have seen how a democracy can crumble.” Dorfman argues that, if these tendencies go unchecked, America could “quickly slip into dictatorial forms”. He does not want Trump to be impeached, however. “I want him defeated by the American people, who put him there.” We need to understand the roots of Trumpism rather than simply lash out. “He didn’t arise from nowhere. He came deep out of things that are in the American character and the American history.” Ariel Dorfman may have an actor’s charm, a writer’s wandering soul, and the dissident’s passion for justice, but he also possesses the serene domesticity of the family man. Twice a day he reads. Old and new books, fiction and nonfiction. He often sits with his wife; they read the same texts. Thomas Mann, Dostoyevsky. This is a ritual he describes with almost ecclesial piety. Angélica is his first and most trusted editor, he says. “She is the soil of my tree.” Darwin’s Ghosts is out now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/07/sally-mays-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T17:13:34Z","webTitle":"Sally Mays obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/sally-mays-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/07/sally-mays-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sally Mays obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My wife, Sally Mays, who has died aged 88, was a concert pianist, teacher and music editor who was born in Australia but lived most of her life in London. Her outstanding talents were apparent from an early age. Her parents, Trevor and Dorothy, or “Sunny” (nee Hopkins), were dance band musicians who were determined that she should receive a formal music education to support her love of jazz. Born in Melbourne, she gave her first piano recitals at the age of 12 and went to the Melbourne Conservatorium, where she was awarded the Clarke scholarship to attend the Royal College of Music in London. She won the Chappell gold medal and other awards, both as a pianist and a composer. She later studied with Irene Kohler and Marcel Ciampi in Paris, and gave the first of her many Wigmore Hall recitals in 1955, the year we married. For more than 50 years, Sally returned almost annually to Australia to give recitals and broadcasts, and added other cities to what became mini-tours of the southern hemisphere. She broadcast for the ABC and the BBC, and played at the Proms with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, under Gennadi Rozhdestvensky. She devoted much of her career to works by new composers, particularly from Australia. Sally formed a musical partnership with the New Zealand composer Barry Anderson, a pioneer of electro-acoustic music, who wrote a series of works for piano and synthesisers for her. She was a founder member of the Mouth of Hermes, promoting the work of the then little-known composers Steve Reich and Terry Riley. In 1988, she gave a series of 12 recitals of works of Australian composers in Sydney to celebrate the bicentennial of Australia. The following year she joined Sounds Positive, the piano and wind ensemble that specialises in new music and stayed until her retirement in 2017. She was a member of the award-winning Alexandra Trio and the Lavolta Ensemble. Sally edited four volumes of graded Australian piano music, which were likened by critics to Béla Bartók’s Mikrokosmos. She was an examiner for the Associated Board and an inspirational teacher at all levels of age and ability. In the 2016 New Year honours list she was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for her “significant service to the performing arts as a leading solo pianist, accompanist and composer, to music education and as an editor”. Her last public appearance was in June last year at a memorial concert for Jo Cox. She is survived by me, our two sons, Simon and Jonathan, and four grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/wedding-wines-that-will-get-a-great-reception","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T15:00:02Z","webTitle":"Wedding wines that will get a great reception","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/wedding-wines-that-will-get-a-great-reception","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/wedding-wines-that-will-get-a-great-reception","fields":{"headline":"Wedding wines that will get a great reception","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It will not be possible, as you may realise with dread, to avoid the subject of weddings over the next seven days – that wedding, in particular.

At least we’ll have a member of the royal family who is a great wine lover. So, what of the rest of you who are getting married this summer and don’t have a super-Tuscan budget?

Both are made by the clever Jean-Claude Mas, who is responsible for a number of supermarket own labels. Another safe option would be the white and red from La Vieille Ferme, a reliable brand from the Rhône that sells for around £7-8 in Booths, the Co-op and Waitrose. However, Waitrose has them on promotion from next Wednesday for £5.99, an unusually good deal that is well worth snapping up. And, at 12.5% for the white and 13% for the red, they’re not overly high in alcohol, either, which could be a bonus if you want to avoid a car-crash of a best man’s speech, and tired and emotional guests. If you belong to The Wine Society (membership of which would make an excellent wedding present, incidentally), they have a Burgundian-style chardonnay from the Loire called Les Parcelles for £7.75 (from the 2017 vintage and 12%) and a pale, pretty Saint-Pourçain La Réserve Spéciale (12.5%) at the same price that knocks spots off most inexpensive red burgundy. For cheap fizz, you’re probably looking at prosecco, but for a slightly more interesting alternative, there’s the smart-looking Cruset Blanc de Blancs at Ocado for £8.99 or, even better, £3.49 in the Calais Wine Superstore. I’d definitely taste it before you buy – at that price, it might be older stock than Ocado’s, or even a different blend, but for a sparkling wine with a similarly soft, creamy appeal as prosecco, it’s an absolute steal.

Even so, in Afghanistan, where being seen in public without a man is taboo, a group of women are rebelling through their love of the game. Shabnam Mobarez is the captain of the Afghanistan women’s team. An Afghan refugee who moved to Denmark with her family three years after her father had fled there to escape war, Mobarez has spent time in the country of her birth to find out more about the struggles of her team-mates. “I was in Afghanistan two months ago before our training camp in Jordan,” she says. “I went to see how hard it is for Afghan players, who live in Afghanistan, to get to training and just live like a regular player. The situation was very bad in my opinion, very sad. Going to practice is such a huge challenge because they face so many things on the way. “We were afraid some of our players wouldn’t show up after a bomb blast in the city and were super afraid. These are the things they have in the back of their minds every time they leave their homes. For me to live that, only for three weeks, was horrible. How are they doing this incredible job? That’s the passion they have for the game.” Having moved to Denmark aged six, Mobarez found playing football much easier but she still feared her parents’ views: “It’s funny because most footballers’ stories start like this. I started playing with boys from my block, on the street, then a Danish coach was walking by with her dog and said: ‘Hey, I have a club for you, come join.’ “I was very afraid in the beginning – were my parents going to accept it? So I used to go to practices hiding it from my parents but once they were involved they were actually fully supportive.” Mobarez could have chosen to play for Denmark but a strong connection to her place of birth and a desire to be involved in change powered her decision. “We are trying to bring something positive to the country,” the 22-year-old says. “These women are so brave they inspire me to do better and, because I live in a safe country, to work harder for them.” Denmark reached the final of Euro 2017, losing 4-2 to the Netherlands, and have agreed a new four-year deal for improved pay and conditions. Mobarez, who plays in Aalborg, is proud to be playing in a much more forward-thinking country: “Denmark is one of the best countries for women footballers. They have a lot of attention for the girls right now with the Danish national team doing so well.” Handed the Afghanistan captaincy in 2016, Mobarez is keen to give refugee children in Denmark the experiences she has had. “I volunteer coach at a refugee camp,” she says. “I’m doing it to make changes. I used to be a refugee and I don’t want the kids to go with a bad experience being a refugee. They need to smile every day and feel safe. “For most of the girls it’s expected that, if you come from a Middle Eastern country, you have to behave ‘like a girl’. Me going in and telling them my story and how far I’ve got with my football, choosing football, I think that’s a brilliant image to put out there. “You see the girls’ eyes go big, they want to be like you. Being a role model is amazing. I think that football gives them confidence and a feeling that nothing can limit them, that they can do whatever they want. They shouldn’t be limited by the fact they are girls.” Afghanistan, unable to train as a full team at home, have met for training camps and games in places such as the US, Germany, Jordan and the Netherlands. The team, coached by the American Kelly Lindsey, who has not set foot in the country since taking over in 2016 because of safety concerns, have risen to 106 in the Fifa world rankings. “Working with Kelly is one of the greatest things and I can say on behalf of the entire team that we’re so grateful and blessed to have her with us,” Mobarez says. “She’s been the reason we’ve improved as a team and individually. “Kelly’s been a big inspiration for me and she’s also the reason why I joined the Equal Playing Field Jordan Quest [where women from more than 22 countries broke the world record for the lowest altitude football match one year after doing the highest, at Kilimanjaro]. “Even though she’s not Afghan, she feels strongly about Afghan women, she wants us to succeed and she’s working so hard behind the scenes of each training camp to develop us as individuals and as a team. I can only imagine what it’s like for her. Every time we come to a training camp we don’t know if everyone will be able to show up – she has to deal with that.” Talking points • The Phil Neville effect is strong.

Yet from our point of view, as participants in the physical universe, the arrow time is an inescapable and supremely important fact. Put briefly, some things cause other things, and we get old. A snooker, or pool, game provides a good image to help understand the problem¹. Film the moment of impact of any shot, or any collision between two balls, and run the video forwards and backwards. Assuming the cue and the player are out of frame, the video looks just as realistic backwards as forwards. With one exception. The break, the opening shot, will look ridiculous when played backwards. In the correct time direction, an orderly triangular array of balls is shattered. In the other direction, it spontaneously assembles out of nowhere. This never happens, and so the correct time direction is determined. Even though the fundamental physical laws that cover the collisions run the same backwards as forwards. This is also why particles made in colliders, such as the Higgs bosons made in collisions between protons at CERN, decay. They are like the triangle in pool, a specially ordered configuration of energy that will fall apart rapidly under the general buffeting of quantum fluctuations. The LHC has to go to enormous lengths - not just lots of energy, but many, many attempts - to “rack them up””. The incongruity between the lack of microscopic time direction and the omnipresence of macroscopic time has been the subject of discussion and enquiry for a long ... er ... time. A recent and particularly enjoyable entry into that discussion is Carlo Rovelli’s book, “The Order of Time”. Rovelli also points out that there is no universal agreement possible on “now”. We have known since Einstein gave us relativity that the question “What is happening right now at some other place in the universe?” has no unique answer. It depends on the relative speed and position of the person asking the question and the place they are asking about. Over distances which can be covered quickly at the speed of light, the practical effect is not so noticeable (though it is measurable). But for astrophysicists trying to build an understanding of the cosmos and how it changes, it is inescapable. The usual approach to the physics of cosmology and the arrow of time is to assume that somehow time began at a very organised moment – the Big Bang as the most impressive pool break of all time – and the dissipation of that initial order, measured as the increase of total entropy in the universe, is what gives us the arrow of time. Indeed, the second law of thermodynamics states that total entropy either stays the same (at best) or (more often) increases over time. There is something suspiciously circular here though. To be able to say something increases over time, we must already have defined time. Yet the increase of entropy, in this thinking, is what defines time. Rovelli explores this idea. What is real is how things change with respect to each other, and time does not really exist as anything independent of that. Our perception of an inexorable flow of time comes from the observed increase in entropy, and the traces of more ordered arrangements of the universe that we observe in our own particular “now”. The direction of time arises because we see these traces of a more ordered universe in the current disorder, while the Big Bang contains no trace of astronomers, telescopes or the planet Earth. The younger me contained no trace of this disordered and ageing physicist, but my brain still houses connections, memories of that lower entropy me. The fact that my bedroom was so much more chaotic then than now just shows that you have to consider the entropy of the whole system, of course. In fact, as Rovelli points out, the apparent entropy of a system depends upon how closely you look at. A solar system, with planets orbiting a star, looks very orderly, notwithstanding the fact that if you were to look closely into the politics on one of the planets you would see total chaos. Put another way, if you have eight planets, there are a few different ways they can be arranged around a star; but if you look closely, and count all the possible ways life might be arranged on the planets, as well as the arrangement of the planets themselves, the possibilities for disorder are endless. So time is (a) not universal, (b) may just be defined by the direction of increasing entropy anyway, and (c) the entropy of something depends how closely you look. Given all this, it is possible to imagine time flowing not just at different rates in different parts of the universe, but also in different directions. At least it seems possible for Rovelli to imagine this. I’m struggling a bit, but I think I get a glimmering. Something Rovelli is surely aware of but doesn’t really deal with is the fact that the microscopic laws of the universe do, in fact contain a way of defining time. These effects are currently being measured at the Large Hadron Collider (especially by the LHCb experiment) and the Belle II experiment in Japan is just now getting underway to study them further . What this means is that in some very rare collisions of our snooker balls (or in reality, decays of particles made of quarks and antiquarks) it is possible to distinguish between forward time and backward time without invoking entropy. However, this distinction vanishes if (at the same time as swapping forward time for backward) you swap matter for antimatter and left for right. So, does entropy have something to say about space as well as time? Does it tell us left from right, matter from antimatter, as well as future from past? I don’t know, right now, to be honest. Whatever now means. I recommend Rovelli’s book, though I am not sure it is right and I’m not sure I have got it all right even if he has. It is a great read. I think I will finish (or possibly start) with a joke. So: Q: What composer always sets up the balls for the break in pool, but then fouls immediately? A: Rachmaninoff. Tish, badum. Sorry. And congratulations to Mark Williams. ¹ I know I didn’t invent this analogy but I can’t remember where I heard it first.

Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said it’s called ‘3 Open’. Others on the team thought the title is ‘Open 4’. Whatever the play’s name, the meaning is not ambiguous. “Give it to LeBron and get out of the way,” one Cleveland assistant coach told the Athletic. Tactical nomenclature is probably irrelevant to the Cavaliers right now. Everything they run this postseason appears to be some variation of Give It To LeBron And Get Out Of The Way. Halfway to the NBA finals, we are watching one of the greatest playoff runs of any player ever. They way he saved Cleveland from disaster against Indiana in the first round and has dominated three straight games against the Eastern Conference regular-season champions, the Toronto Raptors, has been astounding. Was there any doubt he would win the game on Saturday as he thundered up the court with 8.8 seconds left in a game tied at 103-103? The last shot, as ridiculous as it seemed on release, was all but certain to go in. This is the way things have been for him these last magical weeks. Saturday Night Live even sent up Cleveland’s dumbfounding over-reliance on their star player in an unaired sketch from over the weekend. But where does it get LeBron and where does it get the Cavs? The 34.8 points a game he is averaging this postseason is the 16th best in NBA history – a stunning statistic, yes, until you realize that only one of those 15 playoff performances above his actually led to a title. That was Michael Jordan in 1993, Jordan’s last season before his first retirement. Each of those other great postseasons, like Jordan’s 43.6 points-per-game in 1986 and Jerry West’s 40.6 in 1965, ended with their team losing. LeBron might be carrying the Cavs, but he can’t tote them to another championship. Even if Cleveland finishes a sweep of Toronto in Monday’s Game 4 and goes on to beat Boston in the conference finals, there seems little chance he can defeat Golden State or Houston by himself. Like the other men on that list above him – one which includes Jordan four more times, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain twice and Russell Westbrook last year – he is destined to fall short of another ring. Maybe he understands this as time ticks down on what is expected to be the end of his second run with the Cavaliers. As intense as he appears on the court, he seems as serene as ever off of it. After Saturday’s game, he sat behind a table in a press conference, laughing at questions, joking almost as if downing beers in a backyard barbecue, he talked about his acceptance of this Cavs team’s limitations and the need to take over. “I think before the all-star break, when (I decided) we’ve got to make the most of this team,” he said. “I’ve been in a really good place ever since.” James’s debt to Cleveland was paid in the summer of 2016 when he brought the city their first sports title in five decades. His burden to be anything more than the kid from nearby Akron who grew to be the greatest player of his time was relieved. He is free to leave town when his contract is up next month and chase championships in Philadelphia or San Antonio or even greater celebrity in New York or Los Angeles. He is giving Cleveland one final gift: the best basketball of his life in the last days before he walks away. At least he can go knowing he gave his best shot with a flawed team for his hometown. Late last spring, I sat with another player ahead of LeBron on that list of all-time great postseasons: number six, Bob McAdoo, whose 37.4 points a game for the Buffalo Braves only got them one series that year, a seven-game loss to Washington. Ironically, we were in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, watching a handful of draft prospects at an open showcase. We were talking about Kevin Durant, who had sacrificed points for a chance to win a championship with the Golden State Warriors and McAdoo said he understood Durant’s decision. Later in his career, he too gave up points for titles with the Lakers. “I didn’t need to (score all the time) in LA and I was happy about that,” McAdoo told me that day. “All the load wasn’t on me, it was spread out. You just kind of matured in the course of your career.” LeBron doesn’t have to mature as a player. He already has three titles. Unlike the players on the list of all-time great postseasons (which includes LeBron himself in 2009), he isn’t chasing something elusive. This playoff run of his feels less about trying to will a championship and more about being as great as he can for one last time in Cleveland. The Cavs don’t have to design a play for that. Just give LeBron the ball and let him do the rest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/may/08/rail-industry-prepares-for-season-ticket-cull-in-fares-shake-up","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T23:01:02Z","webTitle":"Rail industry prepares for season ticket cull in fares shake-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/08/rail-industry-prepares-for-season-ticket-cull-in-fares-shake-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/08/rail-industry-prepares-for-season-ticket-cull-in-fares-shake-up","fields":{"headline":"Rail industry prepares for season ticket cull in fares shake-up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The rail industry is preparing for a cull in the number of fares and season tickets offered to commuters as it launches an appeal for root-and-branch reform of the “outdated” regulations underpinning the £9.7bn-a-year fares system. Britain’s rail companies are beginning a public consultation into the rules underpinning the country’s ticketing options, which have ballooned in complexity to offer passengers about 55m different fares. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), the trade body representing the firms that run Britain’s railways, said it was launching the UK-wide consultation alongside the watchdog Transport Focus because “decades of well-intentioned but outdated regulations have led to a range of fare options that have not kept pace with technology or how people work and travel today”. The pair are pledging to use their findings to “update fares regulation and make things easier for customers” but have ruled out recommendations that will lead to a reduction or increase in average fares. The industry will wait for the results of the consultation, which will run from June to September, before committing itself to any specific proposals. However, it has already cited its irritation with certain restrictions, including “inflexible seven-day, monthly or annual season tickets”, which must be offered to passengers under regulations that date back to the mid-1990s. Rail firms claim these restrictions make it impractical to offer more flexible “smart ticketing”, such as those implemented on the London Underground, where computer systems can calculate the most cost-effective ticket for different customers. They argue that the style of season tickets has become outdated because of more flexible working patterns. However, train tickets that would suit modern work patterns – such as a three-day-a-week season ticket – are too difficult to offer under current rules, train operators say. A spokesman for the RDG indicated that some fares might have to be scrapped in order to make way for new ones. “It doesn’t make sense to offer a three-or-four-day season ticket. There are certain fares that train companies have to sell. Unless we get rid of them, [new fares] keep adding to the total number.” According to research commissioned by the industry from the consulting group KPMG, only 34% of rail customers are “very confident” they bought the best-value ticket for their last journey and only 29% were “very satisfied” with the experience of buying their ticket. The industry says reforming the fares systems has the potential to attract more people to travel by train. Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, said: “Rail passengers want a simpler, more understandable and modern fares system which matches the way we now travel. Opening up the debate and looking at the pros and cons of various reform options is welcome. Transport Focus will make sure the passenger voice is heard in these debates.” Jane Gratton, the head of business environment at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Businesses rely heavily on the rail network and will welcome this long-overdue review of the fares and ticketing system. Increasingly confusing, frustrating and unfair, the current system needs to be brought in line with the more nimble and flexible way in which firms now operate. It’s the obvious next step to ensure people gain maximum benefit from the ongoing investment in our railways.” The regulations underpinning rail fares have remained unchanged from the mid-1990s, when the 1995 ticketing settlement agreement spelled out how fares should be set and sold. As it pre-dates widespread use of internet and smartphone technologies, the regulations assume that all customers will buy their ticket by visiting a ticket office and set out in detail how customers must be able to buy a ticket from each of the 2,500 stations in Britain to every other station in the country. A final report from the rail industry on the fare system is expected to be published in the autumn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/may/07/vladimir-putin-russian-president-sworn-in-fourth-term-kremlin-ceremony","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T13:55:32Z","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin sworn in for fourth term in Kremlin ceremony","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/vladimir-putin-russian-president-sworn-in-fourth-term-kremlin-ceremony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/07/vladimir-putin-russian-president-sworn-in-fourth-term-kremlin-ceremony","fields":{"headline":"Vladimir Putin sworn in for fourth term in Kremlin ceremony","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has been sworn in for a fourth presidential term in a lavish Kremlin ceremony as tensions with the west rise and domestic discontent over poverty and wealth inequality simmers. State television began its live coverage of the inauguration on Monday with Putin, 65, apparently hard at work in his Kremlin office. He then walked down a long, red-carpeted corridor to a black limousine that whisked him to the nearby Grand Kremlin Palace, the former throne room of Russia’s tsars. Putin was applauded by about 5,000 guests as he entered the palace’s ornately decorated Andreyevsky Hall through colossal doors flanked by Kremlin guards. Among the guests were Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor, Steven Seagal, the former Hollywood action star who has become close to Russia’s political elite, and Alexander Zaldostanov, the leather-clad, tattooed leader of a pro-Putin motorcycle club. With his hand on a gold-embossed copy of the Russian constitution, Putin swore to serve the Russian people faithfully. He also hailed Moscow’s ability to stand up for it interests in the international arena, and what he called Russia’s traditional values. Despite the pomp, the ceremony was relatively low key compared with Putin’s return to the Kremlin in 2012, when his black motorcade sped through deserted streets that had been cleared of residents by heavy-handed security forces. A Kremlin banquet to mark the inauguration was reportedly scrapped over fears it would lead to public criticism. Barring a change to the constitution, Putin’s fourth term is likely to be his last as president. He recently laughed off suggestions that he could return to the Kremlin in 2030, when he will be eligible to stand again. Government officials have not discussed the issue of his successor publicly, and analysts say the issue is taboo within the Kremlin walls. Shortly after the inauguration, Putin put Dmitry Medvedev forward to continue as prime minister, a position he has held since 2012. Allegations of high-level corruption against Medvedev, 52, triggered large opposition protests last year, and 57% of Russians said they were dissatisfied with his work as prime minister in a recent opinion poll. Some analysts suggest Putin’s continued support for Medvedev is due to his usefulness as a scapegoat for economic failures. Since his last inauguration six years ago, Putin has seized Crimea from Ukraine, triggering western economic sanctions, and ordered Russia’s military into Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Just weeks before his election victory in March, Putin presented what he said were Moscow’s invincible new nuclear weapons, his bellicose speech accompanied by an animated video that showed Russian warheads falling on Florida. Fyodor Lukyanov, a political analyst who sometimes advises the Kremlin, has described the current standoff with the west as a state of cold war. Monday’s inauguration ceremony came just two days after Russian security forces assisted by Cossack fighters detained hundreds of people, including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, at an anti-Putin protest in central Moscow. The EU condemned “police brutality and mass arrests”, and human rights figures demanded an investigation into why Cossacks had been allowed to attack opposition supporters, including with leather whips. Russian opposition media said on Sunday that Moscow city hall has paid a pro-Kremlin Cossack organisation almost £190,000 to ensure public order in the Russian capital. Putin, who has ruled Russia for longer than anyone except Joseph Stalin, begins his new six-year term of office as an economic downturn has plunged millions of Russians into poverty. About 20 million people, or 14% of the population, live below the poverty line, which is defined as an income of 9,828 roubles (£115) a month. Real incomes have fallen for a fourth year in a row, and about 3,000 schools, including in deepest Siberia, have no indoor toilets, according to government statistics. Wealth inequality is among the highest in the world, and corruption involving government contracts costs the country £26bn a year, according to the Moscow-based Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy. In an opinion poll published by the Levada Centre on Monday, 45% of respondents said they blamed Putin for failing to reduce wealth inequality, and just over 30% said he had failed to increase pensions and salaries. Putin is reportedly preparing to tackle these concerns with an increase in spending on healthcare, education and infrastructure as part of a six-year plan worth 10tn roubles (£119bn). Russia’s economic slump has also meant an increasingly vicious struggle for resources among the country’s government and security apparatus, analysts say. Alexei Ulyukayev, the country’s former economy minister, was jailed for eight years in December on corruption charges that were widely interpreted as a rare case of Kremlin infighting spilling out into the open. The recent jailing of state security officials on corruption charges is also evidence of “intensified competition” for financial resources between officials at Russia’s interior ministry and the FSB intelligence agency, said Yekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political analyst. Opposition figures, who accuse Putin of caring only about the economic interests of his friends and family members, reacted with scorn to the former KGB officer’s inauguration pledge to serve ordinary Russians. “Putin said Russians will live better, but he didn’t say which ones,” read a popular online joke."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/cocktail-of-the-week-bakewell-fizz","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Cocktail of the week: bakewell fizz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/cocktail-of-the-week-bakewell-fizz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/cocktail-of-the-week-bakewell-fizz","fields":{"headline":"Cocktail of the week: bakewell fizz","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This favourite from our afternoon tea menu combines the sweet, nostalgic flavours of a childhood favourite, Bakewell tart, with a touch of indulgence and fizz.

On his HBO show Last Week Tonight, the comic started by covering Giuliani’s “ill-advised and chaotic” interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, where he revealed damaging information about the president. Many pundits have struggled to relate the latest iteration of the former mayor of New York City with the person he is now. “People seem to be as shocked at finding out who Giuliani really is as a child at Disney World who accidentally saw Mickey Mouse pull off his head to reveal that he was actually Tilda Swinton,” Oliver said. Oliver then went back over Giuliani’s career, including his marriage to his second cousin. Giuliani claims they didn’t realize they were related until later into their relationship while Oliver rejects this. “He didn’t think it was just a little bit weird at the wedding ceremony when one side of the church was both families and the other side was just one very nervous photographer who didn’t take a single picture,” he said. In another marriage, Giuliani decided to announce it was over during a press conference without telling his wife first. “Just about the most humiliating way possible to end a marriage other than announcing publicly: ‘Whoopsy, I boned my cousin,’” he said. During his failed campaign to be president, Giuliani “could not stop leveraging 9/11 for his own ends” yet after spending $50m, he received zero delegates. He then “frittered away years as a rent-a-quote pundit” before joining Trump’s legal team. “Giuliani’s role as Trump’s lawyer isn’t an aberration,” Oliver said. “Everything in his life has led to this point and while he may well be providing terrible legal representation for Trump, he’s actually the most honest representation of him in general.” Oliver continued to describe how the pair are actually incredibly similar. “They’re basically two versions of the same person,” he said. “They’re both New Yorkers coasting on their reputations, they’ve both had three marriages, neither of them can shut up when in front of a camera and, perhaps most importantly, they both want to fuck Ivanka, which is weird for Trump because she’s in his family and weird for Giuliani because she isn’t.” But he also had a worrying vision for the future: “He’s so fatally flawed as a human being that he’s probably going to end up president.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/08/source-public-sector-food-from-uk-post-brexit-farmers-say","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"Source public sector food from UK post-Brexit, farmers say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/08/source-public-sector-food-from-uk-post-brexit-farmers-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/08/source-public-sector-food-from-uk-post-brexit-farmers-say","fields":{"headline":"Source public sector food from UK post-Brexit, farmers say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Food procured for Britain’s public sector after Brexit should be sourced from the UK wherever possible, the biggest farming organisation has said. Promised sweeping reforms of food and farming have been cast by ministers as a flagship policy that will unlock some of the biggest potential benefits from Brexit. But farmers fear they will lose the £3bn-a-year taxpayer subsidy they enjoy under EU rules and be hamstrung by subsidised competition from Europe. For a consultation on the potential reforms that closes on Tuesday, the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) is submitting proposals that suggest the NHS, schools, the government and other publicly run services that use government buying standards should be “wherever possible, sourcing British assured ingredients”, except for products not grown in the UK. If followed through, this would ensure a market of tens of billions of pounds a year to British farming and food production and secure millions of jobs. It would also provide a guaranteed market amid uncertainty for British farmers and food processors on the future export tariff regime. Such proposals have been rejected by Whitehall in the past as being incompatible with EU rules that require member states to treat each other equally in public procurement. However, other EU countries manage to interpret the regulations in their favour: France announced plans this year to require the public sector to buy food that was organic and locally produced. Minette Batters, president of the NFU, said: “I want British farmers and growers to remain the number one supplier of choice to the UK market, and I want British people to be able to enjoy more sustainable, quality, affordable British food at a range of prices that suit all incomes. A future farm policy could uplift British farming’s ability to produce food for the nation … and enhance our reputation for high-welfare food which delivers for the environment.” Under the banner Health and Harmony, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is consulting with farmers, food producers, landowners, countryside campaigners and environmental groups in an attempt to redraw the relationship between the countryside and urban Britain, and the future of taxpayer support for farming. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has said repeatedly he wants any taxpayer support for farmers to be dependent on them providing “public goods”, such as protections for wildlife, and maintaining the countryside. The NFU also said farmers could provide public goods, for instance under schemes to value the “ecosystems services”, such as water storage and flood prevention, that farmers can provide through better management of their land. The NFU also called for the government to be flexible on the transition period of Brexit, saying it was not sensible “to impose an arbitrary timeframe on the length of transition required”, and called for easier ways for seasonal labourers from overseas to be employed in the UK after Brexit, an issue that is already causing problems for some. Other campaigners are concerned that the government will retreat from existing EU protections while failing to address more wide-ranging problems, such as concerns that intensive farming may become more attractive after Brexit if cash-strapped farmers are beset by low-cost, subsidised and lower-quality competition and unable to recruit cheap workers from eastern Europe. Peter Melchett, policy director of the Soil Association, said the “rare opportunity to ensure we’re farming in ways that benefit human health” had been missed. He stressed in particular the threat of resistance to antibiotics, which can spread from the overuse of the drugs on livestock, and the dietary ill-health that is costing the NHS billions because of overprocessed food. He said: “It is frustrating that the Health and Harmony consultation has frankly bugger all to say about human health. No clear actions are proposed. The need to reduce farm antibiotic use gets a mention, as does the possibility that access to green spaces might benefit our wellbeing, but there is so much more to it than this. Britain has the most ultra-processed diet in Europe and fruit and vegetables could become less affordable post-Brexit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/thomasina-miers-recipe-crab-new-potato-salad-salsa-macha","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T08:30:54Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for crab and new potato salad with salsa macha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/thomasina-miers-recipe-crab-new-potato-salad-salsa-macha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/thomasina-miers-recipe-crab-new-potato-salad-salsa-macha","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for crab and new potato salad with salsa macha","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Salsa macha is a deliriously delicious chilli oil from Veracruz, a port on the eastern side of Mexico. It is made with toasted garlic, peanuts and sesame (an ingredient brought over from Africa, via the Caribbean), and it has a natural affinity with seafood – a must with raw seafood tostadas. Here I pair it with a British crab and new potato salad, which makes a lovely starter. Crab, new potato and watercress salad with pickled onions and salsa macha The chilli oil adds an intensely nutty, lightly fiery and terrifically garlicky spark of flavour to the salad. Leave out the sesame and peanuts for a simpler version. Chile de arbol can be found online and in good supermarkets, but substitute with any hot, dried red chilli. Prep 5 min Cook 40 min Serves 4 500g new potatoes (jersey royals, anya or pink fir apple are great varieties) Salt 100ml cider vinegar 3 tbsp caster sugar 2 large banana shallots, halved and finely sliced 6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil The juice of 2 limes 200g dressed crab meat 2 bags watercress 1 large bunch each of basil and tarragon, leaves picked For the salsa macha 25g dried red chillies (I use chile de arbol) 6 fat garlic cloves 25g sesame seeds 600ml sunflower oil 90g peanuts – raw, untoasted, unsalted 2 tsp sea salt 1 tsp caster sugar Put the potatoes in a saucepan, cover with cold water, add a quarter-teaspoon of salt, bring to a boil and cook until tender. Heat the vinegar in a small pan with 100ml water, the sugar and half a teaspoon of salt. When hot, pour this mixture over the shallots and set aside. Now make the chilli oil. De-stem the chillies, discarding any seeds that fall out, and bash the garlic cloves a few times with a heavy object to remove their skins. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a medium heat for four to five minutes until they are a pale gold, then set aside. In a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat, warm 200ml of the oil and add the peanuts and garlic, gently frying until both turn a light caramel colour, (but turn the oil down if it sizzles too much – burning the peanuts, garlic or chillies will make the salsa taste bitter). Pour the oil through a sieve and empty the nuts and garlic into a bowl. Pour the oil back into the pan, add the chillies and fry for one to two minutes, over a medium heat until they darken in colour and smell nutty. Pour in the rest of the oil to stop the cooking and turn off the heat. Grind the sesame seeds in a blender, for a few minutes. Aadd the chilli and garlic, half the peanuts, one teaspoon of salt and the sugar. Blitz to a coarse crumb. Now pour in the oil and blitz for another minute. Add the rest of the nuts, stir well and taste, adding more salt, and a little sugar, if necessary. Cut the potatoes into finger-thick discs and toss in half the olive oil and half the lime juice, then season. Stir the rest of the olive oil and the lime into the crab, and season. Wash and dry the watercress and herbs and arrange on a large platter, with the potatoes on top. Scatter with the crab, the pickled shallots and a little of their vinegar, and drizzle with one to two teaspoons of the salsa macha. Serve with fresh bread and more salsa on the side, for those that want more. And for the rest of the week The chilli oil does crazily good things to eggs and vegetables – I spoon it over a fried egg for breakfast, or underneath braised green vegetables for supper. It adds a lovely heat to smashed avocadoes, and is great with pasta – try toasted breadcrumbs, anchovies and walnuts. Lastly, try a little of it over slow-roasted summer tomatoes on toast. The leftover pickling liquid from the shallots is great with summer fruits such as raspberries and cherries.

No ring roads or dual carriageways. In fact, no cars. Fleets of “taxi-carts” or “pedi-cabs” service its streets. No bigger than 15km across (so everywhere’s less than 30 minutes’ ride away). No cycle lanes; every inch is cycle-able. Anyway, back to reality. You might spy Velotopia in parts of Denmark or the Netherlands, but in the UK it’s still Motopia – for now. A decade ago, the government began its Cycle City and Towns programme (flagship members Blackpool, Bristol, Cambridge, Chester, Colchester, Leighton Linslade, Shrewsbury, Southend, Southport, Stoke, York and Woking remain some of the UK’s more bike-friendly), and then came Bradley Wiggins and the Mamils. British Cycling lists towns and cities stretching from Plymouth to Edinburgh as best for cycle commuting; but for sheer numbers Cambridge is way ahead: 52% of its citizens cycle at least once a week, 31% five times; next is Oxford, at 33.5% and 12.6%; then York, at 27% and 10.6%. Nowhere else comes close – yet. So many places are investing in infrastructure – Cardiff is pledging to eject half its commuters from their cars by 2021; Manchester’s bike tsar Chris Boardman is calling for a £1.5bn fund to encourage walking and cycling – that Velotopia might not be so unreachable after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/23/winsome-pinnock-leave-taking-bush-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T16:30:28Z","webTitle":"Winsome Pinnock: 'I used to think we needed change – now we need a revolution'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/23/winsome-pinnock-leave-taking-bush-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/23/winsome-pinnock-leave-taking-bush-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Winsome Pinnock: 'I used to think we needed change – now we need a revolution'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘I am a Windrush baby,” says Winsome Pinnock, “the child of people from the Windrush generation, and this country owes that generation so much.” Pinnock’s 1986 play Leave Taking – the first by a black woman to be staged at the National Theatre – is being revived at the Bush theatre in London. It’s a timely decision for a work that charts a clash of generations between Enid, who has moved from Jamaica to make a life in England and give her children the opportunities she never had, and her teenage daughters – born in the UK – who know nothing of the West Indies and see England as home. There is a line about an immigrant who is told his papers are not in order and who faces deportation. “That was written 30 years ago,” says Pinnock, wryly. Her frustration with the slow pace of change in general, and theatre in particular, is quietly but potently expressed. “We need to honour these journeys that are so old. Hundreds of years old. We must honour the sacrifices made by my parents, but also by our great, great, great, great grandparents. There is a link with this country that goes back generations,” she says, referring to slavery. “We deserve opportunities and access because our history and sense of being is part of this country’s history. It’s important not to forget that, because our history is one of being overlooked and silenced. It’s a continuing cycle and unless it’s broken there can be no progress. You can’t get away from the fact that we have been oppressed.” This production will mark the first time Leave Taking has been staged in London since 1997, and Pinnock’s only regret is that her mother is no longer around to see it. She died three years ago, and her last words to the daughter who had asked her mum endless questions about life in Jamaica when creating the play was to urge her to keep writing. “She had Alzheimer’s, but her saying I must keep going, keep writing, made me realise how important it was to her.” It’s important to Pinnock, too. She may once have been described by this paper as “the godmother of black British playwrights”, but despite accolades – including the George Devine award, and numerous well-received plays including Talking in Tongues and Mules at the Royal Court in the mid-1990s – she has been sorely neglected. In recent years, she has written shorts for the Bush and the Tricycle and had several radio plays broadcast, but her last major play in the theatre was One Under, more than a decade ago. “I felt forgotten. It’s painful. Writers are so powerless. We have a directors’ theatre, and if you are going to get plays seen, you have to have people in buildings championing you – and I didn’t have that.” Now she does, in Madani Younis, who is directing Leave Taking and has commissioned her to write a new play. She has also just finished a draft of Rockets in Blue Light, which she describes as “a conversation between the past and the present” set in contemporary London and the 19th-century capital just after the abolition of slavery. She remains fascinated by the craft of writing, which has led to a fruitful life in academia teaching playwrighting (“I learn as much as I teach,”), but while she knows she has achieved a great deal and that every hard-won gain should be celebrated, she is also acutely aware of how far there is to go for writers of colour. “I never imagined I’d ever have a play on. I grew up in Islington, in the poor bit, in a single-parent household and I was educated in the inner city. When I was told I was the first black woman to have a play on at the National Theatre, I thought, ‘That’s great, that’s progress.’ But then I thought, ‘Why did it take so long?’” We meet in the week in which Natasha Gordon’s debut play, Nine Night, opened at the National to rave reviews, but Gordon is still one of only a handful of black female writers, including debbie tucker green and Michaela Coel, who have had their work staged at the National. It’s hard for any young playwright to progress, but without a strong champion for writers of colour – Pinnock’s early work was supported by Jules Wright and the Women’s Playhouse Trust – the invisible barriers further lessen the opportunities. “You are always finding yourself cast as a beginner, always a young writer, even though I no longer was,” she says. “There was a sense for me and my peers, other black women writers, of feeling we weren’t allowed to grow up and progress – the feeling that I constantly had to prove myself over and over, and never getting to the point when people said, ‘You can do this.’” Pinnock argues it is not just the individual who suffers, but the entire culture, leaving each new generation of black female writers to feel that nothing came before them. “Always feeling that you are the first is a lonely place to be,” she says. “If writers like me are denied a full career and the opportunity to reach our mature voice and fulfil our creative potential or tell our stories, it’s not just a censoring of that individual but the censoring of an entire community. I feel this far more passionately than I ever did. You leave a trace of yourself as an unresolved history. It’s not enough that you now have black actors playing parts not necessarily written for them. There is a culture and history that should be told and seen on stage. I used to think we needed change to progress. Now I think we need a revolution. I was a shy kid, full of self-doubt when I wrote Leave Taking. I’m no longer that shy kid. I’ve got stuff to say. Let me say it.” She smiles. “What can be so dangerous about that?” • Leave Taking is at the Bush theatre, London, from 24 May.

Diary of a Provincial Lady, EM Delafield --- If you’ve never seen a jam roly-poly, it’s a suet pastry spread with jam and rolled up like a Swiss roll, before being steamed. The recipe is almost laughably simple; Mrs Beeton’s 19th century version calls for just jam, flour, suet and water. I’ve added butter and milk in the version below, like most 20th century recipes, which give the roly-poly a richer, sweeter taste. I read The Diary of a Provincial Lady last year, and the roly-poly on this bizarre plate of food stayed with me. Not only did a steamed pudding sound like an odd choice for July, I felt, like the titular Provincial Lady, horrified at the thought of it alongside cheese and pickles. The book itself is a wonderfully dry, witty work – a fictional diary (with undeniably autobiographical elements) that documents the daily minutiae in the life of a Devon wife and mother in 1930. Originally published in serial form in Time and Tide, the book is filled with the character’s constant battles with her cook (negotiating over cold beef and beetroot, while hoping for roast chicken and bread sauce), collection of ridiculous neighbours, her perpetually bored and unimpressed husband Robert, and her wish to “maintain the detached attitude of a modern mother” when dealing with her children Vicky and Robin. It’s self-deprecating and self-aware, genuinely hilarious and an enormous amount of fun; a perfect book for spring. Jam roly-poly Serves 6 Ingredients 225g self-raising flour (plus more for dusting) 40g salted butter 60g suet 170ml whole milk 150g raspberry jam Equipment Mixing bowl Butter knife Tin foil Greaseproof paper Rolling pin Roasting dish 1. Place an oven tray at the base of the oven and fill it with water. Make sure there’s an oven tray or rack in the centre of the oven. Preheat the oven to 180C. 2. Tip the flour into the bowl and rub the butter in with your fingertips. Mix the suet through the flour. Pour in the milk, then use the knife to cut it through. Bring the pastry together with your hands. 3. Dust your work surface with flour and then roll out the pastry with a floured rolling pin. Aim for a square about 25cm wide. Spread jam over all the dough, save for an inch along one edge. Roll it up towards the non-jam edge, pinching the dough closed down the length and at both ends. 4. Spread out a sheet of tin foil, and place a sheet of greaseproof paper on top. Place the roly-poly, seam side down, on the paper. Roll it up loosely in the paper (it will expand while baking) and then scrunch the foil around it too. 5. Place it in the roasting dish. Transfer to the oven for 70 minutes. Leave to cool for a little and then serve warm. If you cut into it straight out of the oven, it might crumble when you cut it, and you’ll lose the swirl a little (like I did), so be patient. It’s great with custard – but not so good with cheese and pickles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/08/complaints-about-state-of-the-game-born-from-nostalgia-for-afl-past","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"Complaints about state of the game born from nostalgia for AFL past | Craig Little","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/08/complaints-about-state-of-the-game-born-from-nostalgia-for-afl-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/08/complaints-about-state-of-the-game-born-from-nostalgia-for-afl-past","fields":{"headline":"Complaints about state of the game born from nostalgia for AFL past","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dermott Brereton, one of the greatest players of his generation, joined a chorus of disillusioned voices last week when he said he doesn’t love the game anymore. “I love Australian rules football, but I don’t love the game now,” Brereton said on SEN last week. Brereton believes coaches are making the game unnecessarily complicated and that today’s players are robotic. “We would write up on the board to have 10 tackles per quarter and we never lost a game,” said Brereton. “If you get 40 now you are a low-pressure team and that is because you need saturation of numbers around the ball. That’s just the nature of the game now.” Brereton lays the blame at the feet of coaching panels that put in “60 hours a week to make their club win”. In his day, Brereton says the players used to nut it out for themselves. “If you took this current game style and immediately swapped it to the 80s or 90s style of football where you barely got rotated we would wipe the floor with them.” It’s an impossible and almost futile argument, partly because those of us who grew up watching Brereton are not objectively entering a debate (despite another round of AFL that outside of North Melbourne’s upset over Sydney and Brisbane pushing Collingwood, had little to recommend it) as much participating in a fable of longing and satisfaction. Nostalgia is a very human trait. In The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap, Stephanie Coontz notes that when school children returning from summer holiday are asked to name good and bad things about their summer, the lists tend to be equally long. “As the year goes on, however, if the exercise is repeated, the good list grows longer, and the bad list gets shorter, until by the end of the year the children are describing not their actual vacations but their idealised image of vacation.” This is to say that consciously or unconsciously, we manipulate our memories to include or omit certain things. Or to put it more simply, anything we process by memory is fiction. So it is with our collective “memory” of football. There were a lot of awful games in the 1970s and 1980s. Selective memory is not a bad thing, but it’s a serious problem when it leads adults to try to re-create a past that never really existed. In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, is also the mother of the nine muses. The past always seems so much more vivid and more generous than the present. Football’s “good old days” are larger than life because invariably, we’re talking about the game we loved as children, when the footballers we watched were… well, larger than life. If Woody Allen had chosen Melbourne, rather than Paris as his muse, Midnight in Melbourne may have featured Guy Pearce as Mike, a disillusioned Fox Footy writer. Mike wanders the back lanes of Melbourne when at the stroke of midnight, a Holden Kingswood pulls beside him, Centerfold by The J. Geils Band blaring from the tape deck. He joins the permed and mulleted passengers in duffle coats on their way to Windy Hill to watch Essendon play Hawthorn and sees Leigh Matthews snap a point post. Melbourne appears perpetually alive, not only because of the ghosts of famous footballers, but because the suburbs are the source and setting of so much of their work – by day, and at the social clubs by night. The Victorian government’s $225m makeover of the Etihad Stadium precinct is a generation away. Over the course of his visits back to the 1980s, Mike develops a crush on Debbie, a woman who has been keeping company with Mark Maclure, Roger Merrett and Gary Buckenara. But like Adriana in Midnight in Paris, who wishes she could exchange the dreary Paris of the 1920s for the Belle Époque, Debbie longs for the Melbourne of the 1950s. Debbie’s dissatisfaction with her own era mirrors Mike’s… mirrors our own. This is largely because the joy we have for the game began in our childhood, and it wasn’t predicated on game styles or tactics which seem to consume us in adulthood, nor did it endure the minutia from a five-minute media conference that becomes a 30-minute talking point on sports radio. But all this analysis and white noise does not an era make. When you boil the game down to its irreducible core, the present era has plenty to recommend it. And it will take more than seven weeks of sometimes ugly and predominately disappointing football to dilute that sense of wonder that got us hooked to begin with. Last year was one of the most unpredictable and engrossing seasons of all time, and produced one of greatest individual seasons in living memory – the Dusty fend off is already as iconic as Haydn Bunton Junior, ball tucked under his arm in mid-flight. Before that we had the “Bontempelli bump” and one of the more remarkable journeys to a premiership. And through it all we’ve had the brilliance of Buddy Franklin, the reinvention of the midfielder through Nathan Fyfe and Patrick Cripps, and one of the greatest, most creative small forwards ever known in Eddie Betts. Who knows, 30 years from now today’s generation of kids might by pensively evoking a time where you used to get more than 100 tackles in a game? If there’s one thing we can be sure of, is that the game will change, and that’s OK, it’s part of its beauty – the game evolves, and it offers each generation something of their own."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/07/choice-launches-energy-service-that-will-automatically-switch-customers-to-best-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T07:18:46Z","webTitle":"Choice launches energy service that will automatically switch customers to best deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/choice-launches-energy-service-that-will-automatically-switch-customers-to-best-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/choice-launches-energy-service-that-will-automatically-switch-customers-to-best-deal","fields":{"headline":"Choice launches energy service that will automatically switch customers to best deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The consumer group Choice has launched a $99 service to compare prices from electricity retailers, monitor them for 12 months and automatically switch subscribers to the best deal. Canisaveonenergy.com.au, which was launched on Monday, allows consumers to upload a recent power bill PDF and find out how much they could save with a new service based on a price comparison from 33 providers. However, they won’t be told which retailer is offering the best deal unless they pay the annual fee. After the $99 fee is paid, Choice will handle the switch and also any subsequent switches to better deals within that 12 months. Guardian Australia tested the new service with quarterly electricity and gas bills worth a combined $517.97. Choice analysed the bill and advised that an immediate switch to a new provider would save $271 a year. Less the $99 fee, that is a saving of $172. Choice’s head of media, Tom Godfrey, said bigger savings could be unlocked by switching providers every three months or so, which was what the Choice Transformer tool was designed to do. He said prelaunch testing of the “concierge service” software found savings of up to $1,500 for individual households. Research Choice conducted with MI Retail concluded that Australian households were paying an average of $324 more than they needed on energy every year. The new product, which was developed with Dr Bruce Mountain of Carbon and Energy Markets, is aimed squarely at disrupting the household electricity retail market where 12 or 24-month contracts are on the rise. “Staying on the same energy plan long-term is the most expensive option,” Godfrey said. “You really only save when you move every quarter.” He said it was difficult enough for many consumers to take the information on a bill and compare to offers from dozens of retailers, let alone doing it every 12 weeks. “Our service dynamically scans all the available deals on the market without you having to decipher the technical jargon,” Godfrey said. “If we can save you more than $99 you can pay for us to continue to monitor the market for you for the next 12 months. Every time we find you a better deal, we’ll change providers for you.” Godfrey said Choice was not satisfied with the current price comparison sites for energy. “We don’t have commission, which none of the others can claim,” he said. “There are hidden costs with commercial sites. By not giving commissions to energy companies, and charging a $99 annual fee, we are able to put consumers first and give them a bigger share of the savings on offer.” When asked how much money Choice expected to make from the service, Godfrey said: “We are trying to make a point rather than money … what we want to do is encourage energy retailers to keep giving consumers better value.” At launch, the service is available in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or south-east Queensland. The service works best with energy bills in PDF format as supplied by the retailer, although Choice is hoping to be able to add the ability to rapidly process photos of paper bills in the future. Canisaveonenergy.com.au joins Choice’s two existing “disruptive tools”: cluckar.com, which lets shoppers check free range egg claims and has had more than 1m scans and 100,000 downloads; and doineedhealthinsurance.com.au, which more than 125,000 people have completed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/06/its-a-bit-throbby-grand-final-hero-lawrence-thomas-shrugs-off-head-injuries","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T01:30:19Z","webTitle":"'It's a bit throbby': grand final hero Lawrence Thomas shrugs off head injuries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/06/its-a-bit-throbby-grand-final-hero-lawrence-thomas-shrugs-off-head-injuries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/06/its-a-bit-throbby-grand-final-hero-lawrence-thomas-shrugs-off-head-injuries","fields":{"headline":"'It's a bit throbby': grand final hero Lawrence Thomas shrugs off head injuries","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As Lawrence Thomas answered questions beneath Newcastle’s McDonald Jones Stadium, deflecting praise as he had goal-bound shots, he had the air of a man on his way to a Halloween party. The Melbourne Victory goalkeeper and Joe Marston medallist had just shut out Newcastle in their home A-League grand final. Now he stood before the assembled media, swollen and swathed, and was asked how he’d done it. But firstly, after being battered and wrapped incrementally as a brutal game wore on, was he OK? “It’s a bit throbby but I’m going to try to get this bandage off, sort it out so I can go and have a little dance,” the 25-year-old said. He performed a pirouette and flashed a grin. Thomas’s second straight man-of-the-match performance had left him resembling Hannibal Lecter, or was it The Mummy? Whichever, the Victory shot stopper was a villain from central casting in the Jets’ 90-minute horror flick. There was the double save, when the hosts were surging in the first half. Thomas threw himself to his left to reach a stinging shot along the carpet from Riley McGree, then filled as much of the night air as he could to smother Jason Hoffman’s follow-up. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Dimitri Petratos and John Koutroumbis had earlier combined to feed Roy O’Donovan a flick from the six-yard box, and Thomas denied him. The Irishman later appeared keen to deny Thomas his head. Despite some viewers perhaps thinking they had flicked over to the UFC, the keeper was quick to forgive the red-carded Jets forward. He gave credit to O’Donovan for apologising in person after full-time, and revealed the pair had gone house hunting together as younger men in England when both were signed to Coventry. “Yeah I saw him coming, I was just watching the ball. I didn’t expect to have it happen,” Thomas said. “But um, forget that, it’s job done. It’s try to stay in the game and take each moment as it is. I just tried to do what I do best, get myself in the way.” Thomas has played his way from second choice keeper at the Victory to the subject of overseas transfer rumours, including the latest, that his seven years in Melbourne will end with him signing for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr. If he does become Lawrence of Arabia, Thomas will leave a club that knows it owes a title to him. When Victory talisman Besart Berisha emerged from Victory’s dressing room on Saturday night, the A-League trophy slung over his shoulder, he shook his head at the bravery of his keeper. He also seemed amused by all the bandages. “I couldn’t see his face anymore. He got every 10 minutes a different bandage,” Berisha said. “But look he was, not just today, he was all the year, unbelievable good. He deserves to be a champion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/06/the-fall-review-southwark-playhouse-london-james-fritz","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T10:10:54Z","webTitle":"The Fall review – millennial angst supplies short, sharp shock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/06/the-fall-review-southwark-playhouse-london-james-fritz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/06/the-fall-review-southwark-playhouse-london-james-fritz","fields":{"headline":"The Fall review – millennial angst supplies short, sharp shock","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Fall opens with a glee club-style choir, stomping on stage and pumping out synchronised dance moves to the bubblegum pop of One Direction’s Live While We’re Young. It sets a deceptively upbeat tone to this short, sharp shock of a play on ageing and millennial angst. Though, even this early on, darkness lurks around the ensemble, from their rigid smiles to their identical grey T-shirts and trainers that might easily pass for prison regulation clothing. The song’s lyrics, repeated between acts, take on ever-increasing notes of irony. The mood changes after a young, unnamed couple are stalled in their plans to have sex in a 92-year-old man’s house. “Old people, man, they’re fucking disgusting,” says one, and his spitting contempt later opens up to a more nuanced dialectic of anxiety and fear between cash-strapped millennials and their comparatively wealthy, ageing counterparts. Who, the play asks, will bear the financial responsibility of care for the elderly when the young can barely afford to pay the rent? Each act moves further away from naturalism, giving way to a futuristic dystopia in which a ruthless solution has been found for the burden of the old. James Fritz is a young, garlanded playwright whose work has examined the politics and poetry of millennial lives, from a 2014 Olivier-nominated play on online identities (Four Minutes Twelve Seconds) to the 2015 Bruntwood prize-winning drama on political activism (Parliament Square). Like that previous work, The Fall plays games with time. Temporal jump-cuts are compressed into a few staccato sentences, such as when another unnamed couple progress in their relationship, from introductions to the mother-in-law – “Hello Jean”– to “I’m pregnant”, in moments. The 70-minute production takes us from youth to death, and the elderly characters we see in the final act may well be the young people we saw at the start. It is slickly done; dialogue pulsates with energy and the cast give strong performances under the direction of Matt Harrison. The set is bold in its sparseness, with only the single, central prop of a bed – not one in the mould of Tracey Emin’s, which teems with the detritus of life – but a signifier of infirmity and oblivion. It is youth theatre at its most mature, and most dazzling. At Southwark Playhouse, London, until 19 May.

Conservatives in Pendle were accused of cynicism after it emerged that Rosemary Carroll had been brought back into the party fold after Thursday’s local election to give them a one-seat majority. Carroll was suspended from the council for three months last June after sharing a joke on Facebook that compared Asian people to dogs. She sat on the council as an independent after the suspension. At the local election count, however, she was seen wearing a Conservative rosette, and when the results gave the Tories 24 seats, the same as Labour and the Lib Dems combined, it emerged she had been readmitted, breaking the deadlock. Carroll, who was elected in 2016, was not among the councillors who needed to stand again this year. The decision prompted condemnation from Labour and activist groups. Asked about it on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show, Clark said: “I haven’t seen that, but I have seen the reports of it, and it seems to me that if they are the views of this person, she has no place in the Conservative party, and I’m sure the party authorities will have to investigate that.” Asked what could happen, he said: “If they are her views then they are incompatible with the Conservative party, but it is for the party authorities to investigate that.” The Conservative chair, Brandon Lewis, had tweeted praise for the local party on Friday: Speaking on Sunday, Lewis said he would look at the case, but seemed to indicate that Carroll’s reinstatement was not necessarily a problem. “Her position has been from the very beginning that she accidentally posted something that she wanted to delete,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. Carroll had been suspended by the party but had later taken diversity training, he said: “She’s been through training, she’s apologised, she’s had punishment. This was all dealt with locally at the time. I am going to be having a look at this.” The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said there must be immediate action. He told Andrew Marr: “To have the Conservative party take control of the council by reinstating a councillor who used the foulest racist joke is unacceptable. “I want Theresa May to say now to Brandon Lewis, who congratulated those councillors, first of all to apologise and suspend that councillor again. It’s unacceptable.” Mohammed Iqbal, the leader of the Labour group in Pendle, said the situation was appalling. “She turned up with a Conservative rosette literally as the votes were being counted,” he said. The Conservative leader on the council, Paul White, said Carroll’s post had been shared in error and that she had apologised and taken diversity training."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/07/indigenous-elders-urge-expanded-koori-courts-after-juvenile-detention-time-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T17:59:27Z","webTitle":"Indigenous elders urge expanded Koori courts to help cut juvenile detention time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/indigenous-elders-urge-expanded-koori-courts-after-juvenile-detention-time-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/indigenous-elders-urge-expanded-koori-courts-after-juvenile-detention-time-cut","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous elders urge expanded Koori courts to help cut juvenile detention time","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Aboriginal elders have called for the New South Wales government to commit to expanding the youth Koori court program after an evaluation found it halved the amount of time young people spent in detention. The Koori court began as a pilot project at Parramatta children’s court in February 2015 but has not received ongoing funding. An evaluation of the pilot program released by the University of Western Sydney on Monday found it cut the average number of days spent in youth detention, as well as helping address underlying issues such as unstable accommodation, lack of engagement in education and employment, and disconnection from Aboriginal culture. Elders who worked on the project told Guardian Australia that it had been successful in reaching children who had little family support and had disconnected from the community. Kamilaroi elder Uncle Rex Sorby said the Koori court model, which allowed elders to sit on round-table hearings alongside the magistrate, police prosecutor and Aboriginal Legal Service lawyer, was less intimidating and more likely to produce results than a traditional western judicial model. Sorby said that his presence allowed Aboriginal people facing the hearing to speak freely about issues that had contributed to their offending, when they ordinarily would not. “They would not speak at the Koori court until I told them who I was and how I was going to address them, and then they opened up and tell me everything, all their problems, and then we addressed it,” he said. “They don’t want these big judges and all those sort of professional people sitting down judging these kids because they’ve never experienced those sort of things.” Darug elder Uncle Greg Simms said elders were able to connect young people to their culture and help heal trauma caused by generations of policy intervention by state and federal governments. Simms said that young Aboriginal people, who are placed in youth detention at 26 times the rate of non-Indigenous young people, did not belong in jail. “I can’t understand why the government don’t fund the courts because they’re the ones that set us up to fail in the first place,” he said. Darug elder Aunty Sandra Lee, who also volunteers on the program, said the youth Koori court model should be extended. “I think it’s a wonderful thing and if you could build something on that to tell the truth, that would be wonderful,” she said. The NSW attorney general, Mark Speakman, said he was “encouraged” by the work of the youth Koori court, however he did not say whether he would commit to funding it as a permanent program. “I have received a report on the Youth Koori Court pilot authored by the University of Western Sydney and I look forward to considering the report in more detail,” Speakman said. Victoria has had a Koori court since 1989 and a children’s Koori court since 2005. It’s the only state where those specialist courts are established under legislation, though other states have specialist community sentencing programs for some Aboriginal offenders. The NSW pilot program only admitted serious youth offenders, those at risk of jail time, who had pleaded guilty to their charges and volunteered to be sentenced through the Koori court. Sentencing was deferred for six to 12 months to allow for a period of intensive case management, during which the young person had monthly round-table hearings. At the end of that deferral period, young people had a celebratory “graduation day” from the Koori court program and received their deferred sentence. The evaluation report tracked 33 cases heard by the youth Koori court in 2016. It found that 26 young people identified disconnection from their culture and community as a key issue, 26 were unable to find employment, nine were homeless, 22 had health issues, 28 had substance abuse issues, 13 lacked basic identity documents such as birth certificates or Medicare cards; and 18 were unable to pay outstanding fines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/06/live-exports-terrifying-new-footage-prompts-maritime-union-to-call-for-suspension","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T06:33:04Z","webTitle":"Live exports: 'terrifying' new footage prompts maritime union to call for suspension","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/06/live-exports-terrifying-new-footage-prompts-maritime-union-to-call-for-suspension","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/06/live-exports-terrifying-new-footage-prompts-maritime-union-to-call-for-suspension","fields":{"headline":"Live exports: 'terrifying' new footage prompts maritime union to call for suspension","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Maritime Union of Australia has joined calls for a temporary suspension of the live export trade after the release of more whistleblower footage showed crew on live export ships struggling to clean up the heavily decayed carcasses of sheep that had died from heat stress. The footage was filmed on the Panama-flagged Awassi Express by whistleblower Faisal Ullah, who earlier released footage of five voyages stocked by Australian company Emanuel Exports to Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes program. Additional footage was released to Fairfax Media by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). It shows crew trying to scoop up the heavily decayed remains of sheep that have died from heat stress and dump them overboard. The carcasses, which are just hours old, fall apart when touched, the fat rendered in a way that former live export vet Dr Lynn Simpson said showed they had been cooked from the inside. The scenes were filmed on now infamous Awassi Express voyage from Fremantle to the Gulf states in August 2017 on which 2,400 sheep died of heat stress. It was released just days after Labor said it would ban the live sheep trade, despite earlier saying it would wait for the outcome of a snap animal welfare review called by the federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud. The review, conducted by the live export vet Dr Michael McCarthy, will look at the management of heat stress in the live sheep trade. Littleproud is due to get the draft report on Monday and the final report by Friday. He previously said he will follow McCarthy’s recommendations – even if they call for an end to the summer trade. He has also said he will look at tougher penalties for exporters who breach animal welfare rules, which Guardian Australia understands could be fines of more than $1m and jail terms of up to 10 years. The ITF president and Maritime Union of Australia national secretary, Paddy Crumlin, said the footage of workers in minimal safety gear struggling to remove dead sheep showed that conditions on board live export ships were “a living hell” for both workers and animals. “Sadly, the utterly disgraceful treatment of animals onboard live export vessels is often mirrored by the equally dismal treatment of seafarers, and this new footage is a terrifying reminder of what life can be like at sea when workers have no rights,” he said in a statement. “It’s a living hell.” Crumlin said the Australian government should temporarily ban the live sheep trade until it had determined a way for sheep to be transported humanely. Ullah’s footage was sent in full to the federal and WA agriculture departments last month. WA is also looking to prosecute Emanuel Exports for animal welfare offences. The ship at the centre of the debate, the Awassi Express, departed Fremantle with no cargo nine days ago after a two-week delay imposed by the maritime regulator prevented it from loading sheep bound for the Middle East. It was instead due to reach Broome on Sunday to be loaded with cattle bound for south-east Asia. The Emanuel Exports managing director, Graham Daws, told the ABC last week that the mass fatality aboard the Awassi last year was due to a “catastrophic weather event” and that banning the trade during the middle eastern summer would mean that “the business would close completely and farmers would be selling their farm”. The veterinarian aboard the Emanuel Exports stocked ship Al Messilah, which left Fremantle last week with 68,000 sheep on board told the ABC that “heat stress is a very minimal problem”. About 3,000 sheep died of heat stress on a single voyage on the Al Messilah in 2016. An analysis by Guardian Australia of 70 mass mortality events investigated by the department of agriculture in the past 10 years found that none resulted in the exporter receiving a fine or loss of licence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/07/coalitions-uniersity-cuts-a-false-economy-that-will-undermine-budget-modelling-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"Cuts to university funding will cost the country billions, study claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/coalitions-uniersity-cuts-a-false-economy-that-will-undermine-budget-modelling-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/07/coalitions-uniersity-cuts-a-false-economy-that-will-undermine-budget-modelling-says","fields":{"headline":"Cuts to university funding will cost the country billions, study claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The $2.2bn cut to universities made in December is a “false economy” that will actually leave the budget worse off in the long term due to decreased income tax receipts, Universities Australia has argued. Modelling from Cadence Economics commissioned by Universities Australia finds that over a 20-year period the cuts will cost the budget between $2.2bn and $3.9bn. In the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook the Turnbull government cut $2.2bn from universities predominantly through a two-year freeze in commonwealth grants funding for teaching and learning. Universities Australia has now called for the $7bn improvement in the budget bottom line since December to go towards reversing the cuts. Universities Australia estimates the freeze has meant that 9,500 fewer Australians can attend university in 2018, rising to 19,500 in 2019 and 23,000 in 2020. Using those figures and the fact that university graduates tend to earn 31% higher wages than people with certificate 3 and 4 vocational qualifications, Cadence Economics estimated the impact to the budget over a 20-year period at $3.9bn. It found that for every Australian who misses out on a university qualification as a consequence of the funding freeze, the cost to the economy is approximately $471,000 in gross domestic product and $152,000 in tax revenue, in present-day terms. Using a more conservative scenario of 2,000, 10,000 and 15,000 fewer enrolments in 2018, 2019 and 2020, Cadence Economics estimated the impact on the budget would be $2.2bn. Estimates of the total impact to the economy ranged from cost $6.9bn and $12.3bn over the next 20 years. Universities Australia’s chief executive, Belinda Robinson, said the figures showed that the university funding cuts are a false economy. “It’s a simple equation – less university funding means fewer skilled graduates, a hit to labour market productivity and less tax revenue for government,” Robinson said. “The work tells us that this short-term budget saving will create unnecessary long-term economic pain by eating into future tax revenue and productivity, and damaging our economy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/07/from-jeers-to-cheers-a-league-title-brings-redemption-for-kevin-muscat","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T18:00:28Z","webTitle":"From jeers to cheers: A-League title brings redemption for Kevin Muscat | Jonathan Howcroft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/07/from-jeers-to-cheers-a-league-title-brings-redemption-for-kevin-muscat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/07/from-jeers-to-cheers-a-league-title-brings-redemption-for-kevin-muscat","fields":{"headline":"From jeers to cheers: A-League title brings redemption for Kevin Muscat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Redemption, thy name is Kevin. As recently as February some Melbourne Victory fans booed the image of their coach Kevin Muscat. “I reckon they’re pretty happy now,” the 44-year old remarked, gesturing towards hordes of travelling Victory supporters dancing in the aisles of McDonald Jones Stadium in celebration of a record fourth A-League championship. Muscat has been involved in some way in all four of Victory’s title successes but none have been more unlikely than this. Yet by overcoming long spells of poor form and upstaging his club’s three biggest rivals in successive weeks it may well be the most satisfying. Championships are normally reward for consistency and excellence over a long period of time, the lifting of silverware the final act of recognition for a competition’s dominant force. Not this season. Victory finished the home-and-away season with a points tally nearer wooden spooners Central Coast Mariners than premiers Sydney FC. After 20 of 27 rounds Victory languished in fifth place having secured three points on only seven occasions. Chairman Anthony Di Pietro spoke at the time of his club’s underachievement. “I stand here and I offer no excuses,” he said. “It’s not good enough and it’s not acceptable by anybody at this football club.” This was seen in some quarters as proving the ground for Muscat’s eventual dismissal but instead a month later the Victory icon possessed a new contract and a clear mandate. “We will be looking to deliver success this year,” Muscat commented. It’s unlikely anybody took such a platitude seriously. Not only had results not gone Victory’s way but performances were disjointed and the squad looked ill thought out. With Besart Berisha labouring and Kosta Barbarouses and James Troisi struggling for form, goals were hard to come by. Behind them the midseason departures of Mark Milligan and Jason Geria left Victory exposed in midfield and defence. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day But as the business end neared key players refound their touch while Terry Antonis filled the Milligan-shaped void. Five wins in seven games saw Victory into the finals with a wet sail but it was perhaps performances in the Asian Champions League that ignited their charge. The win at home to Kawasaki Frontale in March set the template for Victory’s run home. It was a performance of industry and dogged defence against arguably superior opposition. The celebrations greeting Barbarouses’ 90th-minute winner exposed a belief that a plan was coming together. After losing the final match of the regular season to Sydney FC, Victory had an ACL dead rubber to attend to against the star studded Shanghai SIPG. A team full of kids played their more illustrious opponents off the park, turning what could have been a momentum-killing second defeat in a week into a springboard for an elimination final triumph over Adelaide United. That come-from-behind win over what marketers have dubbed Victory’s “original rivals” was the beginning of a finals fantasy. There are no sweeter victories than those secured by last-minute winners and when that last minute winner is an acrobatic volley against a meaningful foe then delirium is justified. The mayhem of the semi-final triumph over Sydney FC quickly consigned Berisha’s volley to footnote status. Not only that but it was a win that curtailed a season-long debate into Sydney’s greatness, one that stuck in the craw of every Victory devotee. Muscat was in his element. In tune with his club’s fanbase he revelled in his rival’s misfortune. “Sometimes when you talk too much it could come back to bite you,” he suggested, after detailing perceived overconfidence from the Sky Blues. It was chippy, authentic, and for the Victory faithful, glorious. Nonetheless Victory were forced to continue swimming against the tide. Newcastle were the feelgood story of grand final week, Victory consigned to the role of killjoy while the football community galvanised around the Jets. It suited Muscat down to the ground. He could set his team up without expectation of result or performance. In return his players executed the game plan to perfection, defending with their lives and capitalising on one moment of good fortune. It was 90-minutes that encapsulated the closing weeks of the season, one of the Victory whole proving greater than the sum of its parts. The icing on the cake for Victory fans was the satisfaction that by securing a championship from fourth position they were denying Melbourne City passage to the Asian Champions League, stalling their rival’s grand plans for another season. They could not have scripted anything better. Three months after enduring catcalls on home turf Muscat now stands alongside Graham Arnold, Ernie Merrick and Ange Postecoglou as one of only four coaches with multiple A-League championship medals. The latest of which will be worn with the greatest sense of achievement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/may/06/chelsea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T17:46:17Z","webTitle":"Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/may/06/chelsea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/may/06/chelsea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’m going to sign off now. Here’s the report from Chelsea. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Bye. I would like to bring you the post-match comments from Klopp and Conte but the coverage has switched to Wenger’s farewell speech at the Emirates. He began it by wishing his friend Alex Ferguson well as he recovers from brain surgery and ended it by telling the Arsenal fans that he will “miss them”. It would be some feat if Liverpool managed to fail to qualify for the Champions League by cocking things up against Brighton. But that’s now a real possibility. Blimey. Of course, if they win the Champions League they could also knock Chelsea into the Europa League even if Antonio Conte’s side do manage to finish fourth. Arsenal gave Wenger a fine send-off at the Emirates. They won 5-0. Jeremy Dresner writes: “Liverpool enjoyed the warm optimistic hug of the final third. Playing like percentages in areas actually matter. But they were strangely allergic to the six-yard box. Like a vegetarian running an all-meat farm-to-plate restaurant. No bite.” Well, after a slow start Chelsea showed other teams how to nullify the threat of Liverpool: defend deep and afford them very little space in behind. That was exactly what Antonio Conte said his team would do before the game. He would have liked a little more enthusiasm in the first 20 minutes but after the goal the work rate was never a problem. Liverpool ran out of ideas – and puff - towards the end of the match. They have now lost 2-1 to Manchester United, drawn 0-0 with Everton, 2-2 with West Brom, 0-0 with Stoke and lost 1-0 to Chelsea after Champions League matches. The European hangover is real, folks. Van Dijk gets on to the end of a Mane cross but his header is straight at Courtois. And that’s that. Liverpool still haven’t secured Champions League football next season and Chelsea have given their top-four chances renewed hope. 90+3 min: Solanke heads wide from six yards after leaping early to get on the end of a Mane cross to the near post. Rudiger leapt at the Liverpool forward, though, and did enough to put the striker off. 90+2 min: Liverpool come again. Moreno swings a ball into the back post that Alonso brings under control with a neat header down before thumping clear. And then Fabregas is replaced by Pedro, which wastes some time and takes the sting out of Liverpool’s attack. 90 min: There will be four minutes of injury time. Liverpool just cannot find the space to shape a shot when they work the ball into the Chelsea penalty area. That’s testament to Chelsea’s increased work rate. They’re not giving any of Liverpool’s forwards a chance to turn. 89 min: Zappacosta is on for Moses, who has been excellent for Chelsea today. And Moreno is on for Milner, who looks knackered. 88 min: Lovren plays a curled diagonal ball into the box towards Solanke, who finds a good spring in his step to tower above Cahill and head just over from 12 yards. 87 min: It’s all a bit sloppy as Solanke loses possession easily and then Cahill gifts the ball back to Liverpool. The attempted clipped pass into the box by Milner is gathered comfortably by Courtois. 85 min: Willian, who scored in this fixture at Anfield earlier this season, is brought on for Hazard, who has been exceptional since Chelsea’s goal. Hazard is given a standing ovation as he trots off. 82 min: Firmino is caught in possession on the halfway line but, as he often does, he wins the ball back off Fabregas as though offended. Liverpool build and Henderson bends a ball into the box that Rudiger stretches to head up and away. And then Henderson repeats the trick, trying to find Firmino on the far post, but Azpilicueta sweeps at the ball, mis-kicks and puffs his cheeks out in relief after watching the ball bobble harmlessly into Courtois’s arms. He was tad lucky there, all right. 80 min: Then Chelsea break and Moses curls a delicious ball in to the back post, where Alonso bends backwards and thumps a left-footed volley inches wide of the far post. That would have been a sublime goal. It was behind him and difficult to control. 78 min: Liverpool are going for this. Alexander-Arnold pings a ball in to Solanke’s feet. The youngster is under pressure but does well to hold the ball near the penalty spot. He’s desperate to turn and shoot at goal but the ball is prodded away by Cahill near. Mane picks up the loose ball and looks to shoot but the blue Chelsea wall moves out squashes the space expertly. The pressure is building though. 76 min: Azpilicueta stops a dangerous-looking Liverpool attack with a wonderfully-timed sliding interception just outside the penalty area. He’s such a steady player. 74 min: Robertson is taken off. Solanke is brought on. Klopp is going to go for this point. Milner is either playing rock–paper–scissors as he gets instructions off Klopp or he’s instructing the team that they’re playing 3-4-2-1. I think that’s what his hands said, anyway. 71 min: Salah tries to dance around a crowd of Chelsea players in the box. He almost succeeds but is finally forced to cut back inside where he tries to play a one-two with Firmino, but the Brazilian’s back-heel is stabbed away. Chelsea break but their counter-attack fizzles out in the final third. 70 min: Arsenal are winning 4-0 now. They’re definitely better than Burnley. 68 min: This is all going wrong for Liverpool. Their passing has gone to pot and they’re looking disjointed now too. Robertson chests a ball towards Karius that is nowhere near the keeper and drifts out for a corner. Karius probably could have come out and helped the Scottish full-back out, mind. 66 min: Moses shows fleet of foot on the right as he tries to engineer an opportunity to cross but Robertson does well to hold him up and Liverpool clear. Liverpool break and Henderson finds Firmino on the right. The Brazilian swivels inside his marker and clips a cross into the box where a sum total of zero Liverpool players are waiting for the ball. 65 min: Salah has been quiet today but he has been quiet in other Liverpool games and then scored. He’s had only 22 touches in the game so far. 64 min: Salah lurks menacingly on the edge of the box and flicks the ball towards Mane but Rudiger gets a boot on the ball and sends it high into the air. It’s not pretty but Chelsea clear eventually. 62 min: Hazard plays a one-two with Bakayoko and beats Alexander-Arnold for pace down the left with a jet-heeled burst of acceleration. He can’t find a cross but the ball is worked back to Bakoyoko on the edge of the box but his shot is good old-fashioned daisy-cutter that slows down as it rolls across the dry pitch. 60 min: Henderson is on for Clyne. The full-back has looked a little rusty today. Alexander-Arnold will now play at right-back and Henderson can sit in midfield. 57 min: Hazard leads Firmino and Clyne on a merry dance down the left, leaving both looking flummoxed in his wake before walloping a shot at Karius that loops up and is cleared hurriedly at the back post by Robertson for a corner. From that, Giroud wins a header and Rudiger clatters the ball past Karius but he’s a mile offside. 55 min: Kante puts paid to another Liverpool attack, skidaddling into the path of Robertson and shepherding the ball out of play for a goal-kick after Milner had prodded the ball down the left wing. 53 min: Liverpool win a couple of free-kicks around the penalty area that are defended well by Chelsea. The home side then break forward rapidly and force Robertson to clear at Liverpool’s far post. Chelsea look better balanced now. They’re much better in the transitions than in the first half. 51 min: Hazard is enjoying himself now. He plays a rabona pass for no reason at all. I doubt he’d have done that early in the first half when Chelsea weren’t in the game. 49 min: Alexander-Arnold takes a look at goal, thinks about laying the ball off and then thinks better of that and goes for the Roy of the Rovers approach. Thwack! It’s miles over. Nothing wrong with a bit of chutzpah from a youngster, though. 47 min: Hazard wriggles away from his marker on the left wing and finds Fabregas inside him. The midfielder spins away from his marker and then momentarily loses control before taking an extra touch and freeing Moses on the right-hand side of the box. But the winger’s shot at goal is drilled a foot wide. That was nifty play. 45 min: Peep! So, can Liverpool get the point they need to secure Champions League football next season. Salah has an early whiff of goal but his hot from 10 yards is scuffed under pressure. “Would Arsenal now be in the Uefa Cup final if they hadn’t moved Giroud on?” asks William Hargreaves. Erm, I doubt it. One man alone cannot hold up a crumbling house. Arsenal are winning Wenger’s final Gunners home game 2-0 by the way, so they’ll probably finish above Burnley. Whoop! Joseph Harvey talks tactics: “As a Liverpool fan who has watched every Chelsea-Liverpool match the past couple of years, Conte has a really good plan against Liverpool. Basically, it’s let Liverpool have most of the ball, counter when you can. Towards the end of the last match, Conte threw on Fabregas and Willian and basically bossed the game. Liverpool were lucky to get out with a draw. Sure, Liverpool look dominant, but barring something special, this is probably the best way to play against Liverpool. Mind you, it doesn’t help to have Spurs fans on your side.” Maybe this is all part of a Klopp motivational masterplan. “By the way lads, you need to beat Real Madrid to do this all over again next season!” Chelsea hold out and Klopp has some thinking to do at half-time. For large parts of the first half Liverpool looked the better team but some nice wing-play from Moses and a trademark Giroud header have given the home team a lead that may keep their top-four hopes alive. Back shortly. 45 min: The half is drawing to a close with an extended spell of sterile possession from Liverpool. The blue wall in front of them appears to have very few cracks in it. 44 min: Rudiger does well to hold off Salah and wallop the ball out for a throw. They were team-mates at Roma last year. Rudiger has certainly read Salah well and has looked solid against the turbo-charged Egyptian so far this afternoon. 42 min: A reader tweets: Like with much of football I suspect the answer lies in dressing-room b@ntz. 40 min: Clyne is booked for clattering into Alonso over by the touchline. Fabregas swings the resulting free-kick towards the back post but Karius catches confidently under pressure. 38 min: Liverpool are back in possession and comfortable once more. They work the ball back up to to Salah, who dinks the ball across the D looking to make space for a shot and then tumbles under a challenge that was never really there. He’s correctly booked for a dive. 35 min: Ah, what a goal can do for confidence. Fabregas wriggles away from Robertson and fires what appeared to be a shot across Karius and out for a goal-kick. In fact, maybe it was a cross. It was a mighty tight angle. 33 min: Before that goal Chelsea did set an alarm bell ringing when Bakayoko headed wide from a Moses cross. Well, this makes the game, and maybe the last game of the season, very interesting. Well, that was against the run of play but Chelsea won’t care. Moses scoops a cross in towards the near-post and Giroud nips in front of Lovren to glance a header across goal into the far corner. He legs it away to celebrate with David Luiz on the Chelsea bench. 30 min: Mane has two half-chances again, first walloping one at goal from 25 yards that Courtois parries away and then picking up a loose ball with a wonderful turn before stabbing straight at Courtois from the penalty spot from 12 yards. 29 min: There are shadows cast on to the Stamford Bridge turf by the late-afternoon sun. However, this hasn’t happened yet. 27 min: Liverpool are pressing high up the pitch and Chelsea cannot get out of their own half with any ease. Conte is rubbing his head. It’s safe to say he’s not happy with what he’s watching. Liverpool, for all their endeavour, have not had a clear-cut chance yet though. 26 min: Milner is hobbling in midfield. They have Henderson on the bench but beyond him their midfield backup consists of some 12-year-olds, Tinhead from Brookside and one of the Crankies. 24 min: Mane rifles a low shot at goal that Courtois parries. It was reasonably central though so the keeper was expected to save it. Still, it was hit with thunderous force. From the resulting corner Courtois gets the slightest of touches on the ball to take it away from Van Dijk’s head. It was a free header into an open goal had the keeper not got something on it. Liverpool are still very much bossing this game. 21 min: Clyne crosses low after some dazzling footwork from Salah on the right but the ball is behind Mane, and the forward wallops a right-footed attempt into nearby Putney. 20 min: Shaun Wilkinson writes: “Do you think Klopp calling this ‘a semi-final’ was an attempt at some kind of Jedi mind trick? Liverpool haven’t won the league in nearly 30 years, but have won a ton of cups in that time. Does he think the way to finally win the league is to hypnotise his players into believing every league game is actually a cup game?” Maybe Derren Brown will be brought in to the coaching setup to replace Buvac. 18 min: Kante shows his value in midfield by tracking Mane half the length of the pitch before sliding in to halt a Liverpool counter-attack. Mane did dawdle on the ball somewhat after an unnecessary stepover though. 17 min: Alonso stings Karius’s palms from 20 yards with a sweetly struck shot. This is better from Chelsea. The chance came after Alexander-Arnold got caught out of position after trying to cover for Clyne. 15 min: Moses cuts the ball back on the right in Chelsea’s first proper attack. With the chance to fire at goal from the penalty spot both Bakayoko and Giroud get in each other’s way. Giroud is furious. Liverpool break but nothing comes of the counter-attack. 13 min: Chelsea just can’t get going. They’ve been sloppy in possession when they reached Liverpool’s half. You would think Chelsea had been the team who had played in an energy-sapping semi-final in midweek, not Liverpool. Giroud is caught late by Clyne. He lets out a huge shriek as the Liverpool full-back’s studs land on the top of his foot. That could have been a booking too. Giroud’s OK though. 10 min: Firmino breaks clear and tries to release Salah behind the Chelsea defence but his pass is either underhit or holds up on the turf. Another dry pitch? Klopp would love that. And then Milner clatters into Hazard and is lucky to escape a booking. He slid right through him late there. 8 min: Clyne and Alexander-Arnold trade passes on the right and the youngster whips a ball in to the back post but it’s too deep. Chelsea are playing like a team who need a point here. They need a win. They seem very happy for Liverpool to have the ball. Late smash-and-grab tactics? 6 min: Chelsea just can’t get into this game at the moment. Liverpool look extremely comfortable in possession. Taking their time as they move forwards. Chelsea are very compact though. Space isn’t easy to find when Liverpool get into the final third. 4 min: Alexander-Arnold curls the ball round the back of the Chelsea defence for Firmino to run on to. It’s a lovely ball. Firmino gets a yard on Cahill and then rifles a shot from 15 yards at Courtois, who parries and then smothers at the second attempt. This has been a strong start by Liverpool. 2 min: Liverpool enjoy a bit of early possession, knocking the ball around at the back under very little pressure and then into midfield. I’m not sure Chelsea have had a touch yet. 1 min: Peep! We’re off. Liverpool get the game under way. They are shooting from left to right on my TV. Chelsea are going the other way. There is a minute’s applause for Roy Bentley, the former Chelsea captain, who died recently at the age of 93. He played over 300 games for Chelsea. The teams are out. Chelsea in blue and Liverpool in red, as it should be. And it’s a lovely, warm spring day at Stamford Bridge. Perfect. It’s almost time for kick-off. For some reason Mike Buffer, the boxing announcer, has just been warbling a rally-cry on the sidelines. Pipe down Mike. Antonio Conte speaks: “We are trying to fight until the end to get a place in the Champions League. We won the last three games and we have only one option – to win and to keep the hope alive. But it won;t be easy because we know the situation is not in our hands. We know very well if we don;t win today this race is finished. On coping with Liverpool’s attack, Conte says: “We are talking about a team who, if they have space, they are very good. We must be very compact. With the ball, we must try to be dangerous.” On not selecting Morata he says he is injured but he should be back for the next game. Jurgen Klopp speaks about this match: “It’s a semi-final[*]. Unfortunately how it is we have a strong opponent and we have a big job to do. Chelsea are a good side. It will be hard work.” On how his team will be physically after their efforts in Rome. “I hope we are 100%. Big decisions are always made at the end of the season. If we want to perform we have to deal with that. Wednesday-Sunday (recovery) is really OK.” *It’s not a semi-final. The awful news that Alex Ferguson suffered a brain hemorrhage yesterday has shocked many this weekend. Jurgen Klopp has just been speaking about the former Manchester United manager’s huge standing in the game. “He was one of the biggest role models in this business. It was a big shock. From what I have heard – and I don’t know any more than anybody else – it looks like he is on his way to recovery but we all want to send our best wishes to Alex from LFC.” The Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, echoed Klopp’s comments wishing Ferguson a speedy recovery. And our chief football correspondent, Daniel Taylor, has written this fine piece about Ferguson. Get well soon Alex. Mohamed Salah will need four goals from Liverpool’s three remaining matches to equal Ian Rush’s record haul of 47 in the 1983-84 season. Rush reached that magnificent figure in 65 games. Salah has scored 43 in 50 so far for Liverpool. Incredible. So two strong teams then, with Liverpool fielding their usual front three and only resting one player in midfield, with Trent Alexander-Arnold moving into the middle to take the place of Jordan Henderson, and Nathaniel Clyne coming in at right-back. Chelsea: Courtois, Azpilicueta, Cahill, Rudiger, Moses, Fabregas, Kante, Bakayoko, Alonso, Hazard, Giroud. Subs: Caballero, Barkley, Pedro, Zappacosta, Willian, Christensen, Emerson. Liverpool: Karius, Clyne, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Milner, Alexander-Arnold, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Henderson, Klavan, Moreno, Mignolet, Ings, Solanke, Woodburn. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Afternoon. Let’s get straight to the point: Liverpool need one of them to secure a tour-four spot and Champions League football next season. If Chelsea win, they keep their top-four hopes alive – especially so given that Spurs lost yesterday – but to take Liverpool’s place in the top four they would need wins against Huddersfield and Newcastle as well as requiring Klopp’s side to lose or draw at home against Brighton on the final day. So their hopes are still slim but with most of the Premier League teams now playing for very little at least something is riding on this. A Liverpool draw or win would enable Klopp’s side to power down until the 26 May, when they face Real Madrid in Kiev, and recent post-European Premier League games suggest a draw is likely. They’ve drawn 0-0 against Everton, 2-2 with West Brom and 0-0 with Stoke after Champions League matches. But Chelsea are in their best form since early September, having won four games on the bounce and would like to stretch that to five here. The last time the two sides met, in November at Anfield, Mo Salah scored for Liverpool (well, who else?) before Willian equalised for Chelsea with what appeared to be a cross. Liverpool would take the same result again here. My prediction: Chelsea 2-2 Liverpool"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/may/06/manchester-city-v-huddersfield-town-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T15:22:32Z","webTitle":"Manchester City given Premier League trophy after draw with Huddersfield – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/may/06/manchester-city-v-huddersfield-town-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/may/06/manchester-city-v-huddersfield-town-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City given Premier League trophy after draw with Huddersfield –as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So that appears to be that. Manchester City are the champions of England, and have done an amazing job in destroying the field playing brilliant football. Good luck to all those trying to stop them next season. Now, join Gregg Bakowski for Chelsea-Liverpool here: Otherwise, thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of the weekend. Thierry Henry says retaining a title is hard, and notes that his Arsenal team couldn’t manage it. But it’s very hard to see anyone catching up with City over the summer - they’re the best by miles, and are still improving. Arsenal did it in 2001-02 after United effectively clinched the title on New Year’s Day, but I don’t think Guardiola is about to reconstruct his midfield nor sign Laurent Blanc. David Silva says he’s so happy - his son, born prematurely, is getting better, and City have won the league. He says he feels good and then Walker and Stones attack him with streamers. Here’s Jamie Jackson’s match report. And here’s the man himself. He says it’s special and the team fully deserve their success. He says the team are building very well and will be better next year. Mendy now has the mic and says everyone loves him - him being Toure. Jamie Redknapp is rhapsodising about how great Yaya Toure is, so here’s a piece about him and the concept of greatnes by, er, me. John Stones says he was talking to Kyle Walker saying this is why they came to City, to win trophies, and they didn’t know how it’d feel but it’s an amazing feeling. Sterling comes over and says he’s been dreaming about this since he was a kid, now it’s time to go again. An ominous thought for the rest of the league. He says winning in England is harder than winning in Spain and Germany, and he expects more from the competition next season. Teams who’ve won the league haven’t qualified for the Champions League the following year, so to retain the title in England is difficult. Guardiola then gives Souness a City shirt with 65 on the back - it’s his birthday today - Souness is really touched - and says Thierry Henry should be a manager. Guardiola says that England is special, and he had no doubts about the right thing to do. You have to do what you believe, he says, and today is the proof that City can improve. He then explains the input of Guardiola, and the drive he’s instilled in the players. He says he never doubted that he’d get back to moments such as this after every injury, and that someone told him how amazed they are by how positive he is the day after hurting himself. Champagne is being poured over Kompany’s head ... it takes a while. Hey Jude is pounding out of the PA and Pep Guardiola looks pensive as he enjoys the moment. The trophy is now going along the line, and the players are posing in various groups of mates. “Simply the best, so much better than all the rest!” says Martin Tyler. He was immediately fired for his behaviour. Then, waiting till last, Vincent Kompany. He invites Sergio Aguero to grab a handle, wiggles arm and hand, and lifts the trophy! A special cheer is reserved for Yaya Toure, who is then mobbed by the rest of the players. What a star he was and is, a big-match specialist and a stereotype-smashing symbol of skill, finesse, power and intelligence. I wonder if people still think Fabian Delph should’ve stayed at Villa and Kyle Walker should’ve stayed at Spurs. Maybe that sentence could’ve ended when the bold did. And now onto the big boys, starting with Ederson... Guardiola receives his medal from Richard Scudamore but even that doesn’t seem to tarnish the mood. Over the PA, the players are summoned to the dais, the youngest of them first. And here they come! Guardiola runs out of the tunnel, high fives the guard of honour formed by those already out, and the players follow. What a season they’ve had! I should add that everyone has City kits with “Champions 18” on the back. That is somewhat naff, in my humble opinion; according to Gregg Bakoswki, sitting next to me, it looks like they’ve won 18 titles. Maybe what’s in fact happened is they’ve all changed their name to “Champions”. You’d have to respect that. Mikel Arterta leads out the coaches with his frankly phenomenal hairline, and Brian Kidd brings up the rear. bIt’s carried by two members of the club’s One City programme; one boy who plays for amputee team and another who plays for the down syndrome team. Out come the various backroom staff in various shortnesses of short shorts. They applaud the crowd as the crowd are applauding them, which they aren’t. I can tell you that this version is so bad, I’m not even getting that weird feeling you get when you unexpectedly hear music you’re more accustomed to experiencing when you’re in a way. This band are now playing Alice Deejay. I don’t know, really I don’t. This is a bit odd - there’a bloke wearing a wispy beard with a ponytail therein and a tie-dye t-shirt, playing drums and various zany friends with other instruments. It turns out the presentation has been delayed because Fernandinho needs to take a slash for the drug testers and is wilting under pressure. In other news, John Stones is wearing glasses, I think. The stage is pretty much set up now - it’s a sort of mauve affair - and in a few minutes, Vincent Kompany will show the Premier League trophy to an array of photographers. Jorgensen says that Huddersfield had the belief they could do it, and the gameplan to press high worked really well for 30 minutes until they got tired - “It’s horrible, but when you take away a point it’s all worth it”. Then in the second half, they double-marked the wingers which worked well too and he says it’s given them the confidence that if they can take a point off City they can do the necessary against Chelsea and Arsenal. He seems an absolutely sound bloke. Anyway, stick with me for the trophy-lift, assorted pyrotechnics, and perhaps some crying children. So City need three points from their last two games to break the Premier League points record held by Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea, need two more goals to break the goal record held by Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea and need one more win to break the wins record they currently share with Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea. I think they might just manage it. A fair quantity of City fans have invaded the pitch, and Sky forget to turn Gary Neville down - he doesn’t seems best pleased that his working day will be extended. That’s an outstanding performance from Huddersfield, who were barely under threat in the second half. It’s fair to say that City weren’t at their best, but Huddersfield really were - they hung in there, played out from the back when they could, and never lost discipline or focus. Still, Huddersfield have a lot of work to do - if Southampton or Swansea get another win, they’ll need a point off Chelsea or Arsenal. Well! 90+5 min Can Mikey Dean be there hero? 90+5 min David Wagner is flailing for the final whistle, and he’s about to get it... 90+4 min Jesus finds the ball on the edge of the box, right-hand side, and slides square for Otamendi ... who tries for a curler inside the near post, but is wide and plenty. 90+2 min A brilliant, hard tackle from Kongolo, right on the edge of the box, stops Sane as he looks to go through the middle so City work the ball left, whereupon Malone calmly nots down into space so that Lossl can arrive and collect. Excellent work. 90+1 min Malone barges through Bernardo on halfway! Yeah, I know you’re thinking like yeah, whatevz, I could do that, but he pushes forward and runs out of pace and gas around the edge of the box, so dredges up a shot that Ederson beats away. 90 min There’ll be four added minutes. 90 min This game is petering out. Well done Huddersfield, who’ve disappeared the last 20 minutes with no alarms or surprises and barely any cheating. 88 min If Huddersfield get a point here, they won’t be safe or anything like it; one win for Southampton or Swansea will put them ahead on goal difference. But it’s a start, and will give them confidence they can do something against Chelsea and Arsenal. 87 min Mendy tries a shot from distance that rushes high and wide, then goes again when a corner is cleared to him, this time dribbling an effort wide. 85 min “Your logic means you can’t be a great side unless there’s another great side and you dominate them,” tweets @goutmaskreplica. “That’s harsh. Lord Ferg’s double-double winning team was a great side, but their rivals were teams like Villa, Blackburn and Keegan’s NUFC. Scarcely Arsenal 1999.” I disagree here. The 94 side was not the same as the 96 side, and neither was great because they didn’t beat anyone good. But you don’t have dominate a great side to be great, but it’s important that you compete with one; not essential, but important. 83 min Bernardo curls over a cross at which Lossl flaps but in the process does enough to get the ball away from immediate danger. City win a corner though, again it goes to the near post, and again it’s cleared - this time by Jorgensen. Waiting outside the is Bernardo, and he swivels into a low shot that swings just wide. 82 min Change for Huddersfield: Van La Parra replaces Pritchard. 82 min Yes, I am searching out database for photos of Lil Mikey Dean. 80 min After somw slow build-up, Mendy swings over an early cross, picking out Jesus. But Schindler is up alongside him, doing enough to ensure that the header loops well over the to. 78 min There’s not a lot going on here. City want to win and all, but speaking as an elite athlete, it’s hard to peak when it doesn’t matter. 77 min Lowe is down with cramp, so he milks as much time as he can before Scott Malone replaces him. 76 min Silva finds Sterling, who flaps past Lowe and is flattened. Eventually, Mike Dean appraises no advantage so stops play and hands out a disappointingly understated yellow card. 75 min It’s attack v defence now, and Huddersfield have earned the right to attempt that. But they’ve got maybe 20 minutes to avoid conceding, which sounds like a long-arse time to me. 73 min Gary Neville was sure Foden would get a run out today, but Guardiola wants to win and presumably wants to thank Bernardo Silva for his efforts, so he replaces John Stones. presume City are going three at the back. 72 min And again, Sane goes for the near post, but again Huddersfield clear ... to no one, so back comes the ball. Nonetheless, the away side are relatively comfortable. 71 min City win a corner down the left and this time take it quickly. It’s still cleared, but they earn another. then another... 70 min City are trying to raise it, but Huddersfield are getting men around the ball at all times. The thing is that they’re already clearing to no one and waiting for the next attack, which is asking for trouble. 68 min So how do City strengthen next season? I think they might improve if they signed two centre-backs, but that seems unlikely, so I guess we’re looking at a passer to play instead of Fernandinho, and a versatile attacker of some sort. But you never know if the chemistry will be better than what they have now. 67 min Another change for City: off goes De Bruyne, and on comes Gundogan. 66 min “If any other top team had two shots on target after 60 mins against Huddersfield the MBM would be awash with negatives,” reckons Bruv; City are the champions and have murdered more or less everyone, reckons, er, me. 65 min Huddersfield win a free-kick in similar position to the one from which they nearly scored, and on the edge of the box, Jorgensen tries a diving header but ends up nutting Otamendi’s boot. There’s a short pause while he receives treatment. 63 min Mendy is looking very lively down the left. Presumably he’s got his phone in his pocket so he can provide all the necessary twitter updates in real time. In the meantime, De Bruyne swings over a cross from the right, but it’s got too much on it for Sane who appears at the far post and seems to now be back on the left. 61 min Sane has the ball on the right and moves it inside ... it arrives at De Bruyne, who snaps a pass for Mendy out wide, and his cross is immediate and venomous, but again Huddersfield clear. 59 min Change for Huddersfield: Mounie, who’s done a lot of running to little tangible avail, goes off, and Depoitre comes on. 58 min Also on the touchline, Phil Foden is warming up. It’s going to be fascinating to see how he is integrated over the next couple of seasons because he looks a real talent, except City are already replete with real players. 57 min Well this is nice: City make a change, bringing Mendy on for the first time since he jiggered his knee. He replaces Delph and is just one indicator of how City will be better next season - he is a serious player. 56 min Sane nashes down the left - is he the most aesthetically pleasing Premier League player since Giggs and Ginloa? - but runs out of space. 54 min City win a corner down the left which is mixahd ... and Lossl drops it as Lowe tries to hook away! But the ball doesn’t drop to a forward and Schindler does very well to clear. 54 min Gabriel Jesus is a very good young player, but I wonder if he is or is going to be good enough to play centre-forward for a team as good as City hope to become. 53 min Huddersfield win a throw on the left and Lowe holds onto the ball for a crucial few seconds to get his breath back. It’s pretty warm out there by all accounts, and City are likely to speed up, not slow down. 51 min This is a really quiet start to the second half, which is to say that Huddersfield are doing really well. I should have noted earlier that Aaron Mooy was particularly good in the first half, using the ball with authority and intelligence. 50 min Sane appears to actually be playing on the right, with Sterling on the left. Silva, meanwhile, gathers the ball in the centre and whizzes forward before trying a through-pass which is to strong for Jesus. 48 min City are on the front foot again, Sane venturing over to the right to combine with Silva and De Bruyne. But Huddersfield are still there and hold it down to clear. 47 min I wonder if these last few weeks, teams have been shown what you have to do to beat City: defend well, obviously, but be brave in possession and commit men forward. Obviously it also needs a City off-day to work, but seems to be working better than just sitting back and hoping. 46 min Off we go again... Half-time correspondence: “Manchester City have been as dominant as any side since the early 2000s,” tweets @goutmaskreplica. “They lost to Liverpool in the league and in the CL, but it’s not their fault that Liverpool have great team who put it together for one-offs but don’t do it week-in week-out, which City do. The true test of any great side is staying together and doing it over successive seasons. If we’re sitting here in four years time discussing a fifth straight title and two big cups with maybe a third to come, that’s a great side.” If we’re sitting here discussing that, that’s the greatest side. I agree they’ve been dominant, but that’s only a partial factor of how good they are; it’s also a factor of how not good the rest are. Mourinho’s Chelsea were the last side as dominant, and likewise, they were brilliant, but the competition wasn’t. Some half-time reading: That was very good indeed from Huddersfield. The rode out the first 10 minutes when City were primed to slice them up, then hauled themselves into the game by attacking with enterprise whenever possible. The likelihood is that their task will become harder once Pep Guardiola has awarded his team a hunk of his mind, but they’ve given themselves a chance. 44 min Huddersfield are flagging, but don’t really look like conceding. 42 min That Huddersfield free-kick from which they nearly scored wasn’t not entirely like this one, but nor was it entirely unlike it either. 40 min City are back stroking the ball around now, and Huddersfield look equal parts bedraggled and befuddled. But they’re keeping the focus, and critically, when they get possession, they’re not panicking. Mooy does really well to win it just outsude the box, knocking it off, and when he moves forward to accept a return, has time to pick a pass in behind the City defence for Pritchard. But he overhits it and is annoyed; rightly so, because get it right and that was a chance. 39 min Huddersfield are ceding the middle of the pitch now and Fernandinho slides a clever pass through the gap, except City can’t make anything of it when Jesus picks up and ending up knocking the ball all the way back. 38 min Silva combines with Delph and the ball goes right to Walker, whose cross is headed away, but City again maintain the pressure and again it’s Walker crossing from the right; Jesus, though, can’t get over what it a decent delivery, heading high. 35 min Raheem Sterling scurries down the outside of Lowe, turns back inside as yerman nips out for a big of chips, and falls claiming a penalty; nothing doing. But City sustain the pressure - this is the one aspect that makes them so much better than the rest, in mine - and work a gap through which De Bruyne spanks a rising shot. I arrives at Lossl around chest-height, though, so he beats away easily enough. 33 min But if we’re talking pressure games, not big games, two of the greatest efforts were perpetrated by Arsenal: in 1997-98, they won 10 in a row to become champions, one of those wins the crucial one at Old Trafford, and then in 2001-02, they won 13 straight to win a three-horse race. For what it’s worth, for all the achievements achieved by a team that isn’t my own, that second one is to my mind the greatest and the one of which I’m most envious. 32 min “Applying your criteria,” emails Konstatin Sauer, “I’d rank the 2009-10 Chelsea side among the worthiest champions. Not only did they face a really strong opponent throughout the whole season (Man United), but also managed to win 5 out of 6 matches against the other top four teams that season (Man United, Arsenal, Tottenham). Plus, they secured the FA Cup at the end of the season” These fall down for me because they didn’t retain the title - and a post-Ronaldo Man United weren’t great. But the big-game record is excellent. 30 min Huddersfield come again, Mooy picking up a loose ball and lofting it to the right of the box where Hadergjonaj flails are a cross. It’s blocked away and Mooy collects, this time transferring left to Lowe! He’s got a proper sight of goal, but snatches a lash, lashes a snatch, over the near bit of the bar. 28 min De Bruyne appears down the left and skates past Smith before brandishing that deadly left foot to whip in a low cross. There’s too much on it, but Lossl decides he can’t just allow it to whizz across his goal, diving to defelect away with his knee. 27 min By their exulted standards, City are a bit shvach. 25 min Sane is through the middle for the moment, and Otamendi slides a clever pass to between right-back and centre-back for Jesus, with whom he swapped. But the low cross is behind Sterling, waiting in the middle, and the chance goes. 24 min I was mumbling about awards earlier, so I’ll say here that I’d have gone for De Bruyne and not Salah as player of the year. De Bruyne set the tone for the season, and is the main on-pitch reason that the champions are the champions. 22 min City are becalmed. Well done David Wagner. 20 min And here they come again! Hadergjonaj, who’s got something, advances at inside right and squares for Pritchard, carrying on his run seeking a return. But Pritchard sees Otamendi follow so has a touch and a look before wiping his foot across a shot which hisses and dips, forcing Ederson into a flying stop. The resultant corner comes to nowt. 19 min For a bit it looked like Huddersfield were ripe for a going-over, but they’ve done pretty well these last few minutes. The teams that have taken points off City this season haven’t done it by simply sitting on the edge of their box, and Huddersfield are looking to get about it whenever they can. 16 min “Re: your criteria for objectively measuring greatness,” emails David Wall, “should you really try to completely take emotion out of the equation? Isn’t there something about a really great team that does just that, stirs the emotions, even for neutrals. As yet City haven’t done so well on thus measure. Against Stoke at home some of the passes played by De Bruyne to set up goals were breathtaking, so there is potential there. But there’s been nothing yet to compare with, say Ryan Giggs’ Cup semi-final goal. Perhaps that will come when their rivals get consistent closer to them. Though in light of your scores for them on measure three, perhaps not.” I don’t know about that - if it becomes about emotion, then it’s entirely subjective, and I’m certain there’ll be people who are certain they’ve never seen better football. And fair enough, who is anyone to argue with that? I totally agree that football is about more than matters of fact, but greatest probably needs a more factual measure. Maybe it just isn’t very important. 14 min Back come City, Silva and Sane combining beautifully down the left, the former finding the latter who cuts back for De Bruyne, zoning into De Bruyne territory. He looks for all the world as though he’s about to score, but instead curves his low finish wide of the near post. 12 min Interesting! Huddersfield press Ederson, refusing to allow him to simply pick a pass, and win a free-kick 35 yards out as a consequence. It’s right of centre and with City expecting a cross, Pritchard slides a straight pass on the blind side, between Sane and Silva. And Hadergjonaj is running onto it, but opts to place his finish when he should’ve blasted it! Oh dear! What a chance that was, and what a clever move. 11 min Huddersfield haven’t come to sit about, and Mooy finds himself in possession 20 yards from goal. He lashes hard and low, but just wide. 8 min “Surely ‘at clutch’ they beat United in December... and then Spurs the following week?” “asks” Miguel Delaney. “Feels like you’re punishing them for making it so easy themselves. Your theory rewards teams who are... worse then them. Surely by the same type of contortions, someone could point out that United’s main challengers between 1997 and 2005 never got past a CL QF so weren’t actually that good.” Perhaps I phrased that badly - maybe I should’ve said in the games they were under most pressure to win. The best of the challengers 1997-2005 didn’t do it in Europe, it’s true, but they did win in their biggest games - Arsenal in 97-98 and 01-02, for example. another comparison is with United’s 93-94 team, who were very good but beat no one any good and failed in Europe. If we’re trying to be objective, that’s an insurmountable problem. 6 min I guess this could be a rare game in which one team panels the other and can’t score, except City aren’t really like that. De Bruyne injects some pace moving through at inside-left and finds Jesus, who immediately turns off to Silva. He bumdles through Schindler and he’s in! But his shot is too close to Lossl, who beats away. 5 min City continue moving the ball with purpose and pace. It’s a while since Huddersfield had a meaningful touch. 3 min I’d rather watch Sane play, but I’d have given YPOTY to Sterling, who has scored some absolutely crucial goals - brilliant late winners against Bournemouth and Southampton spring to mind - and also shoved it up the various newspapers whov’e harangued him for the lowest and worst possible reasons. 1 min City begin weaving patterns, and it seems like Huddersfield are pressing them high up the pitch. Good luck with that, lads. Sterling gets the ball down the right and slides it across to Silva, who delivers a frankly wondrous return pass into the box and between three men to meet his cut inside. It’s not quite right, but the vision and anticipation was brilliant. 1 min Away we go! Guardiola and Wagner hug. Touching. Huddersfield have formed a guard of honour the closest they’ll get all afternoon etc etc and out come City - with their kids before the game. Just another thing for which we can blame Dennis Wise. Various City luminaries are on the pitch: Summerbee, Lee and the rest The fans are waving blue and white flags, my fingers are barely responding to instruction, and here come the teams! “For those of us unaware of your allegiance,” tweets Brendan Large, “could you please enlighten us? MBMs are always better when you know the person writing them is doing so with gritted teeth and feeling pain with each keystroke. People are nice like that.” I support United. I’ve had better days on the job, but of course appreciate the pleasure anyone else might take in my disgust; I appreciate it myself in some kind of peculiar way. I’m sure the Germans have a word for that, if anyone knows what it is. We’re all adults, so let’s try this: where do City rank alongside other Premier League winners? My criteria for judging greatness, which attempt to remove emotion and insert objectivity are as follows: 1. What did you win? 2. Who did you beat? 3. What did you do at clutch? As far as I can see, by these standards, City have work to do - and I’m pretty sure Pep Guardiola would agree with that. 1. One title, won brilliantly but still one. 2. We seem to have reached rare consensus that the second-placed team are rubbish, so. 3. The two biggest individual games - away to Liverpool in Europe and home to Manchester United – were lost, and in disconcerting style. The thing is, City will be better next season and the season after that, and it’s hard to see anyone else improving enough to stop them so this isn’t the end of the conversation. David Wagner says it doesn’t matter what other teams do, so Huddersfield’s task hasn’t changed after yesterday’s results. When you play City, you can either sit in a low block or look to get amongst them, and in football crazy stuff can happen; “maybe City will not be on their best today ... we know this chance is small ... not a big one, a small one, and we are searching for it.” Pep Guardiola says it’ll be good for the future if his team can break the points and goals records they’re after - “friendly games are boring”. He says David Wagner’s teams are always committed with and without the ball and he expects Huddersfield to defend deep and look for breaks and set-pieces. Finally, he sends a “big hug” to Alex Ferguson with whom he had dinner a couple of weeks ago, and notes that Brian Kidd was very upset. Let’s be real. Those of you who know my allegiance might well be sniggering at this assignment. These lads appear to have my number... So City make two changes to the team which worked over West Ham – Stones and Silva come in, with Laporte and Gundogan dropping out. Pretty much, this is their first XI - perhaps Laporte is ahead of Stones, who’s being rewarded for his season’s work, but that aside, and the difference is moot. Huddersfield make two changes: Smith and Lowe are in for Quaner and Van La Parra. Manchester City (a geometric 4-3-3): Ederson; Walker, Stones, Otamendi, Delph; Fernandinho, De Bruyne, David Silva; Sterling, Jésus, Sané. Subs: Bravo, Gundogan, Laporte, Bernardo Silva, Mendy, Toure, Foden. Huddersfield Town (an agricultural 5-4-1): Lossl, Smith, Jorgensen, Schindler, Kongolo, Lowe; Hadergjonaj, Hogg, Mooy, Pritchard; Mounié. Subs: Coleman, Malone, Billing, van La Parra, Depoitre, Quaner, Gorenc Stankovic. We’ve all been there: you very politely ask a bigger kid for something they don’t need for which you’re desperate ... only for them to crunch up the crisps, snap the snout, or spit in the 20/20. Welcome to your life! This is the situation in which Huddersfield Town find themselves: they’ve been a pleasant addition to the Premier League and thought they’d be staying in it, but life being as life is, are now in serious danger of forsaking it. If Southampton beat Swansea in midweek and Swansea then beat Stoke next weekend, they will need three more points to stay up; the games in which they have to find them are against the champions, today, away to Chelsea, on Wednesday, and at Arsène Wenger’s farewell party, next Sunday. Oh. Sometimes, teams who’ve won titles ease up. In 1997-98, Arsenal lost twice following a 10-game winning run; in 2000-01, Manchester United donated wins to Derby and Southampton. But Manchester City will not do this. Since their triumph was confirmed, they showed their compassion for those fighting relegation by tumping Swansea and West Ham them to the tune of 5-0 and 4-1, and will want to mark the final home game of a spectacular league season, after which Vincent Kompany will be presented with the Premier League trophy, in the correct manner. This might get messy.

Labor has warned that changes eroding the revenue base will mean weaker surpluses in the medium term, as it prepares to match “targeted tax relief” and promise larger surpluses by raising revenue in other areas. On Sunday the treasurer told Channel Nine’s Today Show that the Turnbull government had flagged for months that its priority is “delivering tax relief for low to middle-income earners”. “They have been doing it tough, it’s been some time since they have had a decent pay rise,” he said. Morrison said that low and middle-income earners “should be the first to whom we seek to provide tax relief”, leaving open the possibility that higher income earners will benefit from the income tax cut plan later on. The federal budget is expected to show a dramatic improvement in revenues, with Deloitte Access Economics estimating that the company tax take has risen by $36.2bn since this time last year and income tax is $10.6bn higher. Improved revenues have allowed the Coalition to ditch the planned $8bn Medicare levy increase and promise income tax cuts, but it is still unclear whether it will also bring forward the plan to return to surplus by 2020-21. Asked why the government didn’t use increased revenue to pay down debt of $600bn, Morrison said “because you’ve got to run a strong economy” and pay for essential services. But he said the government had set down “responsible, methodical path back to budget balance, which is what we have been doing, for five successive statements and it will be six on Tuesday night”. Asked about concerns that the budget could only afford a “milkshake and sandwich” tax cut, Morrison replied: “I’m not going to pretend these would be mammoth tax cuts, they will be what is affordable.” Morrison said that criticism was made of Howard-era income tax cuts at a time when they were cut more regularly, but “it’s been a long time since there has been real relief in this area”. The treasurer said if the scale of income tax cuts were criticised it would be “very hard to say that the government is irresponsible at the same time”. Asked why the Coalition planned changes that would permanently cut revenue, such as income tax cuts, Morrison said the government would “build the budget up to surplus” but must not do so by “taxing the economy, because that is like the snake eating itself from the tail ... It is a self-defeating exercise. It never ends well.” Despite the Coalition delivering budget deficits since 2014, Morrison said it had reduced debt growth by two-thirds and delivered the “lowest rate of expenditure growth of any government in the last 50 years”. The treasurer said increased spending had to be balanced by savings to pay for them and the government had set a “firm tax speed limit” of taxes not exceeding 23.9% of GDP. “If you go above that tax speed limit you are putting jobs and the economy and essential services at risk.” The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, told the ABC’s Insiders program the tax cap meant that future generations would be forced to pay down debt. Morrison again refused to commit to the target of surpluses equal to 1% of GDP over the medium term. He noted the current fiscal rule is to “return to that level as soon as possible” but did not rule out shifting the goal posts, saying only that the “fiscal rules haven’t changed”. Bowen said on the government’s own figures they would not deliver a surplus of more than 0.5%. That would leave Australia vulnerable like a “cork bobbing around on the ocean of international economic uncertainty”, he said. Bowen said the budget needed “strong, healthy, sustainable” surpluses not “razor-thin” ones that could be wiped out by revised forecasts or global downturns. Labor has plans to raise revenue by reducing tax concessions, decreasing the capital gains tax discount, abolishing negative gearing and ending cash refunds for excess imputation credits. “Because we’ve engaged in that difficult reform process which the government has ... refused to do, we can actually have budget repair and return to surplus and engage in tax reform, which benefits low and middle-income earners as well,” Bowen said. He said that Labor recognised Newstart was too low but committed only to review it. The opposition is under internal pressure to commit at its national conference to increase Newstart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/06/can-coalition-mp-bechamel-foreclaws-really-live-on-40-a-day","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T00:01:47Z","webTitle":"Can Coalition MP Bechamel Foreclaws really live on $40 a day? | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/can-coalition-mp-bechamel-foreclaws-really-live-on-40-a-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/can-coalition-mp-bechamel-foreclaws-really-live-on-40-a-day","fields":{"headline":"Can Coalition MP Bechamel Foreclaws really live on $40 a day?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/may/06/metoo-revelations-and-loud-angry-men-the-feminism-flashpoint-of-sydney-writers-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T03:02:05Z","webTitle":"#MeToo revelations and loud, angry men: the feminism flashpoint of Sydney writers’ festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/06/metoo-revelations-and-loud-angry-men-the-feminism-flashpoint-of-sydney-writers-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/06/metoo-revelations-and-loud-angry-men-the-feminism-flashpoint-of-sydney-writers-festival","fields":{"headline":"#MeToo revelations and loud, angry men: the feminism flashpoint of Sydney writers’ festival","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hours before the cornerstone Sydney writers’ festival panel about the #MeToo movement on Saturday night, the Pulitzer-prize winning author Junot Diaz – with events still booked in Sydney and in Melbourne – was on a plane out of Australia. The day before, another festival guest, writer Zinzi Clemmons, had spoken from the audience during the Q&amp;A of one of Diaz’s panels, questioning the timing of his recent New Yorker essay and asking the writer to reckon with his own alleged history of harm. She then shared her story on Twitter, claiming he had “cornered and forcibly kissed her” when she was 26. Clemmons was joined on Twitter by other women – including another festival speaker Carmon Maria Machado – who made their own accusations of his alleged misconduct. Diaz withdrew from his remaining appearances, and told the New York Times (without referring to the allegations specifically): “I take responsibility for my past.” As the story unfolded on Twitter, the green room’s “no journalists” policy was enforced with more vigour. Understandable. For anyone who thought the #MeToo movement had lost momentum, the last few days proved otherwise. “Let’s recap,” moderator and former Crikey editor Sophie Black told the audience, before a panel that would be interjected by a protester, a whistle-blower, and one of Australia’s best known feminists. “We’ve got a lot to talk about.” On Friday, for instance, the Nobel prize for literature was cancelled amid a sexual assault scandal. The day before that, a Washington Post investigation told of 27 more women who had allegations of sexual harassment against talk show host Charlie Rose. One of the journalists behind that investigation, Irin Carmon, was on the panel, along with Now Australia’s spearhead and spokesperson Tracey Spicer and the New York Times’ Jenna Wortham. Carmon had been working on the Rose story since 2010, but it was only when the #MeToo movement gathered steam that she was able to get it off the ground. “[In 2010] the women weren’t ready to speak out, and I had to move on,” she explained. “But when people started to tell their own stories on their own terms, I thought, ‘Maybe it’s time to go back to the story, maybe they are now feeling it’s safe enough’.” The movement has made it easier, she said, “but it’s still not easy.” Carmon talked about the burden of proof needed to publish a story alleging sexual crimes, and the emotional exhaustion it took for a victim to speak out. The Rose story, she said, had taken over her life. “This is not just happening willy-nilly; people are not just doing it for fun. Having been up close in the machine and the aftermath, it is not fun. It is not glamorous just because a few people went to the Oscars.” Later, she said: “I wish people knew that what reporters publish is just the tip of the iceberg of what we know, because it has to meet such a high standard”. One of Harvey Weinstein’s accusers, for instance, had a recording of her harassment and “still wasn’t believed ... So many people don’t have that kind of evidence.” Spicer agreed. Since her public call-out for #MeToo stories on Twitter in October, she said 1600 people had contacted her with allegations about 100 different Australian men. “I’ve got beyond a dozen accusations against many of the alleged offenders [who we haven’t yet exposed],” she said. “And even with that, you have to almost act like you’re part of the police force. Is there any clothing with DNA on it? Are there any diaries? Did you tell anyone at the time, a family member or a friend? It’s incredibly difficult in this country. “So whenever you read these stories or see them on television, you know that they have been robustly researched.” Australia’s restrictive defamation laws work against the whistle-blowers, as do varied pressures inside newsrooms, which have been hampering investigations at home. Spicer has spent the past six months connecting the strongest of the stories with news outlets around the country – but her efforts, she revealed, haven’t always been welcome. “This is a conversation that’s not going to be very popular in this room, but it’s something I’ve been wanting to say publicly for a long time. When we started doing these stories in this country ... we had the support of Fairfax and the ABC, and they were tremendous,” she said. “But recently, in the last two months, I’ve seen mainstream – what we would call ‘old media’ – organisations starting to pull away from some of these stories ... Not only is it costly, not only is it difficult because of defamation, but ‘it’s getting a little bit too close to our executives’. And that is a true story.” For that reason, she has been taking stories to a broader array of outlets, including Guardian Australia, the Financial Review and News Corp. “If you want to keep reading and hearing about these stories, contact the media outlets in Australia and tell them,” she said. At least one of the people who had told their story to Spicer was in the room; she found her way to a microphone during the audience Q&amp;A. “I came to Tracey with my story last year and she followed up with me. She said, ‘You’re not the only victim of this man but we just can’t get the story up’ ... “You shouldn’t have to be sitting on a stage, putting out a call, asking audience members to give you the resources to bring these man to justice,” she continued. “I have seen you done so much more than what your job description has asked you, and honestly, the responsibility lies with the media organisations.” Following the Diaz allegations, the panel also discussed so-called “trial by Twitter”: women making allegations against men on social media or blogs, sidestepping journalism and the justice system. “I don’t agree with people naming people on social media,” Spicer said, “but I understand why people are [doing it]. They feel a frustration with the gatekeepers.” It was even more difficult for women who didn’t fit the mould of the victims whose stories have so far been prioritised: white, privileged, straight and famous women. “I don’t think we’re dealing or talking about it at all the way we should be, in terms of non-white, hetero normative, straight [victims],” said Wortham, who co-hosts the Still Processing podcast on race and pop culture. Wortham also spoke about the toxicity of “open secrets”, referencing the “shitty media men” list which privately circulated New York late last year before it was exposed. The shared document named men whose allegedly inappropriate and harmful behaviour had, in some cases, been known by many. “I had gone to drinks with those people, I had been alone with them,” Wortham said. “I was a young 25-year-old who didn’t know any better, and I’d been in situations that could have potentially been very difficult. And because they were open secrets, the onus was on me to know that that was a dangerous situation.” But she hadn’t been tapped into the whisper network. “Either I wasn’t successful enough or I wasn’t interacting with the people who were privileged enough to have that information and pass it along to me. I wasn’t in the right place on the hierarchy of knowledge ... “We’ve developed these coping mechanisms to deal with these societal problems that are really insufficient, and put the [onus] on us.” The panel’s penultimate moment was a welcome surprise: notable Australian feminist and writer Eva Cox stood at a microphone with a question for the panellists. “It’s not ‘How do we stop that man from doing that to us?’, but ‘How do we stop men feeling like they’re entitled to?’,” she said. “We have to start looking at what we are doing to little boys to make them feel entitled. We need to sit down and start addressing the social problem, because we are still the second sex. And unfortunately, a lot of what we’re doing to fight this ... is using a male-driven system to try to screw a male-driven system. It doesn’t work.” As the applause died down in the audience, a lone voice could be heard from the front: a man who had been barred from the microphone during the Q&amp;A was standing in front of the stage and screaming aggressively at the strong, accomplished women who sat in front of him. “HOW MANY INNOCENT MEN WILL GET TAKEN DOWN?” he yelled, as he was escorted out. “GEOFFREY RUSH IS AN AUSTRALIAN ICON!” The four panellists had spent the last 60 minutes illustrating why this movement wasn’t going away. It took just one man, in one second, to succinctly prove their point. An earlier version of this article implied journalists were removed from the green room following the Junot Diaz allegations. According to the festival, the green room was intended as a journalist-free space"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/05/trump-israel-private-security-iran-nuclear-deal-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T20:01:00Z","webTitle":"Trump’s dirty ops attack on Obama legacy shows pure hatred for Iran deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/05/trump-israel-private-security-iran-nuclear-deal-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/05/trump-israel-private-security-iran-nuclear-deal-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s dirty ops attack on Obama legacy shows pure hatred for Iran deal","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The use of an Israeli private security firm to dig for dirt on senior members of the Obama administration linked to the Iran nuclear deal, as revealed in today’s Observer, shows how far President Donald Trump and the hawks around him are willing to go to destroy the agreement. The 2015 deal is the last major element of Barack Obama’s foreign policy legacy left standing, after nearly 16 months of the Trump era. The drive to unravel the agreement is both deeply personal – driven by Trump’s animus towards his predecessor – and global in its implications for international peace and security. The bid to discredit the deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – with compromising information on two of its fiercest advocates from the Obama administration came to nothing. Instead, Trump’s campaign against it has relied on the simple repetition of derogatory phrases about it being the “worst deal ever” and “a major embarrassment”. It has remained a fixed point in Trump’s universe. The struggle over JCPOA’s fate comes to a head at the end of this week, when Trump must choose whether to keep a set of sanctions suspended, or violate the deal by reviving them. Trump has reminded the world repeatedly that only he knows what he is going to do when the sanctions waivers fall due on Saturday, while hinting heavily that he will refuse to sign them. If that happens, JCPOA could collapse quickly, or more likely stumble on wounded and weakened a while longer before crashing. Either way, the prospect of a new conflict in the Middle East will draw closer. In view of these high stakes, European capitals are desperately seeking a compromise to satisfy Trump and salvage JCPOA by addressing the president’s complaints about the deal: that it does not address ballistic missile development or Iran’s role in conflicts across the region, and that some of the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities expire in the coming years. White House visits by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor Angela Merkel failed to achieve a breakthrough, but UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson is due in Washington today to try his luck. Meanwhile, diplomats in London, Paris, Berlin and Washington (all parties to JCPOA) continue to exchange ideas on possible compromises. There is agreed text on tougher action towards Iran’s missiles and containing its regional expansion, but not so far on JCPOA’s “sunset clauses”. In any case there is no guarantee that the US officials involved in these exchanges have any sway with Trump himself. He promised to kill the deal and seems bent on delivering. And his resolve has scrambled global alignments. The Europeans find themselves in agreement with Russia, China and Iran, as well as much of the rest of the international community. The US, meanwhile, finds common cause with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As the struggle has sharpened in the run-up to Trump’s day of judgment, the gambits on both sides have grown bolder. By flying, one by one, to Trump’s court in a bid to appease him, the Europeans risk exposing their impotence. For his part, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, showed a sure feel for his audience of one on Monday with an extraordinary stunt, displaying an Israeli intelligence trove on Iran – which in normal times would be quietly shared with allied agencies – in the style of a Las Vegas show. With a showman’s flourish, Netanyahu ripped black sheets off bookcases of files and panels emblazoned with CD-roms, while screens displayed the message “Iran lied” in 3ft-high letters. The substance underlying the show did appear to be a remarkable intelligence coup – Iran’s nuclear weapons archive reportedly swiped from a Tehran warehouse in the middle of the night in January – but has so far only confirmed what was already known to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): that Iran began a concerted weapons design project in 2002, but shelved it a year later, then continued some theoretical feasibility studies until 2009. It is not clear whether Netanyahu’s performance was intended to sway Trump, a counter-balance to Macron and Merkel, or to do the US president a favour by providing political cover for a decision he has already taken. Trump has set 12 May as a grand season finale, with himself at centre stage. However, even if he reimposes sanctions by refusing to sign a waiver it will not necessarily spell the end for JCPOA. The sanctions legislation in play is targeted at foreign countries and companies dealing with Iran’s central bank but contains exemptions for states that significantly reduce their purchases of Iranian oil. As preparations have been made, the US would have to give other countries some months to comply before targeting them, which could offer breathing space for more diplomacy. Another raft of sanctions waivers come up for renewal in mid-July, however, affecting shipping and a broad range of trade and investment. It would then be up to Europe and Iran to decide how to respond. Europe could comply or try to fight US sanctions, but big European companies, reliant on raising finance on the New York money markets, are likely to take fright and avoid dealings with Iran. Anger is already mounting in Iran over the absence of the promised economic benefits from the deal, and the disappearance of European companies can only make that worse. Hardliners who opposed any external constraints on the country’s nuclear ambitions are waiting in the wings. “The US looks like the non-compliant party now, so it doesn’t make much sense to shift the focus back to Iran,” said Ariane Tabatabai, an Iran expert at Georgetown University in Washington DC. “But there will be more and more pressure to loosely implement the deal as time goes by.” One of the first likely flashpoints is likely to be the IAEA inspections. The Israeli trove of documents is likely to prompt demands for visits to newly identified sites at a time when Iranian incentives to comply are at a minimum. In that scenario, European states might go along with US sanctions, but the rest of the world, including the big Asian markets for Iranian oil, would make their own decisions. “The Trump administration will find it harder than it expects to get countries to reduce their oil purchases,” said Peter Harrell, a former senior state department official who helped craft some of the Iran sanctions. For the Iran nuclear deal, Harrell added: “It is going to be a slow and messy end.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/05/local-elections-brexit-little-comfort-right-or-left","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:25:06Z","webTitle":"Local elections haunted by Brexit offer little comfort to right or left","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/05/local-elections-brexit-little-comfort-right-or-left","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/05/local-elections-brexit-little-comfort-right-or-left","fields":{"headline":"Local elections haunted by Brexit offer little comfort to right or left","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Entering the West Midlands market town of Nuneaton, there are signs saying “Nuneaton and Bedworth – United to Achieve”. But in the town centre the upbeat slogan does not rest easy with the prevailing mood. The traditional industries that once drove the local economy – coal and textiles – have all but disappeared. It is now a dormitory town for nearby Birmingham and Coventry and people complain that its centre is dead, that its shops are struggling. Paul Bull, the local butcher, is one of those anxious about his and his town’s future. “I’ve seen trade get less and less, year on year,” he says. “There are fewer stalls on market days and they usually pack up early – even the nice weather doesn’t get people out.” At every election, local or national, the attention of politicians and political pundits turns to Nuneaton, a key marginal, a bellwether seat in the heart of England that oscillates between Labour and the Tories. It is a place to gauge the national mood and the political temperature in middle Britain. It expressed its discontent at the 2016 referendum by voting by 66/34 for Brexit. Last week, after eight years of Conservative government at Westminster, and against the backdrop of crises over immigration and the NHS, and deadlock on Brexit, Labour had hoped to benefit from Theresa May’s troubles and consolidate its position on the local council. Yet Labour went backwards. Its tally of seats fell from 25 to 17 while the Conservatives’ went up from seven to 16, depriving Jeremy Corbyn’s party of control. Peter Kang, 48, a financial planning and analysis manager in the town, has voted Ukip in recent elections. But he now looks to the Tories to deliver on Brexit. “There’s no point voting Ukip because they’re just a spent force. It’s about making sure the Tories do what they’re supposed to do over Brexit: voting Labour doesn’t do that.” Yet that Ukip dividend for the Conservatives – on a night when the party Nigel Farage once led lost 123 seats and held just three – could become a curse as well as a blessing, at least for those Tories who fear the consequences of an all-singing all-dancing hard Brexit. As the smoke cleared after an election night with no clear victor, one theme of capital importance was being identified by polling expert Professor John Curtice. The mass defection of the Ukip vote to the Tories in Leave areas could store up huge problems for Theresa May, placing the prime minister under even more pressure to deliver the kind of clean Brexit that her new backers, the ex-Ukippers, crave. “The vote that is helping to buoy up Theresa May’s popularity is very much a Leave vote,” Curtice told the BBC. “If the Conservatives are going to hang on to that vote, they are going to have to deliver a Brexit that, broadly speaking, appeals to the sympathies and instinct of Leave voters.” After a week in which pro-Brexit ministers had already quashed plans for a customs partnership with the EU that the prime minister hoped would help unlock the Irish border question, Curtice’s assessment was further music to their ears. Boris Johnson quickly took up the theme on Twitter – that Tories had to reject a customs union or partnership and buy fully into a hard, clean Brexit because that was what voters said they wanted. “Jeremy Corbyn has been abandoned in many Leave areas – his pledge to stay in the customs union means he is not trusted to deliver Brexit. PM’s clear Mansion House vision for leaving the single market and customs union a key part of Tory electoral success,” the foreign secretary tweeted. But there is a problem that will not go away. Last week the Irish government made clear again that it will veto any Brexit deal that fails to deliver a frictionless border between north and south. Neither in Brussels nor in Dublin, nor in soft-Brexit circles in Westminster, can anyone see how that frictionless border can be achieved without some form of customs union – one that ever more people who vote Tory say would amount to a Brexit betrayal. While Tory successes such as Nuneaton may create their own problems, Labour is contemplating a set of results which convey some disturbing messages, and deepen its own angst over what to say and do about Brexit. Labour scored some notable successes, robbing the Tories of control of Trafford in Manchester and taking Plymouth. It performed better in London than at any time since 1971. But there were similar stories to that of Nuneaton in too many other areas of provincial England where it had hoped to do well. Some Labour MPs and council candidates in the party’s ranks said the results were nowhere near good enough for an opposition fighting a governing party that had been in office for so long, and that never seems able to wrestle free of crises. On Saturday Labour’s Angela Smith, a member of the influential parliamentary committee representing backbenchers, said it was time for the party to “take a long hard look at ourselves as many voters don’t like what they see”. Former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: “After eight years of Tory misrule, most people thoroughly tired of austerity, a disastrous Brexit negotiation, the Windrush outrage and four cabinet resignations in six months, we should be well ahead and we are not. If we don’t ask why, then we risk losing a fourth time at the next general election.” Labour lost three councillors in Derby, ceding overall control, as well as losing their leader, Ranjit Banwait. In Basildon the Conservatives took control of the council as they picked up half of 10 seats lost by Ukip. In Redditch, another Leave-voting area, Labour struggled, losing three seats while the Conservatives picked up four to take control of the council. Just as damaging to morale was Labour’s failure to take, or make the hoped-for headway in, any of the traditional Conservative strongholds in London – Wandsworth, Westminster, and Barnet (where the row over antisemitism in the party had a devastating effect). The relief among Tories, even though they lost 33 seats, was palpable. The national picture showed them neck and neck with Labour, but they had outperformed expectations that had been pegged very low. The Liberal Democrats had cause for celebration too, retaking Richmond and Kingston upon Thames councils. Theresa May looked happier than for months as she congratulated Tories in Wandsworth and taunted Labour. “Labour thought they could take control. This was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed,” she said on Friday. Corbyn will address the parliamentary party a week tomorrow and will face calls for changes of direction on many fronts. Labour MPs say the crisis over antisemitism needs addressing urgently and is damaging the party more by the week. Gillian Lazarus, a former Labour supporter in the borough, told the Observer: “I’ve always voted Labour and have been a member off and on. I come from a Labour family and am the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants. I could not vote for Labour in the council elections, because I have witnessed the rampant and unremitting antisemitism coming from the Labour environment.” But for both parties, Thursday’s elections above all revealed just how much of British politics is being refracted through the prism of Brexit. Peter Kang in Nuneaton is not alone, and the Tories must work out how to appease their increasingly hardline support (70% of Tory voters are now Leave supporters compared with 30% of Labour ones, according to polling analyst Rob Ford). For its part, Labour desperately requires a strategy that stiffens its Remain resolve without alienating voters in the passionately pro-Leave towns of provincial England. Calls are growing from Labour’s Remain majority for it to be bolder in backing a soft Brexit and membership of the single market. That, they say, would open up clear water between the two largest parties. “Why did we fail to do better in London and why did the Lib Dems get back in the game in areas we need to be progressing in?” asked one Labour frontbencher on Friday. “Because people think we have no policy on Brexit that is different from the Tories. Remainers don’t think we are with them. We are a pro-EU party without a pro-EU policy.” Key parliamentary votes are approaching. A group of Labour peers is protesting this weekend that Corbyn is not backing their efforts in the Lords to promote amendments to Brexit legislation that would allow the UK to effectively stay in the single market. Corbyn fears any move that would appear anti-Brexit would hit Labour support hard in the many Leave areas where it routinely returns MPs – a view backed by many of those MPs themselves. While the likes of Umunna push for soft Brexit, or no Brexit, other senior figures in the party argue the reverse. As a crunch period approaches, in which Britain’s future trade agreements with the EU must be agreed one way or the other, the time for judicious equivocation is almost over. Last Thursday’s poll suggests that, for both of the main parties, there is no easy option available. But an option must be chosen. Election voices Kate Hoey, Labour MP for Vauxhall and leading pro-Brexit campaigner “These results suggest many ex-Labour Ukip voters don’t yet trust us to genuinely honour the referendum result. While this is the case we simply cannot win the seats we need to form a government. Those who voted Leave in Labour areas want us to stick to our manifesto promises and not be pushed into a Brexit that is in name only.” Chuka Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham and leading anti-Brexit campaigner “Neither major party can treat these results as any kind of endorsement. On Brexit, clearly the country is not coming together behind the prime minister’s hard-Brexit plan or, frankly, the alternative Labour is offering. People deserve leadership on Brexit, the biggest issue of our time – which will fundamentally impact on our ability to end Tory austerity, reduce inequality and poverty, and spread opportunity – and we have yet to see it.” Bernard Jenkin, Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex “Be wary of drawing conclusions from these results about Brexit. Either Conservatives deliver what the people voted for, or we risk looking indecisive and paralysed, which would never be rewarded at the ballot box. Most people who voted remain want us to get on with Brexit. Governments are rarely rewarded for a reform programme which drags on without conclusion.” Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats “We enjoyed a number of gains in areas that voted heavily to leave the EU, including Sunderland and Hull, as well as Remain-leaning areas that commentators would have expected us to do well in. This shows that people respect parties if they have the courage of their convictions, even if they disagree with them. It also reflects that while there can be these disagreements, it is still the case that people correctly place high value on the ability of a party to effectively run a council.” Anna Soubry, Tory MP for Broxtowe and anti-hard-Brexit campaigner “Bins not Brexit won it for the Conservatives in this week’s local elections. That view may not be shared by Tory councillors who lost their seat in places like South Cambridgeshire, Richmond and Wandsworth, but by and large it was hard graft on local issues by moderate, competent Conservatives that saw off Labour and in places even won us seats. The real story is Labour’s failure to make the sort of progress we feared they would, and which they should have made.” Suzanne Evans, former vice-chair of Ukip “The collapse of the Ukip vote worked mostly in the Conservatives’ favour in this election, as the bulk of the Leave vote went to them. This sends a clear message to Theresa May. She must deliver a clean Brexit, one in which we are fully independent from the EU – no fudges or compromises – or Ukip will rise again, strongly, and swiftly, and the Tories will face a massive loss of electoral support at the next general election.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/05/sir-alex-ferguson-emergency-surgery-brain-haemorrhage","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:34:13Z","webTitle":"Sir Alex Ferguson in serious condition after surgery for brain haemorrhage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/05/sir-alex-ferguson-emergency-surgery-brain-haemorrhage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/05/sir-alex-ferguson-emergency-surgery-brain-haemorrhage","fields":{"headline":"Sir Alex Ferguson in serious condition after surgery for brain haemorrhage","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sir Alex Ferguson is in a serious condition in hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage on Saturday. The former Manchester United manager underwent emergency surgery for a bleed on the brain. This was said to have been successful and his family were at his bedside as he began his recovery. United, the club he managed for almost 27 years until retiring in 2013, issued a statement that read: “Sir Alex Ferguson has undergone emergency surgery today for a brain haemorrhage. The procedure has gone very well but he needs a period of intensive care to optimise his recovery. His family request privacy in this matter.” The 76-year-old was first taken by ambulance from his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, to Macclesfield district hospital at 9am. He was subsequently transferred, with a police escort, to Salford Royal hospital, where he was being treated last night in the Hope building. Speculation grew that Ferguson was unwell when his son Darren, the Doncaster Rovers manager, missed his side’s final game of the League One season against Wigan. A club statement read: “Rovers manager Darren Ferguson will not be at Saturday’s game due to family reasons.” The assistant manager, Gavin Strachan, took charge of the game and Doncaster were beaten 1-0 as Wigan were confirmed League One champions. Afterwards the club said: “Darren asks for privacy and will provide an update through the club during the week.” Ferguson is famously private and has been married to Cathy since 1966. Together they have three sons: Mark, Darren and Jason, who runs an events management company and used to be a football agent. Ferguson led a ceremony celebrating the opening of the £200m Hope building where he was being treated on Saturday night in 2010. He placed a tile on the facade of the structure to mark the event. At the time he said: “The new hospital development will no doubt enhance the great work that the team at Salford Royal already deliver to patients in Greater Manchester.” In 2011 he attended an event at Salford Royal where his friend the artist Harold Riley unveiled his latest exhibition. Portraits, including one of the former Manchester United manager, were displayed inside a wing of the Hope hospital. It is not the first time Ferguson has been treated in hospital for a serious health condition. In 2003 he underwent cardioversion electric shock treatment for a heart irregularity. United players past and present took to social media to express their shock about Saturday’s news and offer their best wishes. Michael Carrick, the captain, tweeted: “Absolutely devastated to hear about Sir Alex being unwell in hospital. All my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. Be strong Boss.” David Beckham, who came through at United under Ferguson, wrote on Instagram: “Keep fighting Boss. Sending prayers and love to Cathy and the whole family.” Cristiano Ronaldo, the Real Madrid forward and five-times Ballon d’Or winner who kickstarted his career at United under Ferguson from 2003 to 2009 posted a picture of him and the manager, saying: “My thoughts and prayers are with you, my dear friend. Be strong, Boss!”. Edwin van der Sar played under Ferguson for six years and was granted leave by the manager in 2009 when his wife suffered a brain haemorrhage. The former Netherlands goalkeeper tweeted his support. “Devastated about the news about Sir Alex and knowing all too well about the situation ourselves,” he wrote. “Stay strong and hope together with everyone that you recover. Edwin and Annemarie.” In a statement the League Managers Association chairman, Howard Wilkinson, said: “I was extremely sorry to hear the news about Sir Alex this evening. I, together with the whole fraternity of football managers in the LMA, wish him well and hope for a speedy recovery from his surgery. All our thoughts are with Lady Cathy and the rest of Sir Alex’s family at this difficult time.” The Premier League tweeted: “The thoughts of everyone at the Premier League are with Sir Alex Ferguson and his family.” Manchester City wished Ferguson “a full and speedy recovery”, and Arsenal said “we’re all thinking of you, Sir Alex”. Liverpool FC gave “full support” to “a great rival but also a great friend who supported this club during its most difficult time”. Ferguson’s reach across sport is so great that even America’s NBA offered their sympathy and support. He is the most successful manager in British football history, winning 38 titles, including 13 Premier League trophies, at United. The Scot joined the club in 1986 after a 12-year spell managing clubs in his home country, most notably Aberdeen, from whom he moved to United. While at Pittodrie he won the Scottish title three times, the Scottish Cup four times and in 1983 the European Cup Winner’s Cup, beating Real Madrid in the final. Before that he had a successful playing career, notably for Dunfermline and Rangers. As United’s longest serving manager he won two European Cups – famously against Bayern Munich as part of the treble in 1999, then against Chelsea in 2008 – and five FA Cups in addition to the Premier League title victories. He was at Old Trafford last Sunday to present Arsène Wenger with a commemorative trophy after the announcement that the Frenchman was leaving Arsenal after 22 years. The two had a bitter rivalry when both were managing at the top level but any ill feeling between the pair now appears to have dissipated as demonstrated by their warm embrace on the pitch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/may/08/richard-branson-set-for-large-profit-if-cybg-and-virgin-money-merge","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T15:04:29Z","webTitle":"Richard Branson set for large profit if CYBG and Virgin Money merge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/08/richard-branson-set-for-large-profit-if-cybg-and-virgin-money-merge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/08/richard-branson-set-for-large-profit-if-cybg-and-virgin-money-merge","fields":{"headline":"Richard Branson set for large profit if CYBG and Virgin Money merge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Richard Branson could bag a large profit on the sale of Virgin Money after receiving a £1.6bn bid for the bank seven years after he led a controversial £747m buyout of Northern Rock – later rebranded Virgin – following its taxpayer rescue. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), which has proposed the deal,said it would create “a genuine alternative to the large incumbent banks”. The enlarged group would have 6 million customers. Virgin Money shares climbed more than 9% to 341p on news of the CYBG approach, but a rise in the shares over recent days could interest City watchdogs. The shares climbed 15% from 270p to 312p last week. Banking analysts said the deal would present “compelling industrial logic”. It would bring together a more traditional bank, CYBG, which has 169 branches, mostly in Scotland and Yorkshire, and serves 2.8m commercial and personal customers, with Virgin Money’s strong brand in mortgages and credit cards business, which has 3.3m customers. Virgin Money has not yet agreed to the deal, which it described as a preliminary proposal, but its shares jumped 9% when the news emerged. Virgin Money shareholders would have 36.5% of the combined group. Virgin Money traces its origins back to the 1995 launch of Virgin Direct, an investment business, but it was the takeover of Northern Rock in 2011 that propelled it into a large-scale operation. As chancellor, George Osborne agreed to sell Northern Rock to Virgin Money nearly four years after nationalising the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The price paid by a consortium of investors, led by Branson, was half the amount the UK taxpayer had injected into bank. Osborne said at the time that the deal represented value for money for UK taxpayers. Branson’s consortium included the US billionaire, Wilbur Ross, now Donald Trump’s commerce secretary. It bought the “good” half of the bank, including its branch network, funded by retail deposits. The “bad” part of Northern Rock – which included its fabled 125% mortgages – remained in public hands, although defaults and losses have been much lower than anticipated. The coalition government brushed off calls by MPs, led by Chuka Ummuna, to remutualise the bank. Virgin Money said in a statement: “The board of Virgin Money is in the process of reviewing this proposal. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made.” Shares in other mid-sized “challenger” banks rose sharply after CYBG’s prompted speculation that a long-awaited consolidation in the sector could become a reality. Virgin Money’s rivals, including Metro Bank and OnesavingsBank, rose as investors bet on which might be next to merge in a buoyant British mergers and acquisitions market which has had record levels of activity. Analysts said the initial offer was too low and would likely be rejected. “We think Virgin shareholders will be lukewarm on the proposal,” said John Cronin at the broker Goodbody, adding that he expected a protracted takeover battle as the two parties jockey over price. Under Takeover Panel rules CYBG now has until 4 June to table a formal proposal or walk away for at least six months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/08/romantic-novelist-trademarking-of-word-cocky-fameela-hopkins","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T13:42:34Z","webTitle":"Romantic novelist's trademarking of word 'cocky' sparks outcry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/08/romantic-novelist-trademarking-of-word-cocky-fameela-hopkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/08/romantic-novelist-trademarking-of-word-cocky-fameela-hopkins","fields":{"headline":"Romantic novelist's trademarking of word 'cocky' sparks outcry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Romance novelists have risen en masse to defend their right to use the word “cocky”, after one writer moved to trademark the adjective. Faleena Hopkins is the self-published author of a series of books about the “Cocker Brothers” (“Six bad boy brothers you’ll want to marry or hide under you [sic] bed”), each of which features the word “cocky” in the title: Cocky Romantic, Cocky Biker, Cocky Cowboy. On Saturday, author Bianca Sommerland posted a YouTube video sharing allegations that Hopkins had written to authors whose books also had titles including the word “cocky”, informing them that she had been granted the official registered trademark of the adjective in relation to romance books, and asking them to rename their novels or face legal action. Records at the US patent and trademark office show that the registered trademark for use of the word “cocky” in relation to romance ebooks was issued in April 2018. Self-published writer Jamila Jasper, who claims she was asked by Hopkins to change the title of her novel Cocky Cowboy, said she removed her novel from sale after she was contacted by Hopkins. “I have to admit I am intimidated because I don’t have many resources to fight this legally if she does pursue,” she wrote on Twitter. Pajiba reported on Monday that the author Nana Malone had been asked to change the title of her novel Mr Cocky, while TL Smith and Melissa Jane’s Cocky Fiancé has been renamed Arrogant Fiancé. Other writers claimed that Hopkins had reported them to Amazon, resulting in their books being taken down from the site. Hopkins tweeted that the word was “a brand”, and that the writers she was contacting could “keep their books, rankings, reviews and their money by retitling which takes one day”. On Facebook, she said she was a victim of “cyber-bullying”, writing that she “applied for the trademark to protect the future of my series because it helps people. It’s filled with love, hope, and respect to all human beings.” She added: “I receive letters from readers who lost money thinking they bought my series. I’m protecting them and that’s what trademarks are meant for.” Others are not so sure. Chocolat author Joanne Harris punned that “such behaviour is considered a dick move” on her blog, adding more seriously that “if it were really possible to legally forbid authors from using a certain common word in their book titles, then the whole publishing industry would be down the drain in a matter of days”. The Romance Writers of America is working with an intellectual property lawyer in response to Hopkins’s trademark, and has asked writers contacted by Hopkins to get in touch. Author and retired lawyer Kevin Kneupper has separately filed a legal challenge to have the trademark cancelled, writing that “as a competing author in the same field who has described characters in his books … as ‘cocky’ and who may use this word in … future titles”, the registration is “causing injury and damage”. “Romance novels frequently involve ‘alpha males’ as their protagonists – and those alpha males are often described in the titles to the works using adjectives such as ‘cocky’,” says Kneupper’s petition, arguing that “such generic terms cannot be subject to a trademark”. A petition to the US patent and trademark office asking it to cancel the “cocky” trademark has since been signed by more than 17,000 people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/08/cliff-richard-seeks-damages-from-the-bbc-over-police-raid-footage","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T19:02:03Z","webTitle":"Cliff Richard seeks damages from the BBC over police raid footage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/08/cliff-richard-seeks-damages-from-the-bbc-over-police-raid-footage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/08/cliff-richard-seeks-damages-from-the-bbc-over-police-raid-footage","fields":{"headline":"Cliff Richard seeks damages from the BBC over police raid footage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sir Cliff Richard is seeking a payment of at least £560,000 from the BBC following the broadcaster’s coverage of a police raid at his home in 2014. The singer was investigated by South Yorkshire police after an accusation of historical sexual assault was made against him, relating to an alleged incident at Sheffield United’s ground in 1985. Richard was never arrested and no charges were ever brought in the case. Justin Rushbrooke QC, representing Richard, told the high court in a closing statement that the 77-year-old had sustained “possibly permanent damage to his self-esteem” as a result of the BBC’s coverage, leaving him with no option but to seek substantial damages. “The psychological damage, as well as not forgetting the reputational damage, was indisputably immense,” he said. The lawyer told the court that Richard would be seeking between £175,000 and £250,000 in damages from the BBC. The singer has previously said he would also claim £278,000 in legal costs, £108,000 for PR fees, and an undisclosed amount in relation to a book deal which collapsed when the accusations were made public. These figures did not take into account legal costs for bringing the case. Richard has previously said that he has spent £3.4m on the case. The singer accused the BBC of invading his privacy by choosing to run the story. The broadcaster decided to fight the case, arguing the story is in the public interest and it is not a breach of privacy rules to factually report the existence of a police investigation. Much of the case has focused on the BBC’s decision to use a helicopter to film Richard’s Berkshire home, which sits in a gated community hidden from the general public. Rushbrooke said without the BBC camera crews and the helicopter it was “quite clear this was an event which could have easily gone unremarked”. Summing up his case, he said his client deserved substantial compensation because of the “excessive” level of worldwide coverage which followed the BBC’s report. “Without exaggeration I would submit that in pretty much every nook and cranny of the English speaking world the fact, the details and the intrusive video footage found their way into the public domain,” he said. Gavin Millar QC, representing the BBC, insisted the broadcaster had acted responsibly. He accepted that the coverage would have had an impact on Richard but said this had to be separated from the “distress” of being under police investigation. “The BBC’s reporting was confined to the most basic facts/visual images concerning the investigation and the search,” he said. “There was nothing in the reporting that was inconsistent with the presumption of innocence.” Millar told the court that Richard could have no “reasonable expectation” that he would not be identified in any reporting of the case. “Sir Cliff might have hoped not to be identified,” he added. “But looked at objectively, he could not really expect to be anonymised.” Richard has already received £400,000 from South Yorkshire police as a result of the coverage. The police now want the BBC to pay part of this sum, arguing it was the broadcaster’s actions which did the most damage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-doctors-overseas-health-medical-training-regions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:29:33Z","webTitle":"Australia to let in fewer overseas doctors, in one of biggest budget savings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-doctors-overseas-health-medical-training-regions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-doctors-overseas-health-medical-training-regions","fields":{"headline":"Australia to let in fewer overseas doctors, in one of biggest budget savings","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia will admit 200 fewer overseas doctors a year than had been planned, providing the budget’s biggest expenditure saving of $415m over the next four years.

Non-vocationally trained doctors will now get 80% of most MBS payments. The number of doctors practising in Australia will continue to increase, and the reduction in overseas doctor admissions, to take effect from next January, will still see a planned target of 2,100 new overseas doctors each year. The reduction in MBS payments to non-vocationally trained doctors would hit about 5,000 practising GPs, according to government officials – most of them overseas-trained.

The measure was announced in Tuesday’s budget, which introduced a suite of tax integrity measures aimed at individuals and companies. “The black economy undermines community trust in the tax system, gives some businesses an unfair competitive advantage, puts pressure on margins of honest businesses, and often includes exploitation of vulnerable employees through the underpayment of wages and loss of entitlements,” said Kelly O’Dwyer, the financial services minister. The government’s largest black economy measure is a crackdown on illicit tobacco, which it expects to raise $3.6bn over the next four years. It says the three main sources of illicit tobacco in Australia are smuggling, leakage from licensed warehouses, and illicit domestic production. To combat this, it will create an illicit tobacco taskforce with powers to prosecute organised crime groups at the centre of the illicit tobacco trade. It will introduce permits for all tobacco imports (except tobacco imported by travellers within duty-free limits), and require tobacco importers to pay all duty and tax liabilities upon importation. That is a change from the current system where tobacco can be imported and stored in licensed warehouses prior to taxes being paid. As part of the cash-in-hand crackdown the government will introduce an economy-wide cash payment limit of $10,000 to reduce money laundering and tax evasion, to apply from 1 July 2019. It means transactions over $10,000 will have to be made through an electronic payment system or cheque when purchasing goods or services. Transactions with financial institutions or consumer to consumer non-business transactions will not be affected. The government is unsure how much money the measure will raise, however. Meanwhile, in other measures, the government says companies will no longer be allowed to claim deductions for payments to their employees, such as wages, where they have not withheld any amount of PAYG from the payments, despite PAYG withholding requirements applying. It will also remove deductions for payments made by businesses to contractors where the contractor does not provide an ABN and the business does not withhold any amount of PAYG. For foreign investors, the government will crackdown on the use of so-called “stapled structures”. It wants to make sure income earned in Australia, can be taxed by Australia. Those additional measures include strengthening the so-called “thin capitalisation” rules, which are meant to stop companies loading up on debt to shift profits offshore. The government also wants to strengthen its anti-tax avoidance rules. The measure will raise $400m in revenue over four years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-road-rail-spending-infrastructure-highways","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:03:33Z","webTitle":"Roads get $4.5bn in Australia budget but rail spending forced to wait","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-road-rail-spending-infrastructure-highways","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-road-rail-spending-infrastructure-highways","fields":{"headline":"Roads get $4.5bn in Australia budget but rail spending forced to wait","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The federal government will direct $4.5bn in spending towards roads but much-heralded new public transport projects including the Tullamarine airport rail link and the Monash rail link will wait years for the lion’s share of announced funding. In his budget speech on Tuesday night, the treasurer boasted that the government’s “$75bn 10-year rolling infrastructure plan will continue”. Scott Morrison announced that $1bn would be directed to an urban congestion fund “to fix pinch points and improve traffic flow and safety in our cities”. Some $3.5bn will be spent on roads of strategic importance to upgrade key freight routes in northern Australia ($1.5bn), Tasmania ($400m), the Bindoon bypass in Western Australia ($220m) and $100m to upgrade the Barton highway in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. Of the total $75bn 10-year package, some $24.5bn has been committed to new projects in a pre-budget blitz but Treasury and infrastructure department officials told Guardian Australia that just $4.2bn of that will be spent in the next four years, reflecting the fact many are not ready for construction. Existing projects will get $17.8bn over the next four years. Of the new projects, some $5bn is committed to the Tullamarine Melbourne airport rail link but just $250m will be spent in the next four years. Of the $475m for planning and pre-construction work for the Monash rail link, just $23m will be spent in the next four years. Of the new public transport commitments, only Perth’s Metronet – which will get a further $1.05bn from the federal government – will see the majority of its funding ($730m) in the next four years. Major road projects will also wait years for most of their funding, with $1bn committed to the M1 Pacific motorway on the Gold Coast but just $155m in the next four years and $971m committed to the Pacific highway Coffs Harbour bypass but just $235m in the next four years. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The budget papers confirm the newly committed $24.5bn will go towards: • $7.8bn for Victoria including $5bn for the Melbourne airport rail link, $1.75bn for the North-East link, $475m for the Monash rail connection, $225m for the Frankston-to-Baxter rail line electrification, $140m for urban roads, $132m for the Princes highway duplication, and $50m for duplication of the Geelong rail line. • $5.2bn for Queensland including the Bruce highway upgrades ($3.3bn), M1 Pacific motorway ($1bn), Beerburrum to Nambour rail upgrade ($390m), Brisbane Metro ($300m), Amberley interchange ($170m) and the Warrego highway ($64.2m). • $3.2bn for Western Australia including $1.1bn for the Metronet, $580.5m for the Tonkin highway, $560m for the Bunbury outer ring road, $144m for the Roe highway, $107.5m for the Mitchell freeway extension and $220m for the Bindoon bypass. • $1.8bn for South Australia including $1.4bn for the north-south corridor in Adelaide, $220m for the Gawler rail line electrification and $160m for the Joy Baluch bridge duplication. • $1.5bn for NSW including the Coffs Harbour bypass on the Pacific highway ($971m), Port Botany rail line duplication ($400m) and a new Nowra bridge ($155m). • $520.8m for Tasmania including $461m for the Bridgewater bridge replacement and $59.8m for the Tasmanian freight rail revitalisation. • $280m for the Northern Territory including the Central Arnhem road upgrade ($180m) and the Buntine highway upgrade ($100m). The budget papers note that although the government will give “up to $5bn” for the Tullamarine Melbourne airport rail link, there is “an option for equity investment, to be settled at a later date”, and the Victorian government will be required to chip in 50% of the cost. Infrastructure department officials insisted the equity option would not reduce commonwealth funding for the project, but equity funding could make up 100% of its contribution. The rest of the $75bn 10-year program includes $15bn in equity grants – which remain off budget – and $4.2bn in contingent liabilities including for the East-West link in Melbourne, which the Victorian Labor government has not committed to build."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/08/trump-iran-decision-sanctions-waiver-nuclear-deal-continue","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T12:55:49Z","webTitle":"Trump's decision on Iran is not as black and white as it seems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/trump-iran-decision-sanctions-waiver-nuclear-deal-continue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/08/trump-iran-decision-sanctions-waiver-nuclear-deal-continue","fields":{"headline":"Trump's decision on Iran is not as black and white as it seems","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"European leaders will look for any chink of light in Donald Trump’s announcement on the Iran nuclear deal to argue that it is still alive and can be salvaged in the months ahead. The US decision on Iran is often seen in Manichean terms of whether Trump pulls out of the agreement or not. This is partly because Trump, unlike his predecessor, does not believe his political base warms to nuance. A president who communicates in 280 characters does not trade in shades of grey. But the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is a subtle document that allows for all kinds of fudge if Trump’s advisers choose to take that course. The 2016 US guidance accompanying the original agreement was 42 pages. The specific decision Trump is required to take by 12 May is whether to renew a waiver on a set of oil sanctions first implemented in January 2012. Removing the waiver will not immediately lead to the imposition of sanctions, but it would mean companies, including banks, having to show over the next 180 days that they are reducing their trade in Iranian oil by significant amounts. In 2012, the US Department of State was charged with defining “significant amounts” in terms of barrels of oil a day, and the Obama administration chose a 20% reduction over an 80-day period. Companies or countries that do not comply will then face sanctions. In addition, all oil payments and any other transactions with the Iranian central bank would be required to go into escrow accounts. Waivers on further, broader sanctions against Iran covering insurance, shipping, transportation and finance do not come up for renewal until 11 July, said Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department. It was open to Trump to reimpose all sanctions immediately, and even add new ones, Nephew said. But if the US president takes a step-by-step removal of sanctions as waiver deadlines fall, EU diplomats have up to six months to negotiate with Iran, with the proviso that Tehran chooses not to decide a US refusal to renew the waiver represents a withdrawal from the JCPOA and justifies the renewal of its nuclear programme. The JCPOA is open to such interpretation since it is not a treaty, but a political agreement. Jarrett Blanc, a former Obama administration lead on Iran, said: “It does not have any formal provisions or procedures for withdrawal. A participant in the deal may simply cease complying with its obligations.” So even if Trump interpreted the lifting of the waiver as a US withdrawal, the EU could still try to keep the deal going on a life-support machine. The EU has been planning for such a scenario in private for months, although it has been reluctant to discuss the bloc’s thinking in public, preferring to focus all its energies on spelling out the dangers of a US withdrawal for peace in the Middle East. The former UK foreign secretary Jack Straw, who is broadly sympathetic to Tehran’s moderate wing, argues that it is possible for the EU to continue to trade with Iran by blocking any US sanctions on European banks that trade with Iran. He says it is possible for the EU to pass legislation stating that any US sanctions on European entities trading with Iran are null and void. The EU did much the same in protest at the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act passed by the US Congress in 1996. The EU passed a blocking statute, arguing as a matter of principle that it was wrong for the US to impose sanctions that had an extra-territorial effect. But this is largely uncharted territory. It would broaden an EU-US foreign policy dispute into a transatlantic economic confrontation. Only EU banks with no interests in the US are likely to take the risk that the bloc can protect them from massive fines imposed by the US Treasury. The residual anti-Iran sanctions currently in force have already put a chill on nervous EU companies from trading with Iran. Trump is hardly likely to impose sanctions on a sworn enemy and then cheerfully let Europe undermine them. But some EU diplomats hope there is time to draw Trump back by showing it is possible to address his concerns on Iran’s ballistic missile programme or behaviour in Yemen. They point to dispute resolution clauses in the deal as another way of deferring a total breakdown. The most senior UN diplomats believe Iran is not as heavily invested in backing the Houthi rebels against Saudi Arabia as is often portrayed. Progress in Yemen might lead Trump to postpone. Europe’s chances of acting as an honest broker between Trump and Iran also depend on moderates holding sway in Tehran. Nephew said: “[The Iranian president, Hassan] Rouhani is already starting to take an awful lot of heat for the technocrat who failed, technically. “He’s supposed to be the guy who’s the steady hand, who can come in and right the ship of the economy, of the politics, of international affairs. The combination of economic instability and the JCPOA being damaged will badly damage his standing inside the country, and that can certainly empower the hardliners.” Jake Sullivan, Obama’s senior adviser during the Iran negotiations, also warned a US withdrawal would weaken protests against the government in Iran, where there is anger over jobs and living standards. “The west was no longer an effective excuse for the regime in Tehran for the economic travails that their citizens are facing,” he said. “The people just weren’t buying it. But if the United States pulls out while Iran is still complying with the deal, that excuse will once again become available.” Nevertheless, Rouhani, would like to keep the deal alive with the EU, and the other signatories apart from the US. He said on Tuesday that if the US left the agreement, Iran “will face some problems for two or three months, but we will pass through this”. Many diplomats will admire his optimism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/09/budget-2018-labor-to-support-tax-cuts-for-low-and-middle-income-earners","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T22:28:05Z","webTitle":"Federal budget: Labor to support tax cuts for low and middle-income earners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/budget-2018-labor-to-support-tax-cuts-for-low-and-middle-income-earners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/budget-2018-labor-to-support-tax-cuts-for-low-and-middle-income-earners","fields":{"headline":"Federal budget: Labor to support tax cuts for low and middle-income earners","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor has signalled it will support tax cuts for low and middle-income earners while reserving its position on the rest of the budget centrepiece, as the Turnbull government prepares to introduce legislation giving effect to its seven-year plan. A blockbuster political Wednesday will see the Turnbull government bring forward legislation for its budget centrepiece, and the high court will hand down its long-awaited verdict on the eligibility of the Labor senator Katy Gallagher to sit in parliament – a decision that could trigger a string of byelections. After handing down the budget on Tuesday night, and launching into the hard sell, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, declared the Coalition’s tax plan would hit parliament as one package on Wednesday morning despite some elements of it not taking effect until 2024 – which is at least two federal election cycles away. Morrison said on Tuesday night the government’s tax reform measures were a “whole plan” and a “package” – setting up a political fight that will likely roll until the next federal election. “It’s a plan that stays together, it’s not designed to be broken apart, it’s a package deal,” the treasurer said. The treasurer also emphasised that low and middle-income earners would see tax relief before big corporations, with the Coalition persisting with its tax cut for Australia’s largest firms in Tuesday night’s statement despite lacking the requisite parliamentary support. Labor has signalled it will support the first phase of the seven-year, $140bn tax plan, which will give 4.4 million taxpayers with incomes between $48,000 and $90,000 a $530 cash rebate. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the opposition has reserved its position on the more controversial element of the package, a move towards a flatter tax structure. The Coalition proposes to axe the 37% bracket so workers on incomes between $41,000 and $200,000 would be taxed at the same marginal rate – delivering a significant windfall for high-income earners. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the tax cuts for low and middle-income earners were justified because of sluggish wages growth. But he said it was a “hoax” for the government to suggest it could fundamentally overhaul the tax system in 2024 when it was unclear what the prevailing economic circumstances would be. “They would make a significant change to the tax system, they want to legislate that now when we don’t know what the financial circumstances will be in 2024,” Bowen told the ABC on Tuesday night. “There is not even a cost of that particular measure in the budget papers. This government is saying vote for us, sign up, we should sign up for something in 2024, two elections away, keep voting for us and we will give you a tax cut”. The Turnbull government has made it plain that it wants a political contest with Labor where it paints the opposition as a risky, high-taxing, big-spending alternative, and it hopes to use Tuesday night’s economic statement to reboot its political fortunes. The budget sets up the Coalition’s election pitch, with the government able to go to the polls anytime after August, but the political landscape for the next several months could be cluttered by the last vestige of the dual citizenship imbroglio depending on the high court’s ruling in the Gallagher case. The high court’s decision could trigger a round of campaigning in several seats before the general election being called. The income tax relief promised in the budget is funded by a massive increase in company tax revenue as the economy unwinds from the lingering effects of the global financial crisis. Company tax collections increased by $15bn or 22% in 2017-18 and the budget forecasts that receipts will grow solidly over the out years. Income tax collections have also improved as the labour market has strengthened and are expected to grow strongly in the last two years of the four-year budget cycle, with Treasury forecasting a rebound in wages growth to 3.5% – which is optimistic at a time when wages growth has been stagnant. Compared with the expectations in last year’s midyear economic forecast, forecasts for tax receipts have been revised up by $12bn over the four years to 2021-22, driven by parameter variations, while the government’s policy decisions are expected to decrease tax receipts by $13.9bn over the four-year cycle. Expenditure on government payments is forecast to equal 25.9% of GDP in 2018-19, which is just below the peak recorded during the stimulus rolled out by the Rudd government during the global financial crisis. Spending falls to 24.7% of GDP at the end of the four-year cycle. Morrison, on the defensive about ballooning government outlays, said real expenditure growth remains below 2%, “the most restrained of any government in more than 50 years”. Despite the massive outlays, the budget is forecast to return to balance in 2019-20, one year ahead of schedule, with a surplus of $11bn in 2020-21 and $16.6bn in 2021-22."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/12/book-clinic-what-constitutes-well-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T16:59:36Z","webTitle":"Book clinic: what constitutes ‘well read’?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/12/book-clinic-what-constitutes-well-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/12/book-clinic-what-constitutes-well-read","fields":{"headline":"Book clinic: what constitutes ‘well read’?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Since it is seen as a great accolade for a person to be thought “well read”, I wonder what the minimum requirement might be to be considered thus? David Handley, Yorkshire Robert McCrum, author and former literary editor of the Observer In 1618, two years after Shakespeare’s death, a well-read adult could easily load all the books they had collected on to a decent-sized cart. Not only was there a consensus about what a good library should consist of, it was also quite easy to accumulate the necessary classics in good Renaissance translations. Four hundred years on, the idea of “well read” is both much harder to define (less of a consensus) and also more difficult to fulfil from the global cornucopia of choice. One thing is certain: it’s still to do with the unaccountable workings of personal taste. The book list I’d consider essential to any description of well read might not be the next person’s; yet both such lists would be equally valid. I’d suggest that three kinds of reading define the well-read mind. First, I’d want to include the immortals from the classics of Greece and Rome: Homer, Plato, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Euripides, Virgil, Plutarch, Ovid, Juvenal and Sappho… Next, from the Anglo-American literary tradition, we can’t forget Shakespeare, Milton, Donne, Byron, Austen, Keats, Dickens, Twain, Thoreau, Dickinson, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, Eliot, Pound, Auden, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Spark, Beckett, Woolf… and certainly another score of contemporary greats, including Baldwin, Pinter, Morrison, Miller, Bellow and Naipaul. Finally, and this is where it gets contentious, there’s great writing in translation, from Proust, Freud, Fanon and Bulgakov to Grass, Márquez, Kundera and Levi. I’ve only scratched the surface, but these would be indispensable to my definition of well read.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, says super funds will also face a 3% annual cap on the fees they can charge passive accounts with balances below $6,000, to prevent low super balances from being eroded by ever-rising fees. In addition, insurance arrangements within superannuation accounts will move from a default framework to be offered on an opt-in basis for members with balances below $6,000, members under the age of 25, and members whose accounts have not received a contribution in 13 months and are considered “inactive”. The changes are designed to protect the retirement savings of young people and those with low balances by ensuring their super is not unnecessarily eroded by premiums on insurance policies they do not need or are not aware of. The changes will also reduce the incidence of duplicated cover so individuals are not paying for multiple insurance policies. The raft of measures is part of a package announced in the budget on Tuesday to protect the super balances of young Australians and low-income earners from being whittled away by fees and insurance premiums. The changes will take effect from 1 July 2019. According to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, superannuation members lost $52m in exit fees in 2016-17 alone. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government will expand the powers of the Australian Taxation Office to allow it to consolidate inactive super accounts of individuals – where balances are below $6,000 – and to proactively reunite those accounts with a member’s active account. The government expects the measure will save the budget $1.1bn over four years. Treasury officials say there are roughly 6 million inactive super accounts in Australia, belonging to 4 million members. The government says insurance changes will not prevent anyone who wants insurance within their super from being able to obtain it. Low-balance, young and inactive members will still be able to opt in to obtain it. The measure is expected to save the budget $697m over four years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/08/talking-horses-has-sam-twiston-davies-made-the-right-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:41:15Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: has Sam Twiston-Davies made the right decision?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/08/talking-horses-has-sam-twiston-davies-made-the-right-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/08/talking-horses-has-sam-twiston-davies-made-the-right-decision","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: has Sam Twiston-Davies made the right decision?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tuesday’s best bets, by Chris Cook So, as it turned out, Paul Nicholls’s first few runners of the new jumps season were ridden by Sam Twiston-Davies, despite their sort-of split that was announced on Friday. Twiston-Davies has decided to go freelance but both sides say he will continue to ride for the Ditcheat yard, though Harry Cobden has now been named as Nicholls’s first jockey. Cobden was suspended yesterday, as was Sean Bowen, which explains why Twiston-Davies happened to be aboard Nicholls’s two winners at Kempton. It shows that the two men are still perfectly happy to work together but it should certainly not be interpreted as a sign that nothing much will change. “I’ve almost had a safety blanket,” Twiston-Davies said, when I asked him to explain his decision. “Whenever I looked at entries, I just looked at Paul, Dad and Dr Newland. Obviously now, with a lot of Paul’s owners wanting Harry and Sean and Bryony [Frost] and stuff, that’s a little bit of the scary factor; what might we ride?” (Like Frost and some other jump jockeys, Twiston-Davies sometimes uses “we” to mean “I”. It seems to me a kind of modesty, a way of generalising the subject so that’s it’s somehow not entirely about the speaker.) “So the nice thing is, I still do have the link-up with Paul. I’ll still be there a lot and if the owners want me, we’ll always ride. It’s just the balance of riding the right ones on the right days and good luck, as always in this game. “Paul’s job is one of the best in the country, so many good horses. What amazed me is, my first season down there, how they restock every summer. So you always want to be involved with that yard, because they’ll always rebuild. But some of the bigger owners, I didn’t really ride for. So it just gives me an opportunity to try and spread my wings and have a go on the Mondays to Fridays and hopefully, thanks to Paul, Dad, Dr Newland and some other trainers, I can still bash away on the Saturdays.” Frost was also at Kempton and I asked her if the jockey reshuffle might mean more chances for her. “We haven’t sat down or discussed anything,” she said. “I’m in a fantastic position, just being in that yard and getting the opportunities I am. The season I’ve had and how he’s supported me, it’s been incredible. What the top guys above me are doing is what they’re doing. I’m focusing on my position, keep my head down, keep working hard, I’ll keep kicking and keep improving.” Personally, I think Twiston-Davies would have been better off trying to make the best of his situation at Nicholls while picking up other opportunities when he wasn’t wanted. I’m sure that Nicholls would have been happy with that. My concern is that Twiston-Davies will not be able to make up for the number or quality of rides he is giving up, for all that he is both popular and talented. It’s a competitive world and many trainers and owners are already happy with the jockeys they have. Anyway, good luck to him. Hey, it’s Norfolk National day! The ground at Fakenham is going to be on the quick side in this baking weather, which steers me towards the 14-1 about Some Kinda Lama (3.45). This grey looked pretty useful as a handicap hurdler on a sound surface in the 2016/17 season and excuses can be made for his five efforts since September. He was overmatched when tried over fences in the autumn but has since dropped nicely down the weights and should be more at ease in this company. I’d like to see him ridden prominently and the first-time blinkers suggest that is what connections are also hoping for. Zeshov (4.55) is the interesting one at Thirsk, having shortened to 7-2 for the in-form Rebecca Bastiman. He seems to appreciate fast ground and there was encouragement in his third last time. You can get 11-2 about the nap, Lip Service (7.20) at Exeter tonight. He needed a sound surface when with Tony Martin and now gets it for the first time since joining Fergal O’Brien."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-older-australians-to-benefit-from-home-care-packages-and-pension-bonus-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:17:01Z","webTitle":"Aged care gets $1.6bn in budget package for older Australians and pension bonus increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-older-australians-to-benefit-from-home-care-packages-and-pension-bonus-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-older-australians-to-benefit-from-home-care-packages-and-pension-bonus-increase","fields":{"headline":"Aged care gets $1.6bn in budget package for older Australians and pension bonus increase","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Wage subsidies, 14,000 new home care packages and improved funding for mental health care in residential aged-care facilities are among measures aimed at older Australians unveiled in the federal budget. In his budget speech on Tuesday the treasurer, Scott Morrison, also announced changes to the pension work bonus to allow older Australians to work more hours without reducing pension payments, and expanded access to the pension loans scheme to boost their income by drawing down equity from their homes. Morrison said the government would spend $1.6bn over four years to create 14,000 home care places “to support the choice of older Australians who wish to stay at home and avoid going into residential aged care”. The places come on top of 6,000 announced in December’s midyear economic and fiscal outlook but is well short of the 105,000 on the national priority list for support. “By 2021-22 over 74,000 high level home care places will be available,” Morrison said. He also announced $146m to improve access to aged-care services in rural and regional areas and $83m for increased support for mental health services in residential aged care. An added $20m over four years is being earmarked for a pilot project targeting “loneliness” and those at risk of isolation. “And we will stand up for older Australians to keep them safe and prevent elder abuse, with new support services and a national online register for enduring powers of attorney,” Morrison said. The government will create an aged-care quality and safety commission, combining the functions of a number of existing agencies, implementing one of the recommendations of the Carnell Paterson review of aged care that responded to elder abuse concerns including the Oakden scandal. The government will spend $227.4m to increase the work pension bonus from $250 to $300 a fortnight, allowing pensioners to earn up to $7,800 a year without impacting their pension. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison said this would mean pensioners could earn an extra $1,300 without affecting their payments. “For the first time, the bonus will be extended to self-employed individuals who can now earn up to $7,800 per year,” he said. The government will provide wage subsidies of up to $10,000 for employers who take on older Australians, which would “combat age discrimination in the workforce”. That is one of a number of employment measures that will cost $189.7m over five years from the 2017 budget, but the budget papers show just $57.1m of new money has been set aside for these initiatives because they will be “partially funded from within existing resources”. A jobs and innovation department official told Guardian Australia subsidies would be provided through the existing employment fund, a pool of more than $300m that job service providers allocate to jobseekers to improve their employability through measures like training. The rules of the fund will now be changed to allow wage subsidies for up to 30,000 disadvantaged jobseekers, not just older Australians, but also other disadvantaged groups including the long-term unemployed, parents, people aged 25 to 29 and Indigenous jobseekers. Other measures announced in the budget include training to help jobseekers 45 years and older develop digital and other skills and grants of up to $2,000 for workers aged 45 to 70 to undertake re-skilling. The pension loan scheme now allows part-pensioners and self-funded retirees who own real estate to borrow up to 100% of the value of the age pension, or $900 a fortnight for singles, to use the equity in their homes to increase their retirement income. The loan is paid fortnightly, is tax-free and attracts compound interest of 5.25% on the outstanding balance. The scheme will be expanded to allow full-rate pensioners and self-funded retirees to increase the maximum fortnightly income stream to 150% of the age pension rate, boosting their income by up to $17,800 without impacting their eligibility for the pension or other benefits. The budget papers reveal the measure will cost just $11m, reflecting the fact the scheme is little-used."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/first-dog-on-the-moon-australia-federal-budget-2018-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:07:24Z","webTitle":"First Dog on the Moon goes to his seventh budget.

How the contenders are shaping up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Like the cuckoo, the new chief selector has been spotted this spring. He has been migrating north and west (it’s the only way to go from where he lives) to soak up some county cricket, to chat to the coaches, the umpires and the odd senior player as he reacquaints himself with the domestic circuit. Ed Smith knows that the easiest time to make an impact as a selector, heralding a vibrant new regime, is at the start of a season. After that, as Harold Macmillan probably didn’t say, “stuff happens”. The borderline selection, whom you don’t really rate, scores a lucky century; the one you really hold in high esteem bags a pair and the course is set. But for the first Test of a summer a selector is not so restricted. There is scope to trust one’s instincts. Andrew Strauss has pointed out that “Ed comes with fresh ideas”, which is clearly true. When I have sat alongside him in a commentary box interesting theories come to light as frequently as pigeons used to when Henry Blofeld was at the microphone. Upon announcing Smith as his chief selector, Strauss added: “There is real depth to his talent identification knowledge.” I will try to interpret as best I can. Strauss may have meant “he knows a good cricketer when he sees one” or he may have been hinting at a highly sophisticated, innovative scientific/mathematical/psychological system of assessing players who might excel for England. We’ll see. The impetus for some sort of change to the Test team is considerable. Throughout the winter England played seven Tests, losing five and drawing two. In these circumstances it would seem odd for a new selector – or an old one for that matter – to pick all the familiar names. However, it is not obvious which way Smith can go to invigorate the side. At the start of the season the data often seems skewed. In the first few rounds of this year’s Championship wickets have usually tumbled on damp, green pitches so that runs count double, while the value of a pile of wickets, mostly taken by 80mph seamers, can be halved. In the last round of matches on drier, sun-drenched surfaces the batsmen started to enjoy themselves a bit. But have the right men prospered for Smith? With the Lord’s Test just over a fortnight away, there are, I think, only five absolute certainties assuming all are fit (Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson). You may have spotted a glaring absentee on this list, an opening batsman of unprecedented experience, and that is where we start. Openers All the candidates are left-handed and I acknowledge that the senior one, Alastair Cook, is a very strong probable. But it is good to keep him guessing. Over the years the great players demonstrate a highly-tuned survival instinct. They manage to conjure something whenever their career is jeopardised. So it may be helpful to put Cook on notice (moreover, in the winter in 15 Test innings he only managed to exceed 37 once – when he scored 244 not out in Melbourne). Mark Stoneman, by his own candid admission, has not done enough to nail down a place, though his last Test innings was a career-best 60. Rory Burns, his partner at Surrey, where batsmen tend to prosper, has scored some runs, while Keaton Jennings, after a poor start at Lancashire, has just hit a century at Old Trafford, where Haseeb Hameed has just been dropped. Another fancied left-hander, Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, posted a century at Hove. Middle order In Christchurch it was James Vince, Root and Dawid Malan. Of these Vince is the most vulnerable despite scoring 76 in his last Test innings. One of Vince’s attractions is that he is used to batting at No3, which Root is reluctant to do. But how he exasperates. Other contenders, such as Liam Livingstone of Lancashire and Dan Lawrence of Essex, rarely bat so high for their counties. Worcestershire’s Joe Clarke has just struck 157 batting at No4 at the powderpuff Oval after a poor start to the summer. We can now proceed more quickly. All-rounder Barring accidents we fall back on Stokes with a caveat over whether he is capable of bowling 15 overs a day with a red ball. This spring he has not been able to take the IPL by storm. Wicketkeeper More certainty, I think. There is Jonny Bairstow, unless Smith suggests sending him up the order as a specialist batsman. However Bairstow is adamant that he should keep the gloves – and it was somehow uplifting to see him standing up at Chelmsford not only to Steve Patterson but also Ben Coad. Pacemen Who joins Anderson and Broad? They tried Mark Wood at Christchurch instead of Chris Woakes with little success. Both have been languishing on the sidelines in the IPL in the past fortnight. Craig Overton has been doing his duty for Somerset but the fast ones tend to be off-target. Olly Stone of Warwickshire flickered when taking eight for 80 against Sussex but then injury concerns resurfaced. Jake Ball with 25 and Coad (23) are the leading wicket-takers in the Division One. The selectors may just hope that Woakes is rejuvenated by the presence of a devilish, dark Duke in his hand. Spinners Until recently Moeen Ali has been hiding in India, Jack Leach in Taunton, though England’s latest Test player was in action for Somerset this week on an Old Trafford featherbed. He is an improving cricketer (he top-scored to save the game against Lancashire) and a competent left-arm spinner. Leach’s cause is helped considerably if Stokes is fit to bowl. And look out for Surrey’s Amar Virdi, patiently. Verdict They could easily pick the same crew. That might be Trevor Bayliss’s preference, but not Smith’s. This will be an interesting meeting of minds. • This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

At a glitzy ceremony in Geneva, which was more Eurovision than Oscars, Håkan Samuelsson, CEO of Volvo, stepped up to a spotlit stage to collect the trophy (a sort of ugly upside-down triangle) for the brand’s newest and smallest car – the XC40. The award is decided by 60 motoring journalists from 23 countries. It’s hard-fought and the results are closely guarded. But the fact Volvo came in so far ahead of the shortlist of six nominees didn’t surprise anyone. The XC40 has already scooped several awards and has the swagger of a vehicle born to win. What did surprise me is that in the 55 years of the European car awards, Volvo has never previously won. So, a big night all round for the Gothenburg gang. It’s a year of firsts for them: the XC40 is also the only compact premium SUV Volvo has ever made. There is one crucial difference between the small premium SUV sector and the large premium SUV sector – size. To understand what’s involved imagine a big posh car, stuffed with luxury geegaws and advanced gadgetry, and then shrink the whole thing so it fits into a smaller space. It’s one of the fastest-growing motoring segments (these cars are particularly popular in China, the world’s largest car market) and it is ferociously competitive. To have any chance of being the cream that floats, you have to out-premium the best of the rest. And that is exactly what Volvo has tried to do. The car is Swedish, alternative, urban, youthful and a bit left field. It sets dizzying standards in terms of design, connectivity, performance, luxury and safety. There are also endless tiny details that will surprise and delight: there’s a special space for phones with inductive charging, a foldout hook for small bags in the boot, a removable waste bin in the central console, hidden storage shelves under the front seats, the armrest lifts to create a space the exact size of a box of tissues… Being a Volvo, safety is off-the-scale. For the risk-averse, this little car really is belt and braces. If you do manage to crash it, you’ve managed to do something heroically stupid – or have been exceptionally unlucky. It comes with a host features including Pilot Assist, City Safety, Run-off Road Protection, Cross Traffic Alert and the 360° camera to help with parking. Volvo has also discovered that spinal injuries are very common when a car crashes off the road into a ditch and have come up with a unique collapsing seat frame that disintegrates as you crash so as to protect your spine. The XC40 also comes with a unique car-sharing feature. This means owners can pool their car with family and friends without having to hand over a physical key. Whether you get a key or a code, you’ll be firing up either a petrol or diesel four-cylinder two-litre turbo. A tidy, frugal three-cylinder petrol arrives later this year, while hybrid and fully electric XC40s are part of the longer-term plan. To my amazement, Volvo still expects 60% of sales to be diesel. I drove the petrol with an eight-speed auto and it was lively, willing and very composed. But nothing is ever quite perfect. In the XC40’s case it’s the horrid little gear shift. Not only does it sit oddly in your hand, but it isn’t intuitive. You have to nudge it the opposite way to what you expect and then you have to nudge it a second time. It irritated me every time I got into the car.

The ABC’s managing director, Michelle Guthrie, told staff she was “very disappointed and concerned” about what amounted to a substantial budget cut and it would impact audiences. “This decision will make it very difficult for the ABC to meet its charter requirements and audience expectations,” Guthrie told staff. The cut comes on top of the government’s decision not to continue a further $43m targeted grant to support news gathering and after cuts of the magnitude of $254m since 2014. While the ABC will be forced to make savings, SBS has been given an additional $14.6m over two years. Operational funding for the ABC will remain at 2018-19 levels over three years in what the government has called an “indexation freeze”. The cuts come amid fierce criticism of the ABC from some elements of the Coalition, especially over the economics editor Emma Alberici’s coverage of the government’s corporate tax cut plans. In March the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, expressed his fury at ABC comedy show Tonightly for a sketch in which Australian Conservatives Party candidate Kevin Bailey was called “a cunt”. In a shock move Fifield also announced a second efficiency review for the ABC and the SBS, echoing the Lewis review in 2014 which recommended a merger of some parts of the two broadcasters and the sale of ABC property assets. Fifield said the Government is “confident further back office efficiencies can now be found”. The “indexation freeze” echoes the Coalition’s “efficiency dividend” imposed on the ABC in the 2014-15 budget, which broke Tony Abbott’s election-eve pledge of “no cuts to the ABC or SBS”. The cut will be phased in over three years, with a $14.6m cut in 2019-20, $27.8m in 2020-21 and $41.2m in 2021-22. Total funding for the national broadcaster will go from $1.131bn in 2017 to $1.122bn in 2018-19. The secretary of the ABC section of the Community and Public Sector Union, Sinddy Ealy, said the ABC would not survive another term of the Turnbull government. “The ABCs MD has tonight confirmed the ABC will not be able to meet its obligations to Australian audiences as a result of these cuts,” she told Guardian Australia. “This is extraordinary. The only way we can protect our national broadcaster now is a change of government at the next federal election.” The SBS boost includes $14.6m which the government says is to replace revenue that SBS could not raise as the legislation needed to allow the further advertising flexibility was not passed. A further $3m will be provided to support the development of Australian film and television content. Savings from the ABC cuts will be redirected to other spending measures within the communications and arts portfolio, according to the budget papers, including $48.7m for the commemoration of the 250th anniversary of James Cook’s landing in Botany Bay. The New South Wales government will be given $25m of this money for activities at the Kamay Botany Bay national park in Morrison’s electorate of Cook such as exhibitions, educational material and a voyage of the replica HMB Endeavour.

The measure is forecast to save $300m. A further $202m is expected to be saved over five years by increasing the waiting period for migrants to access to some welfare benefits from three years to four years from July 2018.

Welfare recipients also face having money taken directly out of their payments if they have unpaid court fines issued by state or territory governments. Anyone with outstanding state or territory arrest warrants would have payments cancelled. Robodebt has been widely criticised for sending out incorrect debt notices and putting the onus on often-vulnerable welfare recipients to track down payslips from as far back as seven years to prove their income was correctly declared. It also required anyone contesting a debt notice to do so through an online system, with some complaining they were unable to speak to anyone in person or on the phone about the debt. The government has responded to complaints of excessive waiting times for calls to Centrelink with a one-off $50m boost. Centrelink’s ageing IT systems will also be overhauled with $316m over four years for more efficient automated claim, assessment and payment processes. Some $1.1bn will be redirected from various departments to reform another highly criticised welfare policy. The remote work-for-the-dole scheme, the community development program, has been accused of failures including overwhelmingly discriminating against Indigenous people with its stricter requirements and harsher penalties. The $1.1bn will be redirected from the departments of prime minister and cabinet, social services and human services. Under the reformed CDP, beginning 1 February 2019, participants will have their required hours of work reduced to 20 a week, and will be subject to the same compliance measures as any other jobseekers “regardless of where they live, or which government program they participate in”, said the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion. There will be 6,000 wage subsidy positions available to eligible employers of CDP participants, for up to $21,034 over two years. The government will also extend its two cashless debit card trial for welfare recipients in Ceduna, South Australia, and East Kimberley, Western Australia, and will conduct another independent evaluation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/13/jess-williamson-cosmic-wink-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T06:59:01Z","webTitle":"Jess Williamson: Cosmic Wink review – fulfils the title’s mystical promise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/13/jess-williamson-cosmic-wink-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/13/jess-williamson-cosmic-wink-review","fields":{"headline":"Jess Williamson: Cosmic Wink review – fulfils the title’s mystical promise","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“Tell me everything you know about consciousness,” goes the first of many deep-diving croons on Texas singer-songwriter Jess Williamson’s third album. The opening track, I See the White, is a reflection about time and mortality inspired by her dog’s first grey hairs, and fulfils the mystical promise of the album’s title, soft strums sent spinning into delirium by gentle shifts in rhythm and kisses of organ. Williamson has evolved as a writer from her early days as a 10-a-penny spectral folkie on 2014’s Native State and its slightly gutsier 2016 follow-up Heart Song. Now she sounds fully formed, her rich lyrics (“Was my cup so full I thought it was empty?” she riddles, koan-like, on the dreamy shuffle of Mama Proud) and the dark depth of her Chan Marshall-ish voice adding intrigue to these subtly crafted songs. Cosmic Wink charts a romantic epiphany from the beguiling, early Neil Young-ish feel and bright, sitar-like guitar tones of Awakening, Baby via the sultry rock of Dream State to the reverby swell and melodic twangs of Forever. “When I don’t know what home is, I can turn in to your arms,” she concludes on the gently erotic Love on the Piano, the cosmic resolving into the domestic with sweet grace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/may/08/artists-condemn-exclusion-of-arts-subjects-from-english-baccalaureate","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T16:28:03Z","webTitle":"Artists condemn exclusion of arts subjects from English baccalaureate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/08/artists-condemn-exclusion-of-arts-subjects-from-english-baccalaureate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/08/artists-condemn-exclusion-of-arts-subjects-from-english-baccalaureate","fields":{"headline":"Artists condemn exclusion of arts subjects from English baccalaureate","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 100 of the UK’s leading artists have joined forces to condemn the exclusion of arts subjects from the new English baccalaureate, warning it will seriously damage the futures of many young people. Artists including Tracey Emin, Rachel Whiteread, Phyllida Barlow, Anish Kapoor, Jeremy Deller and Antony Gormley have signed a letter, published by the Guardian, calling on the government to rethink a key secondary school policy introduced by the former education secretary Michael Gove. The letter says there is compelling evidence that the study of creative subjects is in decline in state schools and that entries to arts subjects have fallen to their lowest level in a decade. “This means that young people are being deprived of opportunities for personal development in the fields of self-expression, sociability, imagination and creativity,” the letter says. “A consequence of this is that it places one of our largest and most successful global industries at risk, one worth £92bn a year to the UK economy. That is bigger than oil, gas, life sciences, automotive and aeronautics combined.” Deller said he had recently been in a new flagship academy at a meeting held in a room full of mirrors. He asked “what’s this” and was told the school had got rid of its dance teacher and now used the dance room for exams. “What a terrible thing for young people, what an incredible waste,” he said. He called the Ebacc “a huge mistake”, adding: “Thinking creatively is what is going to get Britain through a lot of the challenges of the next 10-20 years and that’s exactly what the arts do, they free up the mind.” Barlow, who taught in art schools from 1966 to 2009, said she had witnessed the erosion of the importance of the arts at all levels within education, especially over the last 15 to 20 years. “Without doubt, such ill thought through policies and attitude to the arts is a tragedy. People, young and old, are being deprived of the opportunities to discover their talents and abilities as artists and innovators within disciplines across the board. “This philistinism must stop for the sake of future generations and the survival of the planet.” Kapoor said it showed the UK was being “led by a bunch of halfwits, at best”. He said: “The fact that we enslave our young people as fodder, and educate them as fodder for this monument to capitalism is outrageous. In older times, and not so long ago, an education meant an education in the arts and music and the classics. Have we so lost our sense of what it means to be civilised that all we care about are subjects directed to the economy. What’s wrong with us?” The Ebacc performance measure makes the sciences, English language and literature, maths, a language and geography or history compulsory for secondary school pupils. Critics say that this has narrowed access to art or dance or music or drama as schools concentrate on core subjects. The government wants to see 90% of GCSE pupils choosing the Ebacc subject combination by 2025. Schools are measured on the number of pupils taking GCSEs in the core subjects. The letter adds to warnings made by many arts leaders. The former director of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner, called the Ebacc policy one of the “biggest disasters of the last seven years” and pointed with disdain to an assertion by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan that arts subjects could hold pupils back for years. A study from the Education Policy Institute thinktank last year found that the number of teenagers taking GCSEs in arts subjects had fallen to its lowest proportion for a decade. The promotion of the Ebacc suite of subjects was one reason for the fall, it said. The 104 signatories to the new letter include 15 former Turner prize winners including Lubaina Himid, Susan Philipsz, Richard Wright, Mark Wallinger, Grayson Perry, Wolfgang Tillmans and Gillian Wearing. A department for Education spokesperson said: “Our drive to ensure all pupils benefit from a stretching core academic curriculum through the Ebacc is not a barrier to pupils enjoying a high-quality arts education. In fact, since the introduction of the Ebacc the percentage of pupils taking arts GCSEs has remained stable. “We are investing nearly £500m in music and arts education programmes between 2016 and 2020. This includes the recent announcement of £96m to help talented pupils to attend prestigious arts institutions, such as the Royal Ballet School in London and Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-income-tax-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T13:08:30Z","webTitle":"Federal budget tax cuts locked in for low and middle-income earners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-income-tax-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australia-federal-budget-2018-income-tax-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Federal budget tax cuts locked in for low and middle-income earners","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Low and middle-income earners have emerged as the biggest winners from the government’s planned tax cuts, with a dual-income family potentially saving $1,000 a year on their annual tax bill. The measure is part of a three-point plan to overhaul the Australian tax system, with the government flagging its plans to install a flat tax rate past the next election cycle. That would eventually see a worker earning $41,000 paying the same tax rate as someone earning $200,000. But it is the next election that appears to be Scott Morrison’s immediate priority, with his personal income tax plan delivering immediate relief for those earning up to $90,000 a year. Under the plan, low-income earners with wages of up to $37,000 a year will have their tax offset by an extra $200 on top of established offsets. Those earning between $37,001 and $47,999 will receive a tapered reduction up to a maximum of $530 a year, while those earning between $48,000 and $90,000 will receive the maximum offset of $530. The average Australian wage is $84,600 and people earning that would be considered in the top 25% of Australian income earners. “For middle-income households, with both parents working on average wages, this will boost their ‘kitchen table’ budget by more than $1,000 every year,” Morrison said in his speech. Those earning more than $90,000 will receive a tapered tax offset of up to $125,000 – meaning the more they earn the less they will receive as an offset. The tax savings won’t be found in pay packets each week, with the intention that the offset be used as tax returns are being filed. Someone who reduces his or her taxable income to zero but still has some low and middle-income tax offset available will not get the remainder as a refund. Morrison said funding for the government’s plan would not be “clawed back by other tax increases”, remaining committed to maintaining the Medicare levy at its current level. It is the first of a three-step, seven-year plan the government intends on legislating, with the second step to cleave back bracket creep, first by raising the 32.5% tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000 from 1 July 2018. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Beyond that, the government has flagged further threshold changes in 2022-23, which is when the $37,000 bracket is earmarked to lift to $41,000, and the $90,000 threshold would be raised, again, to $120,000. From there, Morrison has planned some of Australia’s biggest tax changes, with a proposal to abolish the 37% tax bracket in its entirety from July 2024, meaning all Australians earning from $41,000 up to $200,000 will pay a flat tax rate of 32.5%. That would put 94% of workers in the same tax bracket, with the high-income earners on more than $200,000 paying the top marginal tax rate of 45%. It is an idea that has gained favour with conservative US thinktanks in recent years. Morrison said it was part of a plan to make the nation’s tax system “simpler”. “Australians earning more than $41,000 will only pay 32.5c in the dollar all the way up to the top marginal tax rate threshold, which will be adjusted to $200,000, to account for inflation and expected wage movements over the next seven years,” he said in his budget speech. “Under the Turnbull government’s personal tax plan, most working Australians earning above $41,000 are likely to never face a higher marginal tax rate through their entire working life.” The plan extends beyond the budget forward estimates and into two election cycles. “This is not spending or a giveaway,” Morrison said. “We are simply enabling Australians to keep more of what they have earned. “Everyone pays the price of higher taxes. It weakens the economy and costs jobs. You don’t have to punish some people with higher taxes, who are already paying the majority of tax, to give others tax relief.” The plan enables the government to signal to higher income earners they will receive relief down the track, while also reassuring its base it remains committed to wider tax reform. But it is also likely to provide Labor with further ammunition in its “fairness” crusade against the government, as the opposition seeks to highlight inequality between Australia’s earners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/08/man-who-let-son-teenage-take-blame-for-jailed-for-at-least-26-years","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:21:26Z","webTitle":"Man who let son take blame for murder jailed for at least 26 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/man-who-let-son-teenage-take-blame-for-jailed-for-at-least-26-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/man-who-let-son-teenage-take-blame-for-jailed-for-at-least-26-years","fields":{"headline":"Man who let son take blame for murder jailed for at least 26 years","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A father who pressured his 14-year-old son to take the blame for a murder he committed has been jailed for at least 26 years. Matthew Moseley, 50, shot dead Lee Holt, 32, before he handed the semi-automatic shotgun to his son, Thomas, and told him to falsely confess to the shooting. Moseley stayed silent as the teenager was arrested and led away in handcuffs from their home near Accrington, Lancashire, last October. The teenager later changed his account and told police that his father fired the shot. Moseley, a keen clay pigeon shooter who lawfully kept 23 guns at his home, maintained his innocence but was found guilty of murder by a jury at Preston crown court last week. On Tuesday he was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 26 years. The shooting on Moseley’s doorstep in Oswaldtwistle was the result of a dispute between Thomas and Holt’s partner’s 15-year-old son, the trial heard. Holt and his partner, Kate Phelan, 34, were seen banging on the front windows and door of Moseley’s home to sort out the dispute as her son, Wesley Metcalfe, looked on. Thomas told police he saw his father bend down by his gun cabinet, load a semi-automatic Beretta and shoot Holt from up to 10ft away as the front door opened. Holt was taken to hospital but died hours later from a single gunshot wound to the chest. Moseley, a tree surgeon, maintained during the trial that it was his son who pulled the trigger despite being covertly recorded pressing Thomas to take the blame. In a recording taken of the father and son as they were driven to court, Moseley was heard to say: “At the end of the day, Thomas, they have come down the drive. They were going to kill you ... it was just a freak accident. You did what you did.” Asked during the trial what he was referring to, Moseley said: “He defended himself basically.” In the same recorded conversation, Moseley later says: “Come here, I will sort it. If I have to take the blame then they will let you out tonight.” Asked what he meant by that, Moseley said: “He did not deserve to be there because he has put up with enough ... bullying. He defended himself. It was an accident.” DCI Jill Johnston, of Lancashire police, said Moseley had shown no remorse for his actions and had allowed his own son “to go through the ordeal of being arrested and questioned by the police, for something which all along he knew he had done”. She added: “If that wasn’t wicked enough, he then also pressurised the boy to take responsibility for a crime that he hadn’t committed and told the court during the trial that he was innocent and that the boy had fired the fatal shot.” Passing sentence, Mr Justice Bryan told the defendant: “How any father could do that to their son is difficult enough to comprehend but what is truly incomprehensible is the cynical way in which you sought to manipulate, and pressurise, your son into accepting responsibility for the shooting and death of Lee Holt.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"Uber’s self-driving car saw the pedestrian but didn’t swerve – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report","fields":{"headline":"Uber’s self-driving car saw the pedestrian but didn’t swerve – report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An Uber self-driving test car which killed a woman crossing the street detected her but decided not to react immediately, a report has said. The car was travelling at 40mph (64km/h) in self-driving mode when it collided with 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg at about 10pm on 18 March. Herzberg was pushing a bicycle across the road outside of a crossing. She later died from her injuries. Although the car’s sensors detected Herzberg, its software which decides how it should react was tuned too far in favour of ignoring objects in its path which might be “false positives” (such as plastic bags), according to a report from the Information. This meant the modified Volvo XC90 did not react fast enough. The report also said the human safety driver was not paying close enough attention to intervene before the vehicle struck the pedestrian. Arizona suspended Uber’s self-driving vehicle testing after the incident. The company later settled with Herzberg’s family. Uber and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the incident. Uber has already reached its preliminary conclusion, according to the report. A comprehensive NTSB report is expected later. “We’re actively cooperating with the NTSB in their investigation. Out of respect for that process and the trust we’ve built with NTSB, we can’t comment on the specifics of the incident,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. “In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles programme, and we have brought on former NTSB chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture. Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon.” The collision marked the first fatality attributed to a self-driving car, the development of which has frequently been labelled as the only way to eliminate road deaths for those inside and outside the car. The incident was not the first controversy to involve Uber’s self-driving efforts, which the company sees as key to its survival as a ride-sharing or taxi firm. The company has been involved in a long-running battle with former Google self-driving car outfit Waymo over theft of technology around Anthony Levandowski. Uber’s self-driving technology was also called 5,000 times worse than Waymo’s in an independent analysis in 2017, while it has had legal tussles with various US states where it has tried to test vehicles.

As in Visitors, Eventide and Echo’s End, Norris shows himself expert at dealing with love and loss in a deeply English rural setting. But, much as I liked the play and its added element of social rage, I felt it would have benefited from a more intimate staging than this handsome new venue can provide. In one sense, the play justifies the epic space: an oil pipe runs across the stage of the wilting Hampshire farm, vividly realised in Rae Smith’s design, in which the action takes place. The pipe is crucial to the plot since the play opens with Ryan, who has taken over the farm since his father’s death, aiding his mate, Pete, in illegally siphoning off oil: in desperate times, corporate property is being put to private use. Ryan’s mother, Jenny, still poleaxed by grief after her husband’s death, is appalled at the theft. She is even more horrified when her daughter, Lou, threatens to desert her to marry Pete. As she roundly tells him, “You’re trying to pull my family apart.” Students of Chekhov will be quick to recognise familiar themes. Since the only hope for the debt-ridden farm is a property company’s plan to build 20 new houses on the land, we are clearly in Cherry Orchard country. There is even a hint of Uncle Vanya in Norris’s stress on the need for stoic endurance in times of trouble. As in any Russian play or novel, characters are unafraid to philosophise about their fate. Lou has one particularly poignant speech, in which she dwells on the way youthful dreams and hopes are crushed by quotidian reality: “I never had time,” she claims “to think about how to be happy.” Norris, however, is stronger on character than on plot. Much the best scene is one in which Lou is confronted by a spontaneous marriage proposal from Pete: even though her initial response is an incredulous “Fuck off”, you feel the tremulous excitement of two young people on the verge of radical change. Norris also shows how Jenny’s shock at her husband’s death turns into a warped possessiveness. But too much narrative information, such as the reason why Pete has spent a year in jail, is held back until late in the piece. Good as Laurie Sansom’s production is on psychological detail, words sometimes get lost on the Bridge’s big stage. There is, however, no question about the quality of some fine performances. Claire Skinner is superb as Jenny. Shadowed by bereavement, she combines a feckless disregard for the farm’s future with a manipulative cunning when it comes to hanging on to her two children. Ophelia Lovibond’s body language as Lou conveys perfectly the confusion of a young woman aching for escape from a routine job and a derelict farm. Sion Daniel Young as Ryan and Ukweli Roach as Pete catch the troubled nature of an unequal male friendship. Even if it would have gained from being seen in a studio theatre, there is much to relish in Norris’s poignant study of rural decay and desperation. • At the Bridge theatre, London, until 26 May.

McLean’s best-known song has become too ubiquitous for some, but if he’s ever done a concert since without playing it, it isn’t going to be this one. “I may get lost in my reverie, but I will keep my statutory responsibilities,” he says, prompting knowing waves of applause. The singer-songwriter is 72, his tenor has darkened a little and has a slightly shouty timbre in the upbeat moments, but he has the energy for a two-hour show in which his hero Holly’s Everyday still features. McLean introduces one of his great, early songs And I Love You So with a story about how, aged 25, he was so angry when his first album was rejected “by 20 record companies” that he threw the tapes out in the snow. “And here we are, 47 years later.” Hearing his young self’s thoughts coming from him now is undeniably moving. McLean has had a tough time lately. The breakdown of his almost 30-year marriage led to a widely reported incident where his wife called the police and took out a restraining order, but then in his defence informed the media that “Don is not a monster”. He always was an emotional character, and McLean’s best work is deeply sentimental without quite becoming mawkish. Winterwood, about appreciating nature and a former partner after a breakup, is one such example. Crossroads, a 1971 song about a man’s humbling admission of his flaws, is another. He touches an eye during the line: “That was never our defeat, as long as we could walk together.” The mood lightens with quips (“I hope I don’t have an aneurysm up here”) and a stream of country rockers. The Lucky Guy comes from his new album, Botanical Gardens, but McLean’s music has barely changed since American Pie. “I mix popular song with rock’n’roll and folk. I don’t understand who Kanye West is,” he explains, adding, a trifle unnecessarily: “All ego and no talent.” There are cheers as he jokes: “That goes a long way – ask our president. Only kidding.” Ray Charles’s bluesy I’m Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town gets toes tapping and Johnny Horton’s Got the Bull By the Horns is rendered Jerry Lee Lewis style, but there are too many sedately paced rock’n’roll era covers. Still, McLean’s own Castles in the Air is lovely, and hearing him sing Vincent – his youthful eulogy to Van Gogh – is magical, a bucket-list moment. No one here minds much that in places during American Pie he’s all but drowned out by the band. It turns into a sing-song marathon, and one chap is escorted away after simulating the act of prayer at the singer’s feet. At the Palladium, London, on 9 May. Box office: 020-7087 7747.

His single Walkin’ was calculated to contain 4.45 words per second; unofficially beating record-holder Eminem, whose Rap God had 4.31 words per second. While MC Harry Shotta has since trumped both artists, tonight remains a potent display of Wisdom’s word-stuffed, syllable-packed style. The opening track, Don, bounces to life with a drum’n’bass-flavoured beat as Wisdom’s rapid-fire technique fills the room. The following Brick or Bat is one of the many moments of the evening that merges Wisdom’s distinctly British lyrical sensibility and technique with music rooted in a clear love of old-school US hip-hop. The loop-heavy beat rolls along smoothly, almost at odds with the tone of the lyrics: “Smash a little prick, hurt a little prat / When I hit ’em with a brick or hit ’em with a bat.” The melodic construct of the lines work together so harmoniously it’s almost like a twisted nursery rhyme. Despite Wisdom’s clear volubility and his ability to spit words at head-spinning speeds, he thankfully understands the power of restraint, too. He holds back his words and lets the genre-spanning music do the work when necessary or, with the DJ, teases the audience, making exaggerated rewinds to take tracks back to the beginning just as the crowd are about to erupt into sweat-saturated euphoria. I Ain’t Eaten is another shift in genre, touching on grime with its gut-punching bass but with a twist of wonky jungle rhythm driving it forward. Deebo is propped up by a stark yet fizzing beat, the perfect backdrop as Wisdom’s words gush forth like a dam opening its floodgates. Closer Walkin’ explodes through the speakers as the room thrashes, and pouncing bodies move along to the crunching beat.

Now he comes to the Critics Week sidebar of Cannes with this well-turned, well-tuned oddity, that brings Erlingsson’s career as a feature director to its Difficult Second Album moment. It is confidently and rather stylishly made, with the same eccentric poise that distinguished his equine success, and the same sweeping sense of landscape. There is a very good performance from Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir as Halla, a fortysomething choir conductor. Erlingsson shows a great flair for ideas, scenes, tableaux. But is it all encumbered with quirkiness? Is the quirk-imperative something that weighs it down? What Woman at War has above all is a terrific premise; and by that token, a terrific opening scene. Halla is a secret guerrilla eco-activist who is campaigning against the energy corporations that are moving into Iceland. To protest, she sneaks out into the countryside and sabotages electricity pylons in remote areas – the hated pylons that are despoiling the landscape – using cordless circular saws to slice through the girders, and a bow-and-arrow to shoot disruptive cables over the power lines. (These scenes are not unlike those in Of Horses and Men where barbed-wire fences are cut in the course of a neighbours’ dispute.) It is spectacular, dangerous work. No one would suspect the mousy Halla, and the cops keep detaining a suspicious-looking male tourist. Halla is obviously passionately committed to a campaign that might end in electrocution, death or imprisonment – or in the hated corporate raiders being driven away from Iceland and Halla becoming a national heroine. But then one day she comes home to find a letter from the authorities: her application to adopt an orphan Ukrainian baby, made some years ago and all but forgotten, has been approved. Halla is to be a mum. And the weird truth dawns simultaneously on her and the audience. Has this eco-campaign merely been a displacement activity for her thwarted maternal instincts? Will she sheepishly admit to herself that she doesn’t much feel like bringing down electricity pylons now? Another, more conventionally minded comedy might devote itself to the gradual fading of Halla’s radical enthusiasm as she gets nappies and toys ready for the new arrival from Ukraine. But Erlingsson is much quirkier and wackier than that; the police and security services become deadly serious about tracking the culprit down, giving the film the occasional look of a thriller, and things are complicated further with a twin sister for Halla (played by the same actor), a hippy-dippy woman called Ása who is preparing to go out to an Indian ashram, and whose twin status later furnishes a species of plot twist. There is also a lot of Icelandic folk music from a tuba, accordion and drums trio, and a rather beautiful singing group, whose performances turn out to be diegetic. That is, the camera pans around to show the musicians themselves, standing weirdly, incongruously in the background of the shot, variously trilling or parping away. It is a comic effect that is a bit distracting, subject to diminishing returns, and which ironises and undermines the action and obstructs your natural tendency to invest emotionally in Halla’s dilemma. But it is an attractive and sympathetic performance from Geirharðsdóttir as Halla: a woman with a fierce and focused energy who has mysteriously concentrated all her efforts on an environmental campaign, but comes, perhaps, to see that there is no contradiction between pursuing that and wanting to be a mother."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/08/australias-refugee-deal-a-farce-after-us-rejects-all-iranian-and-somali-asylum-seekers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T06:54:15Z","webTitle":"Australia's refugee deal 'a farce' after US rejects all Iranian and Somali asylum seekers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australias-refugee-deal-a-farce-after-us-rejects-all-iranian-and-somali-asylum-seekers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/australias-refugee-deal-a-farce-after-us-rejects-all-iranian-and-somali-asylum-seekers","fields":{"headline":"Australia's refugee deal 'a farce' after US rejects all Iranian and Somali asylum seekers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s Muslim travel ban is influencing Australia’s offshore processing system – with all Iranian and Somali refugees rejected for resettlement in the US. The third version of Donald Trump’s travel ban bars or limits entry to citizens of five Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen – as well as North Korea. The ban’s constitutionality is currently being considered by the supreme court but is currently in effect. About 150 refugees held in offshore processing on the island of Nauru have appointments with US officials this week, where they will discover final assessments of whether they have been accepted by America. So far, every Iranian and Somali applicant has been rejected. At least one refugee has attempted suicide after being rejected. An Iranian woman had to be rescued from the sea near Ijuw late on Monday night after being told she could not go to the US. “Everyone is just thinking they have no hope,” one refugee told the Guardian by phone. “I have seen small children so distressed, a 12-year-old girl crying she is a like widow, asking what will happen to her life.” The ABF has escalated its presence on Nauru for this week’s meetings and stepped up the security around the camps and the island settlements. Iranian refugee Shahriar Hatami said the environment across the island was disruptive and distressed. “Highly security environment again spread everywhere. In our camp a deadly [silence] is dominant.” On Manus Island, the refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani said all Iranians and Somalis were fearful they would be rejected. “There is huge worry in Nauru &amp; Manus about US deal,” he wrote. “Many Iranian &amp; Somali refugees in Nauru given rejection notices from US. It means US considers the countries banned. Its time for that the Home Affairs minister takes responsibility &amp; makes his plan clear.” The Australian government has promoted the US resettlement deal as its solution to offshore processing but, for more than a year, it has conceded that the US deal cannot clear the camps. Thus far, 85 refugees have been resettled from Manus and 162 from Nauru. US officials hope to finalise the resettlement deal by October, when its annual resettlement quota restarts. More than 500 refugees are expected to be left on the island of Nauru even if the US fulfils its entire commitment of 1,250 places. Only a handful of refugees have been resettled in Papua New Guinea and the Nauru government has consistently refused to permanently resettle any refugees. Both the PNG and Nauru governments have consistently maintained those refugees not accepted for resettlement remain the responsibility of Australia. “It’s Australia’s responsibility to move them out,” the PNG prime minister, Peter O’Neill, said. The Nauruan president, Baron Waqa, said: “They can’t stay on Nauru forever, we’ve made that clear right from the start.” Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said the US resettlement had been “revealed to be a farce”. “Iranian refugees account for around a third of all refugees on Nauru,” he said. “It is just not possible for all Iranians to be rejected on any legitimate basis. “While Trump says there is no official ban on Iranians and Somalis, it is now very clear that the US administration is imposing an unofficial ban. It is not a coincidence that all Iranians are being rejected. “Turnbull’s phone call to Trump is coming back to haunt him. Turnbull told Trump that he didn’t have to accept anyone; now Trump is taking him at his word.” Over the past five years, Australia has approached dozens of countries – including Kyrgyzstan – offering millions of dollars and other inducements in exchange for resettling some refugees from Australia’s camps. But the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said this week there were no “third country” resettlement options beyond the US and the Cambodian deal, which has resettled only two refugees at a cost of more than $40m. New Zealand has a standing offer to resettle 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore islands every year but this has been rejected by the government as a “back door” to Australia. “We will continue to look at third-country arrangements,” Dutton said. “Believe me, Dfat, our department have been working on this for a number of years. People aren’t jumping out of their skin to provide places and that’s the reality.” Australia has effective control of, and ultimate authority over, the offshore processing system, and legal responsibility for the welfare of those held within it. Of acute concern on Nauru at present is the mental health of children. Three pre-teenaged children have been moved off the island following repeated suicide attempts but only after court action in Australian courts to have them moved. Australia has opposed their removal, in defiance of the recommendations of doctors, in two of the three cases. A Nauru government employee, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said their officials were powerless to assist refugees rejected or in need of advanced health care. “We are only a bunch of puppet. This is like colonisation again. Australia treat us like we are property. They have all the money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/08/horse-racing-doping-scandal-eight-found-guilty-of-taking-part-in-aquanita-conspiracy","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T07:35:33Z","webTitle":"Horse-racing doping scandal: eight found guilty of taking part in Aquanita 'conspiracy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/08/horse-racing-doping-scandal-eight-found-guilty-of-taking-part-in-aquanita-conspiracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/08/horse-racing-doping-scandal-eight-found-guilty-of-taking-part-in-aquanita-conspiracy","fields":{"headline":"Horse-racing doping scandal: eight found guilty of taking part in Aquanita 'conspiracy'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Eight people have been found guilty of taking part in a doping “conspiracy” that the Racing Appeals and Disciplinary Board has dubbed “probably the biggest scandal and the most widespread investigation in the history of Australian racing”. The five trainers and three stable hands, including the former director of Aquanita, Robert Smerdon, were found guilty of involvement in a doping ring that used sodium bicarbonate or other alkalising agents to “top up” horses before a race. Alkalising agents are used to counter the buildup of lactic acids and delay the onset of lactic acids, giving horses “a 1% edge.” In a decision handed down on Tuesday, the disciplinary board said it was “comfortably satisfied” that all eight accused were involved in what it described as a “long-running systematic conspiracy to try and obtain an unfair advantage in well over a 100 races over seven years”. “The Aquanita case represents one of the darkest and longest chapters in the history of the Australian turf,” the board said. “There is a litany of brazen attempts to cheat and to obtain an unfair advantage over many years by a well-organised team.” Trainers Smerdon, Liam Birchley, Tony Vasil, Stuart Webb and Trent Pennuto, drivers Gregory Nelligan and Daniel Garland, and stable hand Denise Nelligan were charged in January. Together, they faced 271 charges, most of which were under section 175 (a) of the Australian rules of racing against “dishonest, corrupt, fraudulent, improper or dishonourable action”. All pleaded not guilty, either explicitly or by failing to formally register a plea, and only Birchley actually attended the hearing and gave evidence. The charges arose out of an incident on 7 October 2017, when Gregory Nelligan, a float driver for Aquanita, was caught inserting a syringe containing the “top up” mixture into the mouth of racehorse Lovani at Flemington racecourse. Investigators seized his phone and identified 1,000 messages they said related to the use of “top-ups” and identified the other seven people charged. Smerdon and Nelligan were also found guilty of other charges, including applying Vicks VapoRub to a horse named Disco Dan at Bendigo racetrack in 2010. Vicks is believed to allow a horse to take in more oxygen during the race but there is no scientific evidence that it works. In an 11-page judgment, the disciplinary board said Nelligan was “the architect and, to some extent, the promoter of the ‘top-ups’ scheme” and was involved in the use of “top-ups” on 123 occasions, at the request of Smerdon or other trainers. Smerdon, the board said, was involved in 115 occasions when “top-ups” were administered and was the “driving force” along with Nelligan, who was “considerably lower down the chain of command”. Smerdon stood down as a director of Aquanita as a result of the scandal, and the company has since rebadged as Neerim Lodge. The board said that the claim by Smerdon and others that the phrase “top-up” used in the text messages referred to feed and water was “palpable nonsense”. Addressing the charges against Birchley, the board said: “Incidentally, any suggestion that ‘top-ups’ are feed and water is well and truly laid to rest by the suggestion that Gregory Nelligan could carry them in his pockets.” Birchley was described by the board as a non-paying customer of “top-ups” on three occasions between 2011 and 2015. He has already said he would appeal the decision. The chief executive of Racing Victoria, Giles Thompson, said the guilty verdicts send “a very strong signal to anyone who thinks they can undermine the integrity of the sport by actively breaching the rules of racing”. “It also is a ringing endorsement of the investigative work of our integrity services team who found these breaches and ran an exhaustive four-month investigation before laying charges against these eight people,” Thompson said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/prisoners-vote-elections-right-democrats-take-stand","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T14:39:18Z","webTitle":"It's time to let US prisoners vote.

Democrats should take a stand","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Republicans get control of government, they typically push through electoral reforms that make it easier for them to remain in power. They pass voter identification laws, limit early voting and reduce the number of polling places. In all cases, these moves are meant to reshape an area’s voting population so that it is more likely to deliver Republican election victories. You might think Democrats do the same kinds of things, but strangely they don’t. Democratic election reform politics tends to focus either on mostly failed defensive campaigns against Republican encroachments or harsh rhetoric against the corrupting influence of money in politics. These Democratic efforts are fine, but also woefully insufficient. To really maximize their potential for success, Democrats need to take affirmative steps to expand the vote to as many favorable constituencies as they can. One way Democrats could do this is by adopting the principled position that no adult citizen should ever be disenfranchised, not even those who have committed crimes and are currently incarcerated. Rather than fighting a somewhat arbitrary battle over when exactly ex-offenders should have their voting rights restored, the Democratic position should be that those voting rights should never go away in the first place. On first glance, this might seem like a radical proposal, but it is in fact the norm across most of Europe. In a report released by People’s Policy Project on Tuesday, Emmett Sanders explains that “26 European nations at least partially protect their incarcerated citizens’ right to vote, while 18 countries grant prisoners the vote regardless of the offense”. Indeed, the European Court of Human Rights has even declared that blanket bans on prisoner voting rights constitute a human rights violation. Of course, it is not just Europe that allows prisoners to vote. Although 48 US states and the District of Columbia currently restrict the voting rights of incarcerated people, Maine and Vermont do not. Thus, it is not as if incarcerated voting is without precedent in the country or totally alien to American culture. Enfranchising the 1.5 million people sitting in our jails and prisons will not, by itself, deliver progressive change in the country. But, given who makes up our prison population – mostly young, lower-class men and especially non-white men – expanding voting rights would move the dial in that direction. As we saw in 2000 and 2016, elections are often won by the slimmest of margins, meaning even slight changes in the composition of the electorate could pay massive dividends. Beyond the narrow electoral benefits, voting rights for prisoners also serves a number of other emerging left-of-center priorities. Movements like Black Lives Matter have forced the country to reckon with the brutal and biased nature of the US criminal justice system while organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America have gone as far as to demand the abolition of prisons themselves. Both are tapping into a desire on the left to lock up fewer people and treat offenders more humanely than we currently do. Voting rights for incarcerated people can serve as a jumping off point for these anti-carceral goals, just as drives for voting rights did during the civil rights movement. As Sanders argues in his report, extending the franchise to prisoners is a way of declaring that they are full human beings, especially in a democratic society where the ability to vote establishes the civic equality of all people. To be sure, a proposal to enfranchise all citizens, including those who have committed heinous crimes, is likely to be unpopular at the moment and probably will be for some time. But campaigns for fundamental social change are always unpopular at first and must start somewhere. In the near term, politicians interested in such an idea would not need to make it a central plank of their platform any more than Republicans’ campaign on voter ID laws. It would be sufficient to run an ordinary campaign on bread and butter issues and then push for the reforms once in office, leaving the responsibility of cultural transformation in the hands of activists and other social influencers.

Today I'd speak up","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After finishing my undergraduate degree, I lived for a few months in a small terraced house in what was then a rundown part of Sydney. Next door lived a couple with young children. It wasn’t long before we noticed a pattern of violence once a week – shouting and crying, and sometimes, when things got really bad, a police car arriving at the house. This was usually on Friday nights, when the man of the house came home late and drunk. I had grown up in a fairly sheltered family environment in a leafy suburb in that same city. I found this experience of violence confronting – obviously nowhere near as confronting as it must have been for the woman and the children next door. What could I do to help? Was there any way to stop it? I’d see her on the street, smile at her, pretend we knew nothing. I was only young then. I wouldn’t do that now. I’d seen violence at university, of course. Drunk boys punching one another, fighting over minor things when alcohol clouded their judgment. Drunk boys who would make unwelcome advances to women. Drunk boys who’d been socialised into believing that men could settle differences with their fists. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Living in such close proximity to that weekly eruption of violence in the cramped little terrace house next to ours made me wonder what might have been happening behind the closed doors of houses in the suburb where I’d been raised. I had already learned when I was young that not all marriages were happy, and that many survived only because there was no easy way of getting out. So what went on when the blinds were closed and the curtains drawn? Would we ever have known if someone was getting knocked around in one of those detached houses? Probably not. Thinking about these questions led me to decide one day that I would write about middle-class domestic violence. But before I began I wanted to investigate how widespread was this was, and if literature had anything to say on the topic. As a social scientist as well as a novelist, I’m interested in statistics, and it seems there is plenty of information available about the extent of domestic violence. In Australia, one in six women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence by someone known to them. Over 12 months, on average a woman is killed every week by a current or former partner. These are staggering statistics. Yet I found it difficult to find any information about how the pattern of domestic violence was distributed across the affluent and the less affluent, the middle and the working classes. This is in spite of the fact that more women from all backgrounds are standing up against sexual violence, and it is being widely reported in the media, with the #MeToo movement and every week new revelations about violent middle-class men. I went searching for more information from academics and psychotherapists such as Susan Weitzman who work in this field. The general consensus is that abuse in middle-class households is still under-reported for a variety of reasons, partly relating to social mores and partly relating to how statistics are collected. The guilt or shame that many abuse survivors feel is especially prevalent among the more affluent, who have been conditioned to believe it’s a lower-income problem associated with the stress of poverty. But poverty isn’t the only correlate of domestic abuse. Perhaps the belief that domestic violence is a lower-income problem has arisen because poorer women are more likely than their richer counterparts to access refuges and social services that target abuse survivors. In contrast, affluent survivors are not only more able to afford to take privately financed routes out of an abusive relationship, but are also more able to afford a good lawyer. Hence information about wealthier abused survivors is not collected – or is under-reported – by service-providers, and fewer police call-outs or restraining orders for domestic violence incidents are recorded. What does literature have to say about the phenomenon? Working-class domestic violence is a common theme in modern literature, as anyone who reads fiction will know, but there is very little that covers middle-class domestic violence. Of course, there are exceptions, some novels that address this head on, such as Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies. But if, as Margaret Atwood once said, novels exist not just for private expression but also for social examination, there clearly is more to be said on the subject. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

It’s an extreme version of the low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet – which trains the body to run on fat rather than carbohydrates – that has become popular in recent years. Proponents of the diet say it reduces inflammation and blood pressure while increasing libido and mental clarity. Baker, who is nicknamed the “Carnivore King” and has amassed a cult following on social media, says the diet is easy because he doesn’t have to plan meals or count calories. “I just have to think: how hungry am I and how many steaks do I want to eat,” he said. Before becoming a pure carnivore, Baker was also eating salads, spinach, dairy and nuts. Ditching these plant-based foods has been transformative for his body and athletic performance, he says. “My joint pain and tendinitis went away, my sleep became excellent, my skin improved. I no longer had any bloating, cramping or other digestive problems, my libido went back to what it was in my 20s and my blood pressure normalised,” he said. Although most medical practitioners balk at the idea of their patients ditching fruit and vegetables, the all-meat diet has been embraced by a cluster of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, who describe themselves as “bitcoin carnivores”, a phenomenon previously reported by Motherboard. “Bitcoin is a revolt against fiat [government-backed] money, and an all-meat diet is a revolt against fiat food,” said Michael Goldstein, a “bitcoin and meat maximalist” based in Austin, Texas. “Once someone has grown capable of seeing beyond the lies and myths that experts peddle in one domain, it becomes easier to see beyond them in other domains as well.” Goldstein, who runs a website dedicated to carnivory called Justmeat.co, eats 2-2.5lb of “very rare” rib-eye steak each day, at a cost of about $400 a month. He says he never has cravings for pizza, chocolate or vegetables. “They don’t even register in my brain as food.” He argues that eating only meat has freed up his time to get more work done. “Grocery shopping takes all of 10 minutes, most of which is standing in the checkout line. I spend little time thinking about food. I only need to eat once or twice a day (no snacking or cravings). Basically, it’s the greatest productivity hack, and Silicon Valley should have listened to me about it while I was there.” Saifedean Ammous, a bitcoin economist, agrees, citing a “huge improvement” in productivity. “The ability to focus for long periods has been life transforming, and was the reason that I managed to write a 300-page book, on bitcoin, fittingly enough!” he said. Lily Chien-Davis, a social media specialist at San Francisco-based startup Heads Up Health, says that the enhanced productivity and mental clarity explains why this diet, like intermittent fasting, is popular in Silicon Valley. She started eating a very low carb diet when her husband was diagnosed with cancer – some studies indicate that a ketogenic diet can help the body fight tumours. However, Chien-Davis found that changing her eating habits alleviated her pre-diabetes. In February, she switched to a carnivore diet. “In 30 days my mood improved, I got stronger. It gave me extra energy and performance,” she said, adding that it also helped her come off her medication for bipolar disorder. “My friends all are curious about whether I have scurvy or have problems pooping. But I’ve been more regular than ever!” The most challenging aspect of the diet is socialising with non-carnivores, said Ammous. “Many carnivores encounter hostility,” he said. “It’s quite startling that when I used to eat junk food all the time, nobody ever got offended or worried by my diet, but they can get really agitated when I tell them I don’t think plants are good for me!” Chien-Davis agrees: “You feel like a weirdo when you tell people about it, people are like ‘oh my God you are crazy’.” Those who publicly discuss their adherence to the carnivore diet find themselves clashing online with vegans over their dietary choices. Travis Statham, a New York-based software engineer and admin for several online communities dedicated to carnivory, will sometimes eat four to six quarter-pounder burger patties from McDonald’s for lunch. In Statham’s view, vegans who are concerned about the slaughtering of cows are not thinking about the “monoculture of giant machines killing mice and other animals” in the fields used to grow crops, the displacement of wild animals that used to occupy farm land, or the spraying of herbicides and pesticides. Baker, who regularly mocks vegans on his Instagram account, said that contrary to his posts, “most vegans are wonderful people trying to do the best thing”. He said that people who eat a vegan diet for health, rather than ethical reasons are good candidates for the carnivore diet. “If your personality allows you to be extreme on a vegan diet you may be just as willing to do a carnivorous diet,” he said. Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, is less convinced by the evidence. “Are these T rex? African lions? Or humans? Assuming [you are referring to] humans, this sounds disastrous on multiple levels,” he said. The lack of dietary fibre in an all-meat diet is likely to wreak havoc on the bacteria in our colons, known as the microbiome, he said. “Growing evidence suggests that in the absence of adequate fibre, the bacteria in the colon consume and thin the protective mucus lining, which then leads to impaired immune function and inflammation.” Eating more meat also contributes to a rise in a substance called trimethylamine N-oxide in the blood which, according to research by the Cleveland Heart Lab, may be as bad for heart disease as saturated fat and elevated cholesterol. Factory farming of animals is also linked to antibiotic resistance in humans and is a huge contributor to the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. “In summary, I think a ‘carnivore diet’ is inappropriate for human health, bad for the health of our planet, abusive of the human labour force that handles the preparation of meat, abusive of animal rights and welfare,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/07/airbnb-black-guests-california-police-helicopter","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T01:09:38Z","webTitle":"Airbnb: police helicopter targets black guests after neighbor fears burglars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/07/airbnb-black-guests-california-police-helicopter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/07/airbnb-black-guests-california-police-helicopter","fields":{"headline":"Airbnb: police helicopter targets black guests after neighbor fears burglars","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police in California sent a helicopter and a squad of cars to detain a group of black friends leaving an Airbnb after a neighbor called 911 and reported them as possible burglars.

Three friends were leaving an Airbnb rental on the afternoon of 30 April in Rialto, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, when, they said, a group of police cars quickly surrounded them and told them to put their hands up. “They informed us that there was also a helicopter tracking us. They locked down the neighborhood and had us standing in the street,” Kelly Fyffe-Marshall, a film-maker, wrote on Facebook, where she also published videos and photos of the police. “At first we joked about the misunderstanding,” she said, but added that “it escalated almost instantly”. The Rialto police lieutenant Dean Hardin told the Guardian that a neighbor, whom he described as an elderly white woman, called police because she “didn’t recognize the vehicle or the people” and saw them loading a car with suitcases. The department responded to a potential “in-progress residential burglary”, dispatching six cars and a helicopter, he said. Police said in a statement that officers “immediately established a perimeter while the people drove away. During the course of the 22-minute encounter, police officers determined the people were Airbnb renters and were at the residence as guests.” Fyffe-Marshall said the situation got worse when a sergeant arrived and said he had never heard of Airbnb, the home-sharing company. Hardin said other officers were aware of Airbnb and cleared up the confusion and said the department cancelled the helicopter before it arrived. Though officers detained the group, police did not use restraints and “allowed them to exit their vehicle”, police said. “I’m still trying to fully digest the what, why and how of this,” wrote Donisha Prendergast, another woman in the car who is also a film-maker and a granddaughter of the singer-songwriter Bob Marley. “I also am deeply meditating on the why not. Why this should not have happened. Why they should not have reacted with such unnecessary force … Why this is not a simple misunderstanding. Why this neighbour who was so fearful without any justified reason, should not have the power to potentially destroy another life because of the color of her skin.” Fyffe-Marshall’s post added: “We have been dealing with different emotions and you want to laugh about this but it’s not funny. The trauma is real.” Similar stories of racial profiling have sparked national backlash in recent weeks. Black Americans have faced law enforcement calls and in some cases arrests and police violence while patronizing a Starbucks, a gym, a golf course and a Waffle House. In New York City, a black former White House staffer said he faced police while moving into a new apartment building after a resident reported an “active burglary”. Last week, police in Colorado also removed two Native American teenagers on a college campus tour after a parent called 911 saying they looked like “they don’t belong”. Officers in two recent California cases killed unarmed young black men while responding to calls to police. The Rialto incident occurred years after the #AirbnbWhileBlack hashtag went viral, with black users of the service sharing stories of racial discrimination, including hosts refusing to rent their homes to them, then accepting white guests. Rialto police have not named the 911 caller but did name the three people in the car they stopped, in a press release issued Monday. The department also said the Airbnb rental in this case was “unlicensed”, but did not provide further details. Airbnb did not respond to an inquiry about the status of the rental but said in a statement that the company had “reached out to the victims of this terrible incident to express our sympathy and full support”, adding that although the neighbor who called police was not an Airbnb user, “what happened to our Guests is unconscionable and a reminder of how far we still have to go as a society”. The women who posted about the incident did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Hardin defended the police department’s response, saying officers had no choice but to show up and investigate the burglary report: “We thought our officers acted professionally and the situation was handled appropriately.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/11/time-to-eradicate-htlv-1-world-health-organisation-is-warned","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T22:30:25Z","webTitle":"Time to eradicate HTLV-1, World Health Organisation is warned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/11/time-to-eradicate-htlv-1-world-health-organisation-is-warned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/11/time-to-eradicate-htlv-1-world-health-organisation-is-warned","fields":{"headline":"Time to eradicate HTLV-1, World Health Organisation is warned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A coalition of the world’s foremost scientists, activists and researchers has written to the World Health Organisation to plead for action to combat the cancer-causing retrovirus HTLV-1, while the federal government is being urged to “show leadership” in dealing with the spread of the virus in central Australia. In an extraordinary move, 60 representatives from 26 countries have signed the letter, telling WHO it is “time to eradicate HTLV-1” and conceding that “our global community has been slow to respond to the HTLV-1 predicament”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The letter, obtained by Guardian Australia and published on Friday by the medical journal the Lancet, points out that an “astounding” 17 prevention strategies have been adopted around the world to reduce the transmission of other blood-borne viruses such as HIV, but only four of a possible 12 are available for the millions of people who have HTLV-1. HTLV-1 affects roughly 20 million people but a lack of awareness and testing mean there could be many more. Guardian Australia has revealed that in five Aboriginal communities around Alice Springs, an estimated 45% of adults tested have the virus, a rate thousands of times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians. Dr Robert Gallo discovered HTLV-1 in 1980. He is the co-founder and director of the Global Virus Network and director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland school of medicine. He wants WHO to develop and promote more up-to-date, evidence-based information on the virus. “We want it to be aware, making recommendations on it, giving it much greater visibility,” Gallo told Guardian Australia. “Visibility leads to greater funding, and greater funding leads to more science, and that solves problems. “I was astounded to learn of the hyper-endemic numbers in the Aboriginal population of Australia. HTLV-1 is endemic in other regions including several islands of the Caribbean, and in countries such as Brazil, Iran, Japan and Peru. “We hope that the WHO will agree with us, and begin to take action in promoting prevention strategies against HTLV-1.” The letter outlines five key strategies WHO could adopt. Key among them is widespread testing. Despite the high prevalence of HTLV-1 in Aboriginal communities, Australia does not yet have a comprehensive testing regimen. Improving access to testing is something Australia should be “working its backside off” to provide, according to the federal member for Lingiari in central Australia, Warren Snowdon. Snowdon is also Labor’s assistant minister for Indigenous health. He told Guardian Australia: “I’m quite shocked by the extent of it, or the potential extent of it. It’d be interesting to know what its coverage really is. But clearly it’s got grave implications for public health, in terms of treatment and access to treatment, access to blood tests at a reasonable price, getting blood tests analysed, getting information back. “It might be focused in central Australia at the moment but I have no doubt that it crosses the WA and SA borders at least. It does require an approach across jurisdictions and it does require national leadership. “That may be nothing more than convening meetings and inviting people with the capacity to set down a framework on how to deal with this, but there’s got to be a process whereby people are brought together.” Most importantly, Snowdon said, the process must involve Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations, which specialise in delivering culturally appropriate primary care and public health messaging in first languages. Donna Ah Chee is the chief executive of Congress, the largest community-controlled health organisation in the country. Ah Chee told Guardian Australia “This could be absolutely devastating for our people, especially given the poor health outcomes experienced by our people generally. The role of Aboriginal people in managing this is critical. “A major problem is that of shame around the transmission of the virus. As any mother in any culture in the world would know, the prospect of unknowingly causing harm to your child through this virus is beyond understanding. For this reason we cannot allow a hysterical response, let alone for it to become yet another item of negative, deficit reporting of our people.” The 60 signatories to the WHO letter would seem to agree. “Words are important,” they write. “We need to change the way we talk about HTLV-1 to increase its visibility.” The WHO vision for tackling HTLV-1 should declare that “our world will become a place where new HTLV infections are very rare and when they do occur, every person regardless of age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or socio-economic circumstances, will have unfettered access to high quality, life-extending care, free from stigma and discrimination”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/08/met-gala-2018-five-things-we-learned-from-the-red-carpet","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T07:47:33Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk is dating Grimes – plus four other things we learned from Met Gala","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/08/met-gala-2018-five-things-we-learned-from-the-red-carpet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/08/met-gala-2018-five-things-we-learned-from-the-red-carpet","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk is dating Grimes – plus four other things we learned from Met Gala","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Elon Musk is dating Grimes Tech billionaire Elon Musk – who recently announced he wanted to start a candy company – and Canadian electropop artist Grimes – whose 2012 song Oblivion was ranked the best song of the decade – are a couple. The unlikely pair publicly announced their relationship on the red carpet on Monday night. Musk wore a white suit and Grimes (real name Claire Boucher) wore a necklace that looked a lot like the Tesla logo. According to the New York Posts’s Page Six, the pair have been together for a month, and first met when Musk messaged Boucher online to reference an AI joke she made three years ago. Two weeks ago, Musk tweeted that he was “just listening” to Boucher’s Spotify playlist Go Flex &amp; Psycho, in a flirtatious exchange that also included rapper Post Malone. “Glad ur finally listening to cyberpunk speedwae hahaha 🐇,” Boucher replied. “Sounds great riding my cyborg 🐉,” Musk said. Men still don’t have to do much With the honourable exception of Chadwick Boseman (more below), men at this year’s event did not put in nearly as much effort into the theme (“Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination”) as the women. For the past three years, musician and actor Nick Jonas seems to have gotten away with adding a mildly relevant pin to a suit. Boseman, the star of Marvel’s Black Panther, was one of the few to really jump aboard the theme, earning praise from (among others) Selma and A Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay. Rihanna is the queen of the Met and will never be toppled “There are very few things the Internet collectively agrees on,” wrote Time Magazine in 2017, “but Robyn Rihanna Fenty is the undisputed queen of the Met Gala”. It is of course not a competition, but Rihanna – dressed this year as a pearl-encrusted Pope, equal parts extravagant and intricate – delivered one of the night’s best outfits for the third consecutive year she’s attended (she skipped 2016). Apologies to rapper Cardi B, whose outfit earned almost as much on-the-night praise. You don’t need a dress to make a statement Writer and actor Lena Waithe struck a blow for those maybe a little uneasy with the explicitly Catholic theme of this year’s event, turning up with a rainbow flag sewn into her blazer. “This is like my skin, I’m proud to be in it,” the Golden Globe-winner told the New York Times. “I’ve got the community on my back to make sure they know I’ve got them all the time ... The theme to me is ‘Be yourself’. You were made in God’s image, right?” 2 Chainz become 1 Finally, Rapper 2 Chainz warmed hearts early on when he used the red carpet opportunity to propose to his girlfriend Kesha Ward on the steps of the Met. The two are actually already engaged – 2 Chainz first proposed to Ward at the BET Awards in 2013 – but the pair have never married. The couple have three children together.

He started lying about where he had been and became defensive when asked questions; knives began going missing from the kitchen and money would turn up in his bedroom. “Odd items started appearing in the house like money and cigarettes – he used to be very anti-smoking. Then he suddenly went missing for more than a week. That’s when things took a turn in a different direction,” Helen says. Tom was eventually found by police, who told Helen her son had been groomed by a gang. From that point on, Tom fell deeper into the murky world of “county lines” drug trading, in which young people are recruited by dealers who offer them money to sell drugs in out-of-town locations. “He was always 10 steps ahead of everyone. Everyone’s hands were tied and we did not know how to find him or where he was. It was extremely frustrating,” Helen says. “He was exploited and he was a victim, but we were told he was choosing this lifestyle of criminality.” She says this attitude stopped Tom from being referred to the national referral mechanism under modern slavery laws, which ensures they receive appropriate support. “That is a big failure by professionals and it stops kids.” Last year, Tom nearly died after being stabbed, but such assaults are not uncommon in county lines. The National Crime Agency reported last year that county lines groups “impose high levels of violence, including the prevalent use of weapons and firearms to intimidate and control members of the group and associated victims”. Helen says a lot of stabbings are the result of turf wars, and social media is also a trigger. “There is a feeling of not valuing their own lives. They are prepared to lead a short life as long as it is a life of bling and status. They don’t care if they are not going to live a long and healthy life ... When you have that situation, where someone is prepared to die young ... how do you compete with that?” she says. She adds that since being stabbed, Tom has changed but she is not sure it is enough to make him quit that lifestyle. “We are having better conversations now, and he has been unreachable for a long time. When you are involved in these gangs you are taught to hate the police and to hate your parents. I am grateful we can communicate relatively well now.” But escaping county lines dealing is not straightforward. “They say eight ways in and one way out,” Helen says. The experience has taken a heavy toll on the family. “He bears no resemblance to my own son, he is a different human being. Lots of parents would not be able to deal with that and it’s easy to throw your child out in that situation, but I knew he hadn’t chosen the lifestyle. He had been groomed and whatever happened had been done to him,” Helen explains. What does she think of how the problem is being tackled by the government? She believes not enough people like her, who have lived through it, are being consulted on how to combat it. “The strategies around tackling serious violence don’t often involve listening to those who have lived it. But we should for our children. We owe it to them if an experience highlights a flaw in the system, people should pay attention and ask ‘where are we going wrong and how can we fix it?’” • All names have been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/08/npower-sse-merger-investigation-competition-cma-energy-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T10:59:34Z","webTitle":"SSE-npower merger faces full investigation amid price concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/08/npower-sse-merger-investigation-competition-cma-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/08/npower-sse-merger-investigation-competition-cma-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"SSE-npower merger faces full investigation amid price concerns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK’s competition watchdog has opened a full-scale investigation into the proposed merger of “big six” energy firms npower and SSE. The announcement by the Competition and Markets Authority comes after it warned last month that the merger could lead to higher energy bills for households. The CMA said the two companies did not put forward evidence to address its concerns, meaning they now face a more detailed investigation which could take about six months. UK-listed SSE is the second largest of the big six by customer numbers, and Germany’s npower is the smallest, but together they would be nearly the same size as British Gas, the market leader. The merger of the companies was announced last year, in the face of increasingly stiff competition from new challengers. There are now about 60 energy suppliers in the UK. Npower and SSE believe the new company, in which SSE will hive off its supply business but remain in energy networks and power generation, will be more focused, more agile and have the economies of scale to offer competitive deals. The new firm will be headed by the former Dixons Carphone UK chief executive Katie Bickerstaffe, who has promised a more innovative and efficient energy supplier. Consumer groups welcomed the CMA’s scrutiny of the deal and its potential impact on consumers, noting that both firms scored badly in customer service rankings. Alex Neill, the managing director of home products and services at Which?, said: “Mergers of big players in essential markets such as energy risk reducing competition and harming consumers.” The companies appear to have factored in the likelihood of a deeper, six-month investigation, as they have always said the merger would likely complete in the final three months of 2018, or the start of 2019. An npower spokesperson said: “We look forward to helping the CMA in its in-depth investigation of our merger with SSE’s retail and energy services business throughout the phase two process. “We did not put forward measures to address the CMA’s concerns because we firmly believe this merger will be good for competition as it stands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/13/he-was-gone-fentanyl-and-the-opioid-deaths-destroying-australian-families","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T01:21:17Z","webTitle":"'He was gone': fentanyl and the opioid deaths destroying Australian families","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/13/he-was-gone-fentanyl-and-the-opioid-deaths-destroying-australian-families","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/13/he-was-gone-fentanyl-and-the-opioid-deaths-destroying-australian-families","fields":{"headline":"'He was gone': fentanyl and the opioid deaths destroying Australian families","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A few days before he died of a drug overdose, Sally’s (not her real name) younger brother called her to make plans. “Someone had given him gold-class movie tickets and he wanted to take me to see Batman v Superman,” she told a coroners court this week. “He was looking forward to our regular Sunday family dinner and he was talking about all the TV shows that he wanted to watch. “And then he was gone.” In May 2016, Sally’s brother, RG, who cannot be named because of a court order, was found dead in the unit where he lived alone on Sydney’s northern beaches. A “smart, funny and frustratingly charismatic” 22-year-old with a “quick wit, a cheesy grin and a cutting sense of humour”, RG nonetheless had a long history of drug abuse. Beginning from the age of about 15 when he began drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis, he had progressed to amphetamines, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. He had attended drug rehabilitation and was on a methadone program but had apparently relapsed. On the day he was found dead, his parents had gone to pick him up from his apartment before the Sunday dinner he had been looking forward to. They found him slumped over on his knees on the lounge-room floor, surrounded by drug paraphernalia. A toxicology report found he had died of an overdose from a combination of drugs, including the prescription opioid fentanyl. RG’s death is one of six examined this week by the New South Wales deputy coroner, Harriet Grahame, as part of a special inquest into the rise of opiate addiction in the state. The inquest was established after the coroner’s office noticed a spate of opiate deaths across Sydney within a few weeks in May 2016. Initially, investigators feared the deaths might have been linked to a bad batch of imported opiates. The truth may be more unsettling. Far from an outlier, the deaths were what counsel assisting the inquest Peggy Dwyer described as merely a “snapshot” of the scale of opiate-related deaths in the state which she were at “record levels in Australia and internationally”. All six deaths examined by the coroner this week were the result of an overdose from various opiates. Fentanyl, in particular, was found to be a contributor in three of the six cases. But only one of the six had a valid prescription for the drugs they died from. The scourge of fentanyl Developed in the late 1950s by a Belgian chemist, fentanyl is a synthetic opioid up to 100 times more potent than morphine. It came into widespread use in medicine during the mid-1990s with the introduction of the transdermal patch that releases the drug into the patient’s bloodstream over two or three days. But like its prescription opioid cousins, misuse of the drug has become part of the problem of opiate addiction. Fentanyl abusers commonly extract the drug from patches in which it’s sold. It is then injected, smoked or even chewed. But the drug’s potency means it poses a particular risk of overdose: the difference between drug-induced oblivion and death is wafer-thin. In the US, where opioid abuse has sparked a public health crisis, fentanyl is at the front line of overdose deaths. Opioid overdoses increased by about 30% across the US in just 14 months between 2016 and 2017, and fentanyl deaths shot up by 540% between 2013 and 2016. According to the the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of deaths caused by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl jumped from 3.1 per 100,000 in 2015 to 6.2 per 100,000 in 2016. In October last year the US president, Donald Trump, declared it a public health emergency. Now the question being asked by Australian health authorities is whether the same magnitude of crisis could be exported here. In Australia, opioid deaths increased by 60% in 2011 and 2015 compared with the previous decade. Deaths caused by pharmaceutical opioid overdoses now exceed heroin deaths by between two and two-and-a-half times. Most of those deaths were caused by accidental overdoses of oxycodone, morphine and codeine but over the past decade fentanyl has emerged as an increasing contributor to the spiralling casualty count. According to the National Coronial Information System, fentanyl was at least partly responsible for 130 opioid-related deaths between 2007 and 2011. Between 2013 and 2017 it had risen to 230. Dwyer said misuse of the drug was a “particular concern” for NSW police. Between March 2016 and February 2018, opiates were responsible for 26% of drug overdose deaths in the state, and 32% of those were directly attributed to fentanyl. But beyond sheer scale, there has remained an important distinction between the issue in North America and Australia. Dr Marianne Jauncey, who runs the medically supervised drug-injecting centre in Kings Cross, told the inquest this week that there was an important difference between misuse of prescription and illicit fentanyl. Opiate addicts access prescription fentanyl through either so-called “doctor shopping” or by buying on-sold prescription versions of the drug from dealers. Illicit fentanyl analogues meanwhile are produced mostly by chemical companies in China who custom-design variants of the drug. The drug’s potency makes it appealing for commercial dealers because they can charge more for smaller quantities but the drug’s analogues can be more dangerous than pharmaceutical-grade fentanyl because slight changes to the drug’s formula can make dosage harder to gauge for users. In the US and Canada, the importation of illicit fentanyl has been a major driver of the rise in overdose deaths. A recent US Senate subcommittee report investigated the presence of online fentanyl dealers and identified more than 500 sales totalling $230,000 involving six online sellers, mostly from China. The subcommittee also identified seven people who died from fentanyl overdoses after sending money and receiving packages from one of the online sellers. Authorities believe most users in Australia are still accessing prescription-grade fentanyl. A drug user who gave evidence at the inquest this week said a 100-microgram patch of fentanyl sold for about $100 in Sydney. But Jauncey said she feared it was only a matter of time before the more dangerous illicit fentanyl became more widely available. “The reality is I can’t gaze into a crystal ball and I don’t know what future holds [but] my concern is that as far as I’m aware much of illicit fentanyl is produced in China and we know that there are already strong illegal trade routes between Australia and China,” she said. “The only protective factor is the size of our market, which pales in comparison to North America. Other than that I can’t really see why we wouldn’t get it.” The inquest heard evidence that illicit fentanyl had been picked up by Australian customs in some seizures, and this week the Guardian contacted online sellers based in North America and China on a drug-selling marketplace on the dark web. All claimed to be able to distribute fentanyl analogue products to Australia. One China-based distributor said packages were sent via Germany or South Korea to avoid detection. The barriers to naloxone Part of this week’s inquest in Sydney looked at the availability of naloxone, a drug which can overturn the effects of an opioid overdose. Naloxone is listed as a schedule 3 drug under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, meaning it can be accessed from a pharmacist without a prescription. Dr Nicholas Lintzeris said that, in NSW, emergency departments would begin trialling handing out the drug to people who overdose. It follows a separate trial in which 500 take-home kits of naloxone were distributed to health workers and opioid users. But he told the inquest that there are still issues with its distribution. Prescriptions are limited to the intended user of the opioids, meaning family members of opioid users are not able to access the drug if they are no its intended user. And, he said, the stigma attached to drug users still acted as a barrier to access. “It’s the same kind of discussions that we were having 30 years ago,” he said. During the inquest – which will resume in August – the deputy coroner said RG’s story showed that “people who died from opiate overdoses are our brothers, our children, our community members. “This is not a strange class of people ... This is happening across our community.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/08/boris-johnson-attacks-theresa-mays-crazy-customs-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T07:09:51Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson attacks Theresa May's 'crazy' customs plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/08/boris-johnson-attacks-theresa-mays-crazy-customs-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/08/boris-johnson-attacks-theresa-mays-crazy-customs-plan","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson attacks Theresa May's 'crazy' customs plan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has launched an unprecedented attack on the prime minister’s preferred option for a post-Brexit EU customs partnership, calling the proposed system crazy and saying it would not give Britain control of trade policy. On a visit to Washington, the foreign secretary said a customs partnership, one of two options considered by the cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee, would be unacceptable. Downing Street said on Tuesday afternoon that the prime minister retained full confidence in Johnson, but in remarks that could be interpreted as a rebuke, her official spokesman pointed out that the entire cabinet had signed up to her Mansion House speech in which she set out her plans. While No 10 defended the business secretary Greg Clarke’s intervention at the weekend as entirely in keeping with government policy, May’s spokesman also refused to be drawn on whether the same was true of Johnson’s comments.The foreign secretary’s comments give the strongest signal yet that he might be prepared to resign should Theresa May push ahead with the partnership option, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels. The method would solve the problem of the Irish border, but Brexiters regard it as untested and impractical, opening the door to remaining in a customs union with Brussels. Sources close to Johnson insisted he did not regard the customs union a resigning matter, pointing out that there were members of the cabinet who did not agree with Brexit but who had stayed put. In an interview that put the backstage cabinet war out in the open, Johnson told the Daily Mail the method was “totally untried and would make it very, very difficult to do free trade deals”. “If you have the new customs partnership, you have a crazy system whereby you end up collecting the tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier,” he said. “If the EU decides to impose punitive tariffs on something the UK wants to bring in cheaply there’s nothing you can do.” Pro-leave cabinet ministers including Johnson prefer an alternative, maximum facilitation, or “max fac”, proposal, which relies on technology to keep border-checks to a minimum. Downing Street has insisted both options remain on the table, though Brexiters have privately described the customs partnership as a “dead parrot” after their forceful objections at last week’s meeting. Johnson suggested the partnership option, also known as the hybrid model, would not deliver on the result of the referendum. “That’s not taking back control of your trade policy, it’s not taking back control of your laws, it’s not taking back control of your borders and it’s actually not taking back control of your money either, because tariffs would get paid centrally back to Brussels,” he said. Johnson said the model would also force the UK into close regulatory alignment with Europe. “It only solves the Northern Ireland border question if you force companies to prove that an imported tariff-reduced good has been consumed in the UK and if you insist on complete regulatory alignment with the EU rule book,” he said. “Otherwise if Britain chose to vary its laws in any way at all on goods and agrifood, then logically you would need checks at the border.” May delayed a final decision on the preferred customs option after a tense meeting of the Brexit subcommittee last week during which the home and defence secretaries, Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson, also expressed concerns about the plan, along with Johnson, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. May, along with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, are said to prefer the partnership option. Clark defended the model on Sunday, setting out how devastating customs checks would be for major employers such as the car industry. Frictionless trade was “something that we’ve made a public commitment to and we need to make sure that we get that right,” he said. His intervention was taken as a bid licensed by Downing Street to revive a project that Brexiters outside cabinet believed they had forced off the agenda, though No 10 denied it was coordinated. In his interview, Johnson said it was right that the cabinet were able to express different views. “Colleagues in cabinet have different concerns about different aspects of the argument and it’s entirely right that they should make their points,” he said. “But we should be looking at the opportunities and thinking confidently about the UK and believing what we can do rather than succumbing to a sort of ‘project fear’ mark 2,3,4,5,6. “There’s a discussion going on, and we haven’t resolved this, but some of the ideas would make it very difficult for us to do meaningful free trade deals.” Johnson said a model such as the customs partnership would also be a disincentive for countries such as the US in negotiating future free trade agreements. “That’s not what the Americans want to see. What they want to see, like all our friends, is a confident free-trading Britain able to do its own deals,” he said. “You can’t do that if you remain locked in the lunar pull of Brussels, the tractor beam of Brussels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/08/gina-haspel-cia-director-atone-past","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T14:11:57Z","webTitle":"Gina Haspel must atone for her past to become CIA director","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/08/gina-haspel-cia-director-atone-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/08/gina-haspel-cia-director-atone-past","fields":{"headline":"Gina Haspel must atone for her past to become CIA director","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The battle in the Senate on Wednesday over Gina Haspel’s confirmation as the new director of the CIA is set to become a public reckoning of one of the darker chapters in modern US history. Haspel, who is currently the CIA’s deputy director after 33 years in the agency, ran a secret detention centre in Thailand in 2002 where inmates were tortured. Over the following two years she was a senior operations officer at the CIA counter-terrorism centre, which oversaw the interrogation programme around the world. Then, in 2005, she drafted an order for her then boss, Jose Rodriguez, the head of the CIA clandestine service, calling for the destruction of nearly 100 videotapes of interrogation sessions. Despite strong support from former CIA chiefs, Haspel’s chances of becoming the agency’s first female boss are delicately balanced in a divided Senate. Senators had demanded greater transparency from the CIA over her history and on Monday the agency delivered a cardboard box full of classified documents. But it is unclear what those documents will prove, and they may raise more questions than answers. The New York Times reported that the White House has seen newly released documentation including records of chats in the CIA’s internal messaging system in which Haspel raises no objections to the CIA’s interrogation techniques. After being summoned to the White House on Friday to discuss the new information, Haspel is reported to have offered to withdraw, uncertain over the administration’s commitment to backing her. She had to be talked out of quitting by senior presidential aides, including the legislative director, Marc Short, and White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, who was urgently dispatched to the CIA headquarters in Langley to bolster Haspel’s resolve. “She wants to do everything she can to make sure the integrity of the CIA remains intact, isn’t unnecessarily attacked,” Sanders said on Monday, when asked about Haspel’s apparent crisis of confidence over the weekend. “If she felt that her nomination would have been a problem for that and for the agency, then she wanted to do everything she could to protect the agency.” “At the same time she wants to do everything she can to protect the safety and security of Americans, which is why she is 100% committed to going through this confirmation process and being confirmed as the next leader of the CIA.” In an effort to boost her standing ahead of the Senate confirmation hearings, Trump sent out a tweet that celebrated rather than downplayed Haspel’s role in the “enhanced interrogation” programme that included waterboarding – the simulated drowning of detainees. “My highly respected nominee for CIA director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists,” Trump declared. “Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror.” The Senate battle over Haspel will be the focus for protests on Capitol Hill by human rights activists who see her ascent as evidence that there has been no real reckoning in the intelligence agencies for the excesses of the Bush administration’s “war on terror”. Haspel herself is expected to say she has learned from past mistakes and would not go along with any future order to use waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture. At the heart of Wednesday confirmation hearing will be an examination of what happened in Detention Site Green, a secret prison in Thailand which Haspel briefly ran in 2002; her role in overseeing interrogation while running the agency’s counter-terrorism centre in the two years after that; and how much say she had in a decision to destroy interrogation videotapes without the explicit assent of the CIA leadership or congressional oversight committees. The CIA itself has conducted an unusual lobbying campaign on Haspel’s behalf, reflecting the agency’s desire to have an insider in charge rather than risk a political appointee. CIA veterans would also see her confirmation as a sign that the agency had been officially absolved of its misdeeds in the war on terror. John Brennan, CIA chief under the Obama administration, used Twitter to appeal for her confirmation by sceptical Democrats. “Senators,” Brennan wrote, “show that you put country above politics. Gina Haspel is a competent, experienced and highly qualified intelligence professional. Ask her tough questions, listen to her answers and then decide but don’t penalize her for previous policy decisions or because [Donald Trump] picked her.” Furthermore, Haspel is seen as a Russia expert and a close ally of Britain’s MI6, having being London station chief from 2014 to 2017. She is reported to have insisted on the forceful US response in solidarity with the UK, to the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, using a nerve agent that is alleged to have originated from Russian government laboratories. CIA insiders hope that Haspel will insulate the agency from Trump’s indulgent approach to Vladimir Putin. But to achieve that Haspel will have to prove on Wednesday that she, and the agency she seeks to run, have atoned for their past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/08/china-sentences-former-political-rising-star-to-life-in-prison-for-corruption","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T05:08:57Z","webTitle":"China sentences former political rising star to life in prison for corruption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/china-sentences-former-political-rising-star-to-life-in-prison-for-corruption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/08/china-sentences-former-political-rising-star-to-life-in-prison-for-corruption","fields":{"headline":"China sentences former political rising star to life in prison for corruption","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A top Chinese official once seen as a potential successor to president Xi Jinping has been sentenced to life in prison for taking more than $26m in bribes, according to state media. Sun Zhengcai, a former politburo member and party boss of the southwestern city of Chongqing, is one of the highest officials to be toppled by an anti-graft campaign that critics say is Xi’s way to root out rivals rather than corruption. Sun was given a “lenient” sentence in exchange for his cooperation, the court in the northern port city of Tianjin said on Tuesday. He was accused of taking advantage of his position to seek profits for himself and others. Sun pleaded guilty after a one-day trial in April. The court said Sun had “gravely damaged the normal work order of national organisations and harmed the integrity of conduct by national employees”, according to a statement. The court said his “illegal gains” would be confiscated. Sun, 54, was the youngest member of the ruling communist party’s 25-member politburo and was a rising star in the party. In 2012, he was sent to Chongqing to replace Bo Xilai, another top official who fell foul of Xi’s anti-corruption crusade. Chongqing, as one of China’s largest cities, is a key post for rising Chinese officials. At one point, Sun was tipped to be elevated to the powerful politburo standing committee of seven people and helmed by Xi. Sun was seen by some as a candidate for leading the party in 2022. Then last year, he became the first politburo member to be investigated since Bo, who was charged with corruption and sentenced to jail in 2013. Sun was expelled from the CCP in September after the party accused him of taking bribes and trading power for sex. Last year, Sun, along with Bo, and China’s former security chief Zhou Yongkang, were named in an alleged plot to “usurp the party’s leadership and seize state power”. All three men have now been ousted from the party and jailed. This year, China’s legislature amended the country’s constitution to abolish a two-term limit for the country’s president, giving Xi freedom to remain in power indefinitely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/09/sydney-archdiocese-runs-ads-seeking-donations-for-cardinal-george-pells-legal-fees","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T18:00:26Z","webTitle":"Sydney archdiocese runs ads seeking donations for Cardinal George Pell's legal fees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/sydney-archdiocese-runs-ads-seeking-donations-for-cardinal-george-pells-legal-fees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/sydney-archdiocese-runs-ads-seeking-donations-for-cardinal-george-pells-legal-fees","fields":{"headline":"Sydney archdiocese runs ads seeking donations for Cardinal George Pell's legal fees","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney has been running ads in its news publication, the Catholic Weekly, seeking donations to fund Cardinal George Pell’s legal costs, a move which a lawyer representing victims of child sexual abuse, Dr Judy Courtin, describes as “utter hypocrisy”. While the Catholic Weekly has been running the ads with the bank account details for the fund since last year, it ran an article promoting the fund after Pell was ordered to stand trial earlier this month on historical sexual offence allegations. He has plead not guilty to all charges. Pell’s legal team, which includes the high-profile defence barrister Robert Richter, is believed to be costing him tens of thousands of dollars every day court sits. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Details of the fund have also been appearing in the newsletters of Catholic parishes around Australia, including St Patrick’s parish in Ballarat. The child sexual abuse royal commission turned its attention to Ballarat several times during its five-year inquiry, hearing evidence from survivors of abuse within the diocese, as well as bishops and priests who were witness to, or responsible for, abusing. While the fund to support Pell is managed by the Ferdinand Zito and Associates law practice in Melbourne, it is unclear who or what organisation was responsible for establishing the fund or who is paying to have it advertised around the world. “All clients of any legal practitioner are afforded the protection of legal professional privilege,” Zito told Guardian Australia. Zito said because of this, he was unable to answer questions about the fund. Courtin, who represented a number of abuse victims who gave evidence to the royal commission, said Pell was entitled to a defence team and to seek funding for it. But she questioned the involvement of the archdiocese in promoting that fund. “Pell, and other defendants with adequate financial backing, can not only afford the star-studded cast that is Pell’s legal team, but it is every defendant’s legal right to do so. But what of the victims of crime and their role in the criminal trial process? Are their justice needs being met? “Churches should be putting more pressure on the government to reform laws to give victims equal access to the courts and to set aside profoundly unjust deeds of release. Victims are still having shocking trouble getting justice because they received a meagre settlement in the past and signed away their future rights in a deed of release.” While the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney has been promoting details of the Pell fund, it said it had not established it, nor was it directing the funds. It has also previously said it is not responsible for Pell’s legal bills. A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Sydney told Guardian Australia that there was no conflict of interest in running the ads in the Catholic Weekly or while Pell was on trial. “The Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney stands by its statement to the royal commission to address child sexual abuse, but it also recognises the rights of the accused, any accused person, to defend themselves,” she said. “Like any other citizen, Cardinal Pell is entitled to the presumption of innocence, he has pleaded not guilty and is also entitled to appoint the defence he wants.” A spokeswoman for Pell, Katrina Lee, told the New Daily that while the Archdiocese of Sydney passed on details of the fund to those who asked, “the archdiocese has not contributed to this fund nor has the Vatican provided any funding”. The ads for the fund, linked to a Bendigo Bank account, are appearing in other publications around the world. A website, cardinalpellappeal.com, has also been established.

It would buy a lot of avocado on toast! Let’s get that predictable remark out of the way before examining the actual merits of the Resolution Foundation’s proposal of a “citizen’s inheritance” of £10,000 at the age of 25 to address the wealth gap between millennials and baby boomers. Those born from 1946 to 1965 have typically done better out of the system than today’s generation, who are saddled with mounting student debts, unaffordable housing and insecure work. “We need to redress that imbalance if we are to maintain the promise of an asset-owning democracy,” says the foundation’s just-released, thought-provoking intergenerational report, which shows clearly how wealth inequality between aged brackets has worsened. The £10,000 grant would be funded by restructuring inheritance tax. The millennial verdict? “It would change your ability to save for a house,” said one. “Without restrictions I would be straight down to Selfridge’s,” said another. * * * ‘Make train travel easier’ – Rail companies are pushing for an overhaul of ticketing rules so they can offer fares more suited to modern work patterns and travel needs. Britain’s ticketing options have ballooned in complexity to offer passengers about 55m different fares. The 1990s rules pre-date smartphones, ubiquitous internet use and smart payment systems. The Rail Delivery Group says tickets such as a three-day-a-week season fare are too difficult to offer under current rules – and some existing fares need to go to make way for them. The passengers’ group Transport Focus and the British Chambers of Commerce have welcomed the RDG’s public consultation, which will report back in the autumn. * * * Ireland ‘will not move’ on border – Theresa May is being warned not to expect a last-minute climbdown from Dublin over Brexit and the prospect of a hard border in Ireland. “Leo Varadkar [May’s Irish counterpart] is someone who will do the right thing for Ireland,” said a Dublin source. “They think we’ll get to the last point of the negotiations – and the border will be the last thing – and we’ll move, and we won’t.” May is facing increasing cross-party pressure for Britain to join the European Economic Area, with peers due to vote on a series of amendments tonight. Boris Johnson has dismissed May’s plan for a customs partnership as “crazy”. Chuka Umunna, co-leader of a cross-party pro-Europe group of MPs, voiced frustration with his Labour party’s unclear stance: “The party must pick sides,” he said. “To oppose the single market is to be aligned with Jacob Rees-Mogg.” * * *Oxford siege – An armed standoff involving and a man who fired shots from an inner-city residence in Oxford has ended peacefully, according to police. Thames Valley police reopened Paradise Square, Paradise Street and Norfolk Street this morning after the incident, which began on Monday and continued through the night as police negotiated with the suspect. It was not being treated as terrorism, police said. * * * Knotted hanky days to end – Or, “Britain in short-lived warm weather shocker”. The early May bank holiday was officially a record-breaker, with a high of 28.7C recorded in London. But we all knew it couldn’t last – from tomorrow it will be “nowhere near as warm”, with temperatures struggling to hit 20C and most likely resting in the mid-teens, according to Met Office forecasters. Today still promises temperatures of 28C in parts before that cool, rainy change moves in from Wednesday. * * * Below the belt – Russell Crowe has gotten his own back at the comedian John Oliver, who bought the actor’s jockstrap from Cinderella Man and donated it to a Blockbuster video store in Alaska.

Speaking to an audience in New Zealand on Monday night, the former US secretary of state and presidential candidate said Chinese interference in domestic policy was apparent in Australia and New Zealand as well as the US. “In Australia and here in New Zealand experts are sounding the alarm about Chinese efforts to gain political power and influence policy decisions,” Clinton said. “[Academic] Anne-Marie Brady of the University of Canterbury has rightly called this a new global battle, and it’s just getting started. We need to take it seriously.” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, told reporters Clinton’s statements about China were not new. “There are a number of world powers that have an interest in our region and, of course, New Zealand needs to maintain our role in building our relationships because there is that greater presence here,” she said. Clinton’s comments follow testimony from the Australian academic Clive Hamilton to the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China that Beijing was waging a “campaign of psychological warfare” against Australia, as America’s most significant ally in the region, undermining democracy and cowing free speech. Hamilton said Australia was being subjected to Chinese Communist party-sponsored operations of “subversion, cyber intrusions and harassment on the high seas”. “Beijing knows that it cannot bully the United States – in the current environment the consequences would be unpredictable and probably counterproductive – so it is instead pressuring its allies,” Hamilton said. China has consistently denied any interference in the domestic affairs of foreign countries. In response to the Australian government announcing a tightening of espionage laws last year, China said it respected the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. “China always follows the principle of mutual respect and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs when it comes to developing friendly cooperation with other countries, and this principle holds true for developing bilateral ties with Australia,” the foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, was due to outline the government’s budget plans for foreign affairs on Tuesday, with some tipping greater spending on the Pacific following his announcement of an increased focus on the region earlier this year. On Tuesday Australia’s Lowy Institute released its Power Index, confirming China’s rising power and influence across the Asia-Pacific. America remains the Asia-Pacific’s dominant power, but money, influence and might were shifting from west to east, the index found. And Donald’s Trump’s political power is a liability for the world’s superpower. The US ranks 13th on Lowy’s list of political leadership, equal with Cambodia’s authoritarian and controversial prime minister Hun Sen. China heads that category: President Xi Jinping has recently been been successful in removing term limits for his position, paving the way for him to be president for life. The Asia-Pacific would emerge as the globe’s dominant region in coming years, the Lowy report said. Within a decade, two-thirds of the world’s population will live in Asia, just over 10% will live in the West. “Much of the world’s future economic growth will come from Asia – but so will the world’s future challenges,” the report argued. “Asia is already the location of America’s only true peer competitor, China, as well as the world’s most dangerous country, North Korea.” Lowy’s new analytical tool – the product of two years’ work – measures power across 25 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, stretching west as far as Pakistan, north to Russia, and across the Pacific to the United States. Power is assessed across 114 indicators: including military, economic, and natural resources; diplomatic and cultural influence; trading relationships; capacity to deter real or potential threats; and defence networks. The index produced using the tool found that the US remained the pre-eminent regional power. But China was rising rapidly and closing in on American dominance. China ranked higher for diplomatic influence and economic relationships in the region, but the US was dominant in defence networks, military capability and cultural influence. The US and China are currently locked in tense trade talks that - despite the positive spin being promoted by both countries - appear locked in several fundamental impasses, especially over tariffs, strategic industry subsidies, and technology exports. The index ranked Japan and India as major powers in the region, but found they were moving in opposite directions: India’s young, growing workforce contrasted with Japan’s wealthy but ageing population. Russia, Australia, South Korea and Singapore were the leading “middle powers”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/07/melania-trump-plagiarism-row-be-best-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T16:31:34Z","webTitle":"Melania Trump in new plagiarism row over online safety pamphlet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/07/melania-trump-plagiarism-row-be-best-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/07/melania-trump-plagiarism-row-be-best-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Melania Trump in new plagiarism row over online safety pamphlet","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A booklet published by Melania Trump’s new campaign for children’s online safety bears an uncanny resemblance to a document released under Barack Obama’s administration. Donald Trump’s wife gave an opening night address at the Republican National Convention in 2016 that was partly plagiarised from a speech by then first lady Michelle Obama. Melania’s initiative, Be Best, which launched on Monday, has a page on the official White House website that said near the bottom: “Parents, click here to read Talking with Kids about Being Online, a booklet by First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission.” Later, in an apparent damage limitation exercise following a backlash on social media, the website’s language was updated to describe the pamphlet as “a Federal Trade Commission booklet, promoted by First Lady Melania Trump”. A White House official confirmed that the wording on the website had been changed, offering an explanation that “there seemed to be confusion so we wanted to be clear”. Visitors who click on the link are taken to a pdf file of a booklet that is almost identical to one first published by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2014 under the title: Net Cetera – Chatting with Kids About Being Online. Their front covers, an array of 16 symbols in grey and orange, are the same except for a minor tweak to images of mobile phones to make them look more like iPhones. This upgrade has been carried out throughout the booklet. The 2018 document, part of Melania’s initiative unveiled in the White House rose garden on Monday, includes a preface accompanied by her photo and signature. “The lessons in this booklet can help kids act thoughtfully and kindly,” she writes. But the following pages, full of advice for parents of “tweets” and “teens”, suggest her input was vanishingly small. They both include, “Talk to your teens about avoiding sex talk online,” and “Talk to your kids about bullying.” But the updated version has an addition: “Tell your kids to talk to you about bullying, too.” The original FTC handbook has a heading that says: “Sexting.” The new handbook says: “Sexting: Don’t Do It.” In the 2016 plagiarism row at the Republican convention, junior aide Meredith McIver eventually took responsibility for the error, saying that Melania had read passages of Michelle Obama’s speeches to her over the phone and she had included some of the phrasing in the final draft. On Tuesday Melania’s office issued a statement attacking “opposition media” for its coverage of the similarity between the two booklets. “Despite providing countless outlets with ample background, information, and on-the-record comments from the FTC, some media have chosen to take a day meant to promote kindness and positive efforts on behalf of children, to instead lob baseless accusations towards the First Lady and her new initiatives,” it said. The statement quoted Nathaniel Wood, consumer and business education division associate director of the FTC, as saying: “We were excited that Mrs Trump distributed this important information about staying safe online. We look forward to continuing to work with her and others to help parents and children use the internet safely and responsibly.” The first lady’s office added: “Our office will continue to focus on helping children and I encourage members of the media to attempt to Be Best in their own professions, and focus on some of the children and programs Mrs Trump highlighted in her remarks yesterday.” • This article was amended on 8 May 2018 to swap the order in which the FTC handbook headings on sexting appeared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/07/somerset-lancashire-county-championship-nottinghamshire-top","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T19:27:49Z","webTitle":"Somerset’s Steve Davies and Jack Leach fend off Matt Parkinson for draw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/07/somerset-lancashire-county-championship-nottinghamshire-top","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/07/somerset-lancashire-county-championship-nottinghamshire-top","fields":{"headline":"Somerset’s Steve Davies and Jack Leach fend off Matt Parkinson for draw","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a scorching day in Manchester, as the swifts arrived from the south, Somerset batted all day until the teams shook hands at ten to five. There was a fifty for Steve Davies and an unbeaten 66 for Jack Leach – his highest first‑class score – as Somerset overcame a post-lunch quiver to finish on 269 for eight declared. There were five wickets for the 21‑year‑old leg-spinner Matt Parkinson, who had the ball spitting with spleen at times and who collected a career-best match tally of eight for 181 in strangely spin‑friendly conditions in late spring. James Anderson took one wicket in his first match back for Lancashire, though he was perhaps unlucky not to have more. In the Somerset dressing room Marcus Trescothick was padded up and ready to bat with a broken metatarsal which, according to the Somerset captain, Tom Abell, “tells you everything you need to know about Tres”. Nottinghamshire collected their third victory of the season in defeating Hampshire despite a valiant rearguard innings from Hashim Amla, who batted more than five hours for 112 against his old club before being the last man to fall, to Jake Ball. Ball, Stuart Broad and Harry Gurney took three wickets apiece and Nottinghamshire squat on top of the table, 17 points above Somerset. There was a draw at The Oval, where the 19-year-old Amar Virdi took the last four wickets to fall to produce his best bowling figures of six for 105. Scott Borthwick was top‑scorer with 82 not out in Surrey’s second innings of 173 for three declared but there were no eye-catching runs for Mark Stoneman, lbw for 20. It was the first time Worcestershire had avoided defeat this season. At Hove Sussex managed a finger-nibbling run chase, to beat Middlesex by three wickets just before tea. Runs came from Stiaan van Zyl (45) and an unbeaten 65 from the wicketkeeper Ben Brown, who steadied the ship after Sussex lost four for 15. It is Sussex’s first victory under their head coach, Jason Gillespie. On a drama-heavy day at the Riverside Durham beat Leicestershire against the odds and the clock and won for the first time in their history after following on. At lunch the game had seemed destined for a draw, until Gavin Griffiths took five wickets in 24 balls as Durham collapsed from 323 for three to 345 for eight. A precious 38 from James Weighell eked out valuable runs to give Leicestershire a target of 148 from 46 overs. Leicestershire were bowled out for 101 with a first-class-best seven for 32 – and an afternoon to remember – for Weighell. In the tour match the Pakistanis made 134 for one to beat Northamptonshire by nine wickets after Northants were bowled out for 301; Mohammad Abbas took four for 62 and Shadab Khan four for 80."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/07/iran-deal-trump-decision-latest-when-date-tuesday","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T16:06:34Z","webTitle":"Iran: UK 'deeply pessimistic' that Trump will stick with nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/07/iran-deal-trump-decision-latest-when-date-tuesday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/07/iran-deal-trump-decision-latest-when-date-tuesday","fields":{"headline":"Iran: UK 'deeply pessimistic' that Trump will stick with nuclear deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Senior UK diplomats have said they are deeply pessimistic that Donald Trump will stick with the Iran nuclear deal when he makes an announcement at the White House later on Tuesday, in what could mark the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. Trump tweeted that he would make his announcement on Tuesday, before the 12 May deadline by which he has to decide whether to renew the waivers on US sanctions against Iran. The US president is expected to tear up the deal, which was negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015, but diplomats are waiting to see how quickly and widely he plans to reimpose sanctions that would affect European firms trading with Iran. European countries are hoping to stick with the deal even if the US pulls out, but there are doubts about whether this is a viable option. The accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), requires Iran to give up its stock of 20% enriched uranium, halt production and limit research on new nuclear centrifuges and allow extensive international inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Authority. There are 100 dispute mechanisms inside the deal that could be invoked to prevent its immediate collapse. A succession of European leaders including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have flown to Washington in recent weeks to warn that tearing up the deal with no alternative strategy to contain Iran’s nuclear programme risks undermining diplomacy and strengthening hardliners in Tehran. Trump, however, is now surrounded by opponents of the 2015 deal, including John Bolton, his new national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo, the new US secretary of state. Following Johnson’s visit to Washington, a senior UK diplomat said: “We are deeply pessimistic ahead of President Trump’s announcement later today. However, we will have to wait and see what exactly President Trump says tonight. “Our objective will remain to uphold and maintain the JCPOA. We will need to wait to understand what the US plan is to deliver on our shared goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” The remarks reveal the extent to which senior European diplomats are not being consulted on Trump’s final decision. Speaking ahead of Trump’s announcement, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said: “It is possible that we will face some problems for two or three months, but we will pass through this.” In an apparent nod to Europe, Rouhani also stressed that Iran wanted to keep “working with the world and constructive engagement with the world”. However, a senior hardliner, Mohammad Javad Larijani, the head of the Iranian judiciary’s human rights council, said it would be a “severe mistake” for Iran to stay in if the US goes. “If the United States leaves … they should know that would be the end [for the deal],” he said. EU and US diplomats had staged private talks over the possibility of widening the deal to cover Iran’s nuclear ballistic missile programme and wider interventions in the Middle East, but these appear to have stalled with the arrival of Bolton and Pompeo. Robert Malley, the former lead White House negotiator on the Iran agreement under Obama, said he expected Trump to withdraw from the deal. “It seems based on everything I am hearing from the Europeans and from people here, that President Trump wants to walk out of the deal, not because he’s not satisfied with its substance, but because it’s an Obama legacy,” he said. Israel and Saudi Arabia have lobbied hard against the deal for different reasons, pinpointing a sunset clause that allows Iran to restart nuclear enrichment once the deal ends in 2025. The head of Iran’s central bank said before Trump’s announcement that a US withdrawal would have no impact on the country’s economy, but the Iranian rial traded near record lows against the dollar on the free market as people tried to buy hard currency for fear of economic turmoil if Trump announces a withdrawal. The dollar was selling for 65,000 rials, according to foreign exchange websites that track the free market. That is up from about 57,500 at the end of last month and 42,890 at the end of last year. Iran also insisted that it would be able to continue as a major oil exporter, but its potential travails have helped to push oil prices higher. Appealing to European powers on Monday, Rouhani said Iran would remain in the JCPOA. “Today we are telling the world that if you are worried about Iran’s access to nuclear bomb, we have completely allayed this concern in the JCPOA, and the deal ensures that Iran does not seek nuclear weapons,” he said. Tehran is hoping European nations can defy US sanctions and retain trade and investment links with the country, but European banks, especially those with any links to the US, have been wary of facilitating trading even under the current sanctions regime. Paris will continue to push for a broader deal, “whether the United States participates or not”, France’s defence minister said on Tuesday. “This agreement is not the best one in the world,” Florence Parly told RTL radio. “But without being perfect, it still has its virtues … and they [the Iranians] are respecting it,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/07/donald-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-trita-parsi-us-intelligence-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T20:13:17Z","webTitle":"Iran deal: prominent backer says he was warned of Trump bid to discredit him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/donald-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-trita-parsi-us-intelligence-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/07/donald-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-trita-parsi-us-intelligence-warning","fields":{"headline":"Iran deal: prominent backer says he was warned of Trump bid to discredit him","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A prominent Iranian-American supporter of the Iran nuclear deal says he was warned by US intelligence during the presidential transition that his communications would be targeted by the Trump camp in a bid to discredit him. The new details from the behind-the-scenes struggle over the 2015 deal have emerged as it reaches a critical point. Donald Trump said on Monday that he would announce on Tuesday his decision on whether to continue to abide by the agreement, which is enshrined in a 2015 UN security council resolution, or potentially violate it by reintroducing sanctions on Iran. Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), was also the target more recently of an Israeli private security company, Black Cube, aimed at gathering personal information about the deal’s advocates among senior figures from the Obama administration. The Guardian has obtained the transcript of an interview with Parsi conducted last summer by an operative working for Black Cube posing as a journalist, probing him for any ways Ben Rhodes and Colin Kahl – top foreign advisers to Barack Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden – might have benefited from the 2015 agreement, in which Iran received sanctions relief in return for accepting strict curbs on its nuclear programme. “I thought it was strange that he was pushing this financial angle, which I hadn’t heard before,” Parsi recalled. According to the transcript of the interview, conducted in the early summer last year, he told the interviewer that, far from reaping rewards, US companies on the whole were frustrated that they were getting nothing from the 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Despite the unusual line of questioning, Parsi thought no more about the interview until the transcript was read to him over the weekend. However some months before the telephone interview, between Trump’s election victory in November and his inauguration in January, Parsi says he received an extraordinary warning. “Someone in US intelligence, through an intermediary, told us that we would be targeted by the Trump crowd, in order to discredit us as a way of discrediting the JCPOA,” Parsi said, adding that the warning had come with an encouragement to be careful about his means of communication. The Observer reported this weekend that Trump associates had commissioned an Israeli private security firm last year to carry out a “dirty ops” campaign against Rhodes and Kahl, who had been prominent in defence of the deal in the face of Donald Trump’s determination to rewrite or torpedo it. Black Cube initially denied any connection to the spying operation against Rhodes and Kahl, but both Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor and Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker reported that the same fake company had been used to approach Kahl’s wife as Black Cube had used to contact Rose McGowan, one of the principal accusers of the disgraced film tycoon, Harvey Weinstein. One of Weinstein’s lawyers hired Black Cube last year, the New Yorker has reported, in an effort to stop publication of sexual misconduct allegations against him. Kahl’s wife, Rebecca, was approached by someone calling herself Adriana Gavrilo, claiming to be head of corporation social responsibility at Reuben Capital Partners, a London-based investment firm, suggesting that it might be interesting in funding the school that the Kahls’ daughter attended, and where Rebecca Kahl volunteered. “They tried to take advantage of my commitment to our daughter’s school to gain access to our family,” Ms Kahl tweeted on Sunday. Rhodes’ wife, Ann Norris, was approached in June last year by someone calling herself Eva Novak, according to the New Yorker, asking Norris to consult on a movie project Novak described as “All the President’s Men meets The West Wing’’. Gavrilo and Novak both appeared to be aliases represented on the professional social network LinkedIn by a photograph of the same woman. Like Kahl, Norris grew suspicious and did not pursue the approach. “It is all pretty rotten and chilling, especially because it brought in my family. I wish these people would just leave me alone!” Rhodes said in an email exchange with the Guardian. After these reports on Sunday, a source close to Black Cube conceded that the firm had been involved in the information-gathering effort aimed at Rhodes and Kahl, but insisted the investigation in question was not political but linked to one of its private sector clients, in relation to an alleged breach of Iran sanctions by a competitor. Israeli media quoted Black Cube sources on Monday as saying that its work was related to a dispute between shipping companies, but did not explain how that mission led the firm to attempt to spy on the Rhodes and Kahl families. The fate of the JCPOA has been the subject of intense interest from the world’s intelligence agencies since negotiations began in 2013. Daryl Kimball, the head of the Washington-based Arms Control Association (ACA), which has been an enthusiastic supporter of the deal, said the group’s computer systems were targeted by a series of untraceable denial of service attacks beginning on 6 June 2016, the day Rhodes spoke at the ACA annual general meeting. In November 2017, the Washington offices of another prominent pro-JCPOA advocacy group were burgled. According to officials from the organisation, who did not want it to be named, it was a sophisticated break-in in which the whole building’s closed-circuit TV and alarms were disabled. The thieves went to offices at the back on the organisation’s suite and took only two computers used by senior officials, ignoring many other expensive electronics including a new computer, still in its box, which was lying close to the entrance. “If these are operations that are sanctioned by someone in the White House to dig up possible dirt on the president’s enemies, this is Nixonian,” Kimball said. “These sort of dirty tricks are unacceptable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/08/abbots-death-notice-dictated-by-henry-viii-goes-on-display","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T11:36:11Z","webTitle":"Abbot's death notice dictated by Henry VIII goes on display","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/08/abbots-death-notice-dictated-by-henry-viii-goes-on-display","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/08/abbots-death-notice-dictated-by-henry-viii-goes-on-display","fields":{"headline":"Abbot's death notice dictated by Henry VIII goes on display","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was little consolation to the abbot of Norton Priory but, in 1536, Henry VIII changed his mind and decided to show mercy. Instead of having him hung, drawn and quartered, and his body parts posted off to be put on display around the country to put the fear of God and the king into other unruly clerics, he was merely to be hanged. The draft letter, probably dictated by Henry to a secretary – with the original sentence “for the terrible example of all others” amended – is on display at Norton Priory, the site of the abbot’s once magnificent church and monastic complex, on loan from the National Archives in London. The V&amp;A Museum has also loaned a 16th-century silver-gilt reliquary as an indication of the wealth of the monasteries, which the king coveted as much as any reforming zeal. Norton Priory was already four centuries old in 1536, founded as an Augustinian abbey in 1115. Henry had evidently been enraged at the news that the abbot, Robert Jannyns, supported by some local people, had blocked attempts by his men to throw out the clergy and shut the priory. The news would have seemed particularly alarming in London, where it was seen as linked to an uprising in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Andrew Abram, from Manchester Metropolitan University, suspects political meddling, and that the high sheriff of Cheshire, Piers Dutton, had reported and deliberately exaggerated the scale of the resistance – though at one point the commissioners who were charged with shutting the monastery did have to lock themselves into a tower for protection from a mob of about 300 people. Sean Cunningham, of the National Archives, says that although Henry delegated most routine business to his ministers, the letter shows that he could and did take a close interest in any events that appeared to challenge his sovereignty. The resistance only postponed the inevitable. The priory was seized and demolished, and a mansion – demolished in turn in the 1920s – was built on the site. In the 20th century Norton became the most extensively excavated monastic site in Europe, and a new museum displaying hundreds of finds opened in 2016. The real surprise was the fate of the abbot. It appears that Jannyns not only kept his limbs, but also his life. He was widely thought to have been executed, but recent research suggests that he was released from prison in 1537."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/07/canada-montreal-police-officer-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T17:46:05Z","webTitle":"Canada: police told massage therapist sexual harassment 'part of the business'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/canada-montreal-police-officer-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/07/canada-montreal-police-officer-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Canada: police told massage therapist sexual harassment 'part of the business'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Canadian police officer told a massage therapist that harassment at work was just “part of the business” when she tried to report an incident of sexual abuse. Claudia Cavaliere went to Montreal police after a client requested a full-body massage and then proceeded to masturbate in front of her. Cavaliere, who had recently graduated from a massage therapist program, quickly left the room and staff asked the man to leave. “I couldn’t speak. I was hyperventilating. I was crying. I was sitting on the floor in the corner of the room, panicking,” Cavaliere told CBC News. But her troubles continued when she attempted to file a police report. Uncomfortable with the process, she recorded a portion of her interview with police on her phone. The officer on duty made repeated attempts to dissuade her from making a formal statement to police, emphasizing the unlikelihood that an investigation would be launched, the lengthy process of legal proceedings and the minor fine the man would receive. “It’s scary. He could be doing this to so many other women out there,” Cavaliere told the officer. The officer replied: “If you want to be a massage therapist, prepare yourself. I know a friend of mine who owns a massage place and would say it happens all the time.” The interview culminated in the officer advising her that such behaviour was to be expected in her line of work. “Prepare yourself. Don’t get emotional with this,” he said. “It’s not part of the business,” responded Cavaliere. The incident prompted strong condemnation from Canada’s largest association representing massage therapists. “Nobody should be subjected to sexual harassment in the least,” said Andrew Lewarne, executive director of Registered Massage Therapist’s Association of Ontario. Massage is therapeutic treatment, “not an open invitation”, he said. The incident comes at a time when police across the country are under greater scrutiny over how sexual harassment claims are handled. An investigation by the Globe and Mail has prompted police to re-examine more than 37,000 cases of sexual violence that had been previously dismissed as having no merit. Montreal police confirmed they are looking into the incident but did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/06/arsene-wenger-arsenal-challenge-farewell","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T19:49:42Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger says goodbye but ‘will cherish every moment I was here’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/06/arsene-wenger-arsenal-challenge-farewell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/06/arsene-wenger-arsenal-challenge-farewell","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger says goodbye but ‘will cherish every moment I was here’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger noted a little waspishly that to please some Arsenal fans it was better he left the club, as he described the final home game of his 22-year tenure as a “very sad day”. Arsenal thrashed Burnley 5-0 to ensure a sixth-placed Premier League finish and direct qualification to the group stage of next season’s Europa League and it was an afternoon of celebration and ceremony. Wenger was presented after the game with the golden trophy the club received from the league for their unbeaten title-winning season of 2003-04 – a heartfelt piece of re-gifting. The 68-year-old reflected on how the Emirates Stadium was in his blood, because he had lived every step of its journey from one-time refuse centre to state-of-the-art venue, and he stressed how his successor had the platform to succeed – particularly in terms of the quality of players at his disposal. “There are many highlights after 22 years,” Wenger said. “I think I played 840 Premier League games. Do you know how many sleepless nights that means? Before the game, after the game. Sometimes to make people happy is to go somewhere else. I want to make people happy. My ambition was to win with style. That was always my target. “It is a very sad day for me. I came here [to the Emirates] to make the first photos and then the lorries came in when it was a deposit for the rubbish. I have worked on every single part of this stadium from your press conferences to the technical area so, of course, it’s part of myself. “But as well it’s a day where the people that come behind me can work in good conditions. My successor inherits a team that is much better than people think it is. With the right additions this team will challenge next year. “I have to deal with it [his departure]. It is a story that ends. You have not many guys that have managed a club of this stature for 22 years, so I have been very lucky. I will cherish every moment I was here but as well it’s a new start for me.” Wenger was asked whether he would return to watch a game from the North Bank of the Emirates. “I would be happy to do that,” he said. “The positive of that is I can shout at the next manager.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
