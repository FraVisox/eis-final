Yet, as the clock has ticked, confusion has reigned. The 14 months since the EU referendum have been characterised by rhetorical posturing, fuzzy logic and position papers peppered with contradictions and questionable assertions. The country’s two main parties have hedged their bets and ducked and dived in relation to the great dilemmas posed by Brexit, rather than engage in a rational and honest conversation about how to pursue the national interest in extraordinary times. So today’s intervention by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is to be welcomed as a significant development. Writing in the Observer on behalf of the Labour party, Starmer states unequivocally that Labour would seek to keep Britain in the single market and a customs union during a transitional period, and possibly in the longer term. This is not yet a worked-through negotiating strategy. But it represents a pragmatic shift towards the only conceivable transitional arrangement Britain should be seeking, and puts clear water between the two main parties for the first time. Theresa May’s government insists that in 2019 Britain must leave both the single market and customs union. Until now, Labour’s Brexit policy has lacked clarity. The party’s recent election manifesto pledged to put the economy first by retaining the benefits of the single market, while also promising to end freedom of movement. How that happy end-state was to be achieved was, to put it kindly, not spelt out. This evasiveness undoubtedly served Labour well in the general election. But it has undermined the party’s ability to hold the government to account for its own shambolic approach to Brexit. It is also politically unsustainable, this far into the Brexit process, when shadow ministers are unable to articulate or agree on what Labour actually thinks. Now Labour has at last made a choice and deserves credit for adopting the only short-term position that makes sense. Negotiating a transitional deal is all but impossible to achieve within 18 months, given that talks on the deal cannot even start until the UK and EU have reached agreement on three complex and contentious issues: the financial bill Britain will owe the EU on exit; the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and British citizens living in the EU, and who will oversee them; and arrangements for the Irish border. Any deal will also require unanimous support from every other EU nation, and ratification by both the European parliament and European council. British negotiators should be focusing on the immediate and critical substantive issues, such as the Irish border, then turning their minds to the long-term settlement; not wasting time and energy on the impossible task of negotiating a transitional deal. This means, as Labour suggests, we must seek to keep all our economic arrangements and relationships with the EU intact for a period after we give up membership of the EU’s political club. This is necessary to allow the time and space to negotiate a final deal. Yes, keeping the economic status quo, while giving up our power to shape the rules that govern it, is very much a second best to full membership of the EU. But there is no way round that. A transition period, by definition, comes to an end. What comes next? Here, Labour has also markedly shifted its tone. Starmer explicitly leaves open the door to remaining in the single market and a form of customs union, so long as a final deal includes arrangements for managing migration more effectively. This is, for now, a sensible position: Britain may well have more luck negotiating some more significant brakes on freedom of movement now than David Cameron did prior to the referendum. The EU today is more self-confident and less blighted by existential fears than the EU of two years ago, thanks to an economic upturn and the failure of far-right nationalists such as Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands to gain power. Labour has clarified its stance and opted for a Brexit approach that is practical. Compare and contrast with the Conservatives’ chaotic journey without maps. In recent days, ministers have published several position documents intended to clarify Britain’s negotiating strategy for a transitional deal. Together they give the impression of a government that continues to cling to the fantasy that Britain can, in the now notorious words of Boris Johnson “have its cake and eat it”. Philip Hammond and Liam Fox jointly wrote two weeks ago that Britain will leave both the single market and the customs union at the end of the Article 50 process. But there is no realistic acknowledgement in these papers of the gigantic difficulties that this would create. On issues from the Irish border to customs arrangements, the government has simply stated what it wants, no matter how unfeasible its demands. There was, at least, a significant concession on the European court of justice: the government seems to have conceded that the UK will continue to be affected by EU law. The government’s approach so far to the historic question of Brexit borders on the irresponsible. Yet, still, ministers continue the deceitful charade, while every day the uncertainty deepens for businesses making investment decisions and EU citizens living in this country. Last week the government celebrated a report indicating falling immigration figures. But those statistics are in fact a sign of a spluttering economy in which industries such as food production are suffering from a lack of workers and the NHS is unable to recruit enough doctors and nurses. New research from KPMG suggests that this is the shape of things to come, with significant numbers of younger, better-educated and better-paid EU nationals considering leaving the UK. That Labour has finally screwed its courage to the sticking place on Brexit could be a game-changing moment. Next month the EU withdrawal bill returns to parliament for its second reading. The bill’s provisions on the European court of justice would effectively make Labour’s transitional proposal to stay in the single market all but impossible. So, not before time, battle must and will be joined in the House of Commons. It’s now down to moderate, pragmatic Conservative MPs to break ranks and rally behind Labour to bring some sanity and realism to the Brexit process. If this parliament votes to sacrifice Britain’s economic interests on the altar of Conservative party unity, history will not remember it fondly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/26/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T13:47:21Z","webTitle":"Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling breaks Bournemouth but then sees red","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/26/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/26/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling breaks Bournemouth but then sees red","bodyText":"In the seventh minute of added time, the Manchester City technical area exploded into life as Raheem Sterling wheeled away after earning three points on a picture-postcard afternoon at Bournemouth. His celebrations, which included jumping into a frenzy of travelling supporters who had spilled on to the pitch, earned him a second yellow card, as Pep Guardiola’s side took victory in the cruellest manner following a superb and often heated contest between two teams coached by perfectionists. It was the second time this week that Sterling had come up with the goods, after his equaliser at Everton on Monday. City were heading for a second successive Premier League draw before he nicked the winner, firing home Danilo’s low cross with only seconds left. It was a bonkers finale to a game that concluded in the 101st minute. Gabriel Jesus had drilled in a first-half equaliser for City after the Bournemouth defender Charlie Daniels filed an early contender for goal of the season, with a rasping half-volley, that pinballed off the crossbar and in from 20 yards. By the final whistle, when Eddie Howe had his head in his hands, Daniels’ spectacular strike seemed a distant memory. City made life difficult, and Bournemouth must take spirit from how they stifled Guardiola’s side for so long, but his side extended their unbeaten record to 11 matches and broke hearts in the process. Howe and his players were aggrieved with the referee, Mike Dean, for penalising the substitute Lys Mousset in the buildup to City’s winner, although the hosts could count themselves lucky not to have finished the game with 10 players themselves. The numbers are not adding up at the moment for Bournemouth, pointless after three games. Guardiola made four changes from Monday’s draw, with Sergio Agüero among those to drop to a bench brimming with more than £202m worth of talent. Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva, both of whom arrived from Monaco over the summer, made their first starts while Guardiola shifted to a back four, with another summer signing, Danilo, at right-back. Howe handed Jermain Defoe his first Premier League start for Bournemouth, after he re-signed for the club over the summer. It was a measure of how impressively they began that a first league goal this season, after 13 minutes, took nobody by surprise. After a swell of pressure Dan Gosling’s effort was headed away by Vincent Kompany, but only so far as an onrushing Daniels, who needed no second invitation to thrash the ball home. He rifled an unwavering half-volley towards goal, which smacked the inner frame of Ederson’s crossbar before crashing in past the City goalkeeper. City looked shell-shocked and could have fell further behind but for Ederson, who denied Defoe from close range after the England striker lost his marker, Mendy, to meet Andrew Surman’s neat first-time cross. Bournemouth had City rattled but not for much longer, with David Silva crafting a fine equaliser eight minutes later. The move was started and finished by Jesus, who took a quick free-kick before Silva slid him through with a beautifully weighted pass and he rolled the ball beyond Asmir Begovic. Sixty seconds later, Jesus again got the better of Nathan Aké, robbing him of the ball before he was fouled by the Bournemouth defender 25 yards from goal. Aké was arguably the last man and fortunate to escape with only a booking. Jesus then shinned an effort wide after a dangerous ball by Mendy. Bernardo Silva, too, had a golden chance but spurned what was virtually a free hit at Begovic’s goal. City had suddenly found their groove and dominated the rest of the first half. After the interval, Steve Cook put in a bruising late challenge on Jesus but both came away from the tackle unscathed. City continued to pry for an opening as Kevin De Bruyne grew increasingly instrumental. It was his sweeping cross that eventually found its way to Bernardo Silva, but the forward got himself in a tangle at the back post. Then Bournemouth went close. King struck an upright with Ederson beaten all ends up. City continued to pour forward and Guardiola called upon Agüero in search of a winner. He won a corner with which De Bruyne laid the ball on a plate for the unmarked Nicolas Otamendi – erratic at times in his own penalty area – whose tame header struck the post. Then came Leroy Sané, in place of Jesus. Bournemouth had one more warning, only for Daniels to get his team-mate Aké off the hook. The Dutchman threw a stray boot at Mendy’s devious cross but Daniels slid in to deny an onrushing David Silva the simplest of finishes. But after Lee Probert signalled for five added minutes, City eventually found a shattering winner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/26/welsh-houses-liverpool-renovation-slums-housing-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"In Liverpool, a rare housing story to celebrate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/26/welsh-houses-liverpool-renovation-slums-housing-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/26/welsh-houses-liverpool-renovation-slums-housing-policy","fields":{"headline":"In Liverpool, a rare housing story to celebrate","bodyText":"Last weekend, 24 newly renovated houses in Liverpool were opened to the public so that prospective tenants could apply to live there. Within a day all were taken. That these houses exist at all is something of a miracle, as they are part of the Welsh Streets, an area of handsome Victorian terraces that national and city government, at a cost of millions in public money, spent more than a decade trying to destroy. Their survival shows how, sometimes, persistent campaigning can defeat the monolithic, clumsy and capricious thinking of authority. The Welsh Streets were victims of the Blair government’s housing market renewal initiative, which was one of the more perverse applications of market ideology to social issues. Launched in 2002, it saw the problem of rundown city neighbourhoods as being one of excessively low property values, which it sought to address by, among other things, spending hundreds of millions of pounds on the demolition and clearance of thousands of what were seen as “obsolete” houses across northern England and the Midlands. It repeated the much-derided rehousing policies of the 1960s – the crude condemnation of houses as “slums”, the failure to see inherent value either in building stock or in the communities contained therein, the belief that social ills could be cured by attacking their physical fabric. But it came with less of the 1960s idealism about the new homes that might be created. The programme failed to acknowledge the value of respecting the past, with its memories and the sense of continuity and identity that it brings. According to one campaigner, it was also an over-reaction to the decades-long decline of industrial cities, and failed to notice that a corner was being turned. In Liverpool, in areas such as Anfield and Granby, it led to the forced eviction of hundreds of people from homes that, in some cases, they had occupied for decades. Homeowners were obliged to sell for low prices, which were insufficient to buy replacements. Communities were broken up. Whole neighbourhoods went into “managed decline”, which meant streets vacated and “tinned up”, some demolished, and a few determined residents left behind in what became frightening wastelands. The Welsh Streets, an area built by Welsh developers and Welsh labour – “hewn”, as walesonline put it, “from the clay and slate of Wales by the sweat of a generation of migrant workers” – became famous. This was partly because Ringo Starr was born there, in Madryn Street, but also because the destruction of these houses, of a type that in London would sell for six- or seven-figure sums, looked particularly wanton. Liverpool city council, incentivised by national government funding, planned to demolish 440 homes, and set about buying them up, emptying them and creating mini-ghost-towns. Whatever good might have come of the housing market renewal project – reports by National Audit Office and the Audit Commission suggested that it was limited – was curtailed in 2011, when the coalition government decided to terminate what had been planned as a 15-year programme. Liverpool city council, arguing that most residents wanted the new homes they had been promised, pushed on with its demolition plans. In January 2015, following a public inquiry, the demolition plans were stopped by the then communities secretary, Eric Pickles. The decision, said the city’s mayor, Joe Anderson, was “yet another kick in the teeth for long-suffering residents”, but the council – having no other option – set about plans for refurbishment. It went into partnership with Placefirst, a company that had successfully renewed derelict terraces in Accrington. Their big idea was to build for rent, not sale, at sufficiently low rates to be accessible to nurses, careworkers, university lecturers and others usually priced out of good-quality housing. There would also be homes for social rent and others for sale and combinations of renting and selling. The 24 houses just snapped up are the result of a pilot project for a plan to create about 300 homes, mostly through refurbishment. Placefirst has worked out ways to recombine the traditional houses to make homes of two, three and four bedrooms. It improved the planting and the paving in the streets and cleared out the old backyards, alleys and rear extensions in order to make communal gardens. The intention, I’m told, was to make place where “kids can play and people can really get to know each other, not like standing in a lift in a block of flats”. Anderson now says that the plans are “really exciting” and will “breathe new life into the area and give it a long-term sustainable future”. Throughout the long struggle over the Welsh Streets, their most persistent champion has been Save Britain’s Heritage. The campaign group’s Liverpool heritage expert Jonathan Brown says that it challenged the official line that the houses were sub-standard, outdated and beyond repair. Although they had problems, they were, “according to the council’s own statistics, in above-average condition. House prices were rising. These houses had survived two world wars, Margaret Thatcher, and the 1981 Toxteth riots, and now Tony Blair came along with all this money to knock them down.” The option of renovating old houses to modern standards is, Brown says, “actually a futuristic sustainable housing form”. Save Britain’s Heritage was joined by some local residents, but not all, as one effect of housing market renewal was to divide communities. Some wanted to keep the streets they knew, others saw new houses as the only way to end the damp and rats from which they were suffering. The option of getting the best of both worlds – the one now being implemented – was not available. If the Welsh Streets are now heading for a happy ending, it is also, as Brown says, “bittersweet”. The residents who were there over a decade ago were moved out and scattered, although some are now returning. Money has been wasted. But, if by much too convoluted and destructive a route, it has been demonstrated that the past has a value to the present, and you don’t have to scrub it all out and start again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/aug/27/uk-tv-industry-1bn-amazon-youtube-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T14:29:30Z","webTitle":"UK TV industry risks losing £1bn a year to Amazon, YouTube and Facebook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/27/uk-tv-industry-1bn-amazon-youtube-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/aug/27/uk-tv-industry-1bn-amazon-youtube-facebook","fields":{"headline":"UK TV industry risks losing £1bn a year to Amazon, YouTube and Facebook","bodyText":"Traditional broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Sky could lose a combined £1bn per year if rival services from Amazon, Facebook and YouTube become dominant players in the TV industry over the next decade. A new report says that UK broadcasters could suffer the same fate as industries including music, news, insurance and property where powerful digital newcomers – including Apple, Google, YouTube, Moneysupermarket and Rightmove – muscled in as middlemen to take a significant share of revenues. The report, by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, argues that broadcasting could be controlled by one or two “super-aggregators” that would act as viewing gateways for consumers looking for a simple way to access a plethora of content. The modern TV viewer now has an array of viewing options to choose from, with the BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube among the platforms vying for the attention of British households. More than 20% of under-35s use more than seven services to keep up with their favourite shows, and 40% say they are becoming confused by how many options are available, according to an OC&amp;C survey. “Viewers are facing a complex web of different routes to access TV content, leading to an unsustainable level of confusion and inconvenience,” says Mostyn Goodwin, partner at OC&amp;C. “This environment is giving rise to the need for a super-aggregator service that provides a universal access point to content.” The report estimates that the UK broadcast industry – which include the TV businesses of the likes of Sky and BT, ITV, Channel 4 as well as the BBC’s licence fee and commercial income – is worth up to to £15bn in revenues annually, including advertising revenues and pay-TV subscriptions. OC&amp;C based the £1bn loss figure – equivalent to the TV industry’s annual profit from broadcasting activities – on an analysis of the proportion of revenue that middlemen, or aggregators, have taken from traditional players in other sectors. These vary from 5% to 10% in the insurance industry, which has players including moneysupermarket, to 20% in the taxi sector following the rise of Uber, to 20%-30% in music and news. “This is not theoretical, in other industries we have seen how powerful these aggregators can become,” said Goodwin. The report identifies Amazon, Facebook and YouTube, each of whom have enormous global user bases, as being potential middlemen for TV viewing and the biggest threats to traditional TV broadcasters. In May, Amazon unveiled plans to expand its TV ambitions by adding 40 TV channels to its UK streaming service, including ITV and live sport such as Grand Slam tennis and the Olympics. Earlier this month Facebook launched a new TV-like rival Watch, and Google-owned YouTube has a TV channel service as well as subscription product Red. In the music sector, the world’s biggest record companies frequently complain about YouTube – by far the biggest destination for music video viewing – arguing that it has too much power and does not pay its fair share of royalties. Earlier this year, Steve Cooper, Warner Music’s chief executive, renewed the company’s deal with YouTube but complained it was struck under “very difficult circumstances” and wasn’t done under “free market” conditions. “It is about the balance of power,” says Goodwin. “At first there may not be much of a charge [to appear on an aggregator platform], commercial negotiations are easy as the digital players want to grow their businesses. Over time, as they grow scale, the nature of the deals can change. What choices the broadcasters make now will define what scale of ‘problem’ they will face.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/27/brexit-the-musical-satire-can-save-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"Brexit the Musical: in Edinburgh, I understood how farce can be more persuasive than argument","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/brexit-the-musical-satire-can-save-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/brexit-the-musical-satire-can-save-us","fields":{"headline":"Brexit the Musical: in Edinburgh, I understood how farce can be more persuasive than argument","bodyText":"The Edinburgh festival fringe at its peak mounts more than 1,800 shows a day, but this year from my sample it was Brexit the Musical that really caught my imagination. From the first scene, where a Boris Johnson in Union Jack underpants realises with horror that Leave has won – “ We will bugger the economy,” he sings – to the last, where he and his sidekick “Govey” finally discover the plan that will save them and the country from “catastrophe”, you are ever more uncomfortably aware that however effective a Brexit satire, it is trumped by Brexit truth. This joyful assault on bumbling, hypocritical Tory politicians completely at sea faced with the forces they have unleashed never misses its target. The portrayal of limelight-loving Andrea Leadsom as vaingloriously prejudiced and supremely ignorant particularly resonates – as does a David Cameron who, after his resignation, no longer has to pretend he likes ordinary people. A Boris Johnson who bounces with effortless unjustified self-confidence from debacle to debacle is also more than recognisable – the buffoon-in-chief in a cast of buffoons. You find yourself shaking your head in disbelief at the familiar follies, even while you laugh. The generosity of the writing makes the characters all too human prisoners of their own idiocy. Yet these are the people and party who run the country: why is such a shower not exposed to more satire and mockery? It would be so much better if we did not have to live through the consequences of Brexit, but too many people are emotionally invested in the Brexit case to allow argument, facts and reason to change their minds. Satire – showing how the project and people behind it are completely farcical – has the better chance of persuading millions in any imminent electoral or second referendum test that they have been sold a pup and must save themselves from both the perpetrators and the wreckage. Yet Chris Bryant, the musical’s author, could not have anticipated the position papers that the government has published over the past fortnight in which it is becoming clear that the planned special and deep relationship that it wants with the EU is to become a shadow member – with no control. Britain will shadow the EU’s product regulations and the bulk of EU law; it will respect indirectly the judgments of the European court of justice; freedom of movement will continue; we will create a shadow customs union; the border with Ireland will remain open. And we will pay a bumper cheque, as even Boris Johnson now recognises, for the privilege. The Brexiters will be able to say we have left the EU, when in fact we will be shadow EU members with even less of a voice than Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland. It is one of the great cock-ups in British political history. The reasons why are obvious. There is no viable option but to stay as close to the EU as possible. Every key economic constituency – trade unions, universities, technology startups, manufacturing, including the food and drink industries, the City, agriculture, the creative industries, the NHS, the big four accountancy partnerships and magic circle law firms, foreign direct investors – are losers from leaving the EU. The property market is freezing. Real incomes are under pressure. The pound – now a “toilet currency” – is close to parity with the euro. The Tory party – for it is the Tory party that has created this mess – is fearful for its very future. Nor are there huge easy trade deals to compensate for the loss of European markets. China, pledged to create Made in China 2025, is no soft touch; nor is India; and the US has long wanted to open up British agriculture and public services to US multinationals. Dr Liam Fox, surely one of the most inadequate politicians to hold high office since 1945, has simply no idea of the dynamics of world trade nor the likely negotiating position of his cherished non-European counterparts. He is as vapid as Brexit the Musical’s Andrea Leadsom. For perhaps the biggest message from the show is that there is no wider cultural constituency for Brexit. The Foxs and Leadsoms are cultural oddities. It is true that some of England’s poorest areas – eight of northern Europe’s 10 poorest regions are in England – voted Brexit, but this should be understood as a proper protest against a status quo that provides so little for them. The millions of disadvantaged are not natural allies of Johnson, “Govey” or now Jacob Rees-Mogg. As we reach 2018 it will be game on: there is a potential majority in the House of Commons for at the very least insisting on a referendum on the final deal – being a shadow EU member with no say or control – or maybe even stopping the process completely with a second general election. Great countries don’t go over cliffs without some attempt at saving themselves. This parliamentary majority can only be unlocked by the Labour leadership changing its position of studied ambiguity, building on the piece written by Keir Starmer in these pages today. National and party interest are aligned – one of the happiest positions for any politician. Privately, a number of former Brexiters in business and the media regard the whole exercise as an unfolding disaster. Blair and Brown were permanently frightened of the right: Corbyn, especially now, does not have to follow the same callow path. But when we’re faced with the next test of public opinion, however it happens, the economic case for continued EU membership and having a say in its rule-making has to be rammed home, along with the high ground argument about making common cause with European countries who share our values against the world’s Donald Trumps and President Xis. But above all, let’s make the EU case full of hope – and, on top, a carnival of fun and mockery. There must be multiple versions of Brexit the Musical mounted in every pro-Leave constituency in the country, continually revised as every twist and turn in the story becomes ever more incredible. Every old people’s home, every ex-mining or ex-steel town, every seaside resort fearful of immigration should see the show and laugh at Brexit. Let’s smile our way to victory – and use satire, that most British of reflexes, to consign Brexiters to history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/27/austin-immigration-protest-trump-daca-dreamers","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T13:28:59Z","webTitle":"Texas set for protests over SB4 law and Trump threat to Dreamer protection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/27/austin-immigration-protest-trump-daca-dreamers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/27/austin-immigration-protest-trump-daca-dreamers","fields":{"headline":"Texas set for protests over SB4 law and Trump threat to Dreamer protection","bodyText":"Activists in Texas are preparing to launch protests on two fronts, with a harsh immigration law set to come into effect just as fears grow that Donald Trump will end a programme that gives protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. NBC News reported on Friday that Trump “appears likely to pull the plug” on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy started by the Obama administration in 2012. About 800,000 young people who were brought by their parents to the US before they were 16 and who have lived in the country since 2007 – known colloquially as “Dreamers” – have been granted relief from deportation. It is a status that must be renewed every two years. Most live in California or Texas. Trump pledged on the campaign trail to eliminate the programme and it has seemed at risk since he took power and pursued a slew of tough immigration policies. He said at a news conference in February he would “deal with Daca with heart”, but Texas is among a group of 10 Republican-led states pressuring the administration to end Daca. In 2014, Texas led a coalition of states that successfully sued to stop the implementation of another Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (Dapa). The Trump administration formally scrapped Dapa in June. A couple weeks later, Texas’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, wrote to Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, calling for Daca to be phased out. “Just like Dapa, Daca unilaterally confers eligibility for work authorization and lawful presence without any statutory authorization from Congress,” Paxton and the other signatories wrote. The letter threatens legal action if steps to dismantle Daca are not under way by 5 September. Three days before then, immigrant rights groups are planning a march and concert in Austin to follow a rally on 1 September, the day state law SB4 is scheduled to go into effect – barring a possible ruling from a federal judge who is considering whether to block it. Signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in May, on Facebook Live and with almost no notice, SB4 effectively outlaws so-called sanctuary cities – places where local law enforcement limits or refuses co-operation with federal immigration agents – and gives police the right to ask the immigration status of people they detain. The measure has inspired a number of resistance events, including teenage girls in dresses holding a quinceañera at the capitol in July. “I think SB4 has had a huge impact on mobilising, and not just immigrants,” said Tania Mejia of Jolt, a Texas-based group aiming to raise Latino voter turnout. “Our mission is to get more Latinos engaged in the political process. “While we do have Daca recipients and undocumented immigrants, the majority of our youth members have been born here in Texas.” Mona Ramirez, a Jolt activist, was born in Mexico and brought to the US aged six. She did not know she was undocumented until she was in high school. Now 24, she and her three siblings are Daca recipients and she has a young daughter who is a US citizen. She worries that SB4 and the possible end of Daca increase the risk of her family being split up through deportations. “I come from a mixed-status family so there’s always been this [anxiety over] what happens when half of the family’s no longer there,” Ramirez said. “I’ve felt like my life has been played with since I arrived here. “They just give us a little crumb to calm us down for a little bit and then we just kind of like wait until the next time that they want to use us for their political games. “I am super-scared, I don’t know what’s going to happen, I am really angry too. Angry that these politicians think our lives simply don’t matter because we are not from here.” Greg Casar, an Austin city council member, is concerned that after the backlash to Trump’s much-criticised response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville earlier this month, the president will revert to a familiar theme that plays well with his base: demonising immigrants, this time Daca holders. “Any time that Donald Trump gets in trouble for just being himself it’s immigrant communities who suffer,” Casar said. On Friday night, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Phoenix-area sheriff who was convicted of contempt of court over his refusal to stop racially profiling Latinos in Arizona. A Texas-born son of Mexican immigrants, Casar was one of a group of demonstrators arrested for trespassing in May during a sit-in at Abbott’s office to protest SB4. Proponents say the measure supports the rule of law, but it is opposed by police chiefs in big cities on the basis that it will erode community trust and lead to more reluctance to report crimes. Critics also argue that minor events such as traffic stops will become a gateway to racial profiling and increased deportations. Texas’s biggest cities – Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin – as well as other local entities have joined a lawsuit against SB4 that was heard in June by Orlando Garcia, a federal district judge in San Antonio. Activists are hopeful that Garcia will rule the law unconstitutional this week. Casar said that it has already had consequences: given the state’s growing anti-immigrant political climate and the threat posed by the new law, some undocumented people have moved. “Some already left Texas [for] other states in the south west that are seen as less dangerous for them to live in, which is horrible and saddening but I understand it,” he said. “Even if we are able to block it there’s still so much work that has to be done to defeat the root causes of why this law exists in the first place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/26/student-charged-with-assault-over-attack-at-australian-national-university","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T04:03:41Z","webTitle":"Student charged with assault over attack at Australian National University","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/26/student-charged-with-assault-over-attack-at-australian-national-university","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/26/student-charged-with-assault-over-attack-at-australian-national-university","fields":{"headline":"Student charged with assault over attack at Australian National University","bodyText":"A student who allegedly attacked an Australian National University lecturer with a baseball bat on Friday has been referred for mental health assessment. Alex Ophel, 18, fronted the ACT magistrates court on Saturday morning after being charged with several counts of assault, including intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm. Police allege he sprung from his seat during a statistics class in Canberra on Friday morning and approached the female lecturer with the bat. A group of students tried to intervene and restrain him, and were injured in the process. Four were taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries, including broken bones. The defendant, represented by his lawyer Tim Sharman, was not required to enter a plea on Saturday. He said nothing during his brief appearance, and fronted the court wearing blue police forensic overalls. He was handcuffed and without shoes. The defendant was referred for a mental health assessment on Saturday, under section 309 of the ACT’s crimes act. The law allows for defendants to be taken to a health facility for clinical examination, to determine whether they need immediate mental health treatment. It is not known when he will return to court. The alleged incident was expected to prompt additional security at the ANU’s open day on Saturday. On Friday, the university’s deputy-vice chancellor, Marnie Hughes-Warrington, described the attack as “isolated and random”. “The second thing I want to do is to acknowledge the remarkable bravery of our students and our staff during this incident,” Hughes-Warrington said. “This was a very, very unusual incident in Canberra. We know one another, we care for one another, and our highest priority is to look after one another.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/everyman/3702","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:00:28Z","webTitle":"Everyman crossword No 3,702","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/everyman/3702","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/everyman/3702","fields":{"headline":"Everyman crossword No 3,702","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/26/texas-cities-catastrophic-flooding-hurricane-harvey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T05:39:02Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Harvey claims second victim in Texas as threat of flooding rises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/26/texas-cities-catastrophic-flooding-hurricane-harvey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/26/texas-cities-catastrophic-flooding-hurricane-harvey","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Harvey claims second victim in Texas as threat of flooding rises","bodyText":"Hurricane Harvey has killed a second person in Texas as the strongest hurricane to hit the US in 13 years continued to bring torrential rain, and with it the risk of catastrophic flooding to Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city. The second fatality was a woman who died after she drove into flooded streets on Houston’s west side late on Saturday. It appeared she got out of her vehicle in high waters and her body was found a short distance away by neighbours, said emergency authorities. More than 2300,000 customers across Texas were still without electricity as Harvey threatened to stall, setting up for several days of rainfall that could tally 50in (127cm), more than 4ft (1.2m), by Wednesday in some spots. Texas governor Greg Abbott said about 20in (50.8cm) of rain had fallen in the Corpus Christi area and 16in (40.6cm) in the Houston region. “There is the potential for very dramatic flooding,” he said in an afternoon media conference in Austin. “Our biggest concern is the possibility of between 20 and 30 more inches of rain in areas ranging from Corpus Christi over to Houston.” Abbott expanded his declaration of a state of disaster by 20 counties, to 50. Numbers of injuries and fatalities were not yet clear, he said. In the small seaside town of Rockport, which was directly in Harvey’s path when it came ashore and was particularly badly hit. One person was killed in a house fire, the mayor said. The Coast Guard reported that helicopters rescued 18 people from boats and barges in distress. Dozens of Houston-area roads were reported flooded. As of midday, 704 flight cancellations had been announced at George Bush Intercontinental airport and 123 at Hobby, though a break in bad weather allowed departures to resume at Bush. Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said on Twitter that the storm was transitioning into a “deadly inland event”. In a Saturday morning update, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that though winds had slowed to a maximum 80mph, Harvey was “moving slowly over Texas producing torrential rains … catastrophic flooding expected over the next few days”. Houston, about 200 miles north-east of where Harvey made landfall, began seeing wind and rain on Friday. It is notoriously flood-prone and more than 6.5m people live in the metropolitan area. Though officials decided against ordering a mass evacuation from central Houston, voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued on Saturday for parts to the south west, near two rivers in Fort Bend County. Levels in Houston’s bayous were increasing, giving rise to the prospect that they will burst their banks if the rain continues as predicted. “This is just day one,” Houston mayor Sylvester Turner told Good Morning America. “We anticipate a lot of rain over the next four or five days.” Traffic was light in the city and many stores were closed, though an exception was a doughnut shop in the suburb of Katy, where Don Mach and his Keeshond dog, Bo, were having breakfast. Mach said he was “very concerned” about Harvey. “We got 5.5in of rain last night. That came down probably in about four hours,” the 70-year-old said. “That water can only go so many places.” Oil companies began shutting down operations in and along the Gulf in anticipation of the storm, and gas prices rose. There was anxiety that Harvey could provoke flooding to hit the region’s vast refining and petrochemical facilities and unleash toxic discharges into adjacent communities or Galveston Bay. Juan Parras, an environmental campaigner in east Houston, said he was worried severe flooding or a storm surge could cause leaks or dislodge chemical tanks. “When they move off their concrete base all that oil, whatever’s in those tanks, just goes out into the community and we have a lot of tanks here,” he said. “We have almost a 52-mile stretch of nothing but refineries and oil tanks.” Neighbourhoods closest to the plants are some of the least-affluent and most-polluted in the region. “The worst off will be hit the hardest,” Parras said. Harvey made landfall near Corpus Christi late on Friday as a category 4 hurricane with maximum winds of 130mph. It was the first category 4 storm in the US since 2004 when Charley menaced Florida; Texas had not endured such a powerful hurricane since Carla in 1961. Harvey was downgraded to a tropical storm after battering Rockport and another seaside town, Port Aransas. Reports indicated severe damage to infrastructure and buildings including a high school, a hotel and a senior living complex where a roof collapsed. Rockport’s mayor pro tem had urged locals to evacuate and told a reporter that those who remained should write their name and social security number in felt pen on their arms, implying this would make it easier for emergency responders to identify their bodies. Corpus Christi police said road debris and downed power lines were widespread and that an alleged intruder was taken to hospital after being shot by a homeowner. City officials advised residents to boil water. The city of Victoria, 30 miles inland, was also badly hit. Shelters were set up as far north as Dallas. Harvey is the first major natural disaster of the Trump administration. Donald Trump’s proposed federal budget calls for a $667m cut to Fema funding, but the president was eager to give the impression he was ready for the challenge. “Closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey from Camp David. We are leaving nothing to chance. City, State and Federal Govs. working great together!” he tweeted on Saturday. A day earlier, Trump said he signed a disaster declaration to speed access to federal help. The president’s attentiveness came after Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, warned him not to repeat the mistakes of George W Bush, whose inept response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 came to define his presidency. Trump should “keep on top of hurricane Harvey”, Grassley tweeted, adding: “Dont mke same mistake Pres Bush made w Katrina.” Trump responded that he had received Grassley’s message “loud and clear. We have fantastic people on the ground, got there long before #Harvey. So far, so good!” Coastal areas remained vulnerable to storm surge, while the storm spawned several brief tornadoes in the Houston suburbs. One struck Sienna Plantation early on Saturday, ripping roofs at dozens of homes. After some neighbourhoods enjoyed a respite from the rains on Saturday afternoon, they returned to drench western areas in the evening, edging flood control reservoirs closer to their capacities and prompting more official warnings of potential flash floods and tornadoes. One conservation group, meanwhile, warned residents to leave some displaced residents alone. “Alligators can not stay in fast moving floodwaters for long and seek slow water to ride out the storm,” The Gator Squad said in a statement. “If you see a gator during the storm, as long as its not in a road or knocking on your door leave it be until the storm passes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/26/sebastian-vettel-signs-three-year-deal-ferrari-f1","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T11:28:00Z","webTitle":"Sebastian Vettel signs three-year deal with Ferrari to end speculation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/26/sebastian-vettel-signs-three-year-deal-ferrari-f1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/26/sebastian-vettel-signs-three-year-deal-ferrari-f1","fields":{"headline":"Sebastian Vettel signs three-year deal with Ferrari to end speculation","bodyText":"Sebastian Vettel has signed a new contract with Ferrari, tying the German to the team for a further three years until the end of the 2020 season. Vettel’s contract was due to end this season and on Thursday he had said he did not expect there to be any announcement in the next two weeks. However, clearly Ferrari wanted to make their position known as soon as the deal was concluded. Vettel said: “I love this team, I love the people working for this brand. I believe Ferrari have something unique. People talk about a legend and this legend is still alive because of the people that work for it day in and day out. If you walk down the streets of Maranello the presence of Ferrari is huge but if you meet the people working there it is even bigger. Their passion for the brand – it allows them to go an extra step compared to other teams, it is extremely great to be part of that family. It was a no-brainer to continue, we haven’t yet achieved what we want to achieve but things are looking pretty good and we have along road ahead of us.” There has been speculation over the driver market for next year but, following Tuesday’s announcement that Kimi Raikkonen has signed a deal for next season, the team have moved to ensure both their drivers are able to fully focus on the nine remaining races. Vettel, leading the championship by 14 points from Lewis Hamilton, had been expected to continue with the Scuderia for at least one more season. However, Ferrari have secured his services for a full three-year programme. The 30-year-old joined Ferrari in 2015, having won four world championships with Red Bull between 2009 and 2014. He was pleased with his first season with the team in a relatively competitive car when he won three races and finished third in the world championship. However, last year he was obviously frustrated with an underperforming car, leading to speculation about his future and links with a possible move to Mercedes. At Spa, Niki Lauda, the nonexecutive chairman at Mercedes confirmed there had been talks. “We discussed it briefly once with him, but the more competitive Ferrari goes the less the reason he would want to leave,” Lauda said. “So therefore we stopped right away a couple of months ago. Every driver, if he’s clever, talks to more than one team. Then when you negotiate you’re in a better position. That’s what he did.” Ferrari’s entry in 2017 is indeed more competitive. They adapted well to this year’s new regulations and are in a close fight with Mercedes for the title. Vettel has led at every round of the season, has four wins and has been revelling in a car that has proved competitive and superior to the Mercedes on certain tracks. Mercedes had not announced whether Valtteri Bottas, on a one-year deal, would remain with the team yet. With Vettel now committed to Ferrari, Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo under contract with Red Bull for next season and Lewis Hamilton signed to Mercedes until 2018, it looks increasingly likely that they will confirm Bottas for a further season sooner rather than later, settling the lineup at the top three teams."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/25/donald-trump-sebastian-gorka-out-white-house-breitbart","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T02:37:54Z","webTitle":"Controversial Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka out of White House job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/donald-trump-sebastian-gorka-out-white-house-breitbart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/donald-trump-sebastian-gorka-out-white-house-breitbart","fields":{"headline":"Controversial Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka out of White House job","bodyText":"Sebastian Gorka, a fringe rightwing figure with questionable foreign policy and security credentials, is no longer working for the Trump administration, a White House official said on Friday. The official said Gorka did not resign but would not elaborate on the circumstances of his departure. The New York Times reported that the president’s new chief of staff, John Kelly, had made clear that he no longer wanted Gorka in the White House, and forced him out. Gorka, the deputy assistant to the president, advised Donald Trump on national security but his responsibilities were vague. He frequently appeared as a surrogate for Trump on cable news, where he appeared to enjoy stirring controversy during his months-long tenure. Gorka has been seen in photos wearing a medal from Vitézi Rend, a Hungarian group with historical links to Nazi Germany. He claimed he only wore the medal to honour his father and has denied accusations of antisemitism. He has drawn fierce criticism for his views on Islam. He was a vocal proponent of Trump’s attempt to temporarily ban travel from six Muslim-majority countries. When a bomb exploded at a Mosque outside Minneapolis, Gorka defended Trump’s silence on the attack by suggesting that it could have been a “fake hate crime”. Liberals and progressives have long decried Gorka’s presence in the White House. In the wake of the deadly violence during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, civil rights groups called on the president to fire Gorka and Steve Bannon, who served as the president’s chief strategist until he was removed from his role last week. On Friday, Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights welcomed Gorka’s departure, calling it “long overdue”. “No one who supports white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideas should be serving in this or any administration,” Vanita Gupta, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement, pointing to two other actions the president took on Friday: signing into law a ban on transgender people serving in the military and pardoning a controversial Arizona sheriff. “Attacking patriotic transgender individuals serving in our military and pardoning Joe Arpaio on the same day as this resignation, however, makes it clear the problem is not Bannon or Gorka but the president himself.” Most recently, Gorka was forced to walk back comments that implied the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was speaking out of turn when he assured Americans that nuclear war with North Korea was not an “imminent threat”. “You should listen to the president – the idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,” Gorka said, according to a recording of the interview obtained by the Washington Post. Gorka previously wrote about national security for Breitbart News, where he worked for Bannon, who has since returned to Breitbart news as executive chairman. This article was corrected on 26 August 2017. Steve Bannon was Trump’s chief strategist, not his chief of staff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/aug/26/talking-horses-battersea-can-power-home-in-yorks-ebor","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T12:14:42Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Davy Russell cautioned and  Ebor buildup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/26/talking-horses-battersea-can-power-home-in-yorks-ebor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/26/talking-horses-battersea-can-power-home-in-yorks-ebor","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Davy Russell cautioned and  Ebor buildup","bodyText":"Russell cautioned – 1.15pm update The Turf Club has cautioned Davy Russell after examining footage from Tramore this month which appeared to show the high-profile jump jockey aiming a blow at his mount Kings Dolly at Tramore on 19 August. Footage appeared to show the jockey striking the horse at a practice flight before the Flynn Hotel Group Mares Handicap Hurdle at the Friday evening fixture, subsequently creating a stir on social media. The raceday stewards were not aware of the matter, but the Turf Club has the authority to look into the matter and take retrospective action where appropriate. The incident was fully investigated and the referrals committee convened at Killarney at midday on Saturday. Denis Egan, the Turf Club’s chief executive, told Press Association Sport: “The decision was that he [Russell] was guilty of rule 272(i) and he has been issued with a caution. “They [the referrals committee] accepted the explanation he gave, in that he wanted the horse to concentrate and that it was inappropriate to use the whip in the circumstances. He wanted the horse to concentrate and he used his hand. He accepted that was inappropriate.” PA Today’s ITV races, by Greg Wood Five of the last 10 winners of the Ebor Handicap have started at 20-1 or bigger and just one favourite has obliged since 1998. Flymetothestars seems likely to carry the uneasy mantle of favouritism for this year’s renewal but, apart from Sir Mark Prescott’s well-earned reputation as a master of the art of getting one ready for a big handicap, his overall form does not justify his price and he is drawn in stall 21. Ivan Grozny, useful both on the Flat and over hurdles for Willie Mullins, will also be popular but his form, over jumps at least, seemed to level off last season and he must defy a mark of 105. The ultra-consistent Nakeeta should not be far away and is a fair each-way chance at 14-1 but Roger Varian’s Battersea (3.35), fourth home last year from a 2lb higher mark, makes more appeal at a similar price. Unraced since May, he has gone well fresh in the past and has the useful claimer David Egan taking off another 5lb. York 1.55 Mustashry has clearly not been an easy horse to train but showed the benefit of his delayed return to action when successful in a handicap at Chelmsford last time, despite being forced very wide on the home turn. Little improvement is needed to make the step up to Group Three level here. Goodwood 2.10 Verandah looked useful when successful in a maiden first time up and has plenty of scope but Billesdon Brook is proving to be a tough and consistent juvenile for Richard Hannon and will offer a stern test for the favourite. At the likely odds, Billesdon Brook gets the nod. York 2.25 The ground was heavy at Newbury last month when Intellect spreadeagled his field in a 12-furlong handicap, which casts a little doubt on the value of the form. The time of the race was very solid, however, and, with just three runs under his belt, he could yet prove to be just as effective on a sounder surface. At around 7-1, it is a chance worth taking. Goodwood 2.45 Burnt Sugar produced his best run of the season when a close second at Thirsk last time out and, while his hold-up running style is a concern, he has done well to draw stall six. He could run a big race at a double-figure price. York 3.00 Headway raced alone and floundered on the heavy ground in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood last time, but his earlier close second in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot is a match for any form in the field and William Haggas knows what it takes to land this race, with three wins in the last 11 years. Goodwood 3.20 Lightning Spear and the lightly raced Zonderland were first and second in this race 12 months ago and may have it between them once more. The latter has more scope for further progress after just eight starts but is making his seasonal debut and could not cope with Lightning Spear’s turn of foot last season. David Simcock’s runner may just have the edge again.

Now the Royal Shakespeare Company is doing something about it by giving disadvantaged teenagers with exceptional talent the chance to be mentored by its leading players. A group of young people who might otherwise struggle to pursue a career in the theatre have been cast within an ensemble that will work at the RSC’s home in Stratford-upon-Avon. The talent development programme the Next Generation will include aspiring actors from black, Asian, minority ethnic and low-income backgrounds, many of whom have had little access to the arts but show real potential. Hannah Miller, the RSC’s casting director, said: “It’s pretty clear that the people that are working in the industry, and the way our world is represented on stage and screen, are not reflective of society as a whole. What we want to do with this and future projects is redress that by starting at the grassroots.” She added: “We want to help them believe a career as an actor could be for them – that it’s not an alien world.” Further evidence of elitism in the arts was offered in a report commissioned last year by the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, which expressed alarm at the lack of non-white performers in UK productions. His foundation will award almost £122,000 over three years towards the RSC’s Next Generation programme. The RSC selected 20 teenagers, aged 13 to 16, and a smaller group aged 16 to 18, after a series of masterclasses earlier this year and through the company’s ongoing contact with schools across the country. They will collaborate in workshops and classes in September, eventually staging a play next summer. They will be mentored by established actors, including Ray Fearon, an RSC associate who himself overcame obstacles and prejudice to become a leading player. Many will recognise him from playing Firenze the centaur in the film Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. He told the Observer that his parents could not afford to take him to the theatre, and that “drama was quite low down the list” at his school. But he started doing drama workshops near his home on the Stonebridge Estate in north-west London, and encountered the RSC through youth centres. He recalled the extraordinary encouragement of one of his English teachers who, from his own pocket, paid for the young Fearon to go to theatre productions, and another teacher who recognised his talent but warned him that he might not get certain parts because he faced a perception that “black actors can’t speak the verse”. Fearon said: “He was telling me ‘that’s what you’re going to face when you get out there. That will be your challenge’.” He added: “I went to the RSC and I became a leading actor. Those perceptions were smashed because it was a lie. Great actors – it’s got nothing to do with colour.” He now wants to pass on such inspiration by mentoring the Next Generation’s young talent.One of the participants is from Blackpool. His mother said: “This opportunity is priceless; it just doesn’t happen to people from Blackpool. It has basically opened up a world of possibility for [my son].” The RSC’s “Next Generation ACT” project focuses on actors. Similar projects for directing and backstage skills are planned. Four of the participants were educated at Lings Primary School in Northampton, whose head teacher, Leigh Wolmarans, applauded the RSC project for giving children the chance that they might not otherwise get: “The area our school serves is high in social deprivation… There’s high drug use. We have all those barriers you would say should stop a child standing up and performing on a professional stage. Aspiration’s low. It’s showing [them] that it can be done… Once they can see themselves mirrored on stage… it raises aspirations and [signals] that, if you can do that, you can face other hardships.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/11/revolutionary-not-a-liberal-radical-black-mayor-mississippi-chokwe-lumumba","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"A revolutionary, not a liberal: can a radical black mayor bring change to Mississippi?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/11/revolutionary-not-a-liberal-radical-black-mayor-mississippi-chokwe-lumumba","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/11/revolutionary-not-a-liberal-radical-black-mayor-mississippi-chokwe-lumumba","fields":{"headline":"A revolutionary, not a liberal: can a radical black mayor bring change to Mississippi?","bodyText":"The day Chokwe Lumumba’s father died in 2014, he asked for a moment to be alone in the room with the man he’d long considered his best friend. He told his dad, Chokwe Sr, then the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, all the last things he had to tell him. He prayed and asked god to put his father’s spirit into him. Then, he said, his next move became immediately apparent. “I decided at that moment, though I shared it with nobody, that I was going to run for mayor,” Lumumba said. “There were a lot of people who were hopeful under his administration, and there was a lot of fear surrounding his loss, so I wanted to restore hope for people.” The 34-year-old attorney who had “never run for junior class president, let alone mayor” now holds the keys to the state’s most populous city. He brings with him a progressive agenda and much of the leftover to-do list of his father’s administration. He sees his victory – collecting 93% of the vote in Jackson’s 6 June election – as proof that even in a deep red Republican state, and even in the age of Trump, the city’s residents are ready to move in a new progressive direction. “The citizens of Jackson have demonstrated overwhelmingly a readiness to be a progressive city and not only to correct the ills as we see them, but to be a model for the nation of what progressive leadership and collective genius can accomplish.” ‘I describe myself as a revolutionary’ It’s hard not to conjure allusions to young Obama when Lumumba walks in the room. Perhaps it’s the African-sounding name, the slightness of build or the warm smile and effortless personability. Lumumba has a beard wisped with salt and pepper streaks, and a better fitting suit than Obama did circa 2004, but otherwise the nostalgia connects. Like Obama, Lumumba spent much of his formative years around radical voices of black liberation, engrossed in community work and navigating a budding career as a gifted young black law professional before moving into the world of electoral politics. Unlike Obama, Lumumba hasn’t found voice in the post-partisan and post-racial vernacular that propelled Obama to the presidency and onwards to international respect and appeal. Lumumba is still quite unapologetic both in his political and racial language and aspirations. In explaining how he seeks to engage with his city’s police department, Lumumba quotes Malcolm X. Phrases like “self-determination”, a favorite of 1960s black power activists, enjoy a privileged place in his lexicon. Asked if he considers himself a “liberal”, Lumumba retorts, “I describe myself as a revolutionary.” On the Mississippi state flag – one which still incorporates the confederate battle flag into its design and flies all over his city – Lumumba doesn’t equivocate. “We are against the Mississippi state flag. We are against oppression and all of those monuments, relics and images that promote it or memorialize it,” Lumumba said. “So long as we are shy about speaking up against that then we’re not prepared to be the best of the new South. We’re still a part of the noose South.” Jackson is deeply steeped in that that history. The city was all but burned to the ground by Union troops during the Civil War and during reconstruction the backlash from local whites was swift. Jackson was the home of the first Mississippi “red shirts”, a postbellum white supremacist organization served as the militarized wing of a broader “Mississippi Plan” to effectively purge black Mississippians from civic life through intimidation, violence and discriminatory “black code” and Jim Crow legislation. This was part of why the state, and in particular the city of Jackson, became something of a flashpoint in the 1960s civil rights movement. Freedom rides destined for Jackson saw participants beaten and bloodied by mobs of angry whites. In 1963 Civil Rights leader Medgar Evers was shot and killed here. Its reputation as a bastion of white racism is part of what made the city attractive to a whole generation of black activists, like Lumumba’s father, who migrated from Detroit when Chokwe Jr was just five to try and create radical change. But Lumumba also seems to embody some of the pragmatism and ideological flexibility of a second generation radical. “Jackson is going to be a business friendly city. We want business to come here and want you to make a lot of money. We want you to be rich,” Lumumba said, convincingly. “However we want you to invest back in our city. We’re looking for a reciprocal relationship where those businesses see the value in our city and see the value in the people in the city.” Lumumba said that this flexibility was something he learned from his late father. Lumumba Sr is ever present in his son’s administration. His photograph hangs in city hall just above where he spoke to the Guardian, and his former chief of staff, Dr Safiya Omari has reprised her role for Lumumba Jr. Lumumba Sr was, all his life, a committed Black nationalist and activist. He was an early disciple and leader in the Republic of New Afrika, a nationalist group founded in the 1970s that sought to build an autonomous black republic in the region where the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina sit, and to collect billions of dollars in reparations from the US government for the wealth generated by US slavery on the labor of enslaved black Americans. Interestingly, the group’s ambitious political aspirations were recently fictionalized for a forthcoming Amazon Studios series called Black America. Pothole to pothole Coming from this background, Lumumba Sr’s eventual foray into Jackson’s city council and eventually the mayor’s office was hardly a given. “For quite some time I think a lot of his work was was more antagonistic to electoral politics than anything,” Lumumba said of his father. “Many of his comrades were hardliners and so people would ask him, ‘Chokwe, how do you plan on [having reparations paid] by fixing potholes’,” a common metaphor for the quotidian concerns that dominate the day to day of small city governance. “A pothole may seem like a small thing in the grand scheme, but what [Chokwe Sr] said is that ultimately we have to connect pothole to pothole and community to community so that people in Jackson, Mississippi understand why there is a community that looks just like theirs in Gary, Indiana or Detroit, Michigan, or New Orleans Louisiana,” all of which are economically depressed, predominantly black cities. “The true issue is that none of the people in those areas truly have an opportunity to dictate when a pothole is being repaired. None of them truly have self-determination. So by meeting people where they are and addressing those concerns, we’re able to have larger discussions about how we develop and create a new society.” That was the type of vision that got the elder Lumumba elected in 2013. He promised citizen-centered government and passionately sold residents, black and white alike, on a tax increase to rebuild the city’s crumbling infrastructure. But just eight months into his term, Lumumba died unexpectedly of an aortic aneurysm at age 66, leaving both the city and his then 31-year-old son to grieve. Lumumba Jr ran for his father’s seat in 2013 but lost a close election to Tony Yarber, then the city council president and a more seasoned Jackson politician, a loss he says he’s gained a lot of strength from.“It better prepared me to understand the condition of the city,” he said. Defeating Yarber in this year’s democratic primary 55% to 5% was a much less metaphorical success. It all but guaranteed him the mayorship in the predominantly black, strongly Democratic city of Jackson. Less than two months since inauguration, Lumumba is putting the pieces of his administration together and still often speaks in the meta-transformational language that campaigns thrive on, waxing poetic on “collective genius”, “people-centered government” and on how his election really belongs to the people. “I don’t believe that we’re going to bring Jackson into a better place because I have all of the ideas, but because we’re willing as an administration to listen to other people,” he said, outlining his hopes to build an inclusive budget-writing process for the next cycle. What Jackson and hopeful progressives around the country now wait to see, is whether or not that energy and intention will translate to “filling the potholes” and getting the proverbial trains to run on time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/25/patriot-prayer-san-francisco-rally-cancelled-dog-poo","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T23:26:07Z","webTitle":"Party poopers: rightwing rally cancelled in San Francisco amid dog poo protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/patriot-prayer-san-francisco-rally-cancelled-dog-poo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/patriot-prayer-san-francisco-rally-cancelled-dog-poo","fields":{"headline":"Party poopers: rightwing rally cancelled in San Francisco amid dog poo protest","bodyText":"Patriot Prayer, the rightwing protest group that planned to rally in San Francisco on Saturday, has cancelled its event, citing safety concerns and a “smear campaign” by elected officials who called them “white supremacists”. The group said it still intended to attend a rally on Sunday in nearby Berkeley, which has seen a number of violent standoffs between rightwing protesters and anti-fascist activists this year. “We’re going to put our effort and resources into Berkeley,” Patriot Prayer organizer Joey Gibson said in a Facebook Live broadcast. “Berkeley is a better situation because we don’t feel that we’re walking into a trap.” However, shortly after, the organizer of the Berkeley rally released a statement urging people not to come to her “No to Marxism in America” rally. Andrea Cummings said she was concerned for the safety of the people who might come to the event. Thousands of San Franciscans were planning to mount counter-protests against the rightwing event, with residents planning to dance, march, rally, and boat in defiance of rightwing extremism. Several hundred people even announced a plan to allow their dogs to poo on the protest site in advance of the event. The group’s intention to hold an event in the notoriously liberal San Francisco provoked considerable concern from the city’s elected officials, police, and residents, especially in the wake of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Though Gibson has denounced white supremacy and neo-Nazis, Patriot Prayer events in the Pacific north-west have been attended by members of white nationalist groups and often devolved into violent street-fighting. Elected officials, including House minority leader and San Francisco congressional representative Nancy Pelosi and mayor Ed Lee, unsuccessfully pressured the National Park Service to deny the group a permit for the rally. Pelosi called the group “white supremacist”. Such characterizations amounted to a “smear campaign”, the organizers said. “Intermingling of protesters and rally-goers would be a horrible horrible idea,” said Patriot Prayer member Gabriel Silva. “It would lead to nothing but casualties.” “In our opinion,” said Gibson, “it seems like it would have been a huge riot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/aug/26/all-blacks-v-wallabies-second-bledisloe-cuprugby-championship-test-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T10:04:42Z","webTitle":"All Blacks snatch Bledisloe win from Wallabies in dying moments – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/aug/26/all-blacks-v-wallabies-second-bledisloe-cuprugby-championship-test-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/aug/26/all-blacks-v-wallabies-second-bledisloe-cuprugby-championship-test-live","fields":{"headline":"All Blacks snatch 35-29 Bledisloe win from Wallabies in dying moments – as it happened","bodyText":"Final thoughts This was expected to be another NZ cake-walk, a pavlova parade if you will. But after getting off to a lightning start that saw Israel Folau score within a minute, and then the Aussies race out to a 17-0 lead in even time, New Zealand dragged themselves back into the contest. After dropping the ball far too often early on, the ABs started to dominate possession and, though the Wallabies defended stoutly, they couldn’t hold on during the second half in which they conceded one penalty after another. But a truly memorable Wallabies win was within reach when Beale scored under the posts in the 76th minute but the All Blacks had time for a killer reply. As they always seem to do. Thanks for your company. Hope you enjoyed the show. Cheerio. It was five tries apiece tonight. The difference was the goal-kicking. Five conversions to Barrett, just two from five from Foley who also missed a penalty conversion. But let’s not forget that the All Blacks came back from 0-17 down. Some effort that. And to have the presence of mind, and the skills, to score the match-winning try after going behind with four minutes to go. You’ve got to hand it to them. “It was close to a fantastic performance,” says Hooper during the presentation. “We’re learning, were growing each week, and tonight was a big step.” Kieran Reed then steps forward to receive the Bledisloe Cup. “That’s what the Bledisloe Cup is about. Congratulations to the Australians on a great performance tonight. We had to dig deep.” So that’s another Bledisloe Cup wrapped up. New Zealand continue to hold the cup they regained possession of in 2013. New Zealand won the game but the Wallabies’ effort will dominate the news. It’s all over! What a thrilling match! New Zealand are ecstatic! Australia gutted. After what happened last week, after everyone writing them off, they almost pulled off what would have been the biggest Bledisloe upset in some time. 80 min: The Wallabies need to win possession from the kickoff but they can’t manage it. NZ need to play it out here... what a finish to this game! The ABs’ lead is back out to six. And that’s why the ABs are the world’s best! Regaining possession from the kickoff, they work the ball to the Aussie 22m. Then they explode into action. Going right Sopoaga passes to Scott Barrett who passes to Read who makes a lovely inside ball to a charging Perenara. He draws the fullback and finds Barrett backing up on his outside. Barrett scores under the posts! No even an out-of-form Foley would miss that. Aussies back in front! That was so simple. From a ruck on the NZ line Genia passed to Beale on his right and, with Whitelock holding off him, Beale said thank you very much, sport, and ducked through a yawning gap and scored under the posts! 75 min: NZ offside from a midfield bomb. Reece Hodge, off the bench, takes the touch finder and does a great job. Australia on the attack from 10m out. The mercurial 5/8 makes no mistake but the Wallabies are still within a converted try. They’d be ahead if Foley had kicked all his chances. On the 19th phase Ioane races into space. He’s hauled down but the ABs then go right and put it through the hands. McKenzie sucks Kuridrani out of the line and it creates enough space for Ben Smith to race unopposed to the line! 69 min: Seven phases get the ABs to the halfway line before a dash from Smith on the right wing threatens momentarily. The ABs maintain possession but the gold defence is holding, holding, holding. After last week this has been a tremendous comeback by the Aussies no matter what happens now. 68 min: Foley misses from 10m to the left of the uprights, striking the uprights for the third time this match! His goal kicking has been awful today. Genia picks up from the ruck, scoots around its east coast, dummies to the man on his outside and creates enough room for himself to run 15m to score! What a response from the Aussies! 66 min: McMahon and Hooper combine well to haul the tired Wallabies to the halfway line. The Australians then work their way to the NZ 22m. 65 min: Five phases in and Barrett pops through the Aussie line like an apparition through the wall of a haunted house. He then grubbers ahead for himself but he can’t win the race to the ball. Lovely stuff from Barrett. 64 min: Crotty is groggy after catching the hip of a charging Folau. Kiwi scrum being set 40m from Australia’s line. From 10m inside the left touchline Barrett knocks it over. That try was coming. Four times the ABs knocked back a penalty attempt this half. On the fourth occasion they made their adventure count. From the scrum the All Blacks go the short side and Smith evades Foley to find Barrett running a nice line. Too easy! The All Blacks are ahead for the first time tonight. 61 min: As we wait an age for the scrum Niall writes in to praise the Aussies: “Still think the ABs will run over the top but Wallabies are showing some ‘grit’.” 60 min: Australia offside as NZ attack their line! The Aussies have barely touched the ball this half. Can they hold on? Another AB scrum 5m out from their line. 58 min: The Wallabies breathe easy momentarily but the All Blacks are again pouring towards their line like an oil slick. Another penalty to NZ who have been awarded 8 of the last 9 penalties! Most, no doubt, due to Australia’s efforts to stifle their play. Some, however, have the whiff of mystery about them. But that’s rugby. 56 min: The Aussie scrum holds, Smith fires the ball to a charging Williams. Beale is in his face, takes a big hit and emerges from the collision with the ball in his arms! Huge effort from the Australian. 55 min: But a penalty has been found from somewhere and the All Blacks will set up a scrum 5m out, 5m inside the right touchline. From a lineout Savea burrows close to the line before, from a mess of a ruck, Retallick rises from the mess of bodies with his finger in the air. A try is given before we go back to check... there was an Aussie arm under the ball as Retallick wrestled his way over the line but to me it was impossible to tell if it hit the turf. 53 min: Penalty to NZ from 40m out from the Aussie posts. They turn down the likely three points. Great stuff. I love a team backing themselves. 50 min: NZ on the attack now and the crowd rise. Aaron Smith, to Ben Smith to Squire, a long charge downfield. But the Aussies scramble well and, on their 22m, force a mistake from the ABs. 48 min: 40m out from NZ line Foley steps inside Williams. Not enough to beat him but enough to find a pass to Kuridrani who knocks on. The All Blacks counter right and only a fine tackle from Speight prevents Ben Smith from going on a potentially long damaging run down the right wing. This has become an end-to-end game now. 46 min: The All Blacks push downfield and then, on the left, Ioane bursts into the clear 30m out! But he’s ankle tapped by Genia. From the next play Moody’s pass is intercepted by Beale who immediately lobs it out to Speight. From inside his own 22m Speight boots it downfield. 44 min: Oh, so close! From a scrum on the AB 22m the Wallabies go right and Folau stands up Barrett cold. In space, from 5m out, Folau looks inside for Haylett-Petty but the pass is intercepted by Squire. Barrett has gone off with a head injury. Can’t be too serious as he jogged off unaided. 42 min: A relieving penalty to Australia inside their own half. The ABs were on the charge but Owen Franks was penalised for obstructing the defence after he ran into two gold jerseys in the defensive line. And the Wallabies kick off... Phew! What an action-packed, mad-cap half of rugby. After a lightning start by the Aussies, the All Blacks have pegged them back and you’d back them to go on with it now. An easy one for Barrett and that’s oranges. ... and Smith picks up, steps inside Hooper, and crashes over! Despair for the Wallabies to concede on the halftime bell but at least that removes any potential controversy from Smith’s effort moments earlier. 40 min: Another penalty 5m out to the ABs! The Aussies hold the AB scrum momentarily before folding ... 40 min: Massive escape for the Wallabies! After surviving Sonny Bill Williams’ charge tiny Aaron Smith burrows through the defence and finds a way to reach out with his right arm and seemingly force the ball next to the padding of the right upright. The ref goes upstairs to check and it’s determined that Smith just lost control at the last moment. A try every day of the week in rugby league, that, but not here. Smith’s hand certainly rolled to the side of the ball but I didn’t see daylight between his hand and the ball at any time. 38 min: But the ref’s assistant has spotted an Aussie infringement and it’s another penalty to the ABs from the same position, 5m out. Not sure what the infringement was for. Something to do with Julie Bishop, I expect. 37 min: The Blacks choose to scrum 5m out. After a big shove by the ABs the ball comes out from under Read’s boot and catches Smith unawares. He knocks on! 35 min: From a mid-field penalty Barrett finds touch on the Aussie 22m. Here come the ABs pouring forward. But Barrett loses patience on just the fifth phase and, as such, attempts a grubber kick in behind for his right winger. But he doesn’t get enough on it and Genia pulls it in. But Genia is penalised for not releasing. 33 min: From the scrum Beale drops it and the ABs counter attack beautifully, Barrett finding McKenize who stretches the Aussie defence on the wing. On the next phase Barrett races through a hole and finds Lienert-Brown on his inside before Genia ankle taps him. Great scrambling defence by the Aussies. 32 min: The Aussies cut loose and some slight passing sees Kuridrani motor down the right wing. He’s pulled down but moments later the Aussies win a scrum put-in just 10m out from the Kiwi line. 28 min: Foley leaves his kicking boots in the sheds (1 from 4 now), hitting the right upright. But it rebounds back into the field of play and the Aussies come oh so close to scoring but for a tiny knock-on by Speight. 26 min: The Wallabies attack the left edge and on their 12th phase get to the ABs 22m. On the next phase the Wallabies turn it over as they spin it right. But the ball hits the ground and Ioane pounces and sets off for the line with no-one near him! Here’s a try! But he’s called back! Folau was tackled before receiving the ball by Crotty, preventing Folau from catching the ball prior to Ioane’s interception. Penalty to Australia. 23 min: We’re spending a lot of time examining a video of a Wallaby forward landing on his head at the ruck. Retallick, it is finally determined, accidentally lifted the Wallaby forward as he rose from the ground causing him to be upended. Hooper not impressed: “So we’re allowed to lift players by the legs and drop them on their head?” he asks the ref. “There was no lift,” the ref explains. “It was accidental.” It’s from over the black dot, as they say in league, but he squeezes it over. The All Blacks are finally on the board! After winning the lineout Dane Coles sits at the back of a maul rolling towards the line. When it gets to a metre out Coles hands off to Smith who shapes to pass right but throws a short ball over his left shoulder to Ioane who crashes over. 20 min: Wallabies pinged for offside when, a metre out, Smith passes from the back of a maul into the backside of Hannigan. A great interception by Hannigan’s can. Had it not intervened Ioane may have been in in the corner. 18 min: Six handling errors by the All Blacks. Now seven. From the turn-over Foley kicks deep and McKenzie, I think it was, returns the favour. Now the Wallabies turn it over, Beale not rolling away from the ball. It came off Genia’s knee, not his hand, so no knock-on. Another try to Australia!! Bloody hell. Who saw this coming? It’s as if the All Blacks just thought they had to turn up to win. Foley misses the relatively easy conversion. That could be costly. 17 min: The ABs push the Aussies off the ball but it pops out to Genia who scoots around the flank of the scrum and races downfield. As the defence hauls him in he passes outside to Hooper. He then offloads to Foley who races 20m to score! Or did he? Genia might have knocked on at the back of the scrum. We’ve gone to the video ref... 14 min: After a dangerous attack from the Aussies Folau drops the ball in traffic and the ABs recycle, spinning it left. Ioane gets through the defensive line but before he can scoot clear Haylett-Petty rides him like a backpack full of text books. Ioane can’t carry such weight and falls. From the ruck the ABs knock on. After missing his first shot Foley converts this, easier, one from 10m to the left of the posts. The scrum disintegrates and through a mess of bodies Hooper emerges and strolls over! What a start for the embattled Aussies! 10 min: Line-out win to Australia 25m out and Foley bombs to Folau’s wing where he looks to out-leap his opposite number. The ball comes off McKenzie and bounces into touch, 5m out from the ABs line. 7 min: The All Blacks attack Australia’s right edge, Ioane prominent. On their 1oth phase of attack they knock it on and Beale roosts the ball to the touchline. After the Blacks win the lineout Sonny Bill Williams, running onto a flat ball passed a little behind him, spills it. 5 min: The ABs win a scrum against the feed 10m out from the Aussie line and they go left sharpish. Ioane gets the ball on the wing a few metres out but his attempt at an inside ball is knocked into touch. 3 min: The Wallabies turn over the restart. They’ll need to get their kick-off receiving into shape quick smart. They can’t rely on intercept tries all night. On the Folau try, McKenzie had his eyes on an overlap on the right. Had Folau not snaffled that ball it may have been a runaway try to NZ. ... and McKenzie, chiming into the backline, throws an intercept pass to Folau who races 55m to score five metres inside the left touchline. The Aussies turn it over from the kickoff but as the Blacks spin it wide to the right ... Really does look like a wonderful stadium. I suppose any stadium where, as a spectator, you’re protected from the elements is a good one. How would it stand up to hail, I wonder? Or the haka? We’re about to find out... A rousing haka with the ABs in arrow head formation and the Aussies facing them and, if they were me, wishing they were instead, in a quiet bar with a good book. No glass fall, however. And so, with the stadium intact, we’re about to get underway... A respectful minute’s silence is held for Colin Meads. Now the anthems. So it’s an early lead to NZ: 1-0. “It’s been another week of soul searching,” says the commentary team as the teams begin to make their way onto the pitch. Some might say the Wallabies have been searching for their soul since 2004. It’s good at hiding. A chameleon if you like. Kieran Reed leads the ABs out and the crowd give him and his team a rousing reception. Say what you like about Kiwis but they don’t get sick of beating Aussies. Phil Withall writes in to offer a commentary on the commentary: “Rather enjoy the commentary team struggling to come up with a contingency plan for the delay as they discuss the contingency plans that the players would have put in place,” he says. “Good thing they don’t do the cricket...” News to hand... due to lighting issues, the kickoff will be delayed. Now scheduled for 745pm local, 5.45pm AEST. The late great All Black Colin Meads will be remembered tonight, with the home team wearing the number 5 on their sleeves: I slapped Dunedin with a wet lettuce leaf moments earlier when I compared it to Mordor. In alluding to Mordor I was, admittedly, thinking of Carisbrook, the ‘retired’ venue known as the House of Pain. These days it’s the Forsyth Barr Stadium that hosts the big games and it looks a picture, like a giant conservatory or greenhouse. Teams: As that graphic shows, the big team news for Australia was the loss of Adam Coleman. It means Rory Arnold comes in to the starting side and Izack Rodda comes onto the bench. For New Zealand, three changes to the team that cracked the Aussies on the rump with a rolled up wet towel last week. Hooker Dane Coles returns to the front row for what will be his 50th Test, with Codie Taylor shifting to the bench. Bench prop Kane Hames replaces Wyatt Crockett, while Scott Barrett is the reserve lock, in for the injured Luke Romano. If I’ve been overly negative in that preamble then feast your eyes on this: a scene from today’s Shute Shield final in Sydney between Northern Suburbs and Warringah Rats. Compared to Mordor (Dunedin) it looks positively bucolic (like Hobbiton). Just the kind of atmosphere to mold and shape a fearless, hard-nosed, desperate, down &amp; dirty rugb … oh, wait … : “Tell ‘em they’re dreaming”: That was the headline of the Otago Daily Times on the day the Wallabies arrived in Dunedin for tonight’s Bledisloe Cup clash with the All Blacks. I take issue with it. Not for its provocative nature —that’s par for the course with the NZ press when it comes to the All Blacks, as Warren Gatland would tell you— but with the idea that anyone within the Wallabies camp actually thinks that they can beat the All Blacks tonight. Who is this mysterious “them” the Otago Daily Times is referring to? If I’m wrong, if there is actual belief in the Wallabies camp, then their team psychologist needs a raise because there’s almost zero evidence to consider an upset in on the cards tonight. Last week, for instance, the Wallabies were pumped 54-34 in Sydney in the first game of the series. In the manner of stricken sailors grasping at driftwood some have suggested that those 34 points are cause for optimism but, really, the vast majority of those 34 points came after the red hot All Blacks had left the field for an early shower. If last weekend’s game (which reflected the moribund state of Australian rugby at the moment) wasn’t enough proof on its own that the Wallabies are rank outsiders tonight consider that it was the sixth consecutive time the All Blacks had beaten the Wallabies, and the sixth consecutive time they’d done so by scoring 40 or more points. Forget the diabolical form of Australia’s Super Rugby teams when it comes to playing on New Zealand soil, the Wallabies haven’t had a win across the ditch since 2001. But perhaps that’s where this so-called “dreaming” has taken root. That 2001 Wallabies win at Carisbrook in Dunedin broke a 96-year drought at the venue and, thus, proved that pain need not last forever. Could a period of abject misery similarly end for the Wallabies tonight? Or will the All Blacks sink the slipper a little deeper? One thing’s for sure. Barnaby Joyce can’t lose either way. (paul.connolly.casual@theguardian.co.uk or @PFConnolly) Kick-off: 7.35pm LOCAL (5.35pm AEST) Paul will be with us shortly. In the meantime, such is the state of Australian rugby union at the moment, you can only laugh. Can’t you?

How they must labor over those mellifluous phrases urging tolerance and love – only to see their hard work undone the minute the boss gets his hands on an electronic device. But the ones who deserve our sympathy are the American people, and the people of the world, who know that this president is mouthing pieties that he privately mocks, who know they are being lied to, and who can’t seem to make the pretense, the meanness and the hypocrisy stop. On Monday, Trump appeared before the nation to announce his plan to increase the American military presence in Afghanistan. Speaking in measured, sonorous cadences, reading from a teleprompter, Trump endeavored to sound “presidential”. He invoked a series of lofty abstractions (courage, patriotism, “mutual trust and selfless devotion”) and cited the need for national unity and brotherhood. He exhorted us to “make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name, that when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one”. The next day, addressing a rally of fervent supporters in Phoenix, Arizona, he delivered one of the most blistering rants of his career. He defended his failure to condemn the violent white supremacists who demonstrated in Charlottesville, Virginia, attacked the press with fresh fury and threatened to shut down the government unless Congress agrees to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. His phrasing (punchy, aggressive, frequently inarticulate), his vocabulary (limited) and his tone (bombastic, unhinged) could scarcely have been less like what we heard Monday night. The former director of national intelligence James Clapper publicly stated that he’d found the emergence of “the real Trump” to be “scary and disturbing” and that the Phoenix speech cast doubt on the president’s competence. On Wednesday, in Reno, Nevada, veterans who attended the National Convention of the American Legion heard a speaker who more closely resembled the Trump of Monday night – Teleprompter Trump – inform them that “we are here to draw inspiration from you as we seek to renew the bonds of loyalty that bind us together as one people and one nation”. By midweek, news commentators were asking: which is the real Donald Trump, the one reading a script from the teleprompter or the one speaking off the cuff – and from the heart? Framed like that the answer seems obvious, and yet, in some sense, it’s a specious question. Few of us have one “real” self that emerges on every occasion; the way we speak to our children is rarely the same as the way we speak to our friends. Even so, we sense that Trump means the insults, the boasts, the attacks, the inflated claims about his popularity and achievements. When he reads the words that someone else – someone who apparently thinks that we must “renew the bonds of loyalty” – has scripted, he seems like an ill-bred, unruly child, compelled by his parents to tell the neighbors that he’s sorry he broke their window, to tell his classmate that he regrets his bullying behavior, to repeat, with reluctance, the apology that his elders insist he offer. It’s interesting to read the drafts of the iconic speeches that world leaders have delivered, to track their efforts to be as clear and eloquent as possible. At the FDR Library in Hyde Park, New York, one can follow Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s revision process as he sought the most inspiriting way to inform the American people that we were going to war, the most damning phrase (he would settle on “day of infamy”) to characterize the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. More recently, American presidents less often write their own public talks, and only the most naive citizen assumes that every president is the sole author of every speech. The addresses crafted by committees – and read from teleprompters – are nothing new. What is new is a president who, speaking informally or to his “base”, sounds nothing like the person who reads aloud the words that someone else has written. What is new is the effort required not to feel insulted, not to feel we are being taken for fools when we are asked to imagine that Trump believes what he says whenever he is persuaded to sound like the president of the United States. We feel reasonably certain that the adults who convince a child to apologize for his reckless or damaging behavior will try to dissuade that child from doing further harm. But we have yet to identify the responsible adult who will gently and legally take the baseball bat, or the brick – or the nuclear option – away from the dangerous child in the White House.

After month after month working with them, I started to understand their vision. It is a very exciting project.” It is now more than five months since Li Yonghong’s Luxembourg-based holding company, Rossoneri Sport Investment, completed the €740m takeover of Milan after almost three decades under the control of the Italian media mogul and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. On Sunday, Li – who has already spent more than any of his compatriots in a spate of Chinese investment in European clubs over the past two years – is expected to make his first appearance at San Siro since attending the 2-2 draw with Internazionale in April, when the seven-times European champions meet Cagliari in their first home match of the Serie A season. Following a summer spree when Fassone and the sporting director, Massimo Mirabelli, committed more than €150m on players, including the eye-catching purchase of Leonardo Bonucci from Juventus, a 3-0 victory over Crotone last Saturday was the perfect start for one of Europe’s great clubs that have found themselves in the doldrums in recent years. Not since the 2013-14 season, when Clarence Seedorf’s side were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate by Atlético Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, have Milan played in Europe’s premier club competition. This year’s participation in the Europa League, after pipping Inter to sixth place last season under the current coach, Vincenzo Montella, is the first time they have qualified for a continental competition in three seasons. Fassone says: “We are probably the most international club in Italy – Juventus has more domestic titles but European football is in Milan’s DNA. We are pleased to have reached the Europa League because it represents an important step and it will be a priority for us this year to come back on to the international stage. But the natural home the club has to be in is the Champions League. “That’s the target that our owners have given to us. They would like to be consistently part of the Champions League in the coming years. They know that on the sporting side and on the economic side, it changes the life of a club – especially in Italy because the revenues are really impressive. We are lucky because this is the first season that Italy will have four clubs who qualify [for 2018-19] so the target is difficult, but not impossible. It represents the minimum goal that we want to achieve. The club is a giant that’s been sleeping for two or three years, but it’s like a Ferrari that’s been kept in a garage – you need to let a Ferrari out on the track to be free.” While the arrival of big names such as Bonucci (£35.2m), Portugal striker André Silva (£33.6m), the attacking midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu (£22m) of Turkey and the Croatia striker Nikola Kalinic (costing an initial €5m loan fee with Milan obliged to spend a further €20m next summer to make the move permanent) has already raised expectations among success-starved Rossoneri supporters, questions over the sustainability of the club under its new owners have refused to go away. When promised investment failed to materialise, Li instead turned to the US private equity fund Elliott Management – which has been described as a vulture fund owing to its tendency to buy up debt owed by failing companies and states including Peru, Congo-Brazzaville and Argentina at knockdown prices – for a loan of €300m, with €180m set aside to help complete the purchase of Milan and the remainder earmarked for buying players. Repayment of the whole loan is due in October 2018, with interest rates for the larger sum set at 11.5% and 7.5% for the rest, although Fassone insists that neither will be an issue. “We are already working to reimburse them and we will actually do this really early, possibly at the start of 2018,” he says. “The level of interest Milan is paying on the €120m is high of course but not terrible. If you consider the debt that Inter or Roma contracted with Goldman Sachs when they were financing, which was about 6.5%, of course this is higher but it’s not something terrible. For Chinese people, when you see interest on loans in double digits, for them it’s completely normal. “In a worst-case scenario, because a lot of fans and shareholders have been asking me this, it means that in October next year, the owners of Milan will be Elliott. “This is really the worst case but, just to ensure, the future of the club is not in the fog. No, 99% we will go ahead with Mr Li and we hope our project will be successful. But in the worst case, be relaxed because Elliott are not ‘desperados’ – it is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world that could keep the club or resell it. They would have paid only €300m, which is a very low price, and they can make business, which is their job.” Yet Li’s approach has prompted a backlash from some of his new rivals. Last month, the Roma president, James Pallotta, was forced to apologise after he accused Milan of “losing their minds” in spending so much money at a time when they have such unprecedented debts, while a Sky Italia reporter was banned last week after suggesting the club’s spending was unsustainable. “As you can imagine, I have a plan A and a plan B,” says Fassone. “To Uefa, I have presented a more conservative plan which shows a progression even if the club is still out of the Champions League next season. In that case, my investment in the market cannot be high and we would also have to consider a sale of one of our top guys. But we also have a scenario that says: ‘Marco, what happens if the club doesn’t achieve the Champions League?’ The investors and I want to be there but we are prepared if we don’t make it we will ensure that the club is protected.” In May, Elliott – who also have a stake in the French club Lille – listed two bonds on the Austrian stock market for a total value of €128m in what could end up being the first step in floating Milan. Together with a new approach to expanding their business in Asia that will lead Milan to set up a subsidiary arm known as AC Milan China to deal with marketing, licensing and commercial operations, pursuing a public listing on the stock market appears to be Li’s main tactic in his attempt to transform the finances of a club that had a consolidated net loss of €74.9m in Berlusconi’s last season. “Before new business starts, you need a couple of years when you still lose money,” says Fassone. “This year and next year, we have forecasted more losses for the club and Mr Li is taking care of this. He has increased the capital and putting money in. The fans appreciate this man who is not so visible here but is spending money. “Don’t forget this is the most expensive investment that there has been in European football after the Manchester United takeover. They hope in two or three years maximum to make the club worth double what they paid for it. But to do that we have to perform on the pitch and off the pitch.” Li is believed to own a 28% share in Renshuo’s New China Building project in Guangzhou – a 48-storey development of offices and shops that is estimated to be worth around €1bn – and has owned shares in packaging companies and phosphate mines A photograph of him and his family watching the 3-0 victory over the Macedonian side Shkendija in the first leg of the Europa League qualifier on his iPad circulated on social media last week. However, despite his heavy investment, the billionaire has been conspicuous by his absence in Milan. According to Fassone, however, he is in almost daily contact with his right-hand man, Li David Han, who “wants to know all the details of the club and all the strategies we are implementing”. “For us in Italy, for our culture, it is very different,” he adds. “For example, the habit was to have owners and presidents who were very physically present: attending the matches, attending the training sessions, doing interviews. It’s like an insurance for the fans in Italy to know who exactly the president is and know what he can do for the club. “To have a president that is not so present, that doesn’t do interviews and has a profile that is partially unknown from everyone, especially, at the beginning, has represented a partial obstacle with the fans. But what I see now the situation is different. The fans globally are really supporting the club and the new management. ““For example, on Sunday in Crotone, Mr Han Li was at the match and I saw lots of the fans wanted to have photos with him. At the beginning a few suspicious people were asking: ‘Who are these Chinese guys?’ but now it’s different. They know more about them and they see that they have invested a lot for this club. It’s not an owner who is coming in just to make a speculation, like has happened with other clubs in Italy. This is one who wants to make the club great again and is investing with his own money.” But with repayment of the loan to Elliott and a number of large financial commitments from this summer’s spending looming next year, it is clear that Montella’s new-look Milan will be under severe pressure to hit the ground running. “In the end it was our decision,” says Fassone. “We could have decided to sign three or four players this year and the same again next year, which would probably have been easier to integrate into the team, but with the sporting director we decided to make a big revolution this year. We know it may take a year or so to integrate all of the players but in this way next year we will be in a position just to change two or maybe three who do not perform in the best possible way. It’s a calculated risk, in our opinion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/25/religious-freedom-must-be-protected-before-marriage-survey-ends-liberal-senator-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T00:40:20Z","webTitle":"Religious freedom must be protected before marriage survey ends, Liberal senator says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/25/religious-freedom-must-be-protected-before-marriage-survey-ends-liberal-senator-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/25/religious-freedom-must-be-protected-before-marriage-survey-ends-liberal-senator-says","fields":{"headline":"Religious freedom must be protected before marriage survey ends, Liberal senator says","bodyText":"Parliament must decide how to protect religious freedom if same-sex marriage is legalised, and cannot wait until the marriage equality postal survey is finished, the Liberal senator James Paterson has said. The Victorian senator has called for an overhaul of anti-discrimination law to allow service providers to refuse gay weddings, telling a religious freedom forum in Perth on Thursday there will be no time to deal with the issue after the survey is finished. The comments escalate an internal dispute between Liberal party conservatives, including Peter Dutton and Tony Abbott, who argue that freedom of speech and religion are at issue in the postal survey, and moderates including George Brandis and Christopher Pyne, who consider the issues a distraction from the only issue in the poll: same-sex marriage. Paterson told the Association for Reformed Political Action that denying a connection between marriage equality and religious liberty would “sidestep the difficult and complex questions this debate raises”. “There clearly is the potential for the legalisation of same-sex marriage to have flow-on effects for other people’s freedom.” He argued it was a matter of when – not if – same-sex marriage was legalised, saying the yes campaign was likely to win the survey and that Bill Shorten and Labor would legislate marriage equality if it failed. He said changing the law “whilst best preserving religious liberty is a task I believe we must now take up”. “I believe parliament should agree to address this issue before the survey is returned. “It is particularly important this work begins now, given the very short timeframe envisaged by the government between the result of the survey and the planned parliamentary vote, in the event the vote is carried.” The government has not said which bill will be used to legalise same-sex marriage if the yes vote succeeds. The possibility of wide-ranging exemptions to discrimination law could raise doubts about the result of a yes vote, and a bill with a right to discriminate against gay weddings risks cross-party support for a marriage bill. Paterson called the Liberal senator Dean Smith’s private member’s bill a “good starting point” that did the “bare minimum” by allowing religious ministers to refuse same-sex weddings, but also provided protections for religious civil celebrants and religious schools and other venues. But Paterson said same-sex marriage would have “implications for people of faith who are not directly connected to religious institutions”. He warned anti-discrimination law would force private citizens who operate businesses in the wedding industry to choose between their beliefs and complying with the law. Suppliers of goods and services to gay weddings “should be allowed to make that choice without having their basic human rights infringed”, he said. Paterson called for consideration of a bill drafted by the Liberal Democrat senator, David Leyonhjelm, which would allow bakers to refuse to bake a cake for a gay wedding. Conservatives including George Christensen and Cory Bernardi have long called for a right of private service providers to refuse gay weddings. Marriage equality advocates including Rodney Croome and an Australian Marriage Equality spokeswoman, Shirleene Robinson, reject the removal of anti-discrimination laws which protect LGBTI Australians from being discriminated against by businesses or public officials. Paterson also called for anti-discrimination laws in Tasmania, which prohibit offence and insult based on sexuality, gender and religion, to be stripped back. “I firmly believe it is possible for the parliament to allow both same-sex marriage and at the same time preserve the freedoms of those who have a different view. But it is a task we must first agree to take up.” The deadline for enrolments to participate in the same-sex marriage postal survey passed on Thursday at midnight. The postal survey faces a high court challenge on 5 and 6 September, before survey forms will be sent out on 12 September. If the challenge fails, the Turnbull government will look to pass a bill with Labor support to apply electoral law protections to the survey. However, on Thursday the acting special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, rejected a call from the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, to ban foreign donations to the yes and no campaigns for the poll."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/26/ruby-ridge-1992-modern-american-militia-charlottesville","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T10:00:33Z","webTitle":"Ruby Ridge, 1992: the day the American militia movement was born","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/26/ruby-ridge-1992-modern-american-militia-charlottesville","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/26/ruby-ridge-1992-modern-american-militia-charlottesville","fields":{"headline":"Ruby Ridge, 1992: the day the American militia movement was born","bodyText":"Twenty-five years ago this week, in a remote corner of northern Idaho, the modern militia movement was born in a firefight. On the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, two weeks ago, observers could see from the presence of well-armed men in fatigues that that movement was still with us. But back in 1992, they hadn’t yet formed. A firefight between six US marshals and two boys and a dog, changed all that. On 21 August that year, the marshals went to a location that became known as Ruby Ridge, near Naples, to scout a location where they might ambush a fugitive, Randy Weaver. Weaver had been holed up for a year and half with his family in his cabin, having failed to attend his trial on firearms charges. The marshals aroused the attention of Weaver’s dogs. Alarmed, they retreated to a small clearing to the west of the house. Weaver ventured out, looking for the source of the disturbance. His 14-year-old son, Sammy, and his young friend Kevin Harris did the same on a separate route, following on the heels of a dog, Striker. Weaver met the marshals first, they challenged him, and then he retreated into the brush. A minute later, the two boys and the dog came out of the woods. There was an exchange of fire. The exact order of events has been disputed for a quarter of a century, but the end result was that Sammy Weaver, deputy marshal Bill Degan and Striker were all dead. The Weavers retreated to their cabin and laid Sammy’s body in a shed. Over the next day, federal and local officers – now under the command of the FBI – began to arrive in their hundreds to join the siege. The next day, 22 August, operating under rules of engagement that allowed deadly force, an FBI sniper wounded Randy Weaver as he checked on Sammy’s corpse. The same sniper then shot Randy’s wife, Vicki, dead and wounded Kevin Harris. The siege dragged on to the end of August, and the scene became a circus. Neo-Nazis from the nearby Aryan Nations compound at Hayden Lake showed up to protest. Other far-right groups poured in from all over the country to stand against what they saw as the persecution of an innocent family by a tyrannical federal government. Ruby Ridge was resolved, in the end, not by agents, but by civilian negotiators including Bo Gritz, a former green beret, prolific conspiracy theorist, and the Populist party’s presidential candidate, who was briefly on a ticket with the ex-Klansman David Duke. Along with the botched Waco siege the next year, during which 76 besieged members of the religious group the Branch Davidians died, Ruby Ridge badly damaged the credibility of the Clinton-era FBI (Bill Clinton became US president on 20 January, 1993), and boosted some emerging narratives on the far right: that the feds were coming for the guns and property of those, like Weaver, who wanted no further contact with a country they saw as irredeemably corrupt. Mike German, a former FBI officer who at the time of Ruby Ridge was working undercover in white supremacist groups, and now Fellow at NYU’s Brennan School for Law and Justice, says that while the FBI “inherited a mess” when it took on the badly handled case, the bureau “ultimately saw it as a mistake, and an escalation that had caused significant harm, including to children”. They made it worse, he says, by “engaging in a cover-up to hide their mistakes”. In 1997, E Michael Kahoe, who had helped supervise the FBI’s response, was sentenced to 18 months in a federal prison for burying documents critical of the agency’s approach to the siege ahead of the prosecution of Weaver and Harris. Bill Morlin reported on Ruby Ridge for the Spokane Spokesman-Review, and is now a fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). He has monitored the far right since the early 1980s. He says simply: “Ruby Ridge became a demarcation point for the rise of the modern militia movement. “It put the fertilizer in their minds which sprouted radical anti-government beliefs.” For a radical fringe, with especially intense anti-government beliefs, it became a reason to form paramilitary groups and stockpile arms in the expectation that they would have to defend themselves against totalitarian overreach from a “New World Order”. Some expected the agents of this conspiracy to swoop in in black helicopters and establish world government, while persecuting patriots. David Neiwert, a contributing writer for the SPLC and author of several books on the far right says the Ruby Ridge myth was potent. Neiwert says it allowed groups to say: “You’re next! They’re going to round people up and put them in concentration camps.” He says some groups even had detailed maps claiming to show where the network of camps would be located.Groups from Montana to south-west Oregon combined different forms of anti-government ideology, such as fears about gun confiscation and grievances about federal land management practices. Morlin says that the ideology of “local supremacy” was also central to movement beliefs. “They said the only real authority in law enforcement is the local sheriff. The feds have no jurisdiction. Some people still believe that.” To this day, pro-milita sheriffs, such as Glenn Palmer in Oregon, hold political power in the region. From this, and a welter of spurious legal beliefs, many groups mounted direct challenges to the authority of federal agencies such as the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Many agents of these bodies faced violence or harassment in the course of their work during the 1990s. Morlin says that militia groups, large and small, used the story of Ruby Ridge to recruit people, and to amplify existing anti-government beliefs: “The whole idea was to play on people’s fears.” The rise of the movement was fortuitously timed with a broader uptake of internet technologies. Morlin says that militia groups made intense use of these technologies to spread their messages and work around mainstream outlets. After the anti-government zealot Timothy McVeigh bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168, including many children, the movement came under more scrutiny. While many believe the movement dropped off sharply after McVeigh’s act, German thinks that its real numbers are difficult to assess, and that many simply turned their attention to other activities, such as acting as vigilante immigration enforcers on the southern border. In the years between their prominence in the 1990s and their resurgent public visibility today, the militias’ basic ideology – stressing federal overreach, local supremacy, and a hardline constitutionalism – gained a greater acceptance among many in rural areas. Contemporary “patriot movement” groups such as the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters, or the various “Light Foot Militias” seen on the streets of Charlottesville, do not generally foreground fervidly conspiratorial anti-government rhetoric. For the most part, they fastidiously disavow racism and white supremacy. Unlike those in the earlier wave of the militia movement, whose adherents mainly confined themselves to rural and provincial areas, newer groups have come, bearing arms, into the heart of liberal cities. This has been apparent during the wave of rightwing protests that have swept cities from Berkeley to Boston since Donald Trump’s inauguration. Usually, militias turn up on the basis of providing security and protection for “free speech”. In the Trump era, these groups are far more emboldened, and often organize openly on social media. They’re also able to bring weapons into public places in a way that was not previously possible. Changing gun laws – such as proliferating open carry provisions, the end of the assault weapons ban, and the supreme court’s Heller decision – mean that groups can bring semiautomatic weapons, sidearms, and body armor into cities unchallenged. And if their rhetoric seems less far out, it may be because some of the ideas they nurture have been brought into the mainstream by broadcasters such as Alex Jones, who has embraced the 9/11 “truth” movement and united it with well-established themes within the militia movement. Their willingness to turn out in numbers in volatile situations is a new and striking development. In Charlottesville, Virginia’s governor, Terry McAuliffe, said police had held back because they felt outgunned by militia. Of the new movements, Neiwert says: “They’re far more dangerous than they were in the 1990s ... This has become a huge problem and I don’t see any way out of it.” In 2017, the shots fired 25 years ago at Ruby Ridge are still echoing in the streets of American cities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/aug/24/whole-foods-price-cuts-amazon-walmart-online-war","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-24T21:38:51Z","webTitle":"Whole Foods price cuts are at center of Amazon-Walmart online war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/24/whole-foods-price-cuts-amazon-walmart-online-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/aug/24/whole-foods-price-cuts-amazon-walmart-online-war","fields":{"headline":"Whole Foods price cuts are at center of Amazon-Walmart online war","bodyText":"Amazon has set the stage for a price war with retail giant Walmart as it signaled a wave of price cuts at Whole Foods, the grocery chain it acquired for $13.7bn in June. The move signals the start of a much wider battle – to see who will be the king of online retail in America. Walmart, America’s second largest bricks and mortar retailer, was slow to develop its online retail offer in the face of Amazon’s growing dominance over the last 10 years. However, more recently it has been trying to play catch-up with significant investment in its digital operation. This culminated in Walmart’s purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3bn. This set the battle for the country’s biggest online retail war, and it was only a matter of time before Amazon responded. That happened two months ago when they bought Whole Foods. Today’s announcement is a sign that the battle has taken off in earnest. Items that will see the first price cuts on Monday include Whole Trade bananas, organic avocados, organic large brown eggs, kale and other organic food. The online retailing behemoth said it hopes to give Amazon Prime members special savings and other in-store benefits, including lockers where they pick up and drop off items. The company also said the 450 new physical locations it acquired in the deal for Whole Foods should help it speed up its grocery delivery capability. “This is just the beginning – we will make Amazon Prime the customer rewards program at Whole Foods Market and continuously lower prices as we invent together,” said Jeff Wilke, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer. “There is significant work and opportunity ahead, and we’re thrilled to get started.” Though Walmart lags way behind Amazon it has begin to make some progress – it now sells 67m items a month, up from 10m early last year. Amazon, however, sells hundreds of millions of items. Amazon’s move on price is a direct attempt to attract Walmart customers who will have been put off by Whole Foods’ high prices. At stake is an enormous online retail market which Amazon not only want to protect, but grow. The move also comes a day after Walmart announced a partnership with Google where the search giant will start offering Walmart products to people who shop on Google Express, the company’s online shopping mall. As the New York Times reported: “It’s the first time the world’s biggest retailer has made its products available online in the United States outside of its own website.” Amazon’s announcement also comes just one day after Walmart announced it will expand its grocery delivery service with ride-hailing service Uber. The moves are clearly designed to help begin to remake Whole Foods’ image for being overly expensive – “Whole Paycheck” as it is derisively known – and to position it ahead of an anticipated war with chains like Walmart, the largest US grocer, also looking to expand their reach in the food sector. The company said Whole Foods Market will continue to operate under its 365 brand name and pledged to “preserve its high standards and commitment to providing the finest natural and organic foods”. Also on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission said it won’t investigate or try to stop Amazon’s $13.7bn takeover of the food retailer. “We have decided not to pursue this matter further,” the FTC said in a statement. Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey, who is staying on as CEO, said the company’s core mission – “to bring the highest quality food to our customers” – remained intact. He anticipated the Amazon-Whole Food hook-up would enable the company to “lower prices and double down on that mission and reach more people with Whole Foods Market’s high-quality, natural and organic food”. Mackey added: “As part of our commitment to quality, we’ll continue to expand our efforts to support and promote local products and suppliers. We can’t wait to start showing customers what’s possible when Whole Foods Market and Amazon innovate together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/09/country-diary-springtails-carboniferous-limestone-hills-morecambe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T04:30:00Z","webTitle":"Springtails … faster than your average photographer's reflexes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/09/country-diary-springtails-carboniferous-limestone-hills-morecambe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/09/country-diary-springtails-carboniferous-limestone-hills-morecambe","fields":{"headline":"Springtails … faster than your average photographer's reflexes","bodyText":"Dense vegetation alive with birdsong clings to the face of Humphrey Head.

I become stuck in one of the glutinous exiting channels that booby-trap Morecambe Bay’s shores. Good Samaritans hoist me to my feet, “We’re on a weekend activity hen do,” says the one in the “Game Over” T-shirt. “Glad the tide’s out,” says the group’s instructor, her top labelled “Boss”. “Folk get mired down like mice in those traps with sticky floors.

Look!” She produces a microscope magnifier lens, which she clips on to her mobile phone. The hens take turns to peer though the glass she holds over the rock. She offers me a go too. It takes time to steady the image of tiny pearly creatures scurrying from crack to crack. I spot one springing up as if from a toaster. “Springtails are like insects but can’t fly,” says Boss. “They have six legs and two antennae. And they have a hinged mechanism below the abdomen that propels them from danger – like Superman jumping over a 12-storey building.” Later, I talk to Dr Emily Baxter, the senior marine conservation officer at Cumbria Wildlife Trust, which manages Humphrey Head. “Your description certainly sounds correct for several of these critters, “ she says. “Problem is there are so many springtails. Without pictures, I am not entirely sure which ones you saw.” I did try, Dr Baxter.

Ferrari have made it clear they are favouring Vettel for the title over his team‑mate Kimi Raikkonen, whose contract was renewed this week, a move considered to have been taken because he has accepted the No2 role and has not been a threat to Vettel. “I know he doesn’t want to be my team‑mate,” Hamilton said. “He would not be in the position he is now in his team in terms of how the team operate if he was here. I am always game to race whoever it is and racing against the best drivers is always a great thing.” Ferrari favoured Vettel over Raikkonen at Monaco and Hungary, the latter meeting where Hamilton returned third place to his team-mate Valtteri Bottas having agreed to do so. He believed it was a clear indicator of how strong their relationship is. “The last race is one of the best examples of how great the team is currently. Coming into this season I haven’t changed a single thing that I do, but there is another new element in the team and it works.” Vettel is expected to renew his contract with Ferrari but insisted in Spa there had been no decision and that he did not expect one to be revealed within the next two weeks. However, the fact Ferrari have re-signed Raikkonen suggests a renewal is increasingly likely and the German welcomed the move. “It’s quite straightforward to work with him,” he said. “I think everybody who knows him knows he’s quite straightforward. He’s a good match, and obviously it is great to continue like that.” The two drivers have been in a closely fought battle for the title this season and have four wins apiece but Hamilton has only held a share of the lead once – after the second round in China. Despite his vast experience – this weekend will be his 200th grand prix – he admitted that the battle with Vettel had proved difficult to endure. “You don’t want your competitors to see if you are struggling mentally or physically, you don’t ever want to show weakness,” he said. “But it is so challenging for everyone involved in our team and in the sport. As a competitor at the top level I take a lot of inspiration from other competitors: Serena, Federer and [Valentino] Rossi and you see their experiences and try to take it on. But it is so draining.” Yet he insisted he was re-energised after the summer break and focused on the task in hand. “It’s important that we win every race. I want to be ahead of him in every single race from now on. That is my goal. No games, I am here to win. I want it just as much if not more than everyone else this year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/25/mining-giant-adani-cleared-in-second-case-over-allegations-of-financial","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T06:20:40Z","webTitle":"Mining giant Adani cleared in second case over allegations of financial fraud","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/25/mining-giant-adani-cleared-in-second-case-over-allegations-of-financial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/25/mining-giant-adani-cleared-in-second-case-over-allegations-of-financial","fields":{"headline":"Mining giant Adani cleared in second case over allegations of financial fraud","bodyText":"India’s customs authority has cleared the Adani Group of illegally siphoning money into overseas tax havens, dismissing one of two sets of power equipment fraud allegations known to be facing the mining conglomerate. The judgment this week involved separate Adani Group subsidiaries to those named in similar allegations reported by the Guardian earlier this month, but employed the same alleged company in Dubai and the same modus operandi. In the allegations dismissed this week, Indian customs investigators had accused two subsidiaries of the Adani Group of using the Dubai company, Electrogen Infra FZE (EIF), to inflate the price of machinery and equipment for power plant projects in Maharashtra and Rajasthan states. It had alleged that EIF charged the Adani Group subsidiaries up to 220% more for the equipment. It claimed the extra money was channelled to a holding company in Dubai owned by Vinod Shantilal Adani, the older brother of Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani. The effect of the now-dismissed scheme would have been to move vast sums of money from the Adani Group’s domestic accounts into offshore bank accounts where it could no longer be taxed or accounted for. In a judgment dated 22 August, an official from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) appointed to adjudicate the case fully dismissed the allegations. The official, KVS Singh, found that one of the Adani Group subsidiaries, Adani Power Maharashtra Limited, had signed a contract with EIF to supply equipment more than one month before it had been taken over by Vinod Adani. Therefore the companies “were not related ... on the date of the signing of the contract”, he concluded. He found the other Adani Group subsidiary, Adani Power Maharashtra Limited, had signed the contract with EIF after Vinod Adani had taken control of the company. But Singh said the evidence had led him to conclude “that the same relation has not affected the price [of the equipment] and that the same was at arm’s length”. “I find that even though I have found that the two entities ... were related, the requirement of relationship influencing the price was not satisfied,” he said. “Thus I find that the allegation that the impugned goods were over-valued does not hold water.” Income tax officials who had scrutinised the transactions had also concluded that the transactions between EIF and the Adani Group subsidiaries had been conducted at arm’s length, he added. Singh concluded the increased price that EIF charged the Adani Group subsidiaries could be justified on the grounds the company had provided extended warranties on the equipment it purchased, and had signed stringent supply contracts. “EIF had undertaken the risk and financial burden to provide extended warranty over what the [suppliers] had added substantially to the said goods,” Singh said. “This additional risk spread over an extended period of time was bound to add a cost premium to the value of the imported goods.” The judgment said the Adani Group subsidiaries had chosen to employ EIF to source the equipment based on a competitive evaluation process in which EIF’s bid had been the lowest in price. “I find that the [Adani Group] has arrived at the price transparently and independently where the price has been finalised based on global tender following international competitive bidding process as prescribed by the Government of India,” he said. A second set of fraud allegations, detailed by the Guardian earlier in August and valued around 15bn rupees, are still pending adjudication, according to the Times of India. The DRI had been contacted to provide an update on the current status of both cases. The Adani Group could not be reached for comment, but said in an earlier statement on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries, and Vinod Adani that it “strongly denies the allegations of overvaluation”. “It is a standard procedure for the group to follow international competitive bidding route for major capital expenditures to ensure transparency and competitiveness in the process. All our transactions are always conducted within the framework of extant regulatory guidelines and provisions,” it has said. “The fact that our projects have incurred the lowest cost across central, state and private utility players has gone to establish the robustness of the processes followed by our group. “It may be noted that Mr Vinod Adani who is the elder brother of Mr Gautam Adani has been a non-resident Indian for about 30 years and has his own established business interests outside India,” its statement said. “Adani Group is aware of the investigations being conducted by the DRI, and has fully cooperated, and shall continue to cooperate with the investigating agencies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/26/melbourne-gp-accused-of-helping-parents-avoid-vaccinations-reprimanded-13-years-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T22:56:34Z","webTitle":"Melbourne GP accused of helping parents avoid vaccinations reprimanded 13 years ago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/26/melbourne-gp-accused-of-helping-parents-avoid-vaccinations-reprimanded-13-years-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/26/melbourne-gp-accused-of-helping-parents-avoid-vaccinations-reprimanded-13-years-ago","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne GP accused of helping parents avoid vaccinations reprimanded 13 years ago","bodyText":"A Melbourne doctor under investigation for helping parents evade compulsory vaccinations was reprimanded a decade ago for failing to properly treat patients with potentially life-threatening illnesses like cancer and depression. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) is investigating Dr John Piesse after a video was uncovered of him speaking at an anti-vaccination event in August. In the video, he boasts that he can help parents jump through hoops to get their children exempt from Victoria’s “no jab, no play” legislation and the federal government’s “no jab, no pay” legislation. The video prompted the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, to say on Thursday that he was “astonished” that someone with a medical degree “would deign to stoop to the level of supporting the anti-vaccination movement”. Victoria’s acting health minister, Martin Foley, said Ahpra’s investigation into Piesse began 12 months ago and that he was concerned it was taking so long, saying it was “not good enough”. Hunt told Guardian Australia he would be raising the matter of anti-vaccination doctors with state and territory ministers: “It’s dangerous, irresponsible and goes against medical evidence,” he said. “Anyone with concerns about a doctor promoting ‘anti-vaxxer’ practices should contact the authorities.” By Friday the Medical Board of Australia told Piesse that it intended to revoke his medical registration. Piesse, a supporter of alternative medicine, has a right-of-reply before that occurs, including an opportunity to outline why his license should not be revoked. The time period usually allowed for a reply is one week. But a report uncovered by Guardian Australia shows that concerns about Piesse were raised as far back as 2001, when Medicare Australia reported him because he charged Medicare for long and prolonged consultations, and because he made an abnormally high number of pathology requests during the year 2000. He rendered 2,137 services to 707 patients at a total Medicare benefit of $87,570 that year. In July 2003, a professional review committee investigating the allegations found Piesse’s conduct during 2000 “caused a significant threat to the life or health of his patients”. “It was concerned that Dr Piesse failed to make appropriate investigations of patient symptoms of possibly serious conditions such as cancer, meningitis, depression, and anaemia,” a report from the professional services review scheme said. The committee also found Piesse administered multiple vitamin B doses from one vial. This information was referred to the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria, which in August 2004 ordered that Piesse be reprimanded, counselled, repay Medicare benefits totalling $18,179, and be disqualified for 18 months from providing certain GP services to patients. In 2007, the Medical Board of Australia ordered Piesse provide a statutory declaration every three months “to confirm that he has not facilitated the administration of intravenous herbal infusions, genome therapies, and other therapies brought into the country by patients, unless the therapies have been specifically approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration”. Piesse later admitted that he had failed to provide these statutory declarations, telling the board: “I acknowledge that I did not initially provide statutory declarations … The reason for the delay in initially providing the statutory declarations was that I was very disturbed by the restriction and implications of this determination in denying safe, beneficial treatment for my patients.” He was ordered to provide the statutory declarations in future and to undertake further education in critical thinking and research. Bill Madden, a medical lawyer and special counsel with law firm Carroll &amp; O’Dea, said in light of the anti-vaccination comments Piesse may face more than just disciplinary action from Ahpra. “It’s always possible that any patients or children could have a right to bring civil civil proceedings against him for financial compensation if his advice has resulted in the suffering of a severe illness,” Madden said. Guardian Australia has contacted the Victorian health minister, Jill Hennessy, for comment. A statement issued by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners on Friday afternoon said “anti-vaccination messages have absolutely no place in general practice”. The president of the college, Dr Bastian Seidel, said it was vital all Australians were fully vaccinated. “While some parents may have concerns stemming from reading misleading immunisation information, anti-vaccination messages are dangerous and are not supported [by the college].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/25/which-australians-should-be-given-a-statue-have-your-say","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T02:52:56Z","webTitle":"Which Australians should be given a statue?

Have your say","bodyText":"Yarri and Jacky Jacky are local heroes in the town of Gundagai in rural New South Wales. A town known for its statues – its claim to fame is a monument to a fictional Dog on the Tuckerbox – it has once again drawn attention to itself for its latest work of art. As statues are toppled and debate rages about history, revisionism and what monuments teach us about history and politics, the town of Gundagai has unveiled a statue honouring two Aboriginal men who saved the lives of a third of the town in an 1852 flood. The Wiradjuri people, who had lived on the land for more than 40,000 years, had consistently warned the European settlers not to settle on the river flats of the Murrumbidgee River because of flooding. Yarri and Jacky Jacky rushed in to rescue about 69 Europeans from rapidly rising flood waters on a rainy June day in 1852. It took 165 years, and it commemorates Indigenous history only in regards to its effect on white people, but the sculpture is the result of work of the local Indigenous people. Is this the solution to our contested history, or at least a way we can reconcile the way we celebrate history now and how we can better reflect it in the future? What other statues should we be erecting, and what other names are missing from Australia’s national highways, parks and institutions? Aunty Sony Piper, a member of the Yarri and Jacky Jacky sculpture committee told NITV she was proud of the statue: “To be Aboriginal men, there’s not many statues around and we wanted that to be in Gundagai,” she said. “For a lot of the tourists to come through and see about these heroes – these two Aboriginal heroes.” The capital’s War Memorial is yet to find a place to honour those who died in Australia’s frontier wars. How else could the country honour its Indigenous history? Which women are missing from the nation’s monuments? What other historical, cultural and sporting events have we inadequately commemorated? Share your suggestions What makes someone deserving of a monument? What would their statue depict – and should they be given a particular spot?

United have bought wisely in the summer – Romelu Lukaku has added goals and will be joined by Zlatan Ibrahimovic if they get through the group – and Nemanja Matic looks an inspired piece of business to strengthen the midfield. Benfica are still the best Portuguese team in the competition despite selling Ederson, Victor Lindelof and Nélson Semedo this summer. Bruno Varela is a very good replacement for Ederson and they have kept Pizzi and Álex Grimaldo. CSKA, meanwhile, have had a relatively poor start but have improved in the past few weeks. Igor Akinfeev has finally kept a clean sheet in the Champions League after 11 years of failing to do so and in the new manager, Viktor Goncharenko, they have a more attack-minded man in charge compared to Leonid Slutsky. Basel, who have just been hit by the retirement of club legend Matias Delgado could well finish bottom. Ricky van Wolfswinkel now leads their line. Prediction 1 Manchester United 2 Benfica 3 CSKA Moscow 4 Basel Star player Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Manchester United) Group B Bayern Munich, Anderlecht, Paris St-Germain, Celtic All eyes will be on the French club this season as they have finally, after years of trying, made the kind of signing that should see them elevated to the level of Real Madrid and Barcelona. The impact of Neymar’s arrival on PSG cannot be overestimated and it is easy to forget now that they came within minutes of eliminating Barça last season, even without the brilliant Brazilian in their team. In Bayern they have a superb group opponent but are the German champions stronger than last season? Arguably not with Philipp Lahm and Xabi Alonso having retired. Corentin Tolisso has arrived from Lyon for £36.4m and James Rodríguez joined on loan from Real Madrid, but he has struggled to recapture his 2014 World Cup form. Celtic can probably snatch third place from Anderlecht – and possibly trouble Bayern and/or PSG at home – but this, sadly, looks like quite an uneven group. Prediction 1 Bayern Munich 2 Paris Saint-Germain 3 Celtic 4 Anderlecht Star player Neymar (PSG) Group C Chelsea, Roma, Atlético Madrid, Qarabag Atlético Madrid are the team to beat considering their Champions League record of two finals in the past four years. They are working under a transfer ban and have had to loan out their only summer signing, Vitolo, who arrived from Sevilla for £31.8m. At least Antoine Griezmann decided to stay. Chelsea looked out of sorts against Burnley and then back to their defensive best in their 2-1 win against Tottenham, however Antonio Conte had two attempts at the Champions League at Juventus but was eliminated in the quarter-finals in 2012-13 and at the group stage the following year. Roma have had a summer of wholesale changes under their new sporting director, Monchi. Mohamed Salah, Antonio Rüdiger (to Chelsea) and Francesco Totti will be hard to replace but they have brought in 10 players. Qarabag became the first team from Azerbaijan to qualify for the group stage. The manager, Gurban Gurbanov, has been there since 2008 and prefers to play three up front with the South African Dino Ndlovu as the focal point. Prediction 1 Atlético Madrid 2 Chelsea 3 Roma 4 Qarabag Star player Antoine Griezmann (Atlético Madrid) Group D Juventus, Olympiakos, Barcelona, Sporting Lisbon A horribly competitive group with Juventus favourites having eliminated Barcelona in the quarter-finals last season. Both teams, however, have lost important players with Leonardo Bonucci joining Milan in a shock move and Neymar jumping the Barça ship for Paris Saint‑Germain. Juve looked defensively shaky in the Italian Super Cup defeat against Lazio but they still have a superb squad and have added Federico Bernardeschi from Fiorentina for a whopping £35.7m. There is unhappiness among Barça fans after a summer during which they failed to secure Marco Verratti and signed the former Spurs midfielder Paulinho instead. They are still pursuing Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembélé, though. Olympiakos should finish third and are enjoying a renaissance under their new manager, Besnik Hasi. The Greek club have spent almost £20m on players this summer; Sporting, third in Portugal last season, will struggle to compete against the other three teams and Jorge Jesus’s side could still sell the midfield linchpin William Carvalho. Prediction 1 Juventus 2 Barcelona 3 Olympiakos 4 Sporting Star player Lionel Messi (Barcelona) Group E Spartak Moscow, Liverpool, Sevilla, Maribor An even group with Liverpool slight favourites ahead of Sevilla, who are on their third manager in three years. Sevilla, who beat Liverpool in the 2016 Europa League final, now have Eduardo Berizzo in charge and while they have sold Vitolo to Atlético they have signed Éver Banega, Jesús Navas and Nolito. Jürgen Klopp has assembled a squad with an enormous amount of speed up front but they are still suspect at the back. Spartak were outstanding last season as they won their first title since 2001 but are 11th in the league and Massimo Carrera (Antonio Conte’s former assistant) may get the sack. The Dutch winger Quincy Promes, though, is a huge threat. Maribor have won one of 12 Champions League group games in their history and the former Leeds manager Darko Milanic has a huge task to improve on that record, especially as they have lost their best player, the attacking midfielder Dare Vrsic, after failing to agree a new contract. Prediction 1 Liverpool 2 Sevilla 3 Spartak Moscow 4 Maribor Star player Sadio Mané (Liverpool) Group F Shakhtar Donetsk, Napoli, Manchester City, Feyenoord There can be no excuses for Pep Guardiola this season. He has spent more than £220m this summer with an astonishing £128.5m on full-backs. They should qualify comfortably but already, this season, Everton have exposed weaknesses at the back. Napoli are one of the most exciting sides in Europe, Maurizio Sarri’s side crushing Nice 4-0 on aggregate in the play‑offs. Goals can come from everywhere with Dries Mertens, José Callejón, Lorenzo Insigne, Arkadiusz Milik and Marek Hamsik all in the squad. Shakhtar won the Ukrainian league by 13 points last season but they have lost their best Brazilians, such as Alex Teixeira and Douglas Costa, in recent seasons. Playing in Kharkiv rather than Lviv should help the atmosphere. Feyenoord won the Dutch title for the first time in 18 years last season under Gio van Bronckhorst but they are now without arguably their three most influential players in Dirk Kuyt (retired), Terence Kongolo (Monaco) and Rick Karsdorp (Roma). Prediction 1 Manchester City 2 Napoli 3 Shakhtar Donetsk 4 Feyenoord Star player Lorenzo Insigne (Napoli) Group G Monaco, Besiktas, Porto, Leipzig One of the more even groups with, frankly, all teams capable of going through. Monaco are the favourites despite losing some of their key players, with Bernardo Silva, Benjamin Mendy and Tiémoué Bakayoko all joining Premier League clubs. And there has been the saga about Kylian Mbappé’s future. Not helpful. Porto have a new manager, Sérgio Conceição, and have sold the prolific André Silva to Milan but have retained the even more prolific Tiquinho Soares. Rúben Neves, of course, has joined Wolves. RB Leipzig will make their Champions League debut having kept Naby Keïta and Emil Forsberg but they lost their first league game of the season, against Schalke, and looked lacklustre. Big-spending Besiktas will hope to do well as part of their president’s plan for a more global profile. They have won the past two league titles and have a competitive team with this summer’s additions of Álvaro Negredo Pepe, Jeremain Lens and Gary Medel among others. Prediction 1 Monaco 2 Porto 3 RB Leipzig 4 Besiktas Star player Youri Tielemans (Monaco) Group H Real Madrid, Tottenham, Borussia Dortmund, Apoel Nicosia The reigning champions look favourites to complete the first hat-trick of European Cup wins since Bayern Munich in 1974-76. All their stars have stayed and are now being pushed to even greater heights by younger players such as Mateo Kovacic, Marco Asensio and Dani Ceballos. Dortmund are still a force to be reckoned with but there is no doubt the transfer saga surrounding Ousmane Dembélé has cast a long shadow over the club. Thomas Tuchel has been replaced by Peter Bosz as manager while Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang is staying and Julian Weigl is fit again. Spurs’ chances probably depend on whether they can perform at Wembley and why shouldn’t they be able to now that they are playing league games there, too? In Harry Kane and Dele Alli they have a pairing that can hurt most defences. Apoel are likely to finish last in the group, having lost Pieros Sotiriou, their top scorer last season, to FC Copenhagen. Prediction 1 Real Madrid 2 Borussia Dortmund 3 Tottenham 4 Apoel Star player Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/25/north-korea-warns-uk-military-drills-south-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T07:21:14Z","webTitle":"North Korea: UK faces 'miserable end' if it joins US-led military drills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/25/north-korea-warns-uk-military-drills-south-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/25/north-korea-warns-uk-military-drills-south-korea","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: UK faces 'miserable end' if it joins US-led military drills","bodyText":"North Korea has warned the UK that it faces “a miserable end” if it takes part in military exercises alongside troops from South Korea and the US. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills, which began on Monday and run until the end of the month, are thought to involve a small number of personnel from Britain, Australia and other countries. The annual drills have coincided with a dramatic rise in tensions on the Korean peninsula following North Korea’s test-launch of two intercontinental ballistic missiles and its threat to target seas off the coast of the US Pacific territory of Guam. Seoul and Washington say the exercises are an opportunity for the allies to improve their defensive capabilities, but Pyongyang routinely denounces them as a dress rehearsal for war against North Korea. In a statement issued on Wednesday, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency said the drills were proof of Washington’s intention to invade. “The reality vividly shows that the US ambition for stifling the DPRK [North Korea] remains unchanged no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and the puppet group’s ambition for invading the north remains unchanged,” it said. It went on to warn the US and its “puppets” to “act with discretion if they want to evade the historic moment of death”. “Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we solemnly warn not only the US and puppet group but also satellites, including UK and Australia, which are taking advantage of the present war manouevres against the north that they would face a miserable end if they join in play with fire by tiger moths of war.” Last October, four RAF Typhoon fighter jets took part in their first joint drill with pilots from South Korea and the US. South Korean officials said the drill, called Invincible Shield, would improve the allies’ ability to strike key targets in North Korea, including military facilities and those linked to the regime’s leader, Kim Jong-un. North Korea had earlier described Australia as having committed a “suicidal act” by joining the US-led military exercises. KCNA noted that the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had recently said his country’s military would fight alongside the US if the latter was attacked by North Korea. Citing an unnamed official from the North Korean foreign ministry, KCNA said Turnbull’s show of support for Washington, plus Australia’s participation in the military drills, had left the country open to unspecified “counter-measures of justice” by North Korea. “This is a suicidal act of inviting disaster, as it is an illustration of political immaturity, unaware of the seriousness of the current situation,” KCNA said. Around 17,500 US troops – several thousand fewer than last year – have joined 50,000 of their South Korean counterparts in this year’s drills. The US defense secretary, James Mattis, said the US contingent was smaller “by design to achieve the exercise objectives” and denied Washington had cut troop numbers in a concession to Pyongyang. While Donald Trump and Kim appear to have paused their rhetorical conflict, the official North Korean media has intensified its criticism of the war games. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a recent editorial: “The joint exercise is the most explicit expression of hostility against us, and no one can guarantee that the exercise won’t evolve into actual fighting. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian joint military exercises will be like pouring gasoline on fire and worsen the state of the [Korean] peninsula.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/25/glencore-document-suggests-mine-site-could-revert-to-nt-before-rehabilitation-complete","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T07:40:59Z","webTitle":"Glencore document suggests mine site could revert to NT before rehabilitation complete","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/25/glencore-document-suggests-mine-site-could-revert-to-nt-before-rehabilitation-complete","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/25/glencore-document-suggests-mine-site-could-revert-to-nt-before-rehabilitation-complete","fields":{"headline":"Glencore document suggests mine site could revert to NT before rehabilitation complete","bodyText":"A mine expansion proposal by Glencore appears to include handing responsibility for the McArthur River Mine site to the Northern Territory government just 50-100 years into an expected 1,000-year rehabilitation and monitoring process. Glencore is proposing to expand its operations in Borroloola for another 20 years from 2018 and, according to its draft environmental impact statement, that expansion would require up to 300 years of rehabilitation and management, and about 900 years of monitoring. But a risk assessment table deep within the document indicates Glencore intends to have little or no involvement after the mine’s life ends and the “adaptive and reactive management phases” begin in 2048. According to the table, Glencore’s new plan reduced the risk that “long-term closure monitoring cannot be achieved”. However, its confidence that the risk would be reduced was “outside McArthur River Mining’s control”, suggesting another entity – likely the NT government – may have to take over the responsibility. Glencore’s current proposal for expansion would have the mine continue operating until 2037, with reprocessing bringing an end to the life of the mine by 2048. It would then enter the closure phase, including “adaptive management” until 2100 to rehabilitate the site to a permanent, self-sustaining state with no need for active management. From 2101 until 3017 the “proactive monitoring and reactive monitoring” phases would see scheduled routine monitoring and maintenance transition to a system of responding only to particular events. The EIS defines “long-term” to be 100-1000 years after closure, including the proactive and reactive monitoring phases, but the document item about the company’s control also references a funding agreement with regulators for the “adaptive” phase. This phase begins much earlier, in 2048, and includes the controversial rediversion of the McArthur river to flow through a refilled pit lake. The Environmental Defenders Office NT said its experts had raised major queries about the “sense and safety” of the flow through option over backfilling the pit. The risk assessment said there was funding for only 25 years of monitoring but early monitoring and feedback would “continually update closure costs and reduce the risk of unforeseen major costs”. The McArthur River Mine has seen a number of environmental incidents including the combustion and year-long smouldering of its waste rock pile – which it is also seeking to expand. Locals have also repeatedly raised concerns over contamination findings in the river and fish stock. Guardian Australia asked Glencore whether it intended to relinquish all responsibility in 2048, what the cited “funding mechanisms” were, what level of involvement the company would have in any future incident responses and if it was proposing to receive its – as yet undisclosed – rehabilitation bond back from the government. The company did not answer specific questions but a spokeswoman said it was continuing to engage with stakeholders including the NT government and the EPA on the content of the draft EIS, as it developed its supplementary report. A public comment period on the draft EIS closed in May and Glencore are now in the process of drafting a responsive supplementary EIS. A spokeswoman for the NT Department of Primary Industry and Resources declined to comment on specific elements while the process was ongoing. The NT environmental protection agency similarly declined to comment on Glencore’s EIS before the draft supplement was completed. However, its chairman, Paul Vogel, said it wasn’t unusual for a mining company to hand over control and responsibility for a mine site to a government once the ore body ran out or ceased to be economically viable. “What needs to be agreed with government and other stakeholders, should their proposal be approved, is under what conditions or relinquishment criteria would that hand back occur and what is the process for that to happen over the ensuing years,” he said. Dr Gavin Mudd, associate professor at RMIT and chairman of the Mineral Policies Institute, suggested it was difficult to predict how Glencore’s rehabilitation plans would play out, partly because they had taken a unprecedented and welcome step of modelling for 1,000 years but also because very few mines in the NT had ever properly been closed. “Often what does happen in the industry … if you’re looking at gold or coal in particular, the lease is just held on to and switched from ‘operation’ to ‘care and maintenance’ and a new operator will come along and reopen it all,” he said. Regardless, relinquishing responsibility in 2048 was “absolutely” too soon, Mudd said, although the mining industry would likely consider it reasonable. There were serious questions around what happens should there be an incident in the future and how it would be funded. “The waste rock dump is up to 300 degrees celsius,” he said. “It’s absolutely incredible … Anyone with a brain would realise that means huge, long-term environmental risk, and financial risk. “We know the very nature of these types of problems. They can last for 1000 years.” The Garawa elder Jack Green recently won a legal battle to have the bond amount publicly disclosed but Glencore are appealing the ruling. In 2015 Glencore agreed to increase its bond – then known to be $111m – after the then Country Liberal party government threatened to shut it down. The new amount was not published but previous estimates have said as much as $1bn could be required to properly clean up the site after Glencore left. The Northern Territory government holds $1.3bn in total rehabilitation bonds for all NT mine sites, according to the Australia Institute."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/25/california-cannabis-wedding-carmel-zak-walton-dani-geen","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T11:49:32Z","webTitle":"I toke thee to be my wife: inside a cannabis wedding in California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/california-cannabis-wedding-carmel-zak-walton-dani-geen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/california-cannabis-wedding-carmel-zak-walton-dani-geen","fields":{"headline":"I toke thee to be my wife: inside a cannabis wedding in California","bodyText":"It was a picture postcard California beach wedding. The bride wore white. The Pacific Ocean lapped at the altar. The violinist played Elvis Presley’s Can’t Help Falling in Love. Then, upon being declared husband and wife, Zak Walton and Dani Geen inclined their heads, puckered their lips, closed their eyes and took long, deep puffs of potent cannabis. A table by the altar had all the accoutrements: pots of cannabis concentrate, a torch lighter to heat it up, and glass vessels known as rigs, through which they inhaled the vapour. The family and friends sat before them minded not a bit. This, after all, was a weed wedding and most of them had also ingested. Melissa Cunningham, the wedding planner, said: “The psychic effect you get from it is very calming. Dani and Zak want to be on the same spectrum going into their matrimony.” Everybody seemed to be on the same spectrum during the ceremony on Thursday at Stewart’s Cove, a bucolic beach near Carmel, south of San Francisco. Walton, 30, savouring his first minutes of married life with a joint alongside bridesmaids and groomsmen, all smoking, said: “I’m feeling good. Nice and relaxed, medicated.” What had he consumed so far? “I had some dabs at the hotel, a joint, some edibles. Not too much, not too little,” he said. It was all legal: the cannabis buds in the bouquet and floral arrangements, the goody bags with joints and cannabis vapes, the cannabis-infused munchies (“handcrafted to melt in your mind”) and the dab bar at the reception in nearby Monterey, where a pot sommelier in a three-piece suit offered guests different ways to get lightly, blissfully stoned. California voters approved recreational marijuana last November, a landmark victory in the fight for legalisation that has paved the way for the largest commercial pot market in the US. Activists and entrepreneurs have found ways to “weedify” multiple products and services, including weddings. It was news to the catering guys setting up chairs on the beach before the ceremony. “A cannabis wedding, really?” said one, astonished. “Is it, like, a thing?” asked another. To evangelists, it’s the future. Philip Wolf, the co-founder of the Cannabis Wedding Expo, which showcases industry products and services, said: “Down the road, people won’t call it a cannabis wedding, because bud bars will be normalised. Smoking creates a bonding aspect. People did it in ancient times. It enhances conversations.” Luna Stower, 33, a friend of the bride, said cannabis soothed nerves and made couples more romantic. Stower, the wedding officiant and sales director for a cannabis distribution company, had benefited from munching toffee hours earlier made by a company called Mind Tricks. “It’s very relaxing. An aphrodisiac and a euphoric sedative that lasts a very long time. It has organic sugar so it’s a quality high,” she said. The high did not addle Stower’s brain. She led the ceremony fluidly, without notes, and made a quip about the the couple loving and honouring each other “till dab do you part”. Dabbing is the term for heating a dose of concentrate on a hot surface and inhaling it through glass. Cannabis brought the Oakland-based couple together because they started out as smoking buddies, said Walton, who works on cars. “One thing led to another and here we are 12 years later,” he added. He uses the herb to ease backache and Geen, 31, uses it for fibromyalgia, tumours and other conditions. “Cannabis has been my medicine and my saviour,” she said. Not to mention her employer: she works for Harborside Health Center, a medical cannabis dispensary. She wanted her wedding to show that cannabis could be classy – integrated into decor and menus, with the reception hosted at Monterey’s Victorian-era Perry House – and safe, with controls to keep it away from children. Geen laughed off the stereotype of zonked stoners, saying certain strains of pot sharpened concentration. “I’m going to remember my night better than someone who has had a lot of alcohol,” she said. Steve DeAngelo, her boss and guest, agreed, citing Carl Sagan, Steve Jobs, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as evidence that weed did not engender low functionality. The drug also did wonders for intimacy, he said. “It opens you to more sensual experiences. It allows men, especially young men, to match their sexual rhythm to a woman’s rhythm,” DeAngelo added. Geen reckoned that about 60 of the 70 guests were using cannabis. Some were exultant, like David Nevitt, 34, who dabbed, munched, vaped and toked. “We’re at a weeding! Usually at weddings you have to be discreet, do it in the car park. Doing it here right in front of everybody, it feels revolutionary,” he said. Others were grateful. Holly Alberti, 34, said: “I’ve taken several concentrated dabs and I could use some more. The ride over was quite stressful, we got lost.” And some, including a pair of college professors, were coy, saying they might partake. They declined to give their names lest Google for ever link them to pot. The groom’s mother, Aurea Walton, 55, was one of the few to opt out. “I’m Catholic,” she said. “So no, I won’t partake.” Then she smiled. “Unless it’s by mistake.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/costume-and-culture/2017/aug/25/a-solid-six-hours-of-hot-glue-gunning-your-best-book-week-costumes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T04:45:56Z","webTitle":"'A solid six hours of hot glue gunning': your best book week costumes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/costume-and-culture/2017/aug/25/a-solid-six-hours-of-hot-glue-gunning-your-best-book-week-costumes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/costume-and-culture/2017/aug/25/a-solid-six-hours-of-hot-glue-gunning-your-best-book-week-costumes","fields":{"headline":"'A solid six hours of hot glue gunning': your best book week costumes","bodyText":"Ahhh, the Australian book week parade: that annual school tradition that seems to come out of nowhere and has parents around the country up until 4am, glueing their fingers together, pounding papier-mache into a shapeless mess, and stapling one thing to another that it really shouldn’t be stapled to.

We can either win wars or win elections","bodyText":"The difficulties faced by recent social movements in achieving positive change, despite their tremendous speed and overwhelming size, is a sign that activism as a discipline must embark on a period of paradigmatic reevaluation. Breaking with the enforced consensus that our movements are winning even when it looks like we’re losing — that Occupy, Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock, Charlottesville and the countless protests happening worldwide every day are victories despite never achieving their avowed objectives — is not easy. Challenging the activist orthodoxy as an activist is far more difficult than marching in the streets or sharing rebellious tweets. But the risk of staying silent is too great. Activists must act up to save protest from irrelevance. The ways activists protest today, both online and in the streets, are ineffective and do not result in the transformative social change that we desire. This realisation is liberatory. It frees us to ask the most important question of all: why are our protests failing? An unfortunate consequence of the lack of critical reflection on protest failure is that the few explanations typically given are wholly insufficient. For example, perhaps the most commonly proposed reason for why Occupy failed is that our movement lacked demands. While it may be true that Occupy lacked a single, unified demand across all of our nearly 1,000 encampments worldwide, this theory is false because it does not explain why protests that have had clearly articulated demands also failed. Consider, for example, the global anti-Iraq war march on 15 February 2003. This was the largest synchronised protest in human history. Ten million people worldwide went into the streets with a single demand: “no war!” And yet, a month later, the Iraq war started despite global opposition. The anti-war movement was effectively destroyed. A compelling theory of protest failure would apply equally to Occupy and the global anti-Iraq war march. Therefore, a lack of demands cannot be the true reason. No, there is something deeper going on. To understand why our protests are failing we need to look instead at the story motivating our performance as activists. What script are protesters following when we flood into the streets? When citizens of nominally democratic governments protest in the streets they are performing the foundational myth of democracy: the faith that the people posses ultimate sovereignty over their governments. Here we have in simple terms the core myth that motivates all of contemporary activism: “Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,” wrote the American revolutionaries in their Declaration of Independence, justifying insurrection. Or, in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was adopted by United Nations general assembly in 1948, “The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government”. Our misplaced faith in these statements is the crux of the crisis within activism. Protest has become the dominant way the people demonstrate their collective will. Obviously, if it were true that the authority of our governments derived from the will of the people, and the consent of the governed, than the public manifestation of the people’s dissent — protest — would be an effective strategy for manifesting a sovereign power over our governments. Activists assume that if we get enough citizens into the streets then we, the people, will magically exert a popular authority over elected representatives. It is a beautiful story. But it is no longer true. Contemporary protest is broken because the will of the people is no longer the basis of the authority of government. Put colourfully, the people’s sovereignty is dead and every protest is a hopeless struggle to revive the corpse. It is time to try a different method. When activists start to think in terms of attaining sovereignty, it becomes abundantly clear that if we cannot demonstrate our will through public protest then only two paths remain: we can win wars or we can win elections. Street protests alone won’t achieve the change we need. The authority of government accrues to whomever changes the existing regime militarily or electorally. If activism is to stay relevant, we must apply our techniques of protest, and social movement creation, to either winning wars or winning elections. Neither approach will look the way you expect it. I believe that focusing on winning elections is the correct path strategically and morally. However, I have noticed that whenever I broach the subject of merging protest with electoral politics, most activists quickly assume that I’m advocating a traditional, progressive electoral strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Radical activists need not work within the existing party apparatuses. On the contrary, I find inspiration in contemporary hybrid movement-parties like Italy’s Five Star Movement, Spain’s Podemos or Iceland’s Pirate Party. Even in nations dominated by a two-party system, such as the US and arguably Australia, I see opportunities for activists to intervene electorally without giving up their revolutionary edge. I’m emboldened, above all, by the experience of the little-known New Alliance Party whose 1988 candidate, Dr Lenora Fulani, became the first woman to run for president of the United States and get on the ballot in all 50 states. This was an immense organising challenge that required gathering over one million signatures, a feat that the Green party was unable to accomplish in 2016. Dr Fulani and the New Alliance Party were able to pull it off because of their years of community organising in poor communities of colour. When outsider candidates are backed by grassroots movements the impossible becomes possible. What does this all mean, in concrete terms, for today’s activists who dream of instigating significant social change? Very few people have thought about activist electoral strategy as deeply as Jacqueline Salit, a former campaign manager for Dr Fulani’s presidential campaign and an ongoing leader in America’s independent political movement. Salit offers two pieces of advice in a recent strategy briefing for activists. First, she observes that, “the most successful independent parties in recent times have been ‘anti-party’ parties.” In other words, as activists pivot toward winning elections our movements should not imitate the form or content of existing political parties. Instead, we must position our movements as protest parties — anti-party parties — whose ascension will be the death of established parties. Salit’s second piece of advice is most important. Advocating for “cross-ideological partnerships,” Salit urges activists to “put ideology on the back burner and move on to democracy, to unrigging the system.” This post-ideological perspective is perhaps most difficult for activists to accept but it is a strategic necessity of an electoral strategy. Rather than fully aligning our movements with preexisting political categories, there is strength in poaching from across the left-right political spectrum. Moving forward, as activists we must radically challenge the roots of our discipline and embark on a period of wild tactical experimentation oriented around capturing sovereignty. Let us no longer tolerate those within our movements who stifle collective reflection on our failures. Only a total rethink of protest will lead to the emergence of newly effective methods of revolutionary activism.

Most analysts expect the central bankers to be cautious about their comments, especially Draghi. Elsewhere there were more indications of the strength of the German economy, with second quarter GDP growth of 0.6%, although a key business sentiment index slipped slightly. But in the US, durable goods orders slumped in July. Meanwhile, the head of the White House’s national economic council, Gary Cohn, has told the Financial Times he came under “enormous pressure” to quit his post after Donald Trump’s Charlottesville comments but felt duty bound to carry on. He also suggested Trump would move forward with tax reforms next week. And with Hurricane Harvey heading for Texas, oil prices have moved higher on fears of disruption to production. On the markets the FTSE 100 is currently up 0.3% , Germany’s Dax is 0.2% higher and France’s Cac has climbed 0.13%. The pound is currently up 0.23% at $1.1.2828 and 0.13% better at €1.0864. With the recent pressure on the pound, there has been some talk it could reach parity with the euro, but ING thinks this is unlikely. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Keep an eye on the Business site for reports from Jackson Hole. Meanwhile, thanks for all your comments and we’ll be back next week. Commenting on the durable goods numbers, Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: The ever-volatile durable goods report delivered once again today, with figures showing a 6.8% decline in orders for July. Investors will be concerned on the back of today’s results. Not only will support for the dollar dampen, the downbeat numbers will cast further shadows over the US growth outlook. US orders for durable goods - long lasting items such as cars and washing machines - fell by more than expected last month. They fell by 6.8% compared to a 6.4% rise in June and expectations of a 6% decline, according to the US Census Bureau. The fall is the biggest since 2014. All eyes may be on ECB president Mario Draghi and whatever comments he may or may not make at Jackson Hole about tapering its bond buying programme or the strength of the euro. But what action will the ECB actually take? Does the ECB even know what to do next? Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING says: When the ECB currently looks at the Eurozone, it sees a modest party with people enjoying themselves. The party is far from over but it could probably do with fewer QE drinks served by one of the hosts: Mario Draghi. In fact, serving less would come in handy as the drinks in Mario’s fridge are running low. But how to tell the party guests? And how to do it without getting called out as a party pooper? In our view, the main arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. Tapering should be a cautious and very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus, preferably without causing any tightening of financial conditions. Financial market reactions since the Sintra speech in June suggest that Mario Draghi and the ECB have lost some of their golden touch when it comes to guiding expectations. This has been partly driven by the fact that the ECB itself does not seem to be fully convinced what to do next and also by regularly changing its main messages. In our view, it seems most likely that the ECB would reduce the monthly purchases to €30bn in January, with an open end to the programme but at least until June 2018 and probably increasing the issuer limit and broadening maturities to grant itself maximum flexibility to scale back up once conditions warrant such a move. The Financial Times interview with Gary Cohn, head of the White House economic council, also contains positive news for those hoping for tax reforms. President Trump has been singularly unsuccessful so far in pushing through much of his agenda, and markets have almost given up on expected the long promised reforms. But Cohn said Trump will launch a major push on tax reform next week with a speech in Missouri. And this has helped the US market perk up. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The [US] index has already had a bit of good news this Friday. Trump’s economic advisor has stated in an interview with the Financial Times that felt duty bound to stay on as part of the administration despite the President’s failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, putting to bed rumours of his departure. Cohn went further, claiming that Trump will put tax reform back on the agenda next week with a speech in Missouri – no doubt a relief for investors desperate for a sign that the President will deliver on his market-lifting promises. Whether he can push through said reforms, however, is another matter entirely. In tandem with the European markets, Wall Street is expected to open marginally higher ahead of the Jackson Hole shindig. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to climb around 23 points or around 0.1% in early trading, while most European markets are currently around 0.3% higher. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The Jackson Hole Symposium is widely regarded as one of the most notable annual events, not only because of the speakers it attracts but also because it has been used as a platform to warn of upcoming policy announcements. In the past it has been Janet Yellen’s predecessors – Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke - that have delivered such warnings, the question today is whether she will do the same. The final months of the year are going to be very interesting as far as the Fed and the ECB are concerned which makes today’s appearances from Fed Chair Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi all the more interesting. Both central banks have started the process of tightening monetary policy, although the ECB would probably claim it’s more a case of removing accommodation. Either way, with the process underway, investors are keen to know what they plan next. The Fed is already well underway with its rate hikes, having started almost two years ago and having raised three more times since (so four in total). With inflation still lagging well below target though, there is growing unease within the central bank about whether the current pace is appropriate. Investors have long been unsure that there’ll be another rate hike this year and the message seems to finally be filtering through to the Fed. It will be interesting to see whether Yellen will address this today or instead focus on balance sheet reduction, which is expected to be announced in September and doesn’t interest investors in the same way. The ECB is taking a far more cautious approach having dealt with a far more severe crisis for the last decade, one that the region is only just starting to truly recover from. The central bank announced one reduction on asset purchases last December and it’s expected to announce another in the coming months. While investors are desperate to get more information on this, I think it’s highly unlikely given the ECB’s unease at past market reactions. I think the central bank will prefer to address this after the meeting next month on home turf and won’t want to risk further tightening of financial conditions in the meantime, with the euro having already sharply appreciated this year. Over to the US, and there had been some concerns in recent days that Gary Cohn, the head of the White House national economic council, might step down in the wake of Donald Trump’s comments over the violence at Charlottesville. Markets certainly did not like the idea, given his crucial role and the number of executives who had already quit various government councils. Now in an interview with the Financial Times (£) Cohn said he had come under enormous pressure to resign but felt duty bound to carry on. But he said the current administration had to do more to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He told the FT: This administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities... As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting ‘Jews will not replace us’ to cause this Jew to leave his job. I feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. We must all unite together against them. Markets are holding onto their gains, but investors are reluctant to commit themselves ahead of the key Jackson Hole speeches. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Indecision is rife across financial markets this morning, as the impending appearances from Mario Draghi and Janet Yellen mean that there remains little certainty over how this week is likely to close out. For the most part we are likely to hear Draghi reiterate his stance from earlier in the week, with ECB sources recently speculating that Draghi wouldn’t announce any new policy shifts at today’s speech. However, we could see Janet Yellen steal the headlines, with today marking her final Jackson Hole appearance before Donald Trump decides her future in February. But there is more activity in the oil market. Mahony said: Hurricane Harvey is bearing down upon the Gulf coast, with traders moving into crude oil given the potential for a massive disruption to a region which accounts for 45% of the nation’s refining capacity and 17% of US output. With possibly the biggest storm in over a decade to hit American soil heading straight into the oil producing heartlands, there is the potential for huge disruption both at sea and inland. With three refineries already shutting down ahead of the storm, there is a significant chance that we will see a major disruption to the extraction and refining of crude oil and gasoline irrespective of any physical damage. The continuing strength of the German economy, as shown earlier by the GDP figures, has been reinforced by the latest business survey. Despite slipping slightly after six consecutive rises, the Ifo business climate index at 115.9 still met expectations. Clemens Fuest, resident of the ifo Institute, said: The ifo Business Climate Index edged downwards from 116.0 points last month to 115.9 points in August. But sentiment among German businesses remains very strong. The decline was due to slightly less positive assessments of the current business situation. Companies’ short-term business outlook, by contrast, improved. Germany’s economy remains on track for growth. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said there was no signs of weakness in the German economy despite the dip in the Ifo index: The Ifo index dropped only marginally in August, confirming the almost breathtaking strength of the German economy. After six consecutive increases and three all-time highs in a row, Germany’s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, just dropped for the first time. The drop, however, was only marginal and the Ifo now stands at 115.9, from 116.0 in July. Interestingly, the decrease was exclusively driven by the current assessment component. Expectations increased to 107.9, from 107.3 in July. It is almost pointless searching for macro-economic explanations for today’s small drop. Of course, next to acrophobia, reasons for today’s drop could be the strengthening of the euro over the last few months, fresh geopolitical concerns with the US-North Korean conflict and fading signs of any imminent investment boom in the US. However, the best explanation for the drop is simply a small technical correction after three record-highs in a row. All of this means that, unless German businesses are living in a kind of never-never land, today’s Ifo index sends a clear signal that the German economy is powering ahead. What might look boring from the outside is clearly enjoyable from the inside. Jackson Hole is unlikely to provide much cause for market volatility, reckons the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Its European head of global markets research, Derek Halpenny, said: We see little reason for President Draghi choosing the Jackson Hole platform for a further update on the monetary policy outlook, but a comment on euro appreciation is more likely. The danger of Draghi not saying much of any substance today is that the markets will take it as a ‘green light’ for further euro buying. Although, with the ECB policy meeting not far from now we doubt the euro will advance much over the near-term. Of greater importance today is the speech by Fed Chair Yellen, as the probability of a funds rate hike in December has dropped to around 30% despite the economy running at a 1.9% growth rate in the first half of the year and now showing signs of a modest pick-up. Yellen’s speech is on financial market stability and given the reference to asset valuations in the minutes from the July meeting, which Fed Staff concluded had increased from “notable to elevated”, Chair Yellen may expand on this. Yellen may believe the markets need reminding that the Fed remains on course to raise the federal funds rate one further time this year. This would merely be a repeat of current Fed communication and hence is unlikely to prompt any major lift for the US dollar. The pound is holding fairly steady after a downbeat week dominated by Brexit worries, edging lower against the dollar but marginally higher against the euro. It is currently at ¢1.2798, down 0.01%, and €1.0860, up 0.09%. In recent days it has been flirting with eight year lows against the single currency, with some talk of it falling to parity. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, thinks this is unlikely: The pound has been an easy target for currency markets as the combination of a post-Brexit economic reality check and ongoing political anxiety has made the UK economy an outlier relative to its faster growing European peers. We believe this economic divergence story has largely run its course. In fact, the pound is beginning to show signs of idiosyncratic selling, similar to previous periods when domestic political risks have flared up. We make two points here. First, this tends to be a short-run phenomenon, with the pound’s material undervaluation acting as a limiting factor for sustained weakness. Second, and more importantly, we would need to see an additional layer of bad news to fuel any further politically-induced GBP selling. This seems unlikely in the absence of a Brexit disaster situation unfolding - that is a complete breakdown in UK-EU negotiations and renewed cliff-edge risks. Political will from both sides suggests the worst-case scenario will be avoided. So while EUR/GBP has overshot our 0.90 forecast for the third quarter of 2017 - and admittedly quicker than we had anticipated - we cite four reasons for why we think a move towards parity looks unlikely at this stage. Our revised forecasts acknowledge the pound could remain under pressure ahead of key domestic and Brexit political risk events in October. But we view this as an overshoot of more fundamentally-justified levels, rather than a sustained trend in EUR/GBP towards parity. The four reasons are: The euro has become a ‘political haven’ for currency markets We had earmarked October as being a pivotal month for the pound regarding political risk events. The Tory Party Conference (1-4 October), the final round of opening Brexit talks (9 October) and EU summit (19-20 October) will give markets an opportunity to assess the progress made when it comes to the UK’s exit from the EU. These event risks mean that it is understandable to see the pound markets trading with some apprehension. We have been warning of a potential ‘sell on (PM) May and go away’ type of behaviour emerging ahead of October. However, the extent of the pound’s recent weakness - and deviation from short-term fundamentals - is now starting to look excessive relative to the near-term political risks at stake. This is certainly the case for EUR/GBP, which based on our estimates is trading around 4% above its short-term financial fair value. In contrast, GBP/USD is showing no visible signs of a UK-specific risk premium. We rationalise this as both UK and US political uncertainty offsetting each other in the near-term, making the euro the go-to ‘political haven’ in currency markets. How times have changed. Political will suggests a Brexit disaster can be avoided For the pound’s politically-driven weakness to persist and extend all the way towards parity against the euro, we would argue that ‘hard Brexit’ risks would need to notch up another gear. In reality, the only way this could occur over the next six months is if we get a nightmare Brexit scenario in October - that is a complete breakdown of UK-EU negotiations. Instead, while we have previously acknowledged it is too early for the pound markets to price in any Brexit transitional deal hopes, we do think the growing consensus within Theresa May’s cabinet over a transitional arrangement means that the tail risks of a cliff-edge Brexit are diminishing. The lack of clarity by the UK government on any preferred transition length - and rumours of only a 12 or 18-month arrangement being sought - may be seen as a near-term disappointment. Progress on securing a transition deal - with both sides providing strong assurances - should help to ease any significant pound downside bias. However, for this to serve as a catalyst for a rebound in the currency, we would need to see evidence that a reduction in economic uncertainty is in fact spurring a rebound in investment activity. This is what would give the Bank of England (BoE) greater confidence to begin normalising monetary policy - which would undoubtedly be a positive pound development. The pound is cheap, very cheap We see the pound as extremely undervalued, with the very stretched valuation likely putting a limit on the scale of further downside. EUR/GBP is rich by a staggering 20% based on our medium-term Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate valuation framework. Even if we control for the post 2015 rise in pound fair value due to improving UK terms of trade and declining UK government consumption, EUR/GBP would still be overvalued by 14%. When the medium-term valuation reaches such extreme levels, it tends to be difficult for the currency to weaken materially given the limits imposed by the underlying fundamentals. Markets have adjusted to a wait-and-see Bank of England stance The latest round of key UK economic data has put talks of a Bank of England rate hike on the back burner, with the breakdown of second quarter GDP highlighting the current weakness of the UK consumer. However, markets have now adjusted to a wait-and-see BoE policy stance and see limited risks of a flatter UK rate curve. For short-term domestic rates to move lower, we would need to see evidence of weak consumer activity turning into a hard-landing for the UK economy. Our economists see this as highly unlikely and are not expecting the economy to take a significant turn for the worst. We also believe EUR/GBP parity may not be in the economic interests of the BoE given the implications that further pound weakness has for imported inflation and the squeeze in real household incomes story. Equally, one could argue it is not in the economic interests of the ECB for financial markets to get ahead of themselves when it comes to pricing in the end of the central bank’s quantitative easing programme. With implicit opposition from both sides, it’s difficult to fundamentally justify any EUR/GBP move towards parity - certainly over the next three to six months. But Patel admits ING could be wrong about not hitting parity: Apart from one (or more) of our four assumptions turning out to be wrong, currency markets can sometimes be an untamed beast. Just because the pound is undervalued doesn’t mean it should rally. There needs to be some positive catalysts for the pound to manifest, not least signs of a stabilisation in a slowing UK economy and greater progress towards a Brexit transition deal (even if not fully agreed). But certainly, the very negative psychology needs to be broken, such that the pound is not such a clear sell on rallies. Indeed we – and the BoE – are on the look-out for a ‘sell UK’ mentality developing, where the pound, gilts and equities all sell-off at the same time. This, however, has not been the case so far. If that mood was to develop, with pound weakness proving more trouble for the inflation trajectory, the IMF might recommend sharp rate hikes to break the vicious cycle. Typically that has been the prescription for significant 20% falls for the likes of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real. Of course, the UK has had some painful experiences in using rate hikes to defend the pound (think 1992), and we very much doubt that the BoE would do that to support the currency. Yet, we believe, the bearish psychology on the pound still needs to be broken. Oil prices are climbing as Hurricane Harvey, potentially the biggest to hit the US in more than a decade, approaches Texas. Brent crude is up nearly 1% at $52.55 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.8% higher at ¢47.83.on concerns about the disruption the storm could cause. Justin Chan at Numis said: Hurricane Harvey, a category-three storm, is expected to make landfall Friday night along the central coast of Texas where many refineries are located. The hurricane has continued to strengthen; if Harvey remains a category-three storm on landfall, it will be the strongest to hit the US since 2005. Energy companies have already shut coastal refineries and removed workers from offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Reuters reports, adding that nearly 10% of offshore Gulf crude output capacity had been halted by Thursday. Ahead of the main speeches at Jackson Hole, European stock markets have made a positive start to the day. The FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, Germany’s Dax has added 0.11%, France’s Cac has climbed 0.15% while Spain’s Ibex is 0.2% better. There could be some fluctuations as the day progresses but some analysts believe investors will prefer to keep their powder dry. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: It’s shaping up to be an uneventful trading session, at least until we get past speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi later this evening. Investors have used the Jackson Hole event as an excuse to go on “pause” despite numerous hints from various insiders that neither Yellen nor Draghi will say anything dramatic when it comes to monetary policy. This is especially true of the Federal Reserve chair... In other words, this year’s symposium should see a return to the days when it was a dry and dusty academic event only of interest to economists. But even though Mr Draghi isn’t expected to address the issue of the ECB’s €60 billion per month bond purchase programme, some traders believe he may have something to say about the euro. This follows on from last week’s release of minutes from the bank’s last meeting which showed that the Governing Council were concerned about the current strength of the euro. Some traders feel that the ECB don’t want to see the EURUSD get much above 1.2000 and will be listening out for anything that Mr Draghi may say on this matter. A revised second quarter growth figure for the German economy was in line with the initial estimates. The country - the economic powerhouse of the eurozone - saw GDP grow by 0.6% quarter on quarter and 0.8% year on year. Later comes the IFO business confidence index. Japan’s inflation rate edged up by more than expected in August. The consumer price index rose from 0.1% in July to 0.5% year on year, compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Improved inflation is good news for the Bank of Japan, even though the Japanese economy is still very far from the 2% inflation goal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be looking to the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US for clues to the future of their various quantitative easing and bond buying programmes. In particular speeches by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be scoured for clues on policy. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: After a long wait the Jackson Hole symposium finally kicked off yesterday, and traders will be paying close attention to the speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, which are due to take place today... We were told by unnamed sources from the European Central Bank (ECB),that Mr Draghi will not be laying down the groundwork for the tapering of the stimulus package. The ECB chief will probably use the speech to congratulate himself on the recovery of the eurozone thanks to the loose monetary policy, but he might use the relatively low inflation rate as an excuse not to talk about reigning in the stimulus package. The ECB are buying €60 billion worth of government bonds per month, and traders know full well the central bank will run out of bonds to buy. The ECB will have to come up with alternative ways to keep the policy loose, because a weak euro will assist the eurozone. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, is likely give us more of the usual, that the US economy is improving, and in particular unemployment is falling. Earnings could be firmer but they are edging higher. The US inflation level is below the Fed’s target, and if Ms Yellen brings that up, it will tip off traders that we are unlikely to see a rate hike in December. Ahead of the speeches, markets look fairly calm. The Nikkei 225 is up 0.5% and the Hang Seng has added 1%. European markets are forecast to open slightly higher: On the foreign exchanges, the pound is holding steady against both the euro and the dollar. We have already had Japanese inflation - slightly higher than expected - and German GDP - in line with forecasts (more on those shortly). Otherwise the Jackson Hole meeting dominates the day.

Situated in the Titanic quarter and looming large over the city, they are known locally as Samson and Goliath, and considering England versus New Zealand is the final the Women’s World Cup has been craving, pitting by a distance the two giants of the game against each other, it is an apt backdrop for Saturday night’s showdown. It is also a match-up that has a familiar ring to it – while the men’s game must make do with verbal sparring from Eddie Jones and Steve Hansen until next autumn, the Red Roses and the Black Ferns are no strangers to each other. England won in Rotorua in June, New Zealand at The Stoop in November and they have contested three previous World Cup finals. New Zealand have won all three but the most recent came in 2010 and because the standard of women’s rugby has improved immeasurably since then, only so much can be read into that. Furthermore, England are the defending champions – although they have not readily acknowledged as much as the tournament has progressed. Simon Middleton’s players have repeatedly said they are setting about “winning the World Cup, not defending it” and if that sounds like the anodyne result of media training, it is. Perhaps it should not be surprising that England have been on-message throughout but we will have to wait to learn what they really think of their professional contracts coming to an abrupt end until the tournament is over, when hopefully their stiff upper lips become a little looser. Unquestionably, however, it would not be the happiest way to celebrate a second World Cup in three years but if they do overcome New Zealand, it is an achievement hard to overstate. If New Zealand are to be cast as Goliath, Samson is the better fit for England, if for no other reason than they are about to be shorn of the very thing that makes them so strong. They are a side littered with very good players but they do not have a star who shines brighter than the rest as New Zealand do in Portia Woodman. Rather England’s greatest strength is their cohesion, which has been developed thanks to the amount of time spent together, as a result of professionalism. And to fully grasp why, 2014 is the best starting point. England’s World Cup triumph – their first since 1994 – catapulted them on to the front pages but a shift of focus to sevens resulted in a fourth-place finish in the following Six Nations and an opportunity missed. Considering the head coach, Gary Street, left his role only a few months after that success, in circumstances never fully explained, it would also appear the RFU did not learn its lessons from history, judging by the parlous state the men’s side found themselves in after Clive Woodward’s exit soon after the 2003 triumph. Moreover, England have won 13 matches in a row and all but one has been since the contracts began. That run includes a first Six Nations title since 2012 and a grand slam to boot. We can only hope, therefore, that if victory materialises on Saturday night it is seized upon. Soon after England’s gruelling semi-final victory over France, ITV confirmed it would screen the final in its prime-time Saturday night slot on its main channel and Emily Scarratt’s face lit up as she was told. The semi-final, broadcast on ITV4, still managed more than a million viewers but the fact that in France the number peaked at more than three million demonstrates the potential audience. The RFU hopes a new-look domestic Premiership will help – there is no doubting it is a positive move – but it requires only a cursory glance at the struggles of football’s Women’s Super League for much in the way of column inches to appreciate that internationals are paramount. Which is why a focus on sevens will be detrimental. Why would anyone inspired by this World Cup turn out to watch next year’s Six Nations if so many of the familiar faces will be absent? Not all hope is lost, however. The RFU has defended its decision to end a number of XVs contracts by pointing to the 17 full-time sevens contracts it will award and the businessman Simon Pennock, chairman of the sports sponsorship company SNAP and Lions Academy, has offered a financial lifeline to those who will soon be out of a job. The RFU, for the time being, is, like the England squad, not addressing the matter publicly and before those obstacles are tackled, New Zealand must be first. The Black Ferns will be the sternest challenge England have faced so far and are marginal favourites. Woodman is an explosive finisher but there is talent throughout their side and they seem hellbent on making up for their fluffed lines in 2014 when they failed to make it out of the pool, having won the previous four competitions. In England’s favour is the fact that as impressive as New Zealand have been, they have not been truly tested yet. The USA were certainly competitive in their semi-final and Canada, opponents during the pool stages, began the tournament ranked third in the world but both North American sides are more accomplished at sevens – neither is as well versed as, say, England or France in the finer points of XVs. England, on the other hand, are battle-hardened after their victory over a ferocious French side, although considering this is a fifth match in 18 days that may still work against them. If the backroom staff have been earning their corn and if England can stiffen the sinews once more, back-to-back World Cup triumphs are attainable. The pack is a well-oiled machine, in open play they have the best kicking game in the world and, as demonstrated against France, they have a remarkably resilient defence. England take to the pitch on Saturday with an awful lot more than a slingshot in their armoury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/27/george-lincoln-rockwell-american-nazi-party-alt-right-charlottesville","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"George Lincoln Rockwell, father of American Nazis, still in vogue for some","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/27/george-lincoln-rockwell-american-nazi-party-alt-right-charlottesville","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/27/george-lincoln-rockwell-american-nazi-party-alt-right-charlottesville","fields":{"headline":"George Lincoln Rockwell, father of American Nazis, still in vogue for some","bodyText":"On 28 August 1963, the day Martin Luther King Jr delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech on the national mall, an American Nazi arrived early. George Lincoln Rockwell, the media-savvy, pipe-smoking founder of the American Nazi Party, was blatantly racist, homophobic and antisemitic. Just 17 years after the US and its allies had defeated Nazi Germany, he had tried to hold a rally celebrating Hitler’s birthday in New York. In the capital, Rockwell had predicted that 10,000 angry counter-demonstrators would join him to protest King’s March on Washington. He had also been spreading fears about black mobs attacking Congress. Instead, the Washington DC police department, which Rockwell assumed would be on his side, had denied him a permit to demonstrate. More than 200,000 Americans joined King for a peaceful event that would reshape American history. Rockwell and fewer than 90 followers were surrounded by about 100 police officers, the Guardian reported. When one supporter attempted to give a speech, he was arrested. Frederick Simonelli, author of a 1999 biography of Rockwell, American Führer, would note that the American Nazi’s tiny band of followers that day included an unknown number who were conducting undercover surveillance for law enforcement or Jewish community groups. Nonetheless, when King marched in Chicago in 1966, he was greeted by thousands of angry white protesters, some holding signs that referenced Rockwell or carried slogans like “Join the White Rebellion” and “We Worked Hard For What We Got”, the Chicago Tribune reported. Rockwell died in 1967, murdered by one of his own followers. American neo-Nazi groups remained, largely in obscurity. Then, earlier this month, people around the world were shocked by footage from Charlottesville, where hundreds of young white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other far-right activistschanted “You will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us”. ‘They want to rebrand white supremacy’ Many of the hate groups that are attracting the most attention today – including Vanguard America, the group that James Fields, the man charged with killing Heather Heyer was photographed standing with in Charlottesville – are newly-founded. They are not part of the handful of current neo-Nazi organizations, including the National Socialist Movement and the National Alliance, that grew out of the splintering of Rockwell’s American Nazi Party, said Marilyn Mayro, senior fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. Where Rockwell used explicit Nazi iconography, many new white nationalist groups have adopted alternative fascist symbols. “They want to rebrand white supremacy, so the swastika is not so much a part of their movement,” said Mayro, adding that with some exceptions, Rockwell “doesn’t seem to be venerated by these groups, but they use some of the tactics that he promoted”. However, strategies used by Rockwell to gain media attention – talks on college campuses, violent clashes without outraged opponents, debates over the freedom of speech– are replicated today. In 1960, for example, Rockwell made headlines with his reported support for Richard Nixon’s candidacy for president. In 2016, white supremacists David Duke and Richard Spencer made headlines by endorsing Donald Trump. “I completely repudiate him and the evil he represents,” Nixon said in 1960, according to the Associated Press. In 2016, Trump did not immediately disavow support from Duke. After Charlottesville, he drew fire for a delayed and equivocal response. For some leaders of extremist groups, Rockwell does remain an inspiration. Matthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party, a neo-Nazi group that marched in Charlottesville, said in an interview in May that Rockwell’s writings and speeches were “the things that worked to bring me to National Socialism”. Heimbach called Rockwell “one of the most gifted orators of the 20th century”. “We really want to be able to carry the banner of what he died doing, being a true political National Socialist,” he said. Rockwell’s most important legacy may be the instinct for showmanship. Rockwell was tall, dimpled and “telegenic”, deploying a trademark corn cob pipe and an instinct for dramatic poses, swastikas deployed for effect, leveraging outrage into constant press attention. In 1961, he and his followers drove a Volkswagen emblazoned with the words “hate bus” through the American South, parodying the Freedom Riders who fought for civil rights reform. Many of his claims – among them the assertion that he would be elected president in 1972 “on the National Socialist ticket” – were clearly delusional. But he mastered the art of turning virulent racism and antisemitism into a spectacle the media could not resist. Like many of today’s most prominent ‘alt-right’ leaders and backers, Rockwell was not a member of the white working class. The son of a vaudeville star, he attended Brown University, where he drew comics for the campus newspaper, then served in the navy in the second world war and Korea. By 1952, Simonelli wrote in his 1999 biography, one of Rockwell’s cousins was shocked by the vehemence with which he was denouncing “Jewish traitors”. In 1963, a report from the Anti-Defamation League found that Rockwell had only 16 “troopers” in residence with him in a rickety two-story barracks in Arlington, Virginia. The plumbing was faulty and the American Nazis were subsisting on canned hash, chicken stew and even cat food, the report said. Rockwell “remains a nuisance, but is not a menace”, the report said, calling him “a mere pimple on the American body politic”. One of the keys to Rockwell’s failure, Simonelli wrote, was the decision of Jewish organizations to give the Nazi leader the “silent treatment”. After several years of responding to his provocations, which produced headlines regarding clashes in New York, Washington and Boston, some Jewish community organizations worked together to ignore him, a tactic they called “quarantine”. Finally, on 25 August 1967, outside a laundromat in Arlington, Rockwell was shot dead. One of his former followers, John Patler, was convicted of his murder. On Friday, in Arlington, NBC reported that a small group of American Nazis offered a salute to their fallen leader."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/25/home-office-pay-back-deportation-legal-fees-letter-error","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T15:16:29Z","webTitle":"Home Office privately says it will pay back deportation legal fees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/25/home-office-pay-back-deportation-legal-fees-letter-error","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/25/home-office-pay-back-deportation-legal-fees-letter-error","fields":{"headline":"Home Office privately says it will pay back deportation legal fees","bodyText":"The Home Office has privately told an EU national who received a deportation letter in error that it will be reimbursing the legal fees she incurred in fighting the order to leave the UK. After Eva Johanna Holmberg spent about £3,800 fighting the government decision to order her to leave the country or face deportation or detention, she discovered that the letter had been sent in error – and that up to 100 EU citizens had received similar ultimatums. When the Guardian raised the issue the Home Office apologised to Holmberg and the prime minister, Theresa May, called the incident an “unfortunate error”. Holmberg, a Finnish academic with a British husband, said the Home Office had now assured her that her expenses would be fully reimbursed and an official had told her that no one who had received a letter would be out of pocket. In a statement, the Home Office directed those affected to its complaints process and said: “We cannot comment on the details of any individual compensation claim.” Other recipients of the letters said they had not heard from the Home Office. “I am relieved, especially for those people who had to take personal loans and were in distress,” said Holmberg. “I wish the Home Office will be more careful with people’s lives in the future and keep their promise to investigate this matter thoroughly. How was it possible to make 100 ‘unfortunate errors’?” The government had faced growing pressure to reinforce their apology with recompense for the worried EU nationals who, in some cases, spent thousands on legal fees to appeal against their since annulled deportation. Holmberg spent £3,800 overall, which included a £3,500 fee to lodge an appeal. The Home Office mistakenly sent the letters to EEA nationals informing them they were at risk of detention if they did not leave the country in the next month. Recipients of the letters had called on the government to cover the costs they spent on legal consultation fees, lodging appeals and going to tribunal. Mihaela Duta, a Romanian national who has lived in the UK since 2010, also received a deportation letter last week and has spent £1,335 on legal fees, including paying for a consultation with a solicitor, lodging an appeal and taking the case to a tribunal. She has not yet received a promise of reimbursement and said that she had little faith in the authorities. “The UK is my home, regardless of my nationality or borders,” said Mihaela Duta, who also received a deportation letter last week. “I have adapted, integrated and respected the rules and the culture of this country. I do feel welcomed but this is not to be confused with the trust I have in the government of this country.” She also said she had complained to the European court of justice over the issue. The Home Office is conducting an investigation into the issue. Letters published on social media by the recipients show they were signed off by more than one person. “The Home Office has long played fast and loose with people’s lives and Brexit means yet more and more people risk being caught up in their often Kafkaesque systems,” said Caroline Lucas, Holmberg’s MP in Brighton Pavilion. “I hope there will be a full investigation into what’s happened and heads rolling should not be ruled out if anyone’s found to have acted irresponsibly.” Attention is now likely to turn to the cause of the “unfortunate errors” as calls grow for the Home Office to reassure the public that they are prepared to deal with hundreds of thousands of applications after Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/25/maria-sharapova-us-open-simona-halep-first-round-draw","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T17:08:48Z","webTitle":"Maria Sharapova to face No2 seed Simona Halep in US Open first round","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/25/maria-sharapova-us-open-simona-halep-first-round-draw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/25/maria-sharapova-us-open-simona-halep-first-round-draw","fields":{"headline":"Maria Sharapova to face No2 seed Simona Halep in US Open first round","bodyText":"Maria Sharapova has been drawn to face Simona Halep, the No2 seed, in the pick of the first-round ties at the US Open, which begins on Monday.

Just look at the figures, as assembled by Enders Analysis. The BBC lost 62% of its staff when it moved departments to MediaCity: that was twice as much per person on redundancy (£48,000) as on relocation (£27,000). The Office for National Statistics, incidentally, lost 90% of its London staff when it moved to Newport. Only 620 C4 employees are involved. They are commissioning and support staff. They do not make programmes and carry no manufacturing base with them. They are also highly skilled men and women, many of them also tied to London because of their partners’ jobs. If – on the BBC Salford model – 62% of C4 staff don’t go to Brum, that would be a near-£20m redundancy bill, £7m on relocation and another big chunk of cash on hiring replacements. Defections at an ONS level would obviously steepen costs. Reckon £35m gone in any case, says Enders. This is a heavy burden for C4 as advertising stalls, a prescription for upheaval that does no one any good: and an endgame that is pure political show, as government seeks to dragoon a state-created asset and thoroughly degrades it in the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/25/corbyn-calls-halt-job-centre-closures-rally-in-scotland-coatbridge","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T16:11:55Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn calls for halt to job centre closures at rally in Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/25/corbyn-calls-halt-job-centre-closures-rally-in-scotland-coatbridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/25/corbyn-calls-halt-job-centre-closures-rally-in-scotland-coatbridge","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn calls for halt to job centre closures at rally in Scotland","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has called on ministers to halt the closure of job centres and social security offices as he continued a five-day tour of key constituencies in Scotland. The Labour leader addressed a rally in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, where the Department of Work and Pensions is closing an administration office and relocating 250 jobs as part of a UK-wide cost-cutting and restructuring programme. Speaking to about 250 union activists and supporters outside the Quadrant shopping centre, where a large proportion of stores are shuttered and vacant, Corbyn said the DWP closure would damage the small town’s economy. “I’m saying to the government: halt this closure programme, halt the closure of this centre here, don’t destroy the 600 jobs that are available here that are important as an economic contributor to this town,” Corbyn said. “Instead think again. Think about the role of government in supporting people. Think again about the punitive way in which you operate your regimes.” He repeated Labour’s pledge to lift the cash freeze imposed on most benefits, which normally rise each year in line with inflation – though party sources stressed they would not be able to meet the full cost of cancelling it immediately. Labour believes part of the cost could eventually come from the increased tax contributions by workers paid the party’s proposed £10 an hour minimum wage. The Conservatives hit back by issuing a statement accusing Corbyn of making promises he could not afford to deliver. “Labour spent their whole election campaign promising the country things they simply couldn’t afford and they’re doing the same thing again,” it said. “Ending this freeze would cost a massive £12.9bn and leave ordinary, hardworking people footing the bill.” The rally was organised by the PCS, the public sector union that is not affiliated with Labour but supports Corbyn’s leadership. Gillian Jones, the PCS branch secretary, said its survey of the DWP staff being relocated had found they spent thousands of pounds each week in local shops. “The loss to this community of these jobs is going to have a huge impact,” she said. “We work here, we shop here, we socialise here. We’re very much part of this community and that’s very much the way we want to keep it.” Corbyn is visiting 18 Scottish constituencies on a five-day tour that Labour hopes will bolster the party’s unexpected victories in seven Scottish constituencies in June’s snap election in case a second election is called. Labour gained ground after 10 years of decline that culminated in the humiliating loss of 40 of its 41 Westminster seats to the Scottish National party at the 2015 election. Corbyn’s advisers say they underestimated the scale of his appeal in Scotland and the SNP’s vulnerability. On Wednesday, Corbyn travelled to the Western Isles, which Labour believes it could regain from the SNP. He visited seats in Glasgow on Thursday, taking in a rally with younger supporters at a brewery, followed by a filled-to-capacity speech at Glasgow central mosque. Corbyn told activists in Glasgow “a Labour government would not be afraid to pick up the phone to President Donald Trump and say quite simply ‘you are wrong on the Paris climate change agreement. And we would also be quite open in saying ‘When the Ku Klux Klan and the fascists arrive in Charlottesville, the whole world should condemn them’.” His tour ends in Edinburgh on Sunday, with an event at the fringe festival. The seat of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill was won back by Labour in June after it was seized by the SNP in 2015. Its new MP, Hugh Gaffney, a trade union activist and former postman, wore his old ParcelForce shirt in his maiden speech at Westminster where he called for the Royal Mail to be renationalised. Corbyn said the UK government needed to abandon its “often punitive sanctions regime” against those claiming benefits and should overhaul the universal credit system. “Invest in the future of all us. Invest in better transport systems; invest in sustainable jobs in new industries; invest in communities; invest in decent housing. You then create the virtuous circle of increasing employment in all those industries and providing a common good for all,” he said. “You don’t cut your way to prosperity: you improve people’s lives by investing in the future. If money was found to bail out the banks then surely the money should be available to support and invest in communities all across the country. “[If] you cut and destroy public services, they are not there for anybody later on in life. Even the very richest get heart attacks; even the very richest may get cancer; even the very richest homes might catch fire. At that point they need an ambulance service. At that point they need a hospital. At that point they need a fire service. I simply say to the Tory party, think again about the direction you’re taking the country in.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/25/ronald-koeman-diego-costa-chelsea-everton-sign-striker","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"Ronald Koeman says Chelsea’s Diego Costa would be ‘welcome’ at Everton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/25/ronald-koeman-diego-costa-chelsea-everton-sign-striker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/25/ronald-koeman-diego-costa-chelsea-everton-sign-striker","fields":{"headline":"Ronald Koeman says Chelsea’s Diego Costa would be ‘welcome’ at Everton","bodyText":"Ronald Koeman has said he would welcome the chance to bring Diego Costa to Everton as he reiterated his desire to sign a striker before the transfer deadline. Costa is in exile in Brazil having refused to return to training with Chelsea and stated his intention to return to his former club Atlético Madrid. A late diversion to Goodison Park may be a remote prospect but Koeman, who wants to add experience to the Everton attack, said on Friday he would be interested in the Spain international. Asked about the possibility of luring the 28-year-old back from Brazil, the Everton manager replied: “I have always said there will be a warm welcome for every good player here and he is a good player.” Koeman intends to discuss late transfer targets with the Everton board after Sunday’s visit to Stamford Bridge, the squad’s third demanding away trip of the week. Despite Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s impressive start to the campaign the Everton manager insists he cannot be reliant on the England Under-20 World Cup winner, and the summer signing Sandro Ramírez, as his frontline options for the whole season. “We are still looking to bring in a striker,” he said. “It is not about being unhappy with Dominic – I am very happy with him – but he is still young and we need more competition up front. We have tough fixtures and a lot of international players and a lot of players selected for the under-21s – six Everton players with England. For young players the most difficult thing is being regular with their performances but Dominic, like Tom Davies, is doing exceptionally well.” Koeman believes Jordan Pickford is on course to become England’s first-choice goalkeeper and justify Everton’s £30m outlay after only four appearances for the Merseyside club. Pickford, who became the most expensive British goalkeeper in history when he moved from Sunderland this summer, continued a highly impressive start to his Everton career when saving a penalty against Hajduk Split in the Europa League play-off on Thursday. His contribution followed a call-up to the senior England squad for next month’s World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia, and Koeman believes it is only a question of time before the 23-year-old establishes himself as No1 for club and country. Koeman said: “Jordan is really strong. From the beginning he has been really comfortable, he has not looked nervous and he gets the confidence of being the No1. The reason we signed him for big money was that we expect him to be the No1 in the future for England. That is the confidence we have in the boy and so far he is doing fantastic. Now it is about keeping that level because it is always more difficult to keep it than to get there.” Pickford has played 14 times for England Under-21s and was selected by Gareth Southgate for last season’s senior games against Slovenia, Scotland and Spain, but has yet to make his full senior debut. Koeman believes it was evidence of the keeper’s “good personality” that he was unafraid to berate Wayne Rooney over a mistake he made against Hajduk. “Criticism with respect is good,” he said. Koeman added: “It is easy for a goalkeeper to stop 100 balls than if you get one or two in a game, because then you need to be focused for that one moment. It was like that in Split. The penalty was a really important moment. If he doesn’t save the penalty it is 2-1 and with the atmosphere in the stadium it could have been really tough for the last 30 minutes. But after he made the save it was over. Everybody likes that kind of goalkeeper. “You look to their stats and he had, even while being relegated with Sunderland, a good season. That is difficult because they conceded a lot of goals but in our view he was still that promising goalkeeper for the future of Everton. That was the reason we paid that money for him. We think he will be the best in the future and he is on a good way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/26/the-week-in-1968","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-26T23:05:49Z","webTitle":"From the Observer archive: this week in 1968","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/26/the-week-in-1968","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/26/the-week-in-1968","fields":{"headline":"From the Observer archive: this week in 1968","bodyText":"The Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia was not only a crime; it was a blunder of historic proportions. It is still too early to strike a final balance, as one bewildering rumour succeeds another.But one thing is certain. By sending in their troops the Russian leaders confessed their political bankruptcy and revealed the weakness of the entire Soviet system. They have, at the same time, increased that weakness. By occupying Czechoslovakia they have, in effect, announced that the Soviet system is so vulnerable that it cannot allow free speech and so brittle that it dare not permit experiment. The Soviet action demands condemnation: but just to condemn is an inadequate reaction. For this risks treating the Soviet behaviour as an aberration. But this is precisely what it is not. The Soviet invasion falls into a familiar pattern: the Pavlovian reaction of all intensely conservative and autocratic regimes faced with a challenge to their authority and a demand for change. It was in this way that Metternich’s Austria reacted to the forces of nineteenth-century nationalism; it was in this way, too, that Tsarist Russia reacted to the demands for social change. What we have been witnessing in Czechoslovakia is not the birth of a new Soviet mood of aggression, but the beginnings of the death-pangs of a hopelessly ossified system. By acknowledging to everyone, particularly to their own people, that they are absolutely obliged to revert to the most blatant use of force, lies and secrecy, the Soviet leaders are also announcing that their present system is doomed.

Rather than marking a dismal low-point for communication, Scott believes that social media is allowing us to become increasingly sophisticated in our use of some of the most potent, but least studied, aspects of communication. “People look at emojis or gifs and think ‘They’re stupid’, but they’re trying to address something,” she said. “It’s trying to put that emotional, non-verbal information back in.” This year’s prestigious lecture series, on the theme The Language of Life, will explore how and when humans first evolved language, how laughter links us to our animal past and the subtle cues we send to others through facial expression, tone of voice and even smell. Scott will also look at how technology is transforming the way we talk to each other. While some suggest social media is dumbing down our interactions, Scott draws parallels between the emergence of emojis and gifs and the introduction of punctuation to indicate the prosody of speech. “Emojis are trying to do that exact same thing,” said Scott. “It’s all trying to add back in the stuff that would be pretty effortless if you were face to face.” Scott argues that science has tended to neglect the non-verbal side of communication, possibly because it does not fit within common preconceptions of what “sounds properly sciencey”. “Actually there’s no real sense to that,” points out Scott, whose own research back catalogue includes work on beat-boxing, impressionists and whether rats laugh (they do). Emerging evidence from brain imaging studies shows that while the brain’s left hemisphere is processing linguistic information, a parallel network in the right side of the brain is activated in response to the rhythm of speech, the person’s identity and emotions being expressed. “There are brain systems that are picking up and decoding all that non-verbal information,” said Scott. Non-verbal signals include so-called microexpressions, the fleeting and subtle movements of muscles around the eyes and mouth that occur within as little as 50 milliseconds, which Scott says often give clues to the emotions people try to mask using large expressions. Specialists can learn to reliably decode these expressions – “it’s almost a phonetics of the face”, but even without training people pick up on flashes of anger, sadness or disgust beneath a smile. Scott has spent more than a decade studying laughter, recently showing that while people can match the sound of an unknown person’s social laughter to their voice, it is almost impossible to match a voice to involuntary laughter. “People can make all sorts of funny noises, it’s completely idiosyncratic,” said Scott. “You’re not being you, this thing is just happening.” The differences point to involuntary laughter belonging to an ancient system for vocalising. The Royal Institution’s annual lectures have a long and distinguished history. Created by Michael Faraday in 1825, past lecturers include Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins and Sir David Attenborough. Scott will be the seventh woman to present the lectures, and the fourth since 2009. As is traditional, Scott’s lectures will include demonstrations and audience participation – the public’s ability to distinguish real versus fake laughter will be tested – and the Royal Institution said that a world record may be attempted, although they would not say in what. Scott will also compare human and animal communication and cites a growing body of work showing that while animals might fall short of the sophistication of human language, primates exhibit similar networks to those we use when we communicate, and that dogs’ understanding of language rivals that of toddlers. “There’s a long and noble history of humans thinking we’re the best at everything … but a lot of the new techniques have indicated we’re much less special than we think we are,” she said. “I’m sure if there were dolphin scientists out there they’d be going ‘We think they’re probably communicating with each other with those funny noises, but who knows?’” Scott will also tackle the “myth” that women talk more than men (research suggests there’s virtually no difference), that women gossip more, or that men fail to pick up on emotional cues. “Men wouldn’t be able to function if they couldn’t,” she said. “Stereotypes are powerful for a reason and they save a lot of time, but they’re not always true.” Scott, 50, traces her current research on the human voice back to being “obsessed with accents” as a child growing up in Blackburn. She describes the Royal Institution’s lectures as a rare “glimpse into the the world of adult science”. “It was like someone let you in on a secret,” she said. “When I was a child there wasn’t really anything else out there. There is more now and people do take it more seriously.” However, Scott believes scientists too often still face an ivory tower mentality in the academic world, where being able to explain your work to the public can be equated to being an intellectual lightweight. “I’m keen to turn that around,” said Scott, who has done a wide-range of public outreach, including stand-up comedy on science. “You can do a TED talk and it doesn’t make your science less important just because it’s accessible.” “I’ve had people say ‘you just work in an easier area’,” she added. “That’s the wrong way around. It sounds easy because [I’ve] thought about how to communicate it.” And, as technology rapidly evolves, what might the future hold for human communication? “If there’s something that we can exploit for communication we’ll find a way – it’s a process that started as soon as humans put marks out in the world to store information,” Scott said. “With the cave paintings in Lascaux, maybe there was someone sitting around going ‘Ooh, I don’t know about these cave paintings, will it lead to us all stopping talking to each other?’ No, it’s what we do.’” The Royal Institution lectures will be broadcast on BBC4 between Christmas and New Year, and Members of the Ri and registered schools can apply for tickets to the recordings from early September via rigb.org/christmas-lectures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/25/crystal-palace-swansea-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T13:02:45Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace v Swansea City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/25/crystal-palace-swansea-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/25/crystal-palace-swansea-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace v Swansea City: match preview","bodyText":"Selhurst Park was the venue for Paul Clement’s first game in charge of Swansea back in January, the recently appointed manager leaving his seat in the stand at half-time to address his players and help inspire a late victory in a relegation scrap.

The collapse of the 2015 deal between Tehran, the US and five other countries – by which Iran has significantly curbed its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief – would trigger a new crisis over nuclear proliferation at a time when the US is in a tense standoff with North Korea. Intelligence analysts, chastened by the experience of the 2003 Iraq war, launched by the Bush administration on the basis of phoney evidence of weapons of mass destruction, are said to be resisting the pressure to come up with evidence of Iranian violations. “Anecdotally, I have heard this from members of the intelligence community – that they feel like they have come under pressure,” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who also served as a national security council spokesman and special assistant to Barack Obama. “They told me there was a sense of revulsion. There was a sense of déjà vu. There was a sense of ‘we’ve seen this movie before’.” However, Donald Trump has said he expects to declare Iran non-compliant by mid-October, the next time he is required by Congress to sign a three-monthly certification of the nuclear deal (known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action, or JCPOA). And the administration is pursuing another avenue that could trigger the collapse of the deal. David Cohen, a former deputy director of the CIA, said it was “disconcerting” that Trump appeared to have come to a conclusion about Iran before finding the intelligence to back it up. “It stands the intelligence process on its head,” Cohen told CNN. “If our intelligence is degraded because it is politicised in the way that it looks like the president wants to do here, that undermines the utility of that intelligence all across the board.” In another move reminiscent of the Iraq debacle, the US administration is putting pressure on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to be more aggressive in its demands to investigate military sites in Iran, just as George W Bush’s team pushed for ever more intrusive inspections of Saddam Hussein’s military bases and palaces. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, visited IAEA headquarters in Vienna to press the agency to demand visits to Iran’s military sites. Haley described IAEA inspectors as “professionals and true experts in their field”. “Having said that, as good as the IAEA is, it can only be as good as what they are permitted to see,” Haley told reporters on her return to New York. “Iran has publicly declared that it will not allow access to military sites but the JCPOA makes no distinction between military and non-military sites. There are also numerous undeclared sites that have not been inspected yet. That’s a problem.” Unlike the case of Iraq and the Bush administration, where there were deep divisions in the US intelligence community over the evidence for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, there is now a general consensus among US intelligence and foreign intelligence agencies, the state department, the IAEA and the other five countries that signed the JCPOA, as well as the European Union, that there is no significant evidence that Iran has violated its obligations under the deal. Tehran scaled down its nuclear infrastructure and its nuclear fuel stockpiles soon after the deal was signed in Vienna. However, Trump, who denigrated the agreement throughout his election campaign, has appeared determined to torpedo it. On 17 July, the latest deadline for presidential certification of the JCPOA deal required by Congress, the announcement was postponed for several hours, while Trump’s senior national security officials dissuaded the president from a last-minute threat not to sign. “If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal on 25 July. He hinted it was his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who had persuaded him to certify the agreement. “Look, I have a lot of respect for Rex and his people, good relationship. It’s easier to say they comply. It’s a lot easier. But it’s the wrong thing. They don’t comply,” the president said. “And so we’ll see what happens ... But, yeah, I would be surprised if they were in compliance.” Trump said his administration was doing “major” and “detailed” studies on the issues. Richard Nephew, who was principal duty coordinator for sanctions policy in the Obama administration state department and a member of the team that negotiated the JCPOA said government agencies were producing such studies all the time. He said the difference under the Trump administration was that they were being told the conclusions should be. “Behind the scenes, there is a huge machine that is pumping up reports and updates and status checks for the administration and Congress,” Nephew, now at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, said. “You have intelligence officers and analysts in a bunch of agencies who spend literally every day scrubbing every single report they have got of what is going on inside Iran trying to find instances of non-compliance. “What I suspect is happening now is that those intel officers have been asked to go to the cutting room floor, [and are being asked:] ‘What have you forgotten? What have you discounted? What have you said doesn’t really fit and not really relevant?’ “I actually think that’s healthy if it’s an honest question,” Nephew said, but he added: “It seems there is a faction within the administration that is trying to lay the basis for getting out [of the agreement] on the basis of cooked books.” He predicted that intelligence analysts would resign if they were pushed too hard. “The intelligence community learned the lessons of Iraq hard,” Nephew said. “And the analysts I know who are attached to this effort I am quite convinced would resign and resign loudly before they would allow ... their words to be twisted and turned the way it happened with Iraq.” Robert Malley, who was a senior US negotiator at the nuclear talks with Iran, said that the Trump administration was discounting the information it was getting from its agencies because it viewed them as the “deep state” or “Obama holdovers”. But Malley predicted it would be harder for Trump to ignore the reservations of US intelligence and US allies and drive towards confrontation with Iran than it was for George Bush to go to war in Iraq. “The main difference is that Iraq has already happened, which means that both the American public and the international community have seen a similar movie before, and therefore might well react differently than the way they reacted the last time around,” he said. The other principal avenue of attack on the JCPOA being pursued by the Trump administration has focused on the question of inspections of Iranian military sites. Under the agreement, the IAEA can present evidence of suspect activity at any site to Iran and ask for an explanation. If the explanation is not accepted by the IAEA, Tehran would have two weeks to negotiate terms of access for the agency inspectors. If the Iranian government refuses, a joint commission of JCPOA signatories could vote to force access, and Iran would have three days to comply. “There is a mechanism, a very detailed one and one of the issues we spent the most time on in negotiation,” Malley said. But he added: “There are people on the outskirts of the administration, and who are pushing hard on the Iran file, saying they should be allowed to ask for inspection at any sensitive site for no reason whatsoever, in order to test the boundaries of the agreement.” During her visit to Vienna, Haley suggested that Iran’s past practice of using military sites for covert nuclear development work was grounds for suspicion. But Laura Rockwood, a former legal counsel in the IAEA’s safeguards department (which carries out inspections), said the US or any other member state would have to provide solid and contemporaneous evidence to trigger an inspection. “If the US has actionable intelligence that is useful for the IAEA to take into account, and I mean actual and honest intelligence, not fake intel that they tried to use in 2003, then I think the agency will respond to it,” Rockwood, who is now executive director of the Vienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, said. “But if they try to create evidence or if they try to pressure the agency into simply requesting access because they can, I think it will backfire.” Some analysts, however, believe that the Obama administration was too willing to let Iranian infractions slide and that a more sceptical view of the agreement and implementation is overdue. “Asking the system for knowledge of violations is different than asking anyone to falsify them,” said David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security. “This is a highly technical subject and the Obama administration downplayed and even hid violations and problems. So, there is a need to establish the true situation and ensure decision makers understand these issues. Spinning this as equivalent to Iraqi WMD claims is not only unfair but highly inaccurate. Certainly, the pro-JCPOA advocates would love to do that.” Any Iranian objections to new inspections could be cited by Trump if he carries out his threat to withhold certification of the JCPOA in October. It would then be up to the US Congress whether to respond with new sanctions, and then Trump would have to sign them into law, in potential violation of the agreement. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said this week that elements of the programme that had been stopped under the agreement could be resumed “within hours” if the US walked out. Ultimately, Tehran and the other five national signatories to the agreement would have to decide whether to try to keep the deal alive without US participation. The head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, suggested over the weekend that if the other signatories remained committed, Iran would continue to observe the deal. It is an issue that would split Europe from the US, likely leaving the UK perched uneasily in the middle. “As a practical matter, you’re not going to have the rest of the international community, you’re not going to have our allies in Europe, you’re certainly not going to have the Russians and the Chinese coming along with us to reimpose real pressure on the Iranians,” Cohen said. “So you’ll have this fissure between the United States and essentially the rest of the world in trying to reinstate pressure on Iran.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/25/new-gcses-exam-politicians-more-explaining","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-25T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"The new-style GCSEs show why politicians must do more explaining | Anne McElvoy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/new-gcses-exam-politicians-more-explaining","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/new-gcses-exam-politicians-more-explaining","fields":{"headline":"The new-style GCSEs show why politicians must do more explaining","bodyText":"Exam results days don’t change, however many reforms the grading system endures. It’s the same mixture of glassy-eyed teenagers awaiting calls, and parents indulging in displacement activity until we can whoop or murmur sympathies. This year we find ourselves looking at a list of number and letters, which is a bit like mixing metric and imperial weights in a recipe. No one likes exams in transition, so this was always going to be the unofficial Year of the Bemused. Not all of it is bad. The introduction of a grade 9 – in English and maths so far, with other subjects to follow from next year – is fair enough in giving the ambitious the highest bar to clear. Some fears have been exaggerated, not least a scary prediction that the new grade was so exacting that only a handful of pupils would hit it. In fact, between 2% and 3.5% did so. Further down the grade ladder, however, confusion reigns and the regulator Ofqual needs to be much clearer about what is going on and how to prepare for it. Education secretary Justine Greening has inherited the job of explaining an exam system that Michael Gove introduced to make it more stretching. But I’m afraid grade 4 as a “standard pass” and a 5 as a “strong pass” is meaningless, even by the standards of Whitehall waffle. The old idea of a pass/fail exam still exists, glimpsed darkly through the grade jumble. In which case a pass is a pass – anything below it isn’t. Alternatively, we have replaced the old pass/fail idea with a ladder of numbered grades, like those bemusing sunscreen ratings. A grade 5, according to one exam board’s briefing, is “not quite a B and not the same as a C”. Why, thanks. But since school leaders are judged on the proportion of pupils they get over the grade 4/5 hurdle, we need to know why the cut-off lies where it does. At the bottom of the performance scale, the fog clears – the bottom of grade 1 aligns with the bottom of grade G. Consistency of failure is not much to aim for. Exam systems change too much, and usually for the same reason. A mixture of too many boards competing for business and a period of grade inflation led to the introduction of the A* because ministers liked to tell themselves that schools were doing better than they were. The proportion of A* to C grades rose every year from 1988 to 2011, before a necessary correction. International comparisons told us this was a bit of a swizz. And though the international Pisa tests can still be faulted, they have improved a lot. After years spent looking at some of the best performing school systems, I can say that it is vanishingly hard to find one that scores in a mediocre way in the tables but turned out to be brilliant at making the most of pupils’ potential. One lesson from comparing systems is that policy reforms work best when their focus is clear and sustained. A plethora of objectives and measures of success often end up muddying aims. So my main criticism of the Cameron-era changes is that they relentlessly measured outputs and, at the same time, re-tweaked curriculums and exam grading, when what was needed was more rigour in the management of the new varieties of schools that now make up a major chunk of state education. True, the public sector is often averse to change. But a new wave of job disruption from automation and technology means that alterations are inevitable. In some cases, social shifts and globalisation necessitate tweaks we had not anticipated. A higher number of children growing up bilingual in cosmopolitan, urban areas, for instance, has created an un-level playing field in modern languages. Having promoted the learning of modern languages in state schools (as a beneficiary of both), I was horrified to hear a very good teacher advising a young friend against a language A-level on the grounds that the A* was more likely to go to a native speaker. Almost two-fifths of those gaining top grades in A-level German, for example, spoke it as their native tongue. At a time when we desperately need linguists in business and diplomacy (as well as just understanding the outside world better), that is a loophole crying out to be closed. As Andreas Schleicher, the Pisa test inventor (and thus no knee-jerk defender of coasting schools) points out, the most consistently improving systems are those that choose priorities and stick to them, throughout political upheavals. The English model has created too much complexity and no obvious sense of what it wants to do most urgently. Add to that an awful funding settlement, which punishes many of the very inner-city schools that ministers were recently so proud to have enhanced, and the present reform recipe looks scrappy. Theresa May faced repeated attacks for this during June’s election, and I suspect changes will follow in the next budget, but only after a lot of unnecessary woe. If there is a useful lesson from a year of fretting over GCSE changes, it is that future implementation needs better preparation and more clarity about intentions – not just at the top end of the scale. So get on with the grade overhaul, but work out more carefully what counts as success and failure between the extremes. Then stick to the plan, empower Ofqual to sort out the oddities – and the next time a politician wants an exam overhaul, make them spend a long time explaining why. • Anne McElvoy is a senior editor at the Economist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/12/harriet-harman-hits-out-unions-backing-decriminalised-sex-work","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T17:49:29Z","webTitle":"Harriet Harman hits out at unions for backing decriminalised sex work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/12/harriet-harman-hits-out-unions-backing-decriminalised-sex-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/12/harriet-harman-hits-out-unions-backing-decriminalised-sex-work","fields":{"headline":"Harriet Harman hits out at unions for backing decriminalised sex work","bodyText":"Harriet Harman has accused two major unions of “legitimising exploitation” after they backed the decriminalisation of sex work. Aslef and the GMB will on Wednesday urge the Trades Union Congress conference to decriminalise prostitution, claiming it would improve safety for the thousands of men and women who work in the sex industry. The unions want the TUC and the government to back the launch of a scheme where sex workers have full legal protection. Opponents say the move could increase sexism and violence against women, legitimise grooming and make schoolgirls grow up seeing prostitution as a “career choice”. The former deputy Labour leader tweeted her opposition to the motion and urged TUC delegates to vote it down: The Aslef motion, which is backed by the GMB, demands the overturning of legislation which “forces sex workers to work alone, leaving workers vulnerable to crime and the threat of losing access to their families”. It says “austerity measures since 2010 have led to an increase in the number of people working in the sex industry”, and claims that many people would not choose to work in the sex industry and do so “because of economic necessity rather than criminal coercion”. It says “sex workers should have the same rights as those in other industries”. The motion supports the New Zealand model of “full decriminalisation which would give sex workers protections as workers in law”. At a fraught TUC fringe meeting on Monday, sex workers pushed the case for decriminalisation – saying the current law infringed their human rights by preventing them from setting up brothels. They were criticised by campaigners who said prostitution demeaned women. One critic argued that the New Zealand model would mean women could set up small brothels without any registration. She said: “That is the model you want for this country: to bring prostitution to every street corner so all our daughters can choose to work there. What about the right of women not to be prostituted?” A delegate from the National Education Union said thousands of schoolgirls were being groomed. “The problem is if you say it’s a job like every other ... sex working will be presented as a viable option, a career choice,” he said. But one sex worker, Laura, told delegates: “Sex workers are workers and we are part of the trade union movement. In one job you sell your arms, if you are a sex worker you are selling different parts. “It’s value judgment to say which parts of your body you use. ‎We have a right to decide which parts we use – at what time and at what price. For people who have a moral objection we ask you to put aside your disgust at exchanging sex for money.” ‎Aslef said it was wrong that the law made it illegal for women to share premises to sell sex – and that this situation infringed their human rights. Cat Stephens, a sex worker and GMB activist, said: “A community’s worth is measured by the way it treats the most vulnerable – and sex workers, whatever their gender, are some of the most marginalised and vulnerable people in the UK. “It’s time for trade unionists to treat people who sell sexual services with respect and support our fight for our rights.” Margaret Gregg, a GMB activist, said decriminalisation of sex workers did not promote or celebrate sex work. “Respect for a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body is fundamental to feminism. Decriminalisation is not a magic bullet, but it is an essential first step to effectively tackle the violence and exploitation facilitated by current legislation.” Organisations such as Amnesty International advocate for the decriminalisation of all aspects of consensual adult sex – including sex work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/15/phoebe-bridgers-ryan-adams-bright-eyes","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T12:30:07Z","webTitle":"Phoebe Bridgers: Ryan Adams, Bright Eyes and me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/15/phoebe-bridgers-ryan-adams-bright-eyes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/15/phoebe-bridgers-ryan-adams-bright-eyes","fields":{"headline":"Phoebe Bridgers: Ryan Adams, Bright Eyes and me","bodyText":"When Phoebe Bridgers was growing up, her taste in music went “completely backwards”. The 22-year-old singer-songwriter, who grew up in Pasadena, Los Angeles, was seriously into classic rock and folk as a kid. The first concert she really remembers was Neil Young, when she was 11. “But when I hit high school, and emo was already basically over, I was like: ‘Wait! I can’t believe I missed this, this is awesome,’” she laughs. She made herself a Bowling For Soup T-shirt and dyed her hair several shades of bright, before finally shaving it and then returning to the bleached blond she is today. There are hints of both Young and her emo past in the music she’s making now, an intricate tapestry of rock, folk and intensely personal storytelling that calls to mind early Bright Eyes. Funeral tells of singing at the funeral of a boy she knew who had died of a heroin overdose, while last year’s Killer is a testament to the morbid anxiety of obsessive love. “Once in a blue moon I’ll have some sort of concept song or it will be about a bunch of different things, but yeah, it’s all from experiences,” she says. After a couple of years of writing and performing around LA – including one gig in a pizza parlour near her house, to which her family and friends would show up every week – Bridgers was at the cinema watching Whiplash, when Ryan Adams, who had heard of her through a mutual friend, texted to invite her to his studio. “We hung out all night and he was like: ‘Come back tomorrow at 4pm.’” She was sceptical that it would happen, but Adams was true to his word. “We get there the next day and Ryan’s there already. We recorded in half an hour, got food, then went to the record store.” The subsequent seven-inch was Killer, which came out on Adams’s label Pax Am in April 2015. At around the same time, Bridgers supported Conor Oberst at a secret show at LA’s Bootleg Theater. The two became email friends, sending each other new songs, and there was a further connection through Bright Eyes’ Mike Mogis, who mixed her debut album in Omaha. The two are now firm friends, and she’ll be on tour with him again this month when that debut album comes out on Dead Oceans. Stranger in the Alps shows off Bridgers’s talent for combining haunting melodies with oddly unsettling lyrical conceits; she is, she says, only getting more literal in her storytelling. “It’s getting like: ‘Oh my God, I’m just saying what’s happening.’” There’s some emo left in her yet, then? She smiles: “I mean, I’m still an angsty teenager.” Stranger in the Alps is out on 22 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cuba-havana-flooding-government-response","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"Cuba's crumbling infrastructure no match for might of Irma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cuba-havana-flooding-government-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cuba-havana-flooding-government-response","fields":{"headline":"Cuba's crumbling infrastructure no match for might of Irma","bodyText":"Havana was in midnight darkness and the floodwaters were neck high when Yanelis Rodríguez finally gave up hope that help was on its way. As giant waves crashed over the Malecón seawall just 200m away, Rodríguez and her two young children waded through Hurricane Irma’s storm surge to safety. “The winds started at four in the afternoon. We’d waited so long because we just assumed the government would come and help us,” she said. “We got out of the water and sheltered in a nearby building.” It was a harrowing night: in the early hours of the morning an iron girder crashed down on to the roof above them. Yanelis ran into the street, before changing her mind and going back inside: it was too dangerous to seek refuge elsewhere. Irma hit Cuba as a category 5 hurricane and barrelled through the central and western provinces, causing catastrophic destruction in a country that prides itself on disaster preparedness. At least 10 people died – Cuba’s worse hurricane death toll since Hurricane Dennis killed 16 in 2005. Seven of the fatalities were in Havana, whose decaying historic buildings were no match for the force of the storm. And as as uprooted trees were hauled away, and electricity returned to more neighbourhoods, many in the Cuban capital were asking whether authorities were ready for another storm. Two brothers, Roydis and Walfrido Valdés, died instantly in their central Havana apartment when a huge block of concrete fell from four storeys above them. The fire brigade arrived a few hours later to pull their bodies from the wreckage. But more than a dozen people remain living in the 100-year-old building. An elegant marble staircase with an ornate iron banister leads up to the first floor where the brothers died. Cracks between bricks in the wall are many inches wide. The floor is sunk and uneven. Like many of Havana’s once-elegant buildings, it is home to dozens of families but has received little maintenance over the years. “The government knows this building is liable to collapse,” said one neighbour, Lixa Peñalver, 47, adding that an elderly man fell to his death years ago when another part of the building caved through. “If you know that there’s a big risk, surely this should be one of the first buildings you evacuate. But nobody came.” María Estela Pedroso, who knew the brothers, said she had been trying to convince the authorities to relocate her for over a decade. “Nobody should be living where we are living,” she shouted furiously. “I go to all the Committee for the Defence of the Revolution meetings, all the assemblies, and I’ve always said they are not going to get us out of here until somebody dies.” Luís Dilu Galiente is the president of the building’s Committee for the Defence of the Revolution – neighbourhood bodies which provide basic social services, and also watch out for counter-revolutionary activities. He admitted that the block had not been evacuated, but pointed out that many locals had taken in neighbours seeking shelter – a standard element of Cuba’s emergency planning. A family of six has been staying in Galiente’s own two-bedroom apartment since before Irma struck. “The state didn’t send buses to evacuate the building like they have on other occasions. But anybody can find refuge if they want it – at least with their neighbours,” he said. Cuban media reported that tens of thousands of people were evacuated in Havana and over a million throughout the island. On Saturday, after the extent of the flooding became clear, dozens of buses were sent to evacuate people from central Havana, according to state media. Though television ran regular updates warning of flooding and advising people to take precautions in the run up to the hurricane, the forecasts did not place Havana in the main storm path. “Given that the country is so poor and the housing is so bad, you would think that there would be many more deaths,” said Elizabeth Newhouse, who has led delegations of emergency managers from New Orleans and the Gulf coast in the US to study Cuba’s response system. “This is really a small number given what it could be.” “They are very adept in disaster mitigation,” said Newhouse, director of the Cuba program at the Center for International Policy. “They have to be.” Three-quarters of the island’s workforce is still employed by the state, so although Cuba’s government is often slow, bureaucratic and profoundly inefficient, in times of crisis, it can marshal its human and material resources in a way that other islands in the Caribbean cannot. The week before the storm hit, the island’s pharmaceutical industry was instructed to put other medicines on hold so as to manufacture and distribute hydration salts. Tonnes of extra flour were distributed to state bakeries in the days before the hurricane struck. Authorities cut gas and electricity before storm hit, but bakers in Havana’s Vedado district worked through the night, using a petrol generator and sometimes even firewood to keep production going. With macabre comic timing, Donald Trump renewed the US embargo on Cuba for another year just hours before the Irma made landfall. While the island’s faltering economy goes some way to explaining the condition of housing stock the embargo makes matters worse. As city authorities go about patching up walls and constructing new homes, Cuba will have to pay over the odds for building materials. The country cannot buy from multinationals that trade with the US, so is forced to source items from further afield. With dozens of hotels smashed, millions still without power, and thousands of hectares of sugar cane destroyed, financing the reconstruction effort will be a challenge: the embargo also prevents Cuba from joining the IMF and the World Bank, as well as other regional lending institutions that grant infrastructure loans. Nobody that the Guardian spoke to in central Havana could point to a nearby shelter, but elsewhere in the city there were plenty to be found. The Belén Convent in old Havana is a care home for the elderly which has been transformed into a shelter for the hurricane. It is clean and calm. Fans whirl to keep the heat at bay. The bunks have clean sheets, and apart from mothers sleeping with new-borns, everyone has their own bed. The smell of fresh coffee wafts through the air as a nurse chats to a police officer as half a dozen evacuees sit back to watch a Bruce Lee movie. “When the rain started I came here with my daughter. We knocked on the door and they let us in,” said Carlotta Francisca Valdés, 79. “The food here is pretty good. I’ve been given things that I don’t have in my house at the moment: minced beef, for example.” Yorka Gutiérrez Pérez came here with her neighbours when the front of their building collapsed. She’s hoping to stay in the shelter until she’s given a new house, but given that hundreds of Cubans are in temporary housing following the last hurricane, it’s likely she’ll have a wait. “I’ve got faith in this government,” she said. “Until now, at least, the Revolution has never abandoned us”.

Just under 445,000 customers switched electricity supplier last month, compared with the 342,000 who moved in August 2016, taking the total number of customers switching so far in 2017 to almost 3.5 million, according to Energy UK, which represents suppliers. Britain’s biggest energy supplier, British Gas, is increasing its electricity prices by 12.5% in a move affecting 3.1 million customers from Friday. The increase means the company’s average annual dual-fuel bill will rise by 7.3%, or £76, to £1,120. The price comparison site uSwitch.com said: “The sheer number of people who switched in August is clear evidence that customers are not taking price hikes lying down.” However Energy UK said the figures suggested that “progress is being made” following concern in some quarters about the millions of people sitting on poor-value standard variable tariffs. Theresa May had pledged to impose a price cap to address the “injustice” of families collectively paying £1.4bn over the odds. There are now more than 50 energy companies vying for people’s custom and almost a quarter of all last month’s switches involved people moving to small and medium-sized suppliers from the larger players. According to uSwitch, at least 10% of people who switched energy supplier for both gas and electricity between June and November 2016 saved £618 or more. Campaigners have called on the government to do more. The prime minister had pledged a price cap on energy bills for 17m families during the general election campaign but the policy was missing from the Queen’s speech. At a private meeting in late August, the energy regulator Ofgem told the big six energy suppliers and dozens of challenger companies that it was planning a price cap for 2 million people. The cap would apply to vulnerable customers who are eligible for the warm home discount scheme. While full details are due to be outlined later this month, the cap is expected to be introduced in January, sooner than expected, so that hard-pressed consumers receive relief during the winter months. In the Commons on Tuesday the business secretary, Greg Clark, said he expected the energy regulator to “do [its] job and stand up for consumers” by curbing prices. MPs heard that Ofgem had yet formally to respond to the government’s letter, sent in June, which asked for details on how the regulator would act to protect customers on the poorest-value tariffs. Clark said he believed it would be “excessive” to compel Ofgem to implement an energy price cap, adding that “the ball is in their court”. Meanwhile one of the newest arrivals to the sector, Fischer Energy, claimed the government should open an inquiry into whether people on standard variable tariffs should receive refunds if they have been overpaying. • See if you can switch supplier and save money with the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/12/norfolk-school-drops-advice-to-offer-pupils-vomit-bucket-in-class","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T17:10:05Z","webTitle":"Norfolk school drops advice to offer pupils vomit bucket in class","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/12/norfolk-school-drops-advice-to-offer-pupils-vomit-bucket-in-class","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/12/norfolk-school-drops-advice-to-offer-pupils-vomit-bucket-in-class","fields":{"headline":"Norfolk school drops advice to offer pupils vomit bucket in class","bodyText":"A Norfolk school that advised teachers to provide buckets for pupils to vomit in during lessons has backtracked, telling parents that “genuinely unwell” children will receive proper treatment. The bucket guidance surfaced in a document given to teachers at the start of the year at Great Yarmouth Charter academy, after the struggling school was taken over by the Norwich-based Inspiration Trust. The Eastern Daily News reported that the document distributed by Barry Smith, the school’s new headteacher, listed a series of rules and practices that teachers and pupils were to follow – including the suggestion that pupils be offered a bucket if they said they felt ill in class. “We all know children say things like that to get out of work. You never pretend to be ill to get out of work because we expect you to work through it. If you feel sick we will give you a bucket. If you vomit – no problem! You’ve got your bucket. That’s probably all your body wanted – to vomit. If you are really ill we will make sure you get all the attention you need,” the document said. Inspiration Trust said the induction document was only meant to be circulated to staff internally, and the school issued a clarified behaviour guide for pupils and parents this week. Under “sickness and absence” the revised rules state: “Pupils may sometimes pretend to be ill to avoid classes they do not like, and teachers will make a judgment call as to whether a pupil is genuinely unwell. “Where a pupil is genuinely unwell the school will make arrangements for their care, and will contact parents if appropriate.” The revised rules also soften other punitive measures contained in the earlier document, including a threat to confiscate any mobile phones seen during school hours. They include advice to pupils to be in bed by 9.30pm on school nights, after they have checked the contents of their pencil cases “to make sure you have three black pens that work, two sharp pencils and a 30cm ruler. You don’t need anything else in your pencil case”. In a letter to parents this week, Smith described “a great deal of rumour and speculation on social media” over the new rules, and offered to hold a parents’ meeting at the school on Thursday. Formerly known as Great Yarmouth high school, the school was taken over and renamed by Inspiration Trust in August after several years of poor exam results and being rated as inadequate by Ofsted. Ofsted inspectors visiting the school found that many lessons were disrupted by misbehaviour. “Pupils told inspectors that all of their lessons in some subjects are disrupted by the behaviour of a small number of pupils. In lessons, inspectors observed pupils openly defying teachers, answering back, refusing to work and leaving classrooms when they chose to. Pupils told inspectors that this was typical,” the report stated. A follow up visit by inspectiors late last year found that “the school’s culture of behaviour and promotion of a safe environment for pupils remains inadequate”. Smith took over as headafter a spell as deputy head at Michaela community school in London, the free school founded by Katharine Birbalsingh that has become famous for its stringent discipline. Many of the rules he has imposed resemble those used at Michaela and other similar schools. Critics say they unfairly penalise pupils for minor deviations. Tom Bennett, an independent school behaviour adviser to the Department for Education, said pupil illness was one of the difficult issues faced by teachers. “It’s obvious to most teachers that many students exploit this excuse in order to duck out of lessons. On the other hand, no teacher should allow a genuinely sick student to suffer in their lesson,” he said. “Personally I would err on the side of kindness and trust.” Inspiration Trust said the initial response from parents and pupils to the new rules had been positive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/13/10-best-clubs-paris-chosen-by-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T05:30:03Z","webTitle":"10 of the best clubs in Paris – chosen by the experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/13/10-best-clubs-paris-chosen-by-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/13/10-best-clubs-paris-chosen-by-experts","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best clubs in Paris – chosen by the experts","bodyText":"Nuits Fauves Nuits Fauves opened in June 2016 beneath the Wanderlust as a “warehouse solution” for central Paris.

It has DJs from Wednesday to Saturday; it’s mainly locals but every now and again it gets a booking from out of town. Rap is the main genre but it also features funk and soul and also has some grime nights. Usually the DJ is set up by the bar but for weekends and busy nights the party is in the basement.

It’s small, about 500 capacity, and has a familial atmosphere. People go because they know who they want to see, and that’s urban and house music. For me, the atmosphere of the club reminds me of another great Paris venue: New Morning.

I do around four parties a year there myself, and it has residencies from the big Parisian DJs, such as Jennifer Cardini, Chloé and Ivan Smagghe.

It is known as a great restaurant that becomes an intimate funky cocktail/club at the weekend. Some call it the Parisian response to London’s Brilliant Corners. Edouard, who owns the place, is also part of the party-promoter crew J.A.W. Family, and thanks to his experience with them he’s able to host all the best record collectors around the world: Theo Parrish, Sadar Bahar, Floating Points, Mark Grusane, and Motor City Drum Ensemble have all come to spin for the lucky few in the know. The other secret ingredient that makes it so special is it also nurtures the local community of record diggers and lovers, inviting local acts to spin, such as Clémentine Superfriends, La Mamie’s collective, Around The World, DJ Waxist and Jim Irie. • 30 Rue Victor Massé, 75009, lentreedesartistespigalle.com Louise Chen, DJ and promoter, on Soundcloud La Station La Station is based in an old train station and is next to the Boulevard Périphérique, north of the Gare du Nord. I like that area; it’s pretty ghetto but authentic. La Station was created by Collectif MU as part of a wider project to transform urban spaces into artistic sites – and it also holds exhibitions, concerts and film screenings. There’s an indoor and an outdoor venue. The post-industrial feel and outdoor stage make it different from many other Paris venues. The music is very good, too: it goes from underground prog to experimental and techno. One of my favourite times was when I played on the little stage last summer. People were losing it, and the venue was so packed people were jumping over the walls from the outside to get in! • 29 Avenue de la Porte d’Aubervilliers, 75018, lastation.paris Quentin Vandewalle, co-founder Antinote records Les Instants Chavirés, Montreuil Since I moved to Paris in 2011, the nightlife has been growing. My favourite place is Les Instants Chavirés. It’s in Montreuil, in the east of the city, has been going for more than 20 years, and is run by the most passionate people. From the outside it looks like a small private house. Inside it can host around 150 people, with a small bar on the right side of the stage, serving French wine and Belgian beer. It has the best lineups in the city for left-field, electronic and avant-garde music and is very influential. The focus is on improvised music and experimentation: from established acts such as Nisennenmondaï and Stephen O’Malley to local noise scene acts such as Tanzprocesz and Quentin Rollet. Seeing Ghédalia Tazartès perform there, with his beautiful vocal skills, was an amazing experience. On a more personal level, our Editions Gravats showcases, which we hold there, are always special for me. Thanks to Les Instants for the opportunity to give exposure to artists such as Black Zone Myth Chant and Jamois/Rollet. • 7 Rue Richard Lenoir, 93100, instantschavires.com Low Jack, DJ, lowjack.eu"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/12/family-members-lincolnshire-jailed-chilling-slavery-case-rooney","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T16:28:53Z","webTitle":"11 family members in Lincolnshire jailed in 'chilling' slavery case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/family-members-lincolnshire-jailed-chilling-slavery-case-rooney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/family-members-lincolnshire-jailed-chilling-slavery-case-rooney","fields":{"headline":"11 family members in Lincolnshire jailed in 'chilling' slavery case","bodyText":"Eleven members of a Lincolnshire family have been jailed for violently exploiting at least 18 victims of modern slavery in offences described as “chilling in their mercilessness”. The Rooney family, who were based on Traveller sites in Lincoln, targeted homeless people and men with learning disabilities to work and live in squalid conditions for up to 26 years. The victims were kept in caravans without running water or toilet facilities, Nottingham crown court heard, while their captors wore Rolex watches, drove expensive cars and lived in gleaming homes that were “palatial in comparison” with their workers’ conditions. The judge, Timothy Spencer QC, said the difference in their lives was “akin to the gulf between medieval royalty and the peasantry” as he jailed 11 members of the family for up to 15 years on Tuesday. Martin Rooney Sr, 58, the head of the family, was jailed for 10 years and nine months, for orchestrating what the judge described as a “criminal culture” at Drinsey Nook, the Traveller site where they were based. His twin sons, John and Patrick Rooney, 32, were both sentenced to 15 years in prison. The judge said the pair were “clearly the most culpable” of those in the dock as their father was not leading the operation when police swooped. A further eight of their relatives were handed jail terms of up to seven years. A series of trials heard how the Rooneys targeted men who were homeless, alcoholic or with mental health problems, often picking them off the streets outside hostels or night shelters. Their victims, who were aged between 18 and 63, were lured with promises of work, money, shelter and food, the court heard. Once taken to Drinsey Nook, they were put up in “broken-down, ill-equipped and dirty” caravans without running water, heating or toilet facilities. Then they were put to work laying tarmacked drives, “dawn to dusk, seven days a week in all weather” and usually without a break, and only rarely were they provided food or drink, the judge said. “Sometimes payment was not monetary but by cheap cider which promoted a dependency upon alcohol, which provided another means of control over them,” Spencer added. Their victims lived in constant fear of violence, the court was told. One man, who was exploited by the family for at least 12 years, was brutally beaten by a “Rooney lynch mob” when a car he was driving ran out of petrol. By the time they were arrested, the family had plundered £36,000 worth of this man’s income support and disability living allowance. Spencer told the Rooneys: “Your victims had reached a position where they were cowed into submission. Any resistance, they knew, was futile. It would have been met by you recruiting other family members and delivering more violence. “You knew they would offer no resistance at all – nor did they. These offences are chilling in their mercilessness.” Detectives said the Rooneys were living a life of luxury in stark contrast to the squalor of their victims. They enjoyed holidays to Barbados, Australia, Egypt and Mexico and lived in “immaculate, gleaming homes” while Patrick and John Rooney were coached at Manchester United football school. “This was all funded on the back of the forced labour of your victims,” said the judge, “whilst your workers’ only solace was cheap cider and for some a packet of tobacco, consumed in squalid surroundings.” Ch Supt Chris Davison, head of crime at Lincolnshire police, said: “We will not rest on this result as there are potentially other victims of modern slavery in our county. We are exploring five active investigations and we will continue to put any victims at the very heart of our investigations. “The severity of these crimes is underlined by the sentences imposed by the judge. The victims will never get the years back that were taken away from them but I hope this provides them with some comfort that justice has been served and demonstrates that we will do everything in our power to try and stop others suffering in the ways that they did.” The National Crime Agency disclosed last month that there were possibly tens of thousands of modern slavery victims in the UK, far more than law enforcement previously thought. Simon York, the director of HMRC’s fraud investigation unit, said: “This was a truly appalling case. These people lived a life of luxury by exploiting and abusing highly vulnerable individuals. They stripped them of their humanity, forcing them to live and work in terrible conditions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/12/italy-naples-boy-parents-die-fall-volcanic-crater-solfatara-di-pozzuoli","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T15:03:41Z","webTitle":"Boy, 11, and parents die after falling into volcanic crater near Naples","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/12/italy-naples-boy-parents-die-fall-volcanic-crater-solfatara-di-pozzuoli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/12/italy-naples-boy-parents-die-fall-volcanic-crater-solfatara-di-pozzuoli","fields":{"headline":"Boy, 11, and parents die after falling into volcanic crater near Naples","bodyText":"An 11-year-old boy and his parents have died after falling into a volcanic crater near Naples. Italian press reports said the boy walked into a prohibited area at Solfatara di Pozzuoli, one of 40 volcanoes in the Campi Flegrei area west of Naples. He is believed to have fainted due to gas fumes before falling into the crater. The boy’s parents tried to save him, but the crater collapsed. Their other child, aged seven, survived because he had left the scene in search of help. The incident took place at about 11am on Tuesday. The family, originally from Turin but living near Venice, were on a visit to the tourist site. Their bodies were recovered from the three-metre (10ft) crater by firefighters. “Either there was a small explosion, or the ground simply gave way from their weight, and they fell into this hole,” national fire brigade spokesman Luca Cari said. Firefighters said they appeared to have died from asphyxia, possibly because of hot gases emanating from the ground. The younger boy ran into a bar at the entrance of the crater, where he was comforted by staff for several hours. Armando Guerriero, the bar’s owner, said: “He saw his parents and brother falling into the crater. “He didn’t know whether they were alive or dead. He was crying and calling his mother’s name. In the 40 years that I’ve worked here, I’ve never seen anything like it.” The dormant Solfatara, which last erupted in 1198, has a shallow crater and emits steam with sulphurous fumes. It is located in the Campi Flegrei, a sprawling constellation of ancient volcanic craters scorching hot just below the surface. The volcano is managed by a private company and open all year round to visitors, who can go on a guided tour or explore it by themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/12/trump-mexico-border-wall-daca-legislation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T16:08:25Z","webTitle":"Trump adviser suggests Mexico wall funding won't be linked to Daca legislation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/12/trump-mexico-border-wall-daca-legislation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/12/trump-mexico-border-wall-daca-legislation","fields":{"headline":"Trump adviser suggests Mexico wall funding won't be linked to Daca legislation","bodyText":"Donald Trump will not demand that funding for his border wall with Mexico be linked to legislation giving legal status to so-called Dreamers, a top White House aide said on Tuesday. Marc Short, director of legislative affairs, told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor event: “The president is committed to sticking by his commitment that a physical structure [on the US-Mexico border] is needed to protect the American people.” But, he added, referring to the Deferred Status for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program cancelled by Trump last week: “Whether that is part of a Daca package or another, I’m not going to prejudge which package.” There had been speculation that Trump would use Democrats’ wish to see Daca reinstated as leverage to ensure construction on a border wall, his signature campaign promise which remains far from becoming reality. Democrats have long insisted they would not vote for any government funding bill that includes funding for the controversial border barrier. Daca, which the administration cancelled this month, was the result of an executive order by Barack Obama that protected roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation. It is now set to expire in early March. Short also ducked a question on whether Trump would support a bill granting Daca recipients a path to citizenship. “I am not going to state on that,” he said. Trump has long campaigned against “amnesty” and path to legal status for those who illegally immigrated to the US. Short also said that the White House did not believe additional congressional action was needed to justify military action in the Middle East and Central Asia. “The president believes current authorization for use of force is sufficient right now and is not intending to change it,” he said. US deployment of military forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria remains tied to congressional authorization of use of military force first passed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11. He also said that he disagreed with the former White House aide Steve Bannon’s statement that congressional Republican leadership was trying to undermine Trump’s agenda. “I disagree with Steve,” said Short."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/live/2017/sep/12/apple-event-iphone-x-iphone-8-plus-apple-watch-news-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T10:24:18Z","webTitle":"Apple event: iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus release dates revealed – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2017/sep/12/apple-event-iphone-x-iphone-8-plus-apple-watch-news-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/live/2017/sep/12/apple-event-iphone-x-iphone-8-plus-apple-watch-news-live","fields":{"headline":"Apple event: iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus release dates revealed – as it happened","bodyText":"So, from top to bottom: The Apple Watch Series 3 ships on 22 September. $329/£329 without cellular connection, and $£399 with. The Apple TV 4k ships on 22 September, at $£179. The iPhone 8 starts at $£699 for 64GB and the iPhone 8 plus $£799, shipping on 22 September. And the iPhone X (that’s “iPhone Ten”, if you want to be one of those people who calls a gif a jif) starts at $£999 for a 64GB model, rising to an astonishing $£1,149 for the 256GB version, and will be available for pre-order from 27 October, shipping on 3 November. And that’s it. No musical guest, just a quote from Steve Jobs to play us out. Welcome to the future; hope it’s slightly less dystopian than some of Apple’s marketing material made it look. The phone will start shipping 3 November for $999 for the 64GB, and it can be pre-ordered on 27 October. The iPhone SE also has a price cut to $349, iPhone 6S to $449, and iPhone 7 to $549. A small update on wireless charging: it’s also supported by the Apple Watch series 3 and the new Airpods. And if you have an Apple-designed power mat, you can charge them all at the same time. Apple’s calling it AirPower, and it looks like it might become a future standard – but for now it’s unique to Apple. Not out until next year, though. The iPhone X has good cameras. Both 12MP like on the 8 Plus, but a faster telephoto lens, which also gains optical image stabilisation. The flash is also improved, but some things you can never really fix, and one of those is a camera flash placed right next to the lens. Just find better lighting, people. The front-facing camera now supports a bunch of the twin-camera features, like portrait mode, that were previously only possible on the 7 plus, and it’s going to mean you can shoot some really attractive selfies. MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL: The iPhone X has a quoted two hours extra battery life than the iPhone 7. Oh dear, Face ID fails first try in Craig Federighi’s demo. That … doesn’t bode well. Still, the rest of the demo looks impressive enough, and it is a very pretty full-screen phone. Snapchat is also supporting the FaceID tech, with two special snapchat lenses, and oh God, Craig Federighi is demonstrating the animoji again, these things unsettle me on a primal level. Phil Schiller returns. It looks like we knew it would look like: a huge screen taking up the whole front with a, er, 5.8 inch OLED “super retina display”; a glass back; a dual camera; and a small bump cutting in to the top of the screen. With no home button, the display is enabled simply by tapping on the screen, you get back to the home screen by swiping up from the bottom, and you get to multi-tasking by swiping up and pausing. The side-button is now dedicated to Siri. What about TouchID? It’s been replaced with “Face ID”. It’s “the future of how we unlock our smartphones”, Schiller says – and it’s based on the front cameras, which are more than just a camera. Seven separate sensors are packed into that little band at the top, and it’s how the company hopes to overcome flaws with previous face unlock systems. It also works at night. Schiller also reveals what the “bionic” label is on the A11: it’s the neural engine, a subset of the chip dedicated to neural network processing, and that’s how Face ID works. The company even trained its system on professionally made masks, to make sure that it only works on real faces. More importantly, Schiller says it “requires user attention”, such as looking at the camera, to unlock – so hopefully a pickpocket won’t be able to wave your phone in front of your face then dash off. “The chance that a random person in the population could unlock your iPhone X and unlock it with their face is one in a million”, Schiller says, comparing it to one in 50,000 for TouchID. But unlike TouchID, it can get confused more easily if someone looks similar to you. If you have an evil twin, “set a passcode”, he says. It works with everything else TouchID does, including Apple Pay. The neural engine has one other use: terrifying animated emoji. I never want to receive one. Wow. I’m shaken. Craig Federighi comes onstage to demo the phone. Tim pulls the “one more thing” card. This isn’t as much of a surprise as the iPod was, but it’s going to be quite big. Cook says it’ll “set the path of technology for the next decade”. We’ll see. It’s called the iPhone X. And it’s pronounced iPhone 10. Phil Schiller returns for the big one ... Schiller’s not done yet, and he returns to announce the biggest change coming to the iPhone 8: wireless charging. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will now support the Qi wireless charging standard – that’s the one which is built into a lot of Ikea furniture. You’ll soon be able to charge your phone by just leaving it on your bedside table. Hooray! The iPhone 8 will start at 64GB, from $699, and the 8 Plus will start at $799. Pre-orders from 15 September, available from 22 September, and iOS 11 will be released on 19 September. Back to Tim. Phil Schiller comes up to talk, but don’t get too excited: it’s the iPhone 8. It looks a lot like the iPhone 7, but it’s now all-glass, and it comes in three colours (silver, grey and rose gold). There are some new features in this phone, including the True Tone tech carried over from the iPad (it adjusts for the temperature of the light), louder stereo speakers and a new “A11 bionic” chip, but you can tell we’re all rushing through to get to the good stuff. Still, we should make the most of it while we’re here. Apple’s also showing off its first ever fully in-house GPU (after it broke with Britain’s Imagination Technologies), and a new image signal processor – the brains behind the camera – with noise reduction and faster low-light autofocus. The camera itself gets a new sensor and new colour filter on the normal 8, while the 8 Plus gets two new sensors for its two new cameras, and the telephoto lens gets better in low light. But it’s the software where the cameras are getting impressive changes: the 8 Plus can now use the two cameras to build a depth map of a portrait photo, and artificially alter the lighting of the images. Schiller also calls the iPhone the first phone “designed for augmented reality” (that doesn’t sound true, given Google’s Project Tango was explicitly just that, but hey), and shows some AR apps, like a Warhammer game and a baseball analytics app. Games developer Alti Mar, from Directive Games, arrives to show a multiplayer AR tower defence game. It looks like quite an annoying way of playing a game, but maybe I’m just lazy. Cook returns for another segue, and it’s the big one: the iPhone. But first, navel-gazing. Cook rattles off highlights: The first iPhone; the App Store; the Retina display; Facetime and iMessage; Siri; TouchID and Apple Pay; and cameras. “Now, we can create devices that are far more intelligent, far more capable, far more personal than ever before. We have huge iPhone news for you today,” Cook says. And the advert for the new iPhone rolls. The new Apple TV finally brings HDR and 4K technology to Apple’s set-top box, allowing owners to view content in the best picture quality possible (until the next must-have new feature). For context, Amazon’s competing hardware has supported 4K for two years. Still, the new Apple TV is twice as fast in the CPU and four times as fast in the GPU, Cue says. More importantly, Apple’s secured 4K content for iTunes – and the company won its fight with Hollywood to not raise the price in the move from HD. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video will also support the platform. The Apple TV app – that’s an app that runs on the Apple TV, so it’s technically the Apple TV Apple TV app – is also coming to other countries than just the US, including the UK, and it’s getting support for live sporting fixtures and live news. The Apple TV app also runs on the iPad and iPhone, so all of this affects them too. Games developer Jenova Chen of thatgamecompany arrives on stage to show off its new game, Sky – which looks like a spiritual sequel to its 2012 indie hit Journey, a PlayStation 3 exclusive. Sky is an Apple exclusive, on TV, iPad and iPhone. The new Apple TV starts at $179, and will ship on 22 September. “This is a big moment for Apple Watch and we think you are going to love it,” Cook says. Next up is the forgotten sibling of the family: the Apple TV. It won two Emmys, apparently! Not for any of their original content, though. Cook invites Eddy Cue to the stage to talk about the next Apple TV. As expected, the new Apple Watch has a built-in mobile connection. “Now you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected,” Jeff says. “The number is the same number as your iPhone,” he notes. Bizarrely, the feature is introduced with a video of a phone call coming through while someone is swimming lanes, which seems … not particularly useful. More useful is the introduction of streaming audio to the watch. If you’ve got an Apple Watch series 3 and Apple Music, you can stream music over that built-in cellular connection. Elsewhere, the watch’s faster processor now lets Siri to talk back, and a new wifi chip reduces power drain by 85%. Despite all that, it’s still the same size as the Series 2 Watch, Jeff says, before adding that it’s not actually the same size as the Series 2 Watch and is actually 0.25mm thicker because the glass bump on the back bulges a bit more. Then Jeff calls a woman on a paddleboard in the middle of a lake, because he can. “I’m going to go rogue for a minute,” Jeff says – Jeff has gone mad with power – before he notes that Deidre on the paddleboard doesn’t have any special mics, just the watch. The watch has some new bands – some pretty, some not – and the super-expensive ceramic version now comes in grey as well as white. Jeff concludes with prices and dates: $329 without cellular, $399 with cellular, and series 1 drops down to $249. The cellular version will be exclusive to EE in the UK, and orders begin on 15 September, shipping on the on 22nd. Back to Tim. Jeff talks about some of the changes coming to the next version of watchOS, first: fitness challenges, new workouts including HIIT and lane swimming, and improved metrics for the built-in heart-rate monitor. The company is also pushing more directly into healthcare: the watch will now notify you directly if your heartrate spikes and you don’t appear to be active, or if it detects an arrhythmia. WatchOS 4 is out 19 September, Jeff says. We open, as ever, with a look back: last quarter, Apple Watch sales grew 50% year on year, Cook says. That’s impressive, but we don’t know what the base was, so it doesn’t tell us that much; what says more is that the Apple Watch is apparently the number one watch in the world, leapfrogging Rolex for the top slot. Following a short video of Apple Watch owners reading out their own fanmail about the devices, Cook invites Jeff onstage to talk about what’s coming next. Who is Jeff? We do not know. He is simply introduced as “Jeff”. Oops: I called them Apple stores, but Ahrendts corrects me. Apparently the company thinks of them as “Apple Town Squares”. Ahrendts details some of the recent changes to the company’s bigger sto Town Squares, including “Avenues”, “Plazas” and meeting spaces. (In the UK, the company’s Regent’s Street store in London is one of these flagship locations). The pitch, in a nutshell: Apple is trying to build a sense of community rooted around these shops, which are already among the most profitable venues on the high street measured by take per square foot. The company wants people to come to hang out, learn how to use their tech, and even receive inspiration from a new group of creative specialists. “The feedback has been fantastic,” Ahrendts says – before previewing changes to the company’s New York flagship store on Fifth Avenue, and future openings in Paris, Milan, Washington DC, and Chicago. But next up is the start what we really came for: Tim Cook returns to introduce the changes to the Apple Watch. Cook notes that Apple is helping relief efforts from hurricanes Irma and Harvey, and says the company is also sending prayers, before moving on to another spiel about Apple Park: “It connects extraordinarily advanced buildings with open parkland … designed to be seamless with nature. It’s open, transparent, and brings everyone in.” (For some engineers, that has been a less than positive change: employees used to having privacy are reportedly viewing the move to an open-plan office with dread.) The products will come soon, but first Angela Ahrendts, the head of Apple Retail, is introduced on stage to talk about how the company’s stores are going. A short video showcasing the Steve Jobs Theater and assorted press and staff arriving (soundtracked by All You Need Is Love), and an audio clip of Jobs talking about the importance of building things with “care and love”, opens the show. Apple CEO Tim Cook arrives on stage, and begins the event with a tribute to Apple’s co-founder and former CEO, who died six years ago next month: “I love hearing his voice … and it was only fitting that Steve should open his theatre. “It’s taken some time, but we can now reflect on him with joy, rather than sadness,” a visibly emotional Cook says, as he pays tribute to Jobs’s vision in creating the new venue for this event: Apple Park, the company’s new head office. “Today, and always, we honour him.” There are not that many surprises today, but there’s still a few things we’re going to be keeping a keen eye out for: Pricing: we don’t know how much anything will cost, and we certainly don’t know how much it’ll cost in the UK. The latter we won’t find out til after the whole thing is over, but we’ll get US figures dropped throughout the show. The iPhone 8: the overshadowed little sibling, we know almost nothing about the iPhone 8. It looks likely to be a minor iteration on the iPhone 7, but what those changes will be is anyone’s guess. Wireless charging: this feature has been rumoured for years, but there’s more evidence than ever to suggest that the company has finally decided that inductive charging is the future. X or 10?: how do we even say “iPhone X” anyway? This event is characterised, more than any before it, by a near-total absence of mystery, thanks to an Apple leak of the final version of iOS 11 to a couple of outlets. That software, likely to hit iPhones and iPads in the next couple of days, revealed that we’ve likely got at least five new pieces of hardware being announced over the next couple of hours: The iPhone X: a new ultra-high-end addition to the product line, with a full-face OLED screen and a price-tag to match. The iPhone 8: the update to last year’s iPhone 7, with few major changes expected beyond a simple speed bump. The Apple Watch Series 3: a new version of the company’s smartwatch, featuring little visible difference but an in-built 4G connection. New AirPods: a minor revision to Apple’s best-selling completely wireless Bluetooth earbuds. The fifth generation Apple TV: which will include 4K support for people with UHD TVs. On top of those we also know that four new software updates will hit devices over the coming weeks. Most of the details will have been already revealed at the company’s software conference, WWDC, and in public betas, but a few surprises are sometimes kept in store: iOS 11: the next version of the software used on iPhones and iPads. This update focuses on multitasking improvements for the the iPad. macOS High Sierra: an update largely focused on under-the-hood changes to the operating system that runs on the company’s Macs. watchOS 4: the Apple Watch’s operating system, improves the workout features and introduces a new Siri watch face. tvOS 11: another minor update, which adding a dark mode and Home screen sync between Apple TV devices. And finally, we may see release dates or prices for a few things we already know are coming, including the HomePod smart speaker and the iMac Pro. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live blog of today’s Apple press event. It’s a big day for the company, which is expected to reveal the first significant shake-up to the design of the iPhone, its biggest-selling product by a massive margin, since 2014. It’s also the first event to be held in the Steve Jobs Theater, outside the company’s new enormous purpose-built headquarters, Apple Park, in the Silicon Valley town of Cupertino. The assembled press have been sending excited pictures of curved glass, shiny marble, and Apple staff in pristine white t-shirts, but we’re watching the sunset from King’s Cross in London, so don’t feel too jealous of us. The main event starts at 10am in San Francisco (or 6pm in the UK), and if you’re planning on sticking around, I’d stock up on nibbles and drinks: it looks like it’s going to be a long one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/15/center-of-my-world-review-gay-coming-of-age-andreas-steinhofel","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Center of My World review – sensitive gay coming-of-age story strikes a chord","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/15/center-of-my-world-review-gay-coming-of-age-andreas-steinhofel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/15/center-of-my-world-review-gay-coming-of-age-andreas-steinhofel","fields":{"headline":"Center of My World review – sensitive gay coming-of-age story strikes a chord","bodyText":"This delicate German coming-of-ager – adapted by director Jakob Erwa from an Andreas Steinhöfel novel – wobbles between genuinely cute and aggravatingly twee before finding its feet alongside its protagonist. Sensitive late-teen Phil (Louis Hofmann) returns from camp one summer to find the small town he’d thought a paradise irrevocably altered: a storm has rearranged his usual reference points, distancing beloved sister Dianne (Ada Philine Stappenbeck) and leaving free-spirit mother Glass (Sabine Timoteo) even more emotionally fragile than when he left. There is one ray of light in sporty new kid Nicholas (Jannik Schümann), enthusiastically leading our boy into the locker-room showers, but we’re set to wondering whether Phil’s tangled history will darken even this glimmer of promise. Flashbacks to Phil and Dianne’s days as Teutonically blond toddlers are proofs of baggage but feel unnecessary, and Erwa is prone to occasional visual cliches, like the overhead shot of semi-clad bodies atop a jetty that seems to recur in every Mitteleuropean drama about first fumbling love. Yet he establishes an intriguing, complicated and capably performed relationship between a mother who’s known only hurt from the opposite sex and a son palpably longing for male affection and affirmation. A vaguely educative, afterschool-special vibe may mean the 15 certificate reflects its optimal viewer age – it’s partly couched as a primer in handling heartbreak – but Erwa’s emotional candour ensures his film will strike resonant chords with anybody who spent their formative years extricating themselves from strangulating family ties."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/12/late-night-tv-hosts-steve-bannon-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T15:15:11Z","webTitle":"Late-night TV on Steve Bannon, 'ex-chief strategist and human sloppy joe'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/12/late-night-tv-hosts-steve-bannon-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/12/late-night-tv-hosts-steve-bannon-trump","fields":{"headline":"Late-night TV on Steve Bannon, 'ex-chief strategist and human sloppy joe'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Monday addressed the administration’s response to Hurricane Irma, the media’s response to Trump’s deal with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling, and Steve Bannon’s appearance on 60 Minutes with Charlie Rose. Seth Meyers began: “As his administration deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, President Trump is also dealing with a brewing storm within his own party over his decision to strike a funding deal with Democrats, prompting an absurd new round of punditry over whether Donald Trump is actually a Republican. “For one thing, there were the heroic acts of first responders rescuing people in the storm,” he continued. “Now, you’d think applauding the bravery of emergency responders like the coastguard would be one of the easiest things a president could do, but even that, it seems, was too much to ask of Donald Trump, who praised the coastguard yesterday by saying this.” Meyers then aired footage of Trump lauding its quick response, adding: “If you talk about branding, no brand has improved more than the US Coast Guard.” “Branding? What are you talking about?,” Meyers asked. “The coastguard doesn’t need to improve their brand. They’re not Arby’s.” “Yesterday, in the midst of the storm, president Trump’s director of social media, Dan Scavino, who has repeatedly attacked reporters and accused them of spreading fake news, tweeted a video of what he said was flooding in Miami international airport,” the host continued. “Now, it was an intense scene, so the tweet had a lot of replies, including this one from Miami international airport, that said ‘This video is not from Miami international airport’.” “You know you’re bad at your job when even airports are correcting you,” Meyers quipped, before moving onto the response from Republicans and journalists to Trump’s spending deal with the Democrats. “Trump stunned Republicans last week by cutting a deal with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to lift the debt limit and keep the government funded for three months,” he explained. “Just to give you an idea of how unhappy Republicans were with the president’s sudden friendship with the Democrats, look at Mitch McConnell’s face during their meeting with Trump in the oval office last week.” Meyers showed a clip of McConnell in the meeting: “He looks like he just saw a fellow ghost,” Meyers added. “Trump’s hostility to to certain Republicans in Congress, like senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, have GOP leaders worried ahead of next year’s midterms,” he said. “Trump got one deal with Democrats to keep the government open to avoid financial chaos, and now all of a sudden there is a rush of praise from the media crowning him as America’s first independent president.” Meyers then showed a slew of headlines, from publications such as the Associated Press, New York Times, and the Washington Post, that wondered whether the deal represented a new, centrist Trump. “Can we just stop with this absurd taking point?,” Meyers said. “Donald Trump is not an independent. The only thing he is independent of is reality.” Trevor Noah of Comedy Central also weighed in on the weekend’s news, including Steve Bannon’s interview with Charlie Rose. “It’s been almost a month since president Trump fired Steve Bannon, his chief strategist and human sloppy joe,” Noah began. “Now, during his time with Trump, Bannon operated from the shadows, but last night he braved the lights of 60 Minutes to give his first major TV interview.” Noah then showed intermittent clips from the interview, including Bannon’s speculation about Republicans trying to “nullify the election results,” “illegal aliens filling churches,” and whether or not the Washington Monument would be the next statue removed by leftwing activists. “Wow, it’s like Donald Trump took a dump while he was tweeting and then wished for that dump to be a real boy,” Noah joked. “I will name it Steve.” Noah continued: “Bannon’s interview wasn’t particularly eye-opening. Mostly, he just willingly confirmed that he is who we thought he was: a radical nationalist who believes that Donald Trump will be instrumental in tearing down the establishment. But one moment really showed how all-in he is on Trump.” Noah then showed the portion of Bannon’s interview about the infamous Access Hollywood tape showing Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. Bannon said the fiasco was a “litmus test” for who would stick by then-candidate Trump, adding that Chris Christie was not made part of the White House team because of his comments that weekend condemning Trump’s language. “Man, that’s loyalty,” Noah said. “Even after Trump fired Bannon, he’s still going to fight for him from outside the White House. If Donald Trump ever killed someone, Bannon will be the guy driving the white supremacist Bronco.” “I don’t know if you noticed this, but Bannon has a very interesting way of rebranding the infamous Donald Trump pussy-grabbing scandal,” Noah said, showing clips from the interview in which Bannon refers to the October incident as “Billy Bush Saturday” and “Billy Bush weekend.” “Billy Bush weekend?” Noah responded. “Poor Billy Bush. Somewhere he must have bene watching that, like, ‘come on man, I was just on the bus. You can’t name something after someone who happened to be there. That’s like rebranding the JFK assassination ‘Motorcade Driver’s Bad Day’”. “Now if there’s one issue Bannon is known for as well, it’s his opposition to immigration,” Noah said, showing a clip of Bannon, in response to a question about Trump’s controversial decision to end Daca, reiterating his stance on immigration and saying America is founded on her citizens. “And on that front, he did not budge an inch.” “I don’t even know why he’s fighting about this,” Noah said. “We all know America is a nation of immigrants.” The Daily Show, in fact, went into the archives to discover that Lawrence Bannon, the great-great-grandfather of the former White House adviser, immigrated to the country in the 1850s from Ireland. “So, in many way’s, Steve Bannon’s great grandfather was a Dreamer,” Noah concluded. “And his great-grandson is a fucking nightmare.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/12/iphone-x-release-date-apple-home-button-screen","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:57:46Z","webTitle":"iPhone X: new Apple smartphone dumps home button for all-screen design","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/12/iphone-x-release-date-apple-home-button-screen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/12/iphone-x-release-date-apple-home-button-screen","fields":{"headline":"iPhone X: new Apple smartphone dumps home button for all-screen design","bodyText":"Apple has unveiled the iPhone X, its new radically redesigned smartphone that drops the traditional home button for an all-screen design, as well as new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models. Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, took to the stage of the company’s new Steve Jobs Theater situated within the brand new Apple Park “spaceship” headquarters to unveil the new iPhones. The new $999 (£999 – there is dollar-to-pound parity on the new range of Apple products) iPhone X will come with the company’s new iOS 11 software featuring new on-screen buttons and gestures to replace the standard physical home button, which has been a mainstay of iPhones since the line’s launch in 2007, plus new animated emoji called Animoji. The iPhone X, pronounced 10, will come in two colours, space grey and silver, and is available for pre-order on 27 October, and shipping by 3 November. A 256GB storage option will also be available for £1,149. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said: “This is the iPhone X. It’s the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.” Instead of pressing a button, users swipe up from the bottom to get to the home screen and swipe and hold to go into multitasking. To wake the device users just tap the screen or lift the iPhone, while the control centre is now accessed by swiping down from top right corner of the phone. The front of the device features a cutout at the top of the new OLED Super Retina display housing a new True Depth camera system for the Face ID facial recognition system and for taking selfies with Apple’s Portrait Mode. Apple says Face ID is capable of identifying the phone’s owner from a 3D scan of the face in order to unlock the device, authenticate payments and input saved passwords into login screens as well as integrate into third-party apps. Similar systems have been used by Microsoft for its Windows Hello-capable Surface computer line, but no one has yet cracked the technology on a smartphone. Apple said the system was capable of operating even when the user was wearing glasses, and only unlocks the phone when the user is actively looking at it. The iPhone X does not include Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner, which was introduced in 2013 under the home button with the iPhone 5S. But Apple said that its Face ID was more secure than Touch ID by a factor of 20, capable of discerning between the user’s real face and photographs – and even Hollywood-level replica masks – using the True Depth camera system, which projects an IR dot map on to the face to map it. It even works in the dark. The rest of the device is made from stainless steel and glass, harking back to the design of the iPhone 4, and mirroring that of rival Samsung’s Galaxy S8 but without a curved screen. It marks a striking contrast to recent all-metal iPhone models, and remains to be seen whether it suffers from a similar level of fragility as rival glass-and-metal sandwich smartphones. Apple said the glass was the most durable ever fitted to a smartphone with metal reinforcement. The headphone jack is still gone too. The iPhone X will have Apple’s latest processor, the A11 Bionic that comes with an integrated Neural Engine for face recognition and now has six cores, up from last year’s A10 with four cores. Apple said that the A11 had 30% faster graphics and was an up to 70% faster processor than the A10, while extending battery life by two hours over the iPhone 7 – a pain point for the majority of current iPhone users. Apple also introduced Qi wireless charging to the iPhone line for the first time, which uses a a plate within the back of the phone to accept an inductive charge from a pad or a piece of furniture with wireless charging built in. It’s a feature that’s been standard in Samsung’s Galaxy S line of smartphones for the last three years and available with several other rivals, and removes the need to fiddle with a power cable to charge your smartphone. The back of the iPhone X has Apple’s now familiar dual camera system, which debuted on 2016’s iPhone 7 Plus with one wide-angle camera and one “telephoto” camera capable of giving the phone a two-times optical zoom, but oriented vertically rather than horizontally. Both cameras have new 12-megapixel sensors, optical image stabilisation and Apple said that it had improved its computational photography system to produce better, more detailed images. Part of the improved system is a new version of the company’s Portrait Mode, which allows users to artificially blur the background to create a shallow depth of field, similar to that created by dSLR cameras, and change the lighting effects across the subject’s face. Rivals Samsung and others have also shipped similar features, with inherent flaws around fine detail such as hair. It remains to be seen whether Apple’s system can fix those problems. Apple also unveiled new animated emoji characters it calls “animoji”, which allow users to map facial expressions on to little characters, such as a robot, fox, unicorn, or anthropomorphised poo using the iPhone X’s facial recognition system. The animoji can only be sent to other Apple users through the company’s Messages app. Ben Wood, chief of research for CCS Insight said: “The iPhone X is the blueprint for the iPhone’s new hardware direction. An OLED display and the new design is likely to [be] standard on future iPhone models, but Apple must first tackle the challenge of obtaining sufficient supply. “A staggered introduction of OLED technology and the new design enables Apple to steadily ramp up scale in its supply chain and maximise profits. The relatively high prices of the iPhone X are a necessary and important mechanism to control demand in the near term.” iPhone 8 Alongside the iPhone X, Apple also unveiled two other new smartphones, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which are essentially updated versions of 2016’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which were themselves updates of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S lines from 2014 and 2015 respectively. On the outside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus has glass on the front and back, with a colour-matched aluminium band around the outside. Apple said that the glass on the back was the “most durable glass on any smartphone”, attempting to assuage fears that the new iPhone would be less durable than the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus both have Apple’s new A11 Bionic chip, but without the Neural Engine of that fitted to the iPhone X, and come with improved screens with the company’s True Tone feature and improved speakers while keeping its current form with a home button with Touch ID 2 fingerprint scanner. But they lack facial recognition and an all-screen design of the iPhone X. Schiller said: “This is the first iPhone created for AR. The cameras are individually calibrated in the factory which makes a huge difference for AR, plus AR benefits from the new A11 Bionic chip.” Apple also added wireless Qi charging like the iPhone X and the latest Bluetooth 5.0 standard, which is expected to become widely used in the next year for headphones and other peripherals. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will come in three colours and start at $699/£699 and $799/£799 respectively with 64GB of storage, available for pre-order from 15 September and shipping by 22 September. A 256GB storage option will also available. Wood said: “The iPhone X and iPhone 8 models are very strong additions to Apple’s portfolio that address increasing competition from Samsung and others. Rivals will be watching how quickly Apple can meet demand for the iPhone X and begin to build margins on a new design with new components.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/12/real-face-mummified-warrior-revealed-british-museum-scythians","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T15:48:14Z","webTitle":"Real face of mummified warrior revealed at British Museum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/12/real-face-mummified-warrior-revealed-british-museum-scythians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/12/real-face-mummified-warrior-revealed-british-museum-scythians","fields":{"headline":"Real face of mummified warrior revealed at British Museum","bodyText":"The real face concealed by a clay mask on the mummified head of a Scythian warrior has been revealed for the first time in almost 2,000 years. The head is on display in an exhibition opening at the British Museum this week along with the scan, made in a St Petersburg hospital, which reveals that he had fine teeth, a ginger moustache, a pierced ear, a hole in his skull where his brains had been removed, and a savage wound, beautifully stitched and healed, which originally ran from the corner of his eye socket to the point of his jaw. Since the real head closely resembles the painted mask, the curator St John Simpson assumes that the faintly smiling mask of a young woman beside him, which has yet to be scanned, is also based on her appearance in life. Her body was found lying beside his in a timber-lined tomb chamber, and she almost certainly did not die a natural death. The Greek historian Herodotus left vivid accounts of the nomadic Scythian horsemen and archers who terrorised their neighbours from an empire stretching for centuries from the Black Sea to the borders of China. His stories, often doubted, have been vindicated by recent archaeological finds, and he wrote that when a princely warrior died, a concubine was often chosen to accompany him to the grave, along with servants and horses. “Herodotus says garrotting was used, so that would have been relatively quick and merciful,” Simpson said. “The horses we find in tombs were usually killed by a single blow between the eyes from a pointed battle axe – quite humane, like a captive bolt for a fallen race horse – so that could be another consideration.” He added hopefully: “We do also have to remember that people really do die of a broken heart.” The scans were completed and processed so recently that they were seen for the first time in London by the Russian curators who accompanied the spectacular loans from the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg, including some of the first superb golden belt buckles and dress ornaments collected in the 17th century by Peter the Great. The exhibition, Scythians: Warriors of Ancient Siberia, also has loans from the new National Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and the Ashmolean and the Royal Collection in the UK. The nomads had no writing and built nothing permanent except their tombs, but fortunately buried everything from their world for the dead to use in the next. The displays include not just the superb golden ornaments and metal work including weapons and utensils, but, astonishingly preserved by the permafrost of Siberia, furs, textiles, wooden furniture and containers, tattooed human skin, horse harnesses and saddles, the oldest pair of chopsticks ever found outside China, and two lumps of cheese. Their luxury imports from China included beautiful silks so precious that even scraps were carefully kept and re-used, including a piece used to trim a child’s quiver of arrows, found with the masked mummies in the Oklakhty burial ground in southern Siberia. There was also a tiny sheepskin coat, on which the man’s head was pillowed. The same tomb held two even more eerie objects, which Simpson hoped to borrow for the exhibition: literally straw men, two life-size stuffed effigies, with clay masks similar to those on the real heads. They were too fragile to travel, and are still being studied – but the first x-rays suggest they contain cloth bags of cremated human remains, presumably carried on horseback across the plains until they could be added to the bodies lying in the family tomb. “When I saw them lying in a dimly lit room in St Petersburg, and one of the curators lifted the head – shedding bits of straw – to look at me, it was an image straight out of some Hollywood horror movie,” Simpson recalled. “I put the photograph on my office door as a way of saying ‘keep away from here’ in the last three weeks I was working flat out trying to get the catalogue finished – it was very effective.” Scythians: Warriors of Ancient Siberia, British Museum, London, 14 September –14 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/13/grenfell-campaigner-calls-for-return-of-local-assets-as-reparation","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Grenfell campaigner calls for return of local assets as reparation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/13/grenfell-campaigner-calls-for-return-of-local-assets-as-reparation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/13/grenfell-campaigner-calls-for-return-of-local-assets-as-reparation","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell campaigner calls for return of local assets as reparation","bodyText":"The man who said it would take a “catastrophic” fire in Grenfell Tower before council officials would act on safety concerns has demanded that community assets are returned to residents as reparation for the disaster. Edward Daffarn, the key author of the Grenfell Action Group blog which detailed the management failures and fire safety problems at the block for five years before the fire, said the move would be a necessary corrective for decades of neglect by the Kensington and Chelsea council. He called for the council to reverse the leasing of North Kensington library to a private school, to preserve the threatened local adult education college, and to reopen stables where riding lessons were, until recently, available for children with disabilities. Soon after Daffarn spoke to the Guardian, the council provided the written confirmation he had sought that the library’s future would be secured. But he is still calling for a reversal of the decisions on the other community sites. “Reparation is a difficult word because nothing can make good for what happened that evening, but some change has to come; it can’t be business as usual,” Daffarn said. Speaking at length for the first time since the fire, which killed at least 80 people in June, he argued that a council-led drive to regenerate North Kensington was behind both the neglect of Grenfell residents and the planned closures of the community services. As such, he said, the services should be returned to the community as a show of official atonement by the council. Daffarn, a former social worker, has been a persistent and meticulous critic of the council and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation since 2010. He documented the failures of both bodies to respond to repeated concerns about fire safety in the tower, while charting the council’s drive to regenerate North Kensington for new, richer residents. Last November, his blog warned that only a “serious loss of life of KCTMO residents” would get people to pay attention to what was happening at Grenfell and predicted that in the event of a fire, the blog would become “part of damning evidence of the poor safety record of the KCTMO”. Since the disaster, police have interviewed Daffarn at length, and taken copies of the blog and all his correspondence with the council and estate management officials. He said he was not ready to talk about the tower and his repeated warnings about safety failings, but he wanted to try to draw something constructive from the devastation by campaigning for reparations and highlighting the council’s misplaced focus on development in the area. “They didn’t give a stuff about us. We were the carcass and they were the vultures,” he said. “North Kensington was like a goldmine, only they didn’t have to dig for the gold. All they had to do was to marginalise the people who were living here, and that’s what they were doing.” He said he believed council officials were preoccupied by redevelopment, giving them less time to focus on their responsibilities towards tenants. “Grenfell wouldn’t have happened if they had spent their time looking after us, doing their job properly,” he said. “These things are linked. The things that were precious and mattered to this community were not respected and weren’t protected.” The library and the college, like the borough’s council estates, “were seen as assets that could be taken away, or mistreated or not looked after properly”, he said. “Are we going to allow them to go on closing down the things that are valuable? Our college, our library, our stables? We can’t lose everything we have been fighting for to the same institution.” Before the fire, the North Kensington library was about to be leased to the private Notting Hill preparatory school next door. Acquiring the building, opened in 1895 as an educational resource for the children of the poor, would have allowed the prep school to expand, and the council planned to build a smaller library nearby. “This beautiful building has been used by generation and generation of working class people,” Daffarn said. “It has served the community for 125 years and it is part of the culture and heritage of North Kensington.” Two weeks ago, Daffarn and fellow campaigners had a verbal assurance from the council’s deputy leader that the library would remain in place. The council finally confirmed that in writing on Tuesday. “We never would have got the library back had it not been for Grenfell. It is bittersweet. It has come at the cost of the Grenfell deaths,” he said. Councillor Kim Taylor-Smith, deputy leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, told the Guardian: “Kensington and Chelsea council has committed to working closely with the community to help those affected by this tragedy. “We will be involving Grenfell community groups and wider community on decisions involving local services and making sure their voices are heard. I have been discussing the future of North Kensington library with residents and I can reassure them that I have heard loud and clear how much the community values it. The library will be retained as a library.” The future of Kensington and Chelsea college remains uncertain; the building is threatened with demolition, to be replaced by a private housing development. Staff at the college believe there has been a process of managed decline in the past five years. Plans to merge Kensington and Chelsea adult education college with West London college are under way, and the local building is threatened with demolition, to be replaced by a private housing development. Staff at the college believe there has been a process of managed decline in the past five years. “The community cannot afford to lose the college,” Daffarn said. The West London stables, located beneath a motorway, are closed, pending redevelopment of the area. Daffarn said: “It was a jewel in our crown beneath the motorway … If you didn’t have money it didn’t matter; you would still be accommodated. “The transfer of these assets from public into private has been a very vicious attack on everything we hold dear.” The fire left Daffarn so traumatised that he has mostly avoided the media since. He fled through thick smoke from his 16th floor flat and was found on a landing by a firefighter who pulled at his leg in the darkness to show the way to the stairs. Many of his friends were among those who died. He said he wanted the demands, which reflect long, bitterly fought and largely ignored local campaigns, to help reverse the rapid transformation of the area, which he regarded as being almost entirely unhelpful for the community. He said he also hoped the inquiry, which starts on Thursday, would help bring long-lasting changes “so that people who live in council estates are never treated again as they were previously: with indifference and neglect”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2017/sep/14/how-to-request-flexible-working","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"Five steps to requesting flexible working","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/sep/14/how-to-request-flexible-working","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2017/sep/14/how-to-request-flexible-working","fields":{"headline":"Five steps to requesting flexible working","bodyText":"Are you reading this while remote working from a sun-drenched beach, hot-desking in a city centre office or working from home at midnight? If so, you’re not alone. More of us than ever are working flexibly, at times and in locations that fit around our lives – and the trend is set to continue. A study by Lancaster University, predicts that flexible working will be the main way of working for 70% of organisations by 2020. However, some new studies suggest that demand for flexible jobs significantly outstrips supply. A recent report by recruitment agency Timewise [pdf], which looked at 230,000 job adverts in Scotland, found that 11.9% of jobs are advertised as flexible, while 34% of job-seeking Scots sought flexible work. Meanwhile, research by Powwownow found that 47% of full-time employees do not have flexible working encouraged at their workplace. It isn’t always appropriate to work from home (if you need specialist equipment, for example) and many employers demand core hours for servicing clients. However, many employers will allow some flexibility – you just have to ask. “You can make informal arrangements with employers, such as leaving early one day for a doctor’s appointment, for example,” says Sajida Hussain, employment and business immigration associate at DAC Beachcroft LLP. “However, after 26 weeks of continuous service, you have the right to make a formal request.” So, for those looking to ditch the 9-to-5, here’s our five step how-to guide… Check the policy First, take a look at your employer’s flexible working policy (if it has one), as this will set out how requests should be made, says Vicky Schollar, senior solicitor at Blake Morgan LLP. “Think carefully about what you want as, unless otherwise agreed, it will result in a permanent change to your terms and conditions of employment,” she says. So before you ask consider whether flexible hours will work for you. Set it out in writing A formal request under the statutory scheme must be in writing. It must be dated and set out in a particular format, which includes certain information. It’s important to get this right – legally employees can only make one formal flexible working request every 12 months. For guidelines on how to do this, see the Acas Code of Practice [pdf]. Make the case Remember that it’s not just about you: the way you work impacts on your colleagues, and potentially your clients and customers, – your employer will take everything into account. “So, think about how your request is likely to impact on your employer’s business and how any negative impact or barriers to your request can be addressed by presenting workable solutions,” suggests Schollar. To help an employer make an informed decision, it’s a good idea to explain why you are making the request – for compressed hours, for example, or term time working – if your circumstances have changed. “This means employers can give the request proper consideration and potentially consider alternative ways of helping if the request is ultimately unsuccessful,” says Jenna Ide, an employment law solicitor at Thomas Mansfield Solicitors. Wait for a response Once you’ve made the request, your employer has to consider it and decide if it’s workable (if there would be an extra cost burden, for example, or it would need to recruit someone to cover your varied hours). Many employers will arrange a meeting with you to discuss your request (this is good practice) and the law requires the process to be completed within three months of the request being received, which includes any appeals. “There are eight reasons that employers may use to refuse your request,” says Hussain. “These are laid out by Acas and include the burden of additional costs, an inability to reorganise work among existing staff and an inability to recruit additional staff.” Be flexible Be open-minded and be prepared to be flexible too. If your employer can’t give you exactly what you want, they may suggest a compromise. “For example, you may want to work Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays but your employer may only be able to accommodate Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays to meet business needs,” says Schollar.

Is she cocking a snook at the American artist Paul McCarthy, whose controversial sculptures include a giant inflatable poo, perhaps? You wouldn’t want one of those plopping down in front of your house. But no, Whiteread was talking about arbitrary acts of public sculpture in a more general sense. “I’m not a great fan of what I call ‘plop art’, where you plop a piece of work down where it doesn’t bear any relationship to anything else,” she said as her cast of the inside of a chicken shed went on display outside Tate Britain. Too much public art in Britain is, she suggests, “ill thought-out and put in places that it shouldn’t necessarily be.” Surely she can’t be talking about Sean Henry’s Couple, two painted statues of a man and woman on a metal platform slap in the middle of a beautiful Northumberland seashore, or the floating sculpture project at St Pancras International that has seen a series of artists suspend abstract ornaments high above the heads of passengers who rarely look up at them? Whiteread is right – Britain is full of bad public art that seems to have no particular reason to be where it is and can give little to its surroundings, let alone inspire or move anyone. Yet she has entered a debate that no one can win: a blasted wasteland of critical dispute littered with burnt-out shards of rhetoric. The real problem with putting permanent works of art in public spaces in modern Britain is that we have no consensus about what art should look like or even what it is. One person’s poetic vision is another’s plop art. Public sculpture is the Brexit of the arts; a savagely antagonistic, remorseless debate between irreconcilable camps. Indeed, this debate – which has raged since the 1990s – may, in retrospect, have been a foreshadowing all along of the two nations revealed by the Brexit vote. Back in 1993, Whiteread’s great sculpture House created a fierce and shockingly destructive national controversy. Supporters saw it as a ghostly masterpiece that paid homage to the history of the East End. It was a concrete cast of the inside of an entire house from a demolished row at the edge of a common in Mile End: when the house it had filled was removed around it, this huge, grey, macabre object was left standing like a mausoleum on the common’s green expanse. Making a pilgrimage to see it was one of the experiences that turned me into a professional art critic. To my eyes and imagination, House was one of the most haunting and enduring things ever created by a British artist. A lot of people disagreed. Tower Hamlets council, for instance, which was deaf to all the art lovers who went to see House or pleaded for it to be preserved – even to the Turner prize jury that recognised Whiteread’s achievement. House was demolished. Tower Hamlets was undoubtedly speaking for some local people. To many eyes a huge concrete cast of a house is the very definition of “plop art” – a strange, unbeautiful modernist object plopped down in my neighbourhood. Whiteread says her art is “poetic” and I agree. But, Rachel, how are we going to force people to understand modern art? Should classes in advanced minimalism be compulsory in all schools? Rightly or wrongly The Great British Bake Off has a bigger following than the art theory of Rosalind Krauss, and many people prefer figurative statues to abstract spectres of lost objects. The huge bronze statue of lovers kissing at St Pancras always has someone looking at it fondly. The art of Antony Gormley is successful because he brilliantly gives both sides what they want: the Angel of the North has a “modern” abstracted quality and is based on a cast, but in the end it’s an easily understandable statue of a winged figure. Even to debate the artistic merits of public sculpture seems slightly old-fashioned. No one talks about artistic quality, only politics, in the protests and even riots that now rage around statues. Pulling down statues that offend and putting up statues of your heroes is what gets us going today. Whiteread’s art stands far apart from this new fervour. No one is going to either put up or pull down one of her casts as a political statement – unless, perhaps, she made a cast of Robert E Lee’s shed. Poetry is rare and banality rules the world. Whiteread will never convert anyone to sensitivity or imagination by talking. She’s probably better off keeping quiet and casting. Her art has a silent power that rises high above the chatter and chanting of our time. It will be remembered when our arguments are forgotten. • Jonathan Jones writes on art for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/12/uk-offers-to-maintain-defence-and-security-cooperation-with-eu-michael-fallon","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T11:42:46Z","webTitle":"UK offers to maintain defence and security cooperation with EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/12/uk-offers-to-maintain-defence-and-security-cooperation-with-eu-michael-fallon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/12/uk-offers-to-maintain-defence-and-security-cooperation-with-eu-michael-fallon","fields":{"headline":"UK offers to maintain defence and security cooperation with EU","bodyText":"Britain has played one its strongest cards in the EU negotiations by offering to put its defence, security and aid assets at the disposal of the European Union in the hope of getting concessions on future trading and economic relations. The offer extends to continuing to share embassies with the EU, provide intelligence information and undertake regular joint EU-led military missions. Issuing its position paper on defence and foreign policy relations with the EU after Brexit, the defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, said the UK was not seeking to blackmail the EU by threatening to withdraw security cooperation if it did not get the economic deal it wants. He told the BBC: “No, this isn’t blackmail, this isn’t a negotiating strategy. What we are doing, and everybody has asked for this, is to set out how we see the new partnership the day after Brexit. We want to fight terrorism together. It’s vital. We are not making threats.” The tone of the position paper, unlike Theresa May’s Mansion House speech in February, makes no reference to a threatened end to UK defence cooperation, and instead presents its offer as based on the “belief the UK has a historic deep belief in the same values that Europe stands for – peace, democracy, freedom and the rule of law”. The paper says the UK would like to work with the EU on its defence missions, and help with operational planning and developing their mandate. It also sets out plans for continuing to contribute to the commission’s nascent European defence fund, including the European defence research programme and the European defence industrial development programme. The move would assuage British defence industry concerns that Brexit will lead to greater Franco-German cooperation, gradually pushing the UK out of major defence markets. The UK is one of the EU’s premier defence forces, but it has not been the largest contributor to the EU’s common defence and security missions, focusing its spending instead on Nato. It has, however, contributed to all 15 EU defence missions, including combating piracy on the Horn of Africa and migration from Libya. The level of UK involvement in the planning process for EU military missions should reflect the UK’s contributions, the paper suggests. Other third parties such as Norway contribute to EU missions, but the Ministry of Defence appears to be proposing a more structural cooperation. The paper also calls for the exchange of classified information to support foreign policy, the reciprocal exchange of foreign policy experts and military personnel, and the shared provision of consular services in third countries where either the EU or the UK lack resources. There is no explicit suggestion that some of the UK aid budget would be distributed through the EU, but officials said this was possible in the context of negotiations on a new EU development budget after 2020. At present, the UK contributes 15% of the EU overseas aid budget, and the paper calls for continued UK collaboration and alignment in development policy and programming. On future diplomatic cooperation, the paper proposes the “UK and the EU should have regular close consultations on foreign and security policy issues with the option to include joint positions on foreign policy issues. This could include cooperation on sanctions listing including “by sharing information and aligning policy where appropriate”. In practice, a unilateral UK sanctions policy, against Russia for instance, would be largely ineffective, leaving Britain little option but to work alongside the EU and UN. The paper does not say whether that cooperation could extend to the UK retaining a veto over EU member state sanctions policy but it points out that half the sanctions listings comes from the UK. Officials did not rule out a suggestion made by the former former foreign secretary Lord Hague that UK officials should be able to sit on the EU’s political and security committee, its premier decision-making body for EU diplomats and officials. The PSC sits just below the EU foreign affairs council, from which the UK will be excluded once it leaves the EU. The offers of future cooperation will disturb Eurosceptics worried that the UK is still being dragged towards concepts such as an EU army and wasteful EU aid spending."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/13/uk-cities-expected-millions-pounds-green-energy-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"UK cities expected to get millions of pounds for green energy projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/13/uk-cities-expected-millions-pounds-green-energy-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/13/uk-cities-expected-millions-pounds-green-energy-projects","fields":{"headline":"UK cities expected to get millions of pounds for green energy projects","bodyText":"Green energy projects run by cities and local authorities around the UK stand to receive millions of pounds of government support, providing another fillip for renewable power just a day after the subsidised price of windfarms hit a record low. The Guardian understands that ministers this autumn will offer more than £3m to help local leaders build low carbon initiatives, such as installing solar panels on social housing. The funding would be a key plank of the government’s upcoming blueprint on how to meet the UK’s binding carbon targets, the Clean Growth Plan. The anticipated support is a response to calls from a network of more than 70 UK cities, which said they wanted to build clean energy projects at a local level but warned that they were struggling to finance them. “We believe the UK has a great opportunity to lead the world in an early shift to a fossil-fuel-free economy, just as we have led the world in previous industrial transitions,” said Judith Blake, leader of Leeds city council, and John Holdich, leader of Peterborough city council. Both cities are members of the UK100, which backs action on climate change and clean energy. But in a new report, the network said local authorites often lacked the technical expertise for accessing finance and EU funds being cut off post-Brexit posed a further challenge. The report’s authors, former employees of the engineering giant Arup and the recently privatised Green Investment Bank, called on ministers to tackle the problem by creating Clean Energy Action Partnerships between national and local government. The partnerships would employ teams of experts to support councils who want to build local low carbon projects, such as heat networks or solar power. Claire Perry, the climate minister, is understood to be sympathetic to the proposals. One idea put forward in the UK100’s report is that clean energy projects run by councils could enjoy a cut in business rates. Perry is believed to have told local leaders she looks forward to helping them access finance. Perry said: “We want to build on our success and that’s why collaboration across government, and with people and organisations throughout the country, is vital as we prepare to launch our Clean Growth Strategy.” The backing for locally owned clean energy came as a thinktank of Labour members and MPs criticised the lack of UK ownership for offshore windfarms, such as the ones awarded nearly £200m a year in subsidies on Monday. The Labour Energy Forum found the Danish state-owned company Dong Energy owned 31.5% of all offshore wind capacity in the UK, with private German, Spanish and Swedish firms dominating the rest of the market. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said Labour supported offshore wind but wanted to see windfarms built off the coast that were publicly owned by the UK. “Labour not only supports investment and real proactive support for the renewables sector but we also commit to ensuring more rapid growth and diversification of ownership within this important sector through the creation of publicly owned and locally accountable energy companies and co-operatives,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/12/leave-britney-alone-prototype-viral-hit-chris-crocker","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T15:08:39Z","webTitle":"Leave Britney Alone was the prototype of a viral hit – it couldn’t happen now | Amelia Tait","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/leave-britney-alone-prototype-viral-hit-chris-crocker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/leave-britney-alone-prototype-viral-hit-chris-crocker","fields":{"headline":"Leave Britney Alone was the prototype of a viral hit – it couldn’t happen now","bodyText":"Within 24 hours, Chris Crocker had accumulated 2m views on his YouTube rant. A decade ago, the then unheard of 19-year-old was propelled to viral fame thanks to a grainy video entitled Leave Britney Alone. Crocker became arguably the prototypical face of YouTube stardom, with his video (in which he cried for commentators to stop criticising Britney Spears after her disastrous performance at MTV’s VMAs show) reaching the dizzying heights of 43m views. Just over two weeks ago, Taylor Swift released the lyric video for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do. It was played 43.2m times in 24 hours. Over the last 10 years, viral videos have changed. Not only have view counts inflated dramatically, viral stars are markedly different. Musicians dominate YouTube’s most popular videos, and although “random” people still go viral, they do so in a much more polished, planned and political way. This is best illustrated with another of 2007’s most popular videos. In August 2007, a video entitled Miss Teen USA 2007 – South Carolina answers a question was uploaded to YouTube. In the clip – which now has over 66m views – beauty queen Caitlin Upton is asked why so few Americans can locate the United States on a map. “I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as, and, I believe that they should, our education over here in the US should help the US, uh, or, uh, should help South Africa,” she said, much to the amusement of YouTube commenters. In recent days, another beauty pageant contestant went viral. A video of Miss Texas has been approvingly shared more than 70,000 times after she was asked about Donald Trump’s handling of the Charlottesville demonstration. “It was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack, and I think that President Donald Trump should’ve made a statement earlier,” she said. A decade apart, these two popular beauty pageant videos (and Crocker’s Britney clip) illustrate succinctly how viral videos have changed. In 2007, YouTube was shiny and new – no one expected to become famous off the back of a tearful rant or a garbled pageant response. Now, young people are constantly aware of their potential to go viral, and they act on camera accordingly. Were Chris Crocker a 19-year-old and staunchly defensive of a popstar today, would he make Leave Taylor Alone? Perhaps, but he’d also more than likely do it with a Canon EOS 70D and swap his bedsheet backdrop for some fairy lights. Still, it definitely seems to be an improvement that (at least in the case of beauty pageants), we now use viral videos to celebrate people’s intelligence rather than mock their alleged stupidity. Thanks to this, internet stardom seems inherently less corrosive. Caitlin Upton contemplated suicide after her video went viral, and Crocker revealed yesterday that he suffered greatly after people (including public figures) mocked him for his video. “I was mocked for my femininity. I was called every gay slur in the book,” he wrote in a post on Instagram, before reflecting on the past in a video (of course): “I didn’t know how to deal with it ... we forget sometimes that things we post online can last for a long time.” It’s now safe to say Chris Crocker went viral in a different time. The culture that allowed the media to gleefully mock Britney Spears’ mental health problems is the same culture that propelled Crocker to viral infamy. As we have collectively become more sensitive about mental health problems, perhaps we are less willing to mock and malign for the sake of meme. Perhaps, also, we don’t want to mock ordinary people when there are buffoons who possess all the eloquence of Miss Teen South Carolina in the White House. In many ways, I still believe 2007 was the golden age of YouTube. The Potter Puppet Pals heard a mysterious ticking noise, Tay Zonday moved away from the mic to breathe in, and Charlie bit his brother’s finger. It seems clear that 10 years on, viral videos have changed for better and for worse. It is a shame now that they often have to be more polished and planned (last week, an Irish family achieved instant fame for trying to get a bat out of their kitchen, and it later emerged that the teen who filmed it was a self-described “content creator”), but it seems nice that viral fame has often become automatically more positive (bat boy now has a range of T-shirts retailing at €24.00 each). • Amelia Tait is the New Statesman’s technology and digital culture writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/12/armed-forces-are-no-place-for-16-year-olds","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T16:51:02Z","webTitle":"Armed forces are no place for 16-year-olds | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/armed-forces-are-no-place-for-16-year-olds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/armed-forces-are-no-place-for-16-year-olds","fields":{"headline":"Armed forces are no place for 16-year-olds","bodyText":"It is unacceptable that the British armed forces continue to recruit people under the age of 18. We are academics who research the armed forces or who are concerned with the wellbeing of young people, and it has been brought to our attention that the youth wing of the Scottish National party is presenting a motion to raise the minimum age of military recruitment to 18 at the SNP’s national conference. We fully support the SNP youth motion. The UK is one of only 19 countries worldwide to recruit 16-year-olds. Other countries that do so include North Korea, Iran and Syria. No other EU or Nato member state recruits 16-year-olds. Some 2,250 minors were recruited into the armed forces in the past 12 months. The army alone enlisted 1,000 16-year-olds. This makes 16-year-olds the single biggest age group entering the army. The army states that it uses the recruitment of minors as “an opportunity to mitigate standard entry shortfalls, particularly for the infantry”. This is worrying because the infantry has the highest fatality and injury rate of any branch of the armed forces. Child Soldiers International has found that soldiers who enlisted at 16 were twice as likely to die in Afghanistan as those who enlisted aged 18 or above. The UK’s child recruitment policy has been challenged by the UK parliament’s joint committee on human rights, the defence committee, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, major child rights organisations, Amnesty International, the National Union of Teachers, the UN committee on the rights of the child and military veterans themselves. The UK government has ignored all these calls to review the policy, and it is an issue on which the SNP should take leadership.

As children across Britain settle into new classrooms with their new teachers, it is a useful idea to keep in mind. How else to explain the widespread animus against educators, which regularly sees them portrayed as workshy moaners? Teacher recruitment and retention is a serious and growing problem. Secondary schools are struggling to recruit enough teachers to replace those who are retiring, and a National Audit Office report released this week shows that the Department for Education is failing miserably on recruitment and retention. According to government figures published in July, over 23% of the teachers who have qualified since 2011 have left the profession. In February the House of Commons education committee published a report acknowledging the increasing pressure faced by schools as a result of losing staff, and pointed to the lack of personal time, financial rewards and status relative to other graduate professions as probable causes of teachers quitting. In one survey, 76% of teachers cited workload as the main reason for leaving their jobs. The majority of parents I meet, as a teacher, are relieved that their child is happy at school, and grateful to the adults who act in loco parentis. But beyond the school gates, attitudes are different. And, in contrast to the energy displayed by government when it comes to reforming qualifications, adjusting school funding or creating new types of schools, there is an astonishing unwillingness to respond to the staffing crisis gripping the system. Raising children is supposed to be the most difficult thing in the world, but there is always the implication that teaching 30 or more of them is a doddle. Why should teachers get 13 weeks’ holiday a year when everyone else only gets 25 days? There appears to be an expectation that life in a school – for both adults and children – should be hard work. That anything which comes too easily is suspect. A new form of emotional stress, rooted in the principle of constant personal accountability, is a prime reason for the crisis in retention. While most jobs entail some degree of supervision and oversight, few – apart from that of the hospital doctor – are monitored by the minute. I am old enough to remember when an essay would just get a tick. It’s hard to convey how much things have changed. With the notion of “personalised learning”, there is no reason why a teacher today should not have to design 30 different lesson plans. The impossibility of delivering this dream, combined with the stresses of Ofsted, Sats and the relentless cycle of assessment, means teachers live with what is best described as cognitive dissonance. This is the condition in which we hold two opposing views and, experiencing it as a form of mental discomfort, we seek to harmonise our ideas, generally by eliminating the less favoured concept. Picture the following scenario: there is one minute to finish a lesson; the success criterion needs to be ticked but a child wants to share something else they have learned, be it vaguely relevant or completely off-topic, perhaps something entirely random from a cartoon they watched at home three weeks ago. It is simply easier, when the clock is ticking towards the start of the next lesson, to chivvy the child on to the content being assessed. But it never feels good; it feels like a betrayal of what we went into education to achieve. No rise in pay or reduction in workload can compensate for the pain of an adult-driven, spreadsheet-ready objective replacing a child’s joy in sharing what they actually know or what interests them. Only those who can harmonise – that is, those who can convince themselves that children would talk about targets even if they had not been specifically trained to do so – thrive in a system that fetishises the tickbox. Many teachers end up deciding they would rather quit. I am not advocating a return to the 1970s. A friend’s O-level French teacher spent a year knitting while telling anecdotes about her holidays. The rose-tinted spectacles worn by those old enough to remember a time before the introduction in 1988 of the national curriculum tend to obscure the reality of directionless teaching and harsh behavioural regimes in those days. Nonetheless, there is truth in the adage that a watched pot never boils. No one in any job performs well unless they are trusted as a professional. Teachers are leaving because being constantly scrutinised is exhausting, even when we deliver that elusive “outstanding” lesson. What is perplexing is that everyone knows this. Schoeck reminds us that there is something primal driving this apparently senseless behaviour. Fear of our children missing out in an increasingly competitive world is resulting in an almost military level of micromanagement of teachers and students. Surely it is time to employ some emotional intelligence here – the kind of creativity embodied in a project to bring youngsters and old people together in Channel 4’s recent Old People’s Home for 4 Year Olds. What was so refreshing about this project was its recognition that teachers cannot provide everything a child needs. Independent schools recognise this too, and often provide a range of specialist arts and sports tutors. In addition to furnishing their charges with a range of arenas in which to shine if they are not book-smart, more time spent in this way has the benefit of giving permanent teachers time to decompress. Just as importantly, these tutors are trusted to deliver lessons without all the paperwork and tickboxes. While it may be heretical to say so, these tutors are also cheaper than permanent staff. While there is no quick fix to the crisis in teacher retention, there is an opportunity, if we are bold, to remember that it really does take a village to raise a child – and it doesn’t have to be a Spartan one. • Tricia Bracher teaches primary-age children in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/15/i-will-eat-my-hat-if-merkel-doesnt-win-readers-on-the-german-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"'I will eat my hat if Merkel doesn't win': readers on the German election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/15/i-will-eat-my-hat-if-merkel-doesnt-win-readers-on-the-german-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/15/i-will-eat-my-hat-if-merkel-doesnt-win-readers-on-the-german-election","fields":{"headline":"'I will eat my hat if Merkel doesn't win': readers on the German election","bodyText":"German voters are hoping for business as usual after September’s general election, according to readers who responded to a Guardian callout. Angela Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, is widely expected to win, and we found support for a CDU-FDP-Green “Jamaica” coalition. Strikingly, even those planning to vote for alternative parties paid tribute to Merkel as a reassuring, safe pairs of hands as chancellor. “In trying times, a change of leadership is always a risk. Right now, with Merkel’s administration working largely well, it is not a risk worth taking,” said Martin Richter, 32, in Berlin, who is voting for the CDU. Below, we share a selection of views from our readers. ‘The other parties haven’t put forward a viable alternative’ Olaf Wonter, 40, Hamburg. Leaning towards: Christian Democratic Union I am not a traditional CDU voter but considering the other parties have put forth no viable alternative, I will vote for Angela Merkel. She is level-headed, extremely intelligent, has clear policy views but can be consensual and, internationally, she portrays an image that corresponds with what modern Germany is actually about. What’s more, she is the only Western leader who can deal with Mr Putin. She takes governing seriously and it is obviously done for the best interest of Germany and not for her own interests - which multi-millionaire’s private yacht have you seen her vacationing on? ‘The SPD have been too similar to the CDU’ Alex Jakob, 35, teacher, Paderborn. Leaning towards: The Left I’m left-wing and would like to vote SPD as the traditional working class party but for a long time now they have been far too centrist and too similar to the CDU. I chose Die Linke as Sahra Wagenknecht has been extremely convincing, eloquent and well-informed during the election campaign. She’s passionate about the same issues I feel passionate about and it shows. She comes across as intelligent rather than slick or smug. I would never vote for the CDU as they are a socially conservative party for people with money, but on the world stage Merkel has done relatively well and in these uncertain times it might not even be bad to hold on to her. Her compassion towards the refugees and her decision to keep open our borders when nobody else would help speaks to her principles and conscience which I respect. ‘Some don’t remember a time before Merkel was in power’ Milena Wein, 20, student, Leipzig. Leaning towards: Alliance 90 / The Greens As someone who cares about social justice and animal rights, I am backing the Green Party. It is going to be the first time that I’m allowed to vote in national elections and I have informed myself about the different programs and candidates. German politics needs to be less concerned with our already highly successful economy but with the price we have paid to keep said economy running - lower wages, temporary employment and of course industrial pollution. Just reading the news about the natural disasters in the United States reminds me why it is necessary to change as soon as possible. I don’t think that my vote will change anything. Most people are happy with the way Merkel has governed the country, some - like me - don’t even remember a time before she came into power. Her clever way of changing her political stance everytime it becomes unpopular has proven to be very efficient. Nobody really knows what Merkel stands for - you can project everything onto her. ‘I trust Merkel’s pragmatism over party ideology’ Will, 32, Berlin. Leaning towards: Christian Democratic Union I’m not backing the CDU. It’s about Merkel. They are not the same thing. I’ve always been a green voter up until now and the thought of going conservative this time makes me cringe. But then I remind myself that in actuality I’m not. Merkel is not a conservative, center-right-left or anything. She just is. The Greens are busy fighting amongst themselves and trying to be an all-issues party when they just should be about the environment and human rights. They appeal to no one because they want to appeal to everyone. Ever since I turned 30 I suddenly found voting for personalities and “leadership styles” more appealing than voting for parties. And in my opinion, Merkel’s spur-of-the-moment pragmatism is something that I trust more than any party ideology. ‘The air is ripe with inevitability’ Felix Powell, 23, Berlin. Leaning towards: Social Democrats I have been living in Berlin for 6 months after studying for 4 years in Manchester - I have dual British and German citizenship and I am looking forward to voting in my second national election inside one year. I am a member of the Labour Party in the UK and feel inclined towards parties of the same ilk in the lead up to the election in Germany. This will ultimately mean voting for the SPD, though it is with slight hesitation. Martin Schultz’s inability to differentiate the SPD as a true alternative to Merkel’s CDU had led me to consider a protest vote in the form of Die Linke. With Trump in the White House, Brexit in motion and Theresa May ‘losing’ an election in which she was always meant to bulldoze her enemies off of the electoral map, anything is possible. Having said this, anything other than a Merkel victory and I will happily eat my hat. The air is ripe with inevitability in Germany and no one here sees Angela doing a ‘Theresa’ by losing a 13 point lead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/sep/19/message-hope-young-scots-change-country-better-scotland-hunter-foundation-school","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T11:48:21Z","webTitle":"A message of hope: how young Scots would change their country for the better","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/sep/19/message-hope-young-scots-change-country-better-scotland-hunter-foundation-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/sep/19/message-hope-young-scots-change-country-better-scotland-hunter-foundation-school","fields":{"headline":"A message of hope: how young Scots would change their country for the better","bodyText":"The following extracts are taken from an ebook of essays written by schoolchildren, outlining what would they change if they ruled Scotland ‘Open more food banks’ More than a million people in Scotland live in poverty. I don’t think it is fair for some people to live an amazing life with everything they want and need, and some people worry that they won’t have a bed for the night or when they will have their next meal. I would open more food banks and hope that more people would feel confident to get help and hopefully turn their lives around, for even a little while, and not feel embarrassed. I would make sure that there were friendly, kind and caring people who volunteer there, and that people would be able to talk to them honestly and get the help that they need. I would like it if shops could donate food that is fresh, instead of it all going to waste. Amy Russell, 13, Currie ‘Children with disablities should have a normal school life’ Children who have disabilities should be able to socialise and have a normal schooling life. I think if we slowly started to mix the children at a young age it would benefit them. If children without disabilities were schooled with the children who do, they would understand that they never asked for that and it wasn’t a choice that they made. Melissa Duff, 15, Edinburgh ‘Provide free sanitary products’ Almost all female bathrooms have no sanitary products available, and if they do the machines are out of date and some users feel embarrassed using them in such a public place. A period is not a choice. As a female student, I feel strongly about the issue and have heard reports of socks and tissues being used as an alternative to sanitary products because women can’t afford them. This is unacceptable. If we give out free condoms, we can surely provide free sanitary products in all female bathrooms. I would make it a legal requirement that all public toilets have at least one free machine filled with sanitary products as everyone should have a chance to feel clean and in control. Libby Cornwall, 14, Dunbar ‘We need more affordable housing’ The thing that I would most like to change is to have more affordable housing. Like 214,000 other households across Scotland, I live in an overcrowded house. The difficulties are having nowhere quiet or spacious enough to study or do homework. For many children it makes it even more difficult to break out of the cycle of poverty as they cannot achieve the grades they need to access university courses, which are more likely to lead to well-paid, professional jobs. Logan Davidson, 14, Leith ‘There is an unnecessary stigma surrounding mental health’ I aim to tackle mental ill-health in schools. As it is such a common issue, we as a society have a responsibility to alter our perception of mental health. There is an unnecessary stigma surrounding these problems. Young people and adults must be told that it is not just them; there is help out there and they are not alone. I would set up mental health clinics in every school, both primary and secondary, across Scotland. Ailis MacLean, 18, Edinburgh ‘Change how we treat the environment’ One of the biggest injustices in our society is our treatment of the environment and the effect this is having on our world’s poorest people. Climate change will only exacerbate the gap between the richest and the poorest. First, it will cause an increase in natural disasters – we are already seeing this in action. Between 2000 and 2009 the number of natural disasters was approximately three times higher than in the 1980s – these include floods, droughts and extreme weather. The communities that are less equipped to face such environmental catastrophes are the ones that are bearing the brunt. But I believe we can make a change. Ruth Dolan, 18, Edinburgh ‘Support older people’ I would like to improve the quality of life for the older generation. Loneliness is still a massive issue – even for those who are healthy enough to stay in their own homes. It is important to have as many support groups as possible, and there are many creative solutions that could make life better for people. One idea could be a scheme to put people in touch with lonely older people and invite them to dinner regularly. It is just a small gesture, but it provides a way for people to socialise and get out of the house – it’s a small step that could be easily achievable. Kara Dempsey, 13, Bo’ness ‘Recuit more medical students’ The NHS is clearly in distress. There is an increasing number of patients and still no rise in doctors or numbers of beds. In 2011, 71% of junior doctors in the UK continued in their training to become a GP or specialist. This number dropped to 50% in 2016. If this trend continues, there will be no NHS. Universities need to recruit more medical students, but also need to ensure their methods of assessing an applicant allow them to find committed applicants. Caitlyn Gallagher,18, Elgin ‘Poverty is unacceptable’ The fact that there are still approximately one in five Scottish people living in poverty is unacceptable. In a country that wishes to advance in the ways that Scotland does, this must be tackled urgently. As a prospective leader, I would fund employability groups and support workers to help the most vulnerable people in Scotland to become fully participating members of society.

Andreas Schleicher, the education director of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), endorsed the English system in which students pay annual tuition fees of £9,000 through loans, saying it had provided sustainability to the sector which had been able to expand as a result. But he sounded a note of caution about outcomes for students, warning that earnings for UK graduates did not provide as good a return on their investment in their education as elsewhere in OECD countries. “The UK system is probably the most sustainable,” he said. “The one caveat I would make is that the returns are becoming more volatile and more varied. The earnings returns in England are not as good as in some other countries.” Schleicher’s intervention comes as the government is reported to be considering ways to reduce the cost burden on university students, following a summer of hostile headlines about soaring vice-chancellor pay and rising student debt. Labour is to force a parliamentary vote to scrap the government’s latest rise in university tuition fees on Wednesday . Under the government’s plan, the annual tuition fee cap of £9,000 is to rise by £250 a year, increasing the debt of a student on a four-year course by £1,000 overall. Speaking in London at the launch of a OECD education survey on Tuesday, Schleicher agreed that tuition fees were high in England and warned against a wholesale lifting of the £9,000 cap. “If you want to see what happens when you drop the cap, look to the US where you get some institutions charging exorbitant fees. Markets are not a great mechanism on this.” But he said he thought there could be greater flexibility in tuition fees in England which could in some instances go up even higher if the learning experience and teaching quality improved in universities, where the focus has long been on research quality rather than teaching quality. “Teaching quality is a major challenge in the UK,” he said. The Conservative peer Lord Willetts, however, also speaking on Tuesday at a separate event on the future of tuition fees, criticised the idea of forcing some English universities to lower their fees from the forthcoming £9,250 maximum – an idea said to be under discussion within government – warning against judgments about “good” and “bad” universities. The former universities and science minister, quoted in Times Higher Education, said he was opposed to the introduction of different levels of fees at different universities, saying that the “best and simplest system by far is £9,000 for everyone”. The OECD report, Education at a Glance 2017, compares the state of education globally, providing data on the structure, finances and performance of education systems in the 35 OECD countries, plus a number of partner countries. The report reveals particularly low levels of public funding in tertiary education in the UK, with just 28% of expenditure from the public purse, compared with the OECD average of 70%. Just under 50% comes from household expenditure – in other words tuition fees paid for by student loans – more than double the OECD average of 22%. While Schleicher was broadly supportive of the UK’s lower than average public investment in tertiary education, he said the UK should increase its public spending on early years which is among the lowest across OECD countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/12/don-williams-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T14:15:10Z","webTitle":"Don Williams obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/12/don-williams-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/12/don-williams-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Don Williams obituary","bodyText":"British fans of country music have tended to favour the unassuming, less flamboyant male exponents of the genre such as Jim Reeves, George Hamilton IV and Don Williams. At the peak of his popularity in the late 1970s and 80s, Williams, who has died aged 78, headed the bill at the annual Wembley international festival of country music, toured Britain and mainland Europe, and sold LPs by the hundreds of thousands. He once described his music as “intensely simple”, but while his love songs were charming and often sentimental and his warm baritone voice was compared to that of Reeves, he also found admirers among the rock music fraternity: both Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend recorded versions of his songs. Williams was born in Floydada, Texas, the third son of James, a mechanic, and Loveta Mae (nee Lambert), an amateur musician who entered her son for a local talent competition when he was three. He won first prize, an alarm clock. A few years later the family settled in Corpus Christi, east Texas, where his mother taught him to play the guitar. By the time Don had graduated from high school in 1958 he was absorbing both country music and rock’n’roll, notably the music of Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. After high school Williams served for two years in the US army. Returning home, he found work variously as a bread delivery driver, debt collector and oil field operative, while performing in local clubs and bars with a friend, Lofton Cline. In 1964 they formed a pop-folk trio with Susan Taylor, calling themselves the Pozo-Seco Singers. The trio made records for Columbia, two of which – I Can Make It With You and Look What You’ve Done – became top 40 pop hits in the US. But the group failed to build on that success and returned to playing in noisy dance halls and bars, which were anathema to Williams. He said later that “I swore I’d never paint myself into that corner again”, and the trio disbanded in 1971. Next Williams set up a furniture business with his father-in-law (he had married Joy Bucher in 1960). But he continued to write songs, and when Taylor asked him to contribute to her solo album, Williams took a job within a year with a Nashville music publishing firm headed by Allen Reynolds. However, the low-key ethos of his compositions went against the grain of the dominant, sophisticated “countrypolitan” Nashville sound so, with Reynolds, he decided to record them himself. The result was the album Don Williams Volume One (1973), which contained one of his most praised tracks, Amanda, described by the music historian Bill Malone as combining “the flavour of old-time country music with a middle-of-the-road approach”. Two more albums followed before I Wouldn’t Want to Live If You Didn’t Love Me gave Williams his first country No 1 hit single in 1974. As with most of his later hits, he did not compose this himself. The songwriter was Al Turney, who had pitched the song while serving Williams at a petrol station. Williams was to top the country singles charts in the US a further 16 times over the next 12 years. Among his biggest hits were You’re My Best Friend (1975), written by Wayland Holyfield; Tulsa Time (1978), composed by Danny Flowers, guitarist with Williams’s touring band; I Believe in You (1980), which became Williams’s only solo US pop hit; and Stay Young (1983), a cover of the Gallagher &amp; Lyle song. Williams first visited Britain in 1976 at the invitation of the impresario Mervyn Conn, who promoted the Wembley festival. Conn also persuaded the British arm of his record company, ABC, to make Williams’s albums available during a period when UK labels were often reluctant to release country albums for fear that their hip rock image would be tarnished. In the event, partly owing to the BBC showing highlights of the Wembley festival, Williams was a great success, both with a hardcore country audience and a wider public. His single I Recall a Gypsy Woman became a Top 20 UK hit in the summer of 1976, while the follow-up, You’re My Best Friend, reached the top 40 later in the same year. More than a dozen of his albums reached the UK charts, the most successful being Images, which peaked at No 2 in 1978. He made his final British tour in 2014. As fashions in country music changed, Williams toured less and spent more time with his family at his ranch near Nashville. But he was held in high esteem by many younger musicians. On his final albums, So It Goes (2012) and Reflections (2014), issued by Sugar Hill, he was accompanied by artists including the singer Vince Gill and the fiddler and singer Alison Krauss. A tribute album, Gentle Giants: The Songs of Don Williams, featuring versions of his songs by Garth Brooks, Keith Urban and Lady Antebellum, was released earlier this year. The title was a reference to his nickname, the Gentle Giant. Like Reeves before him, Williams appealed to listeners on several continents. He toured Australia and New Zealand, India and Latin America, and was especially popular in Africa, where he had enthusiastic fans in South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Ivory Coast. Williams was awarded many honours from the country music community. He received the 1978 male artist of the year award dressed in the outfit of faded blue jeans, denim jacket and worn-out hat designed for him when he appeared with Burt Reynolds in the 1975 film W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings. He was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2010, but was too ill with bronchitis to attend in person. He retired from live performance in 2016. He is survived by Joy, their sons Gary and Timmy, and four grandchildren. • Donald Ray Williams, singer and songwriter, born 27 May 1939; died 8 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/action-bronson-rapper-sending-food-tv-fans-into-raptures","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"Action Bronson: the rapper sending food TV fans into raptures | Ed Cumming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/action-bronson-rapper-sending-food-tv-fans-into-raptures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/action-bronson-rapper-sending-food-tv-fans-into-raptures","fields":{"headline":"Action Bronson: the rapper sending food TV fans into raptures","bodyText":"Speaking to Action Bronson, the thick-bearded, 300lb tattooed Albanian-American rapper who has forged a second career as a gourmand TV presenter, it seems surprising that more musicians aren’t foodies. Surfing from city to city on expense accounts, with plenty of free afternoons, life on tour offers a lot of scope for exploring out-of-the-way restaurants and eateries. “Music and food go hand in hand,” Bronson explains. “The dish in the middle of the table is like the song you put on for everyone to start grooving to. It’s the language of the world, a way of bringing people together.” As he explains, for him the food came before the music. He grew up in Queens, New York, son of an American mother and an Albanian father. “My grandmother would be making food three times a day,” he says. “Delicious Albanian delicacies, but I didn’t appreciate it until I was older. I’d be eating hamburgers like a little prick.” He worked as a chef, and even briefly did food TV himself, before an injury led him to focus on the music. Soon, however, Bronson’s catholic palate and growing hip-hop fame led to a show on Vice’s food channel, Munchies, called F*ck, That’s Delicious. As you might guess from its title, the series does not dwell long on the finer points of flavouring or sous-vide technique. Instead, Bronson travels around, meeting local chefs, exuberantly sampling their wares, and swearing a lot. “This is going to blow your pussy off,” he says of some fried chicken in New Orleans. “This tastes like my grandmother. Not like her, like the things she used to make,” he says of a meat-filled pancake in Paris. “I feel like Jamie Oliver,” he says, showing us how to make Hawaiian poke on a New York rooftop. It’s funny, unpretentious – and filthy. Perhaps inevitably, given the millions of views it has received, the show has led to a cookbook of the same title, co-written by Rachel Wharton. In it, Bronson lists 100 of his favourite things to eat, going into 40 recipes in depth, as well as telling some colourful stories from his childhood. “Think of it as volume 1,” he says. “You can’t fit everything into just one book. It’s the start of an Encyclopaedia Britannica of food.” Like its author, the book is equally devoted to haute cuisine and street food. “I’m not a snob,” he says. “I didn’t grow up on fine dining and I love everything. I love going to the shittiest part of the neighbourhood for a barbecue and then going to a three Michelin-star restaurant where you have to wear a tie. It’s about experience. That’s how you increase your knowledge of who you are.” Not that he doesn’t have his favourites. Copenhagen and Paris are his top cities to eat out in. He’s been fed by Massimo Bottura at Osteria Francescana in Modena, and Rene Redzepi at Noma. But in the UK he goes straight to east London for earthier delights. “As soon as I touch down in London I go directly to Lahore kebab in Whitechapel, straight off the plane. They know where to sit me, what to bring me. I get a shish kebab, lamb vindaloo, vegetable curries, two types of naan. It’s a staple.” He’s good friends with Lee Tiernan of Black Axe Mangal in Highbury, and Tom Adams at Pitt Cue Co. “Those places are cathedrals.” Other food presenters have spoken about the inches the job puts on their waistline and what it does to their blood pressure. Is there ever a move from the people around him to make a programme about, say, yoga instead? “You try not to eat the whole meal,” he says, “but I don’t even think I’m overweight. I know the way I move on stage, and I could do 50 push-ups in a clip. The only thing that makes me feel overweight is when my shirt clings a little bit. But it’s all about how you feel. You can change the outside, but it doesn’t change what’s inside.” Besides, he has important work to do showing his fans how much great food is out there to be discovered. “I hope I’m helping to make it happen. People in the music industry you’d never expect have told me they love the show. And I’ve had messages from the fans telling me they’re eating this or that. Motherfuckers from the hood saying, ‘Yo, I made octopus tonight,’ who would never have tried it. They’re getting the hype. I don’t know what I could have done with my life, besides some sort of humanitarian work, that would have been more satisfying,” he says. “I’m very fucking satisfied.” To order a copy of F*ck, That’s Delicious by Action Bronson with Rachel Wharton (Abrams, £19.99) for £16.99, go to bookshop.theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/14/what-happened-10-books-by-failed-presidential-candidates-hillary-clinton","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T09:10:01Z","webTitle":"What happened to the others?

Ten more books by failed presidential candidates","bodyText":"What happened? It’s the question we’ve all been asking since Donald Trump’s surprise ascent to the US presidency. It is also the title of Hillary Clinton’s new book, in which she looks back at her campaign and reveals what she thinks … happened. Some Democrats, Bernie Sanders included, have objected to the book, saying it is important to look forward and not back, but those of us still walking around incredulous will probably buy it seeking answers. Even if that answer is clarifying just how bad Clinton’s campaign was. Clinton is not alone as a failed candidate in publishing a book dissecting events – she’s not even alone as a failed candidate of 2016 publishing a book. Here’s a list of some other titles written by hopefuls who never made it to the White House (or in some cases, the nomination): The Conscience of a Conservative (1960) by Barry Goldwater Goldwater’s slim, ghostwritten book caused a sensation on publication, reignited conservatism, made him a star and influenced Republican thought for decades. But it also provided some of the grounds for a smear campaign against him when he ran for president in 1964: a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists, none of whom had treated Goldwater, whether he was “psychologically fit” for the top job. The criticism led to the Goldwater rule, a stipulation that psychiatrists should not speculate about the mental health of a public figure. But though Goldwater lost the election to Lyndon Baines Johnson by a landslide, his book is still often namechecked. Economist Paul Krugman wrote a riposte, The Conscience of a Liberal, in 2007. God, Guns, Grits and Gravy by Mike Huckabee (2015) I’m afraid a huge motivation for including this is the title, because: the title. I don’t know who is advising twice-Republican-candidate and Fox News host Huckabee on what to name his books, but give them a raise, because he also published a diet guide entitled Quit Digging Your Grave With a Knife and Fork (2005). To which I can only say: you tell ’em, Mike, you tell ’em. Here, Huckabee goes full Huckabee. He touches on pop culture – “I’ve seen dusty pickup truck windshields that were less see-through than the mesh ‘dress’ Rihanna wore”; posits that if Jewish people had had access to guns, then the Holocaust would never have happened; rants about Gordon Ramsay and describes North Koreans as eating “lawn clippings” (me neither). No Apology: The Case for American Greatness by Mitt Romney (2010) For Mitt Romney, sorry seems to be the hardest word. The title is actually a nod to his belief in American exceptionalism and annoyance with Barack Obama for sometimes acknowledging awkward truths about US history. Many people bought No Apology, clearing space on their shelves laden with binders full of women. The book was very briefly No 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution by Bernie Sanders (2017) Sanders’ summer release is all about once again feeling the Bern, encouraging young adults to get into politics. The much loved campaigner calls for young people to “fight for a progressive economic, environmental, racial and social justice agenda”, casually dropping in the fact he gained more youth votes than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined. He also writes: “It is my observation that the current generation of young people is the smartest, most idealistic, and least prejudiced generation in the modern history of the United States”. Which is a change from the usual millennial-bashing polemics. The Good Fight: The Education of an American Reformer by Gary Hart (1995) Oh, Gary Hart! Such promise, such scandal. Hart had narrowly missed out on the 1984 Democrat nomination and was the frontrunner in his follow-up 1988 bid before he had to drop out after an (alleged) affair was exposed – via a picture of him cavorting on a yacht with someone who wasn’t his wife. Rather brilliantly, the yacht was called Monkey Business. So the narrative sort of worked itself out on that one. Hart was a talented politician and has authored many books, including the taking-no-prisonersPatriot: An Exhortation to Liberate America from the Barbarians (1996), but The Good Fight was his first big book after the, you know, monkey business. In 2006, he also put out The Courage of Our Convictions: A Manifesto for Democrats. Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution by Jeb Bush (2014) It’s tempting to choose Bush’s more recent book Reply All (choice quote: “just like a BlackBerry, I needed recharging from time to time”), but I’ve picked his 2014 book because of the brutal fact it sold fewer than 4,600 copies in hardback. But Bush can comfort himself with the knowledge that he’s not the only remaindered Republican: Rick Santorum has sold just 6,831 copies of American Patriots (2012); Rand Paul scraped past 10,000 for Government Bullies (2012); and Scott Walker sold 19,096 of Unintimidated (2013). Ted Cruz, however, received a reported $1.5m advance from HarperCollins for A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America (2015) – and it paid off, with 11,854 copies selling in its first week alone. A shame then, that the New York Times initially refused to recognise A Time for Truth as a bestseller because of the “preponderance of evidence” that Cruz was bulk-buying his own book. Rising to the Challenge: My Leadership Journey by Carly Fiorina (2015) Look, we needed a woman in the list, and given that the patriarchy has all but locked out women from running for the “highest office in the land”, Fiorina will have to do. Rising to the Challenge – incidentally also what I call ordering pudding after two starters and a main – detailed Fiorina’s, well, leadership journey. The book was released at the same time as her announcement to run as a Republican presidential candidate for 2016, so much of the book teases potential policies – but it’s also a defence of her CEO tenure at Hewlett Packard. A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties by Ben Carson MD (2015) This snappily titled tome by Ben Carson MD (the MD is important, never forget it) is just one of many books that Ben Carson MD has penned, all of which come with a picture of the great physician posing on the jacket like the seer he is, hand cupping chin/hands clasped/arms folded. He is a bestseller: his 2014 book, One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America’s Future sold a staggering 360,000 copies in its first year. A More Perfect Union served as campaign literature in the run-up to his 2016 Republican candidacy, covering his thoughts on same-sex marriage, religion and taxes. (You can probably infer some of these positions once you know that he recommends the same retrospective Holocaust remedy as Huckabee.) Worth the Fighting For by John McCain (2002) The follow-up to McCain’s bestselling Faith of My Fathers: A Family Memoir (“the prose may be flat, but the story is gripping”, according to the Observer), Worth the Fighting For covers McCain’s congressional career and culminates in his failed 2000 presidential nomination campaign. McCain went on to win the Republican nomination in 2008 and run against Barack Obama and … well, we know how that worked out. Why Not Me? The Inside Story of the Making and Unmaking of the Franken Presidency by Al Franken (1999) I could have gone with an Al Gore book, sure, but Gore’s books are more about global issues than his own experiences in politics. He also never wrote a book about the 2000 race. So instead, I’ve gone with this satirical novel by comedian Franken (and subsequent real-life senator). Written in the style of a candidate’s memoir, it is set around a 2000 election in which Franken beats Gore to the Democratic nomination. It would be spoiling it to reveal the ending, but as with the real lives of the other authors in this list, it’s safe to say things don’t exactly go to plan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/12/hurricane-irma-british-territories-aid-anguilla","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T17:14:11Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Irma has devastated British territories – so why such little aid? | Rupert Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/hurricane-irma-british-territories-aid-anguilla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/hurricane-irma-british-territories-aid-anguilla","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Irma has devastated British territories – so why such little aid?","bodyText":"Hurricane Irma, now seemingly in its final throes, has shattered Caribbean islands for which the UK is ultimately responsible. The government now appears to be taking that responsibility more seriously: the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said he will spend the coming days visiting the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Anguilla, two of the British dependencies worst hit by Irma. This is beginning to look like an appropriate response. Until last year, I served as attorney general for Anguilla and my thoughts are with friends and all those who have died or have lost homes and businesses. Media attention will soon move on but the aftermath for many will be grim for months to come: no home, no power, no schools. This will be compounded if the UK’s reconstruction effort is not quick and effective. Equally, we must be careful of colonial attitudes to “victims”. Many of the people who have suffered are resolute and resilient. They have strong spirits and are determined to rebuild quickly. Many Caribbean islands rely upon tourism; if the airports and hotels are not in a fit state to accept tourists this winter then there will be another blow to their economies. Immediate demands for supplies are one thing, but medium-term infrastructure support is required – we need to know that the electricity and schools are up and running. The UK government’s task is extremely demanding. Yet its commitment so far only to spend £32m in total across the three affected British overseas territories – Anguilla, BVI and Turks and Caicos Islands – is a drop in the Caribbean Sea. Johnson said on Monday that £28m of that has already spent. Are we to believe it will only release a further £4m? This would be derisory – it would not even pay to rebuild one school. I am sure they will do much better. The foreign secretary has also pledged to match taxpayers’ donations to the Red Cross. I just hope that we have not arrived at government by crowdfunding. If this had happened to other UK territories – the Falkland Islands or Gibraltar, for instance – would the response have been the same? To put it in perspective, the government recently spent £285m on St Helena, its territory in the South Atlantic, for an airport that, sadly, is effectively unusable. The UK’s foreign aid budget is around £12bn. There has not yet been any suggestion of other forms of support, such as UK exchange programmes for affected students. Following the volcanic eruptions in the neighbouring territory of Montserrat in the 1990s, two thirds of the population relocated to the UK. Time will tell what is required. Of course, the government will claim that it is doing all it can. It will say that troops are on the ground, needs will be met and more money released in due course. To those making unfavourable comparisons with France’s response to the crisis, the government may also say the UK does not have direct rule and control over the islands. This is in contrast to the French government’s sole responsibility for St Martin and St Barts. But they do accept that the territories are populated by UK citizens and we remain solely responsible for their security and governance. Their founding constitutions are British orders in council – we retain the power to legislate for the territories and in an extreme situations suspend their constitutions and provide for direct rule. The government’s reluctance to commit immediately to deploying significant sums in aid may simply be their huge wheels cranking into gear as they assess the needs to be met. But there are several issues provoked by the relief effort, each of which should spark serious debate about the UK’s relationship with its Caribbean overseas territories. First, does the UK see its partner Caribbean islands as tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions? Some are better known for offshore financial services than tourism. There have been longstanding reports that the islands are havens for corruption, tax avoidance and money laundering. Much of their offshore wealth emanates from the UK. The Panama Papers exposed the level of BVI ownership of London property. I would hope this publicity would not cause the UK government such embarrassment that it would seek to distance itself from the islands. Transparency International has done much work highlighting the issues in these offshore jurisdictions. What is less well known is that it was the UK which supported the establishment of these financial outposts in the first place, to benefit and service the city of London. Legislative attempts to end these secretive arrangements so far have been a fig leaf: last year’s compromise agreements fell short of requiring public registries of the beneficial ownership of companies registered in the islands. The economist Richard Murphy has recently called for the donation of any aid from the UK to be conditional on reform of the territories’ offshore tax haven status. The UK may hold the local governments of these territories responsible for these failures. What it does not say is that the UK could legislate to require reform tomorrow if there was the political will. There is not, perhaps because of the fear that it would highlight the UK’s ultimate responsibility. Both UK and local politicians also recognise that the islands’ economies, heavily reliant on offshore financial services, might flounder with the major loss of jobs. Then the UK may have to provide alternative investment. It may also rightly believe that the offshore money would simply be moved to other global secrecy jurisdictions. Second, we should also consider the political situation in each territory. Some local politicians may underplay the help required because they do not want to be seen to cede control to the British government. Some may not want to highlight reliance as they are pushing towards full independence from Britain. Less understandably, they may not want the UK to provide any control or scrutiny of their activities. Some may not want to highlight the extent of the damage for fear of putting off tourists from coming this winter. Third, we must ask whether it is a priority for the UK government to invest significantly in the territories. The Foreign Office may support a more detached relationship - that of “partners” rather than former colonial masters. Each territory has its own locally elected government, but is it realistic or fair for these governments to take primary responsibility for such an enormous reconstruction effort? The majority of their citizens still want to maintain a link with the UK, not least for when major assistance is required. If this disaster is not such an occasion, I don’t know what is. Fourth, the government may also have a real concern about controlling who aid money will go to and how it will be spent. In 2009 the UK temporarily suspended the constitution of the Turks and Caicos, and imposed direct rule following the Auld Commission into alleged governmental corruption. The former premier is currently standing trial and denies all charges.A reported £400m has been spent in Montserrat since the first eruptions of its volcano in 1995, with reported concerns about local mismanagement of aid money. Finally, the criteria that the Department for International Development uses for aid do not prioritise British overseas territories and their citizens. Eligibility is weighted towards relief for the poorest, regardless of nationality. The territories hit by Hurricane Irma are considered, rightly or wrongly, to be “middle-income countries” and their populations are not normally eligible for automatic aid. So when the foreign secretary arrives in the Caribbean, I hope he will maximise the UK’s response to the devastation wreaked by Irma, as well as using it as an opportunity to discuss our relationship with the overseas territories. It’s a conversation long overdue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/13/robocall-claims-same-sex-marriage-may-lead-to-radical-gay-education-raising-push-polling-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T22:41:04Z","webTitle":"Robocall claims same-sex marriage may lead to radical gay education, raising push-polling fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/robocall-claims-same-sex-marriage-may-lead-to-radical-gay-education-raising-push-polling-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/robocall-claims-same-sex-marriage-may-lead-to-radical-gay-education-raising-push-polling-fears","fields":{"headline":"Robocall claims same-sex marriage may lead to radical gay education, raising push-polling fears","bodyText":"A robocall asking Australians their opinion about the same-sex marriage postal survey has suggested that marriage equality may lead to “radical gay sex education” and threats to freedom of speech and religion. The poll, which was first reported by social media users on Tuesday night, stated that it was conducted by the Republican-linked American pollster WPA Intelligence. On Wednesday the Australian Market and Social Research Society said the call – which did not contain an authorisation disclosing who commissioned it – “appears to be push-polling”. The poll asks a series of seven questions. The first three are neutral questions asking whether the respondent: has a favourable or unfavourable view of Malcolm Turnbull; intends to vote in the postal survey; and whether they support, oppose, do not plan to vote or are unsure about their vote on same-sex marriage. The poll then repeats the question about support or opposition to same-sex marriage after two propositions: “Denying some people the option to marry is discriminatory and creates a second class of citizens”; and “Legalising same-sex marriage may lead to negative consequences such as radical gay sex education being taught in school, threats to freedom of speech and freedom of religion”. The last two questions ask for the respondent’s age and sex for “verification purposes”. Steven Short, who was surveyed by the robopoll, said that when he first answered the call it “didn’t have the more balanced question” about denying some people the option of marriage being discriminatory. “I was disappointed that whichever organisation is responsible for the robo-dial is spreading misinformation en masse – because the marriage plebiscite is simply about nothing other than allowing two people of the same sex to marry,” he said. “It has nothing to do with schools, it has nothing to do with kids, it’s a misinformation campaign.” The AMSRS, the market research professional body, said the survey “appears to be ‘push-polling’ – an activity that attempts to impart information to individuals rather than collect information from individuals”. “This practice is not genuine social research and runs contrary to the AMSRS code of professional behaviour and may contravene aspects of the Privacy Act (Australian privacy principles).” The AMSRS cited the code’s requirement that surveys be “honest and truthful” and the code and privacy principles’ requirements that researchers identify themselves and state the purpose of their research. Omnipoll partner and former Newspoll chief executive Martin O’Shannessy told Guardian Australia the poll may be an advertising agency “testing the efficacy of the two main messages of the campaign” because it offers two propositions with “one each way”. O’Shannessy said that surveys should always identify the sponsor as required by Australian Communications and Media Authority rules and it was “suspicious” this survey did not identify its source. “Where you only have one proposition and it’s very negative, that is prima facie evidence of a push poll. “[This survey] is a bit light on on one side, the yes vote side. But my gut is if it was a push poll it could’ve been worse.” The chief executive of Galaxy Research, David Briggs, said it was “very unlikely to be push-polling” and was more likely to be message-testing because the survey provided alternative arguments. “Asking biased or misleading questions isn’t necessarily push-polling, especially in a small sample and we don’t know how many have been exposed to this message,” he said. WPA Intelligence is not a member of the Association of Market and Social Research organisations or the Australian Market and Social Research Society. It bills itself as one of the top two Republican polling firms in the US and does work for Republican senator Ted Cruz. Guardian Australia contacted WPA Intelligence for comment. The phone number generating the call, a New South Wales or ACT-based landline, has already been reported by several users of the Should I Answer online forum who appeared confused about whether the poll encouraged responses for or against same-sex marriage. “I took the poll but am now not sure that I should have. It asked the same question three times and seemed to be push-polling but from both sides of the debate which I found to be strange,” reported one user called Milton. “Asking about Malcolm Turnbull ... very dodgy IMO [in my opinion],” said one user. “Harassing call to get details of how you vote in plebiscite. SSM [same-sex marriage] advocates continually attacking Australia people,” said another user. Claims that marriage equality will impact the gender education of children have been central to the no case, with the first Coalition for Marriage ad claiming schools will allow boys to wear dresses and compel students to role play same-sex relationships. Conservative opponents of marriage equality, including John Howard and Tony Abbott, argue that it poses a threat to religious freedom and freedom of speech. On Wednesday the Coalition will introduce a bill requiring campaign communications to be authorised and establishing protections against vilification, intimidation and threats against participants in public debate. Vilification based on a person’s sexuality, gender identity, intersex status, religious convictions or the views they hold or are perceived to hold about the survey will be banned. The bill contains remedies including injunctions and penalties of up to $12,600 for vilification, but limits who can bring a case to authorised campaign groups and gives the attorney general a gate-keeping power to reject cases seeking a penalty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/shortcuts/2017/sep/12/the-house-next-door-the-sad-truth-about-hillary-clintons-writing-room","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T13:41:32Z","webTitle":"The house next door: the sad truth about Hillary Clinton’s writing room \r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2017/sep/12/the-house-next-door-the-sad-truth-about-hillary-clintons-writing-room","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/shortcuts/2017/sep/12/the-house-next-door-the-sad-truth-about-hillary-clintons-writing-room","fields":{"headline":"The house next door: the sad truth about Hillary Clinton’s writing room \r\n","bodyText":"Name: The House Next Door Age: Built sometime in the 1970s. Appearance: Four bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom, single-level ranch-style house in a sleepy Chappaqua cul-de-sac. A Chappaqua cul-de-sac, you say? Yes. My unexpected but comprehensive knowledge of northern Westchester County, New York real estate tells me that is where the Clintons – one Bill, one Hillary – bought their house. You are correct. A house comprising 5,232 square feet of late-1800s, gambrel-roofed delight, set in an acre of expansive lawn ringed by mature trees, purchased for $1.7m (£1.28m) in late 1999, I believe, unless I am more mistaken than a Trump voter. Very impressive. But this is the one next door, which they bought for $1.16m in August 2016. Fancied a bit more room did they? Sort of. Hillary admitted in an interview with CBS this weekend that the second house was bought to accommodate White House staff and security when she ... you know ... Won the election? Yes. Has she burned it to the ground? You couldn’t blame her, but no. She says she doesn’t regret the purchase and used its dining room to write much of her new memoir, What Happened, an account of losing the presidency to Trump. Did she need long to scrawl “WTAF!?!” across a wodge of tear-and-blood-sodden pages? Again, you couldn’t blame her, but no – it’s a proper book. 512 pages from Simon &amp; Schuster. All typed, as Victoria Wood once said, loads of spelling. So she has some thoughts on the subject? One or two, yes. Such as? The current president being “the least experienced, least knowledgeable, least competent” in history and “a clear and present danger to the country and the world” whose inaugural address she heard as “a howl straight from the white nationalist gut”. Who does she blame? Herself, Comey, Russia, sexism, racism. Not necessarily in that order. Will she run again? Would you? Do say: “I was running a traditional presidential campaign with carefully thought-out policies and painstakingly built coalitions, while Trump was running a reality TV show that expertly and relentlessly stoked Americans’ anger and resentment. I was giving speeches laying out how to solve the country’s problems. He was ranting on Twitter.” Don’t say: “Sad!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/15/attica-locke-when-trump-was-elected-overnight-my-book-changed","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T13:01:08Z","webTitle":"Attica Locke: ‘When Trump was elected, overnight my book changed.

I didn’t alter a word’","bodyText":"‘I wrote the book primarily in 2016,” Attica Locke says of her new crime novel Bluebird, Bluebird, “so the rise of Donald Trump and of people feeling free to speak their white supremacist beliefs” had begun. The plot revolves around murders with a connection to the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas: “Are you talking about the Klan?” her hero, Darren Mathews, is asked. “Worse,” he replies: “It’s the Klan with money and semi-automatic weapons.” The politics of race saturate the suspenseful tale, which is the first in a series set in the near present day. “When Trump was elected,” Locke tells me, “I remember feeling: oh my God, overnight my book changed, and I didn’t alter a word.” Mathews, a Texas Ranger beset by difficulties but proud to wear the lone-star badge, is determined to investigate “homicides with a racial element – murders with a particularly ugly taint”. He reflects on the long history of racial prejudice his family has suffered and his recent hope that “change might trickle down from the White House”. But “in fact the opposite had proved to be true. In the wake of Obama, America had told on itself.” Locke has been forthright in her analysis of the discomfort many Americans felt having a black man as president: “A large segment of white folks … could not take that.” Interviewed hours after Trump’s election, she saw his victory “through the lens of race”, as a “backlash” to Obama. We talk in the wake of the violent events in Charlottesville, and Locke, who is from the south – she was born in Houston – maintains “there’s nothing surprising to me in what’s happening”. “Everything about Trump has led to #Charlottesville,” she tweeted. She notes the ubiquity of Confederate monuments – “there was a Robert E Lee high school where I grew up” – and believes it is “dangerous to have these relics of the past unquestioned and all around us … It’s laced into a child’s unconscious all the time, the region’s racist past”. In other words, “they are tools of white supremacy. They are there to fuck with your head.” “All of a sudden,” Locke says, Bluebird, Bluebird is “resonating in a way that I had not prepared myself for. I was just telling a story that I knew to be true about Texas, but I didn’t know it would speak to something larger.” For her, the most painful aspect of the Trump presidency is ‘realising that there’s no there there with America anymore. What I mean is: if it’s only a set of ideas, only an honour system in which we all follow laws and rules and codes of behaviour, and suddenly we just don’t, where’s the republic? … I don’t think I realised that nobody would come in to stop this absolute insanity, and get this person out. I didn’t realise the extent to which Republicans would so covet power that they would be willing to let this play out, because we’re in dangerous territory right now.” The novel is Locke’s fourth, and arrives after a spell of her writing for the enormously successful TV show Empire, the hip-hop music industry saga dubbed the “black Dynasty”. “I missed books, and I missed writing about Texas,” she says. She has lived in Los Angeles for many years, but is a great enthusiast for her home state, and owns a “very big” collection of cowboy boots. In the novel she has given Mathews a similar family history to her own: her people are “from towns along Highway 59, going back to slavery. We are the people who stayed.” Beginning in the second decade of the 20th century, “there was a great migration of black people leaving the south”. But despite segregation and “Klan terror”, “we set down roots”, she explains. “Part of that was to do with class – we owned land … we dared anyone to run us off.” Bluebird, Bluebird is, she has written, “a thriller and a character study, but it’s also, at heart, a love letter to black Texans and a thank you to the ones who raised me”. Locke’s family has an impressive history of public service going back generations, including the first black professor at the University of Texas, Austin, whose experience has helped form one character in the novel. Her mother’s maternal grandmother, who ran a roadside cafe where she cooked food for black travellers, was the direct inspiration for Geneva Sweet, who in Bluebird, Bluebird serves up fried pies and has blues records in her cafe’s ancient jukebox. Her tiny establishment is a kind of antipode to the white supremacist bar just down the highway, whose owner lives in a grand house built to resemble Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello. Two bodies are dragged from the bayou, one a black man, one a local white woman, and gradually Mathews unfolds a complex history of race, sex and miscegenation. Although Locke swore she would “never write a cop” – her novels Black Water Rising and Pleasantville both centre on a Houston lawyer, Jay Porter – she changed her mind for two reasons. First, she wanted her narrative to be set all along the highway – “a Texas Ranger ranges”. Mathews has a degree from Princeton but knows what it means “to stand on the land where your forefathers had forged your future out of dirt”. (Locke shows me a photo of her father, complete with cowboy hat, on the family land where her grandparents were born.) In writing her black hero as a high-status Ranger, Locke wanted to turn “the image of lone-star swagger on its head”. The other impetus came in the form of Jill Leovy’s influential study Ghettoside (2015), which tackled a “plague of murders” of black men in south Los Angeles, focusing on how little was done to solve the crimes, “It had a big impact on her “because it flipped the script of only considering the overpolicing of black life, and asked the reader to consider its underpolicing. Mathews was created as someone who could sit on the question: is the law something we can trust to protect us or is it something we need protecting from?” Locke has said: “I think I get away with a lot of political stuff because of the presence of a dead body. If you have familiar signposts along the way … readers get comfortable, and then you can slide in all this other material.” Her debut, the Orange prize-shortlisted Black Water Rising (which received plaudits from James Ellroy and Val McDermid among many others), was given an extra dimension thanks to the black activist background of her protagonist, the wary Porter. Both Locke’s parents were themselves in the “movement” at the turn of the 1970s – her father was an associate of Stokely Carmichael and was put on trial. Attica, born in 1974, was named after the 1971 prison riot: “The older I get the more I have an appreciation for my name, it’s almost a mission statement. It has instilled in me a sense of a base level of humanity we’re not supposed to go beneath.” Her parents divorced when she was young: their marriage, forged in “the excitement and sensuousness and heady intellectual atmosphere of the movement” petered out when the movement did. Her father became a prominent lawyer, her mother a successful businesswoman. “Part of why I wrote Black Water Rising,” Locke says, “is that I grew up with people who had a deep history, one that must have hurt because they didn’t talk about it. I was trying to get under the surface, to explore what it must have felt like to have done all of this amazing stuff at 19.” Locke was the first black student at an all-white elementary school, an “overwhelming” experience, and later would write stories on her father’s law-practice stationery, even trying to sell them to her high-school friends. But she “didn’t get serious as a writer until I got rejected as a movie director”. A fellow at the Sundance Institute, Locke aspired to be the next Spike Lee, but though she secured a movie deal, with a story similar to Bluebird, Bluebird, the studio pulled the plug, on the grounds that the film had a black lead but also white characters, and the “world isn’t interested in the rural black south”. “I felt despair,” she recalls. “Back then there was no business model for who I was.” Her response was to become a Hollywood screenwriter, highly paid and sought after, though “nothing ever got made. It was almost like the old studio system … This was a time when sequels and superhero movies were starting to ramp up, and I was writing political thrillers and character-based stories. It was fake success, money success. I got disillusioned and walked away.” The cash at least enabled her to put her husband, a public defender, through law school. They met at university, when she was 17. “At first sight, I couldn’t stand him,” she laughs. “He was so weird. He was white. I was a sweet little girl, and he was this guy with long hair, leather jacket, earrings, and he reeked of cigarette smoke. He was so smug! But over time I started noticing things about him that made me question my initial judgment. When we had to make a documentary, he spent a night on the streets of Chicago with a homeless man.” There was no doubt about the kind of fiction Locke would write: she was always drawn to crime. “I have always been fascinated by the question: why do they think they’re going to get away with it? And the woman in me wants to play these things out in order to feel some mastery and control over a world in which I’m shorter than 50% of the population. I’m scared of everything. But also I think that in essence every novel is a crime novel – crimes of the heart, moral crimes. It’s all about how we deal with different types of scarcity: money, love …” When she finally decided on the subject matter of her first novel, she felt she had “come home … I had shown up as my true self, because when I was a screenwriter, I was frequently praised for being ‘of no colour’; I did what I was asked to do; I didn’t have an identity. With Black Water Rising I vividly remember sitting on the floor of a hotel room and crying: I knew that I was about to announce to the world that I’m black. Which seems dumb, cos … duh! But what I was saying to the world was: I’m not incidentally black. My worldview is black, it’s who I am; there will no longer be any kind of apology for it.” Locke’s second novel, The Cutting Season, was set on a plantation with slavery in its past and immigrant exploitation in its present; Pleasantville was written in response to witnessing her father’s campaign to become mayor of Houston – “one of the most painful experiences of my life”, due to dirty dealing on the part of his opponents and the local press. The subject-matter suited a return of Porter as the hero. When asked why three of her novels have had male protagonists, Locke has been adamant: “When you’re going through life as a black woman and some weird shit goes down, I don’t go to gender first, I go right to race … I am black before I’m a woman.” Locke points out that one of the pleasures of being a writer on Empire was “the lack of a ‘white gaze’”. She was drawn to its theme “of what happens to a family that is wealthy but has no training in generational wealth, which is a particular black thing. That’s a Beyoncé story.” She adds that “everything I was trying to do in movies 20 years ago has moved to TV: it’s where the complex characters are. I really can’t quantify how much fun it was.” Just when her writing contract could have been lucratively renewed, after three seasons, Locke has, however, taken the decision to withdraw from the show, which is far more “soap-operatic” than when it first began. More important, in writing for the show, she felt too far away from “my actual voice”. Her novels give Locke “a feeling of connectedness to who I fundamentally am” – she is inseparably bound to Texas, with all its “wild contradictions”. On a recent trip to research the second Darren Mathews novel, she stayed in a cabin near Caddo Lake, on the border with Louisiana. “I was too chicken to stay by myself, with, frankly, a bunch of rednecks, so I asked my dad to come with me. And I asked him to bring a gun. I detest guns, and from my point of view, the question is: ‘What do you need guns for?’ But for my dad and my grandmother, who is”, she chuckles, “ also quite armed, they are thinking about the Klan. “With the exception of one town, where I felt an incredible tension, everybody was warm and engaging,” she recalls. “Yet I knew I was standing in Trump country and that these people had just voted to keep white supremacy in place. They didn’t see a hypocrisy in that. It was bothersome. It was frightening – that this might go so much deeper and might be so much harder to extricate.” Locke’s daughter, Clara, was visiting her grandparents in Houston when Hurricane Harvey struck, and the novelist pays tribute to the “regular citizens who made all the difference: offering their boats, rescuing strangers, offering their homes, their stores for shelter.” She also suggests that “one day when the waters recede, Houston will have to contend with its love affair and addiction to industrial growth. It will be a hard look in the mirror.” The hurricane is the latest chapter in her family’s long Texan story. Locke becomes visibly emotional when she re-emphasises how much of her own heritage has been folded into Bluebird, Bluebird. The book – “it’s so personal, I can’t really articulate it” – is dedicated to her ancestors, “men and women who said no”. The state depicted in the novel may feature huge images of Trump, a cafe called Kay’s Kountry Kitchen (the initials are a “flagrant act of microaggression”) and “white nationalism” growing like fungus in the “social media swamp”. But Ranger Mathews refuses to leave. “They don’t get to decide what this place is,” he says. “This is my home, too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/17/eco-guide-to-ancient-grains","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"The eco guide to ancient grains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/17/eco-guide-to-ancient-grains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/17/eco-guide-to-ancient-grains","fields":{"headline":"The eco guide to ancient grains","bodyText":"If you find the whole business of organic too tame, there’s always landrace crops, which are positively subversive. Landrace crop varieties (sometimes known as folk crops) are ancient versions of the standardised crops we rely on today. Genetically variable, these biodiverse cultivars are allowed to grow at will and to cross pollinate. Farmers collect the seeds from successful crops and these become the parents of next year’s varieties. Simple. If this sounds primitive (it is in fact Neolithic), it makes much more sense than modern agriculture, which is reliant on selective breeds that are addicted to fertilisers. The idea is that the selective breeds give the highest yield when conditions are good. This is a terrible strategy in an era of climate change when conditions are not ideal. Modern agriculture has wiped out almost all original genetic diversity. Ancient cultivars of wheat are used for straw or shoved into seed banks. Proponents of the Real Green Movement want them released into the soil. In the UK it would be tough to live on odd, old grains alone – we lack diversity. In fact the Plant Variations and Seeds Act of 1964 makes it legally pretty hard to grow anything but standardised crops. But pioneers are pushing forward. These include gin makers, the Oxford Artisan Distillery (surprisingly Oxford’s first licensed distillery) committed to total provenance and sourcing all ingredients from a 50-mile radius. Their grain, an ancient rye, is from a farm in Thame, grown especially for them. This is a hyper-local product which makes an active contribution to biodiversity – world’s away from the industrial alcohol bought in by most distillers. From mother’s ruin to saviour of the planet. The big picture: mangrove forest communities We are hooked on dramatic events. So the steady cascading effect of climate change on lives and ecosystems gets little attention.

Good table manners? It would have been nice if he’d offered to share his food. I thought this was a given for tapas. Best thing about Jeremy? He made me laugh a lot. Would you introduce him to your friends? Sure – I just don’t know how much they would have in common. Describe him in three words Open, amiable, fun. What do you think he made of you? I hope he found my company enjoyable. Did you go on somewhere? It was never on the cards, really. And… did you kiss? Nope. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I would have ordered more food. Marks out of 10? 6. Would you meet again? I don’t think so. Jeremy on Josie What were you hoping for? Some chemistry. First impressions? Down-to-earth and chatty. What did you talk about? Cooking, travel and London. I tried not to bore her with my work, as it can be a bit geeky. Any awkward moments? Not from my side, no. Good table manners? Naturally. We both kept our phones away from the table. Best thing about Josie? Her clear sense of adventure, in travelling so much. Would you introduce her to your friends? I wouldn’t have any issue with that. Describe her in three words Natural, genuine, smiley. What do you think she made of you? Hopefully polite and well-mannered. Perhaps occasionally funny, too. Did you go on somewhere? No. And… did you kiss? Just a polite one on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I’d maybe have a mojito. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? The spark wasn’t really there. • Josie and Jeremy ate at Dehesa, London W1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.

As eight-year-old foragers, we had found a cluster of mushrooms under a tree in the wild untended bit at the bottom of the garden. Seeing no red cap or alarming spots, we deemed them edible and picked them. We had also found a handful of blackberries and something suitably herby, so we put all three in warm water, stirred, then fed our soup to Ben behind the sofa. Ben went yellow and cried for mum, who asked us calmly what we had done while her eyes gave away her pure and absolute panic. It turned out they were only mildly nauseating, and Ben was fine. The adults, though, were not. So traumatised were they that they didn’t even shout. Instead, we were given the most earnest talking to. Did we know how serious this was? Had we any idea what could have happened? I did. Despite our sibling rivalry, I did not want to murder my younger brother; a crime sure to make the front of the local paper. We were made to promise we would never pick mushrooms again. As yet, I haven’t. I know a man who does, though. At this time of year, as autumn seeps slowly into the air and I celebrate my birthday, I hope to get a call from a friend telling me her dad has been on one of his quiet and determined hunts in the chestnut woods just outside Rome. The Boletus edulis, or porcini, arrive wrapped in a cloth, their swollen stems like fat babies’ legs, their caps the colour of ruddy chestnuts. The flesh is quite unique – thick and nutty with a rich, almost custard-like quality about it, which is why they are so good when fried or grilled. Porcini dry beautifully, and make superb wild gifts preserved and stored in packets ready to be soaked back to life, and give flavour and moral support to meals or cultivated mushrooms. Despite the sofa incident, I am very fond of mushroom soup, especially the Jane Grigson/Elizabeth David recipe, also mushroom risotto and anchovy, and mushroom eggs. For all these recipes, I use cultivated mushrooms, bolstering with wild when I can, either fresh or from a packet. A favourite way to prepare mushrooms, though, both wild and tame, is to fry them in a mixture of olive oil and butter, along with garlic and plenty of finely chopped herbs. It is a straightforward way, but one that seems to bring out the flavour and texture of mushrooms most beautifully. It is a dish for the whole year, but autumn is when it seems most appropriate, as cooking slows down, and the olive oil rich dishes of the summer demand a little butter. Or in this case, a lot of butter! Mushrooms take and give: soaking up fat, but then giving back in the form of intensely flavoured gravy, which you can reduce. Mushrooms prepared this way are delicious on toast, but also stirred through pasta for an extremely satisfying and tasty supper dish. The ideal pasta for these mushrooms is pappardelle – wide ribbons of fresh egg pasta that cook into an almost fabric-like silkiness and so wrap themselves around pieces of mushroom while collecting buttery sauce and flecks of herbs. Alternatively, tagliatelle works well, too. In either case, homemade – I use 100g of flour and one egg per person – or dried pasta both work. If you are lucky enough to know how to forage, collect as many edible varieties as you can. Alternatively, buy a selection of cultivated mushrooms – button, chestnut, oyster – and bolster with a packet of dried porcini. In their recipe for mushroom pasta, Oretta Zanini De Vita and Maureen B Fant note the herbs should remind you of being lost in the woods, and suggest a mixture of parsley, thyme and oregano, which do indeed seem like somewhere wild and bosky rising up out of the pan. They also describe mushrooming in autumn in Italy, the quiet clamber on inhospitable slopes, the torn skin and clothing that arise from getting the best specimens. I like these words around a recipe, they remind me of my own childhood adventure – however misguided – and make me wonder if this is the year I might try mushroom hunting again. Pasta with mushrooms and herbs Serves 4 25g dried porcini 800g mushrooms, mixed varieties, wild or cultivated 4 tbsp olive oil 120g butter 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped Salt and black pepper Parsley, oregano and thyme, finely chopped 450g dried long pasta (ideally pappardelle or tagliatelle) Parmesan, grated 1 Soak the porcini in warm water for 30 minutes, then drain, reserving the liquid. Clean the other mushrooms by brushing away any mud and then wiping the cap and stem with a damp cloth. Cut all the cleaned mushrooms into slices; not too thin. Put a large pan of well-salted water on to boil in preparation for cooking the pasta. 2 In a large frying pan, heat the oil and butter. Once the butter is foaming gently, add the garlic and fry for a few minutes. Add the porcini and cook for another minute to combine the flavours. Add the fresh mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5–6 minutes, or until the mushrooms have released their water and are tender and glistening. Add a little of the porcini liquid and let it all bubble for another minute to reduce, then sprinkle with the herbs. 3 Meanwhile, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain and toss with the mushrooms. Divide between bowls and serve, passing around grated cheese for those who want it.

I patronised good coffee bars and knew my espresso from my macchiato; I drank decent coffee at home, too, albeit (I blush) from a Nespresso machine. But my appreciation of the stuff was all about the intensity and caffeine hit, and I now look back (with more blushes) at being offered filter coffee in a bar and thinking, “Why on Earth would I want to drink that?” That’s because I’ve seen the light, and it’s as if I’d spent my wine career drinking Napa cabernet sauvignon and never tried a good red burgundy. What I discovered on a fascinating home barista workshop at Extract Coffee in Bristol (£80, and a great Christmas present for coffee-lovers) is that power isn’t everything. To appreciate coffee from different origins, you need temporarily to abandon your espresso habit. The simple piece of kit you need is a V60 drip coffee maker (easier and less messy than a cafetière). Ideally, you also need a grinder, because ground coffee starts to deteriorate the moment you open the packet (within hours, let alone weeks), so it pays to grind your own (a hand grinder is better than a cheap electric one, too). That said, there are some interesting ground coffees out there, provided you can get through them quickly enough. Waitrose has a particularly good range: try its Sumatra Mandheling, a rich, dark, almost chocolatey coffee that is both organic and Fairtrade (£3.50 for 227g). The downside is that supermarkets tend to claim that their ground coffees are suitable for all appliances, whereas, for the best results, you need a different grind depending on which type you use. (That’s one reason to get your coffee ground to order at a specialist shop.) You’ll fairly rapidly discover you have a taste for certain types of coffee – it turns out I like the fresh acidity and fruitiness of East African coffee from Ethiopia and Rwanda. Even Kenyan coffee, which I’d never been grabbed by, can be a revelation: Extract’s dazzling Rukera AB (£10.25 for 250g) is part of an experimental project run by the Coffee Research Institute of Kenya, and it’s fascinatingly different from Union Hand-Roasted’s, darker, more deeply flavoured Ethiopian Yayu Wild Forest coffee (Waitrose, £4.50 for 200g). (See how rapidly I’ve become a coffee geek?) The best idea is to sign up to some kind of subscription plan – most online roasters offer one (Union Roasted and Has Bean both have good ones) – so you can explore different countries and regions. You may never need an espresso again. matchingfoodandwine.com • Fiona Beckett’s latest book, Wine Lover’s Kitchen: Delicious Recipes For Cooking With Wine, is published on 10 October by Ryland Peters &amp; Small at £16.99.

In a keynote speech ahead of negotiations between the main parties represented in the Stormont assembly, the former first minister of Northern Ireland told the DUP ruling executive on Thursday night that despite holding the balance of power at Westminster her party was still committed to bringing back the regional government in Belfast. But the DUP leader insisted she did not regard the Irish language as a threat to the union or her Britishness. Sinn Féin has insisted it will not go back into a power-sharing government with the DUP unless a stand-alone Irish language act, which would put the Irish language on an equal par in law to English, is agreed during talks aimed at restoring devolution. On what is now emerging as the key roadblock to progress in the talks, Foster said: “We have nothing to fear from the Irish language nor is it any threat to the union. We have previously supported practical measures for the Irish language and we will do so again if we can reach a wider agreement on these matters. However what we cannot and will not do is simply to agree to one-sided demands. “I have also heard from those within the unionist community who hear others speaking about respect while at the same time they engage in a campaign to denigrate and demonise any and all aspects of our British identity in Northern Ireland or insult the Ulster Scots community. This is not acceptable.” Foster called for a “new cultural deal”, which she said would provide a comprehensive and long-term approach to the sensitive issue of identity in Northern Ireland. The DUP’s 10 MPs are critical in terms of propping up Theresa May’s minority Conservative government in parliament. However, on Thursday Foster stressed the DUP was still fully committed to bringing back devolved government to Northern Ireland despite its new power at Westminster. She said the DUP was in favour of bringing forward legislation to address cultural and language matters but added that there were more pressing issues. Foster said: “That’s not me saying that language or culture isn’t important. To me – and to many – they just should not have a greater priority than health or education or the economy. But I understand and appreciate the need to deal with matters of culture and language in a mature way that aims to engender real respect for the multitude of cultures that coexist in Northern Ireland today.” The DUP leader also defended the £1bn-plus deal that the party made with the Tories in June in order to put May back into 10 Downing Street. She said: “Some who sought to undermine us from the start said that we would selfishly pursue party interests in our discussions with the Conservative party. Instead, we secured a financial package worth £1.5bn that is intended to boost our economy, rebuild our infrastructure, help reform our NHS and will be to the benefit of everyone, everywhere in Northern Ireland. “While the new parliamentary arithmetic delivers a measure of influence it does not change our fundamental belief in Northern Ireland shaping its own destiny. I want to see devolution restored immediately.” Foster’s broad hint at all-encompassing legislation to promote not only the Irish language but also Ulster Scots and Orange culture is likely to be opposed by Sinn Féin. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Féin president, has repeated his party’s demand for a stand-alone act only covering the rights of Irish speakers in Northern Ireland. He said: “The British government and unionist parties have failed to fulfil their commitment to an acht na Gaeilge (Irish language act) and to the full implementation of the Good Friday and St Andrews agreements. “Implementation of these matters must be a bedrock of any future executive. Equality must be a bedrock for any future executive. The rights of Irish speakers must be recognised and respected.” Foster referred to Adams’s recent comments about his scepticism that power-sharing could be restored. She said: “I want to see devolution restored immediately and we are working to that end. But, as we all know, Sinn Féin has built a barrier to the return of Stormont, and as I indicated earlier in the summer, I question whether Sinn Féin is serous about wanting to see an early return of Stormont. That is not an unreasonable question given some of the recent comments from Gerry Adams.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/31/phil-jones-two-game-uefa-ban-europa-final-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T21:30:26Z","webTitle":"Phil Jones claims he was harshly treated with two-game ban after Europa final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/31/phil-jones-two-game-uefa-ban-europa-final-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/31/phil-jones-two-game-uefa-ban-europa-final-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Phil Jones claims he was harshly treated with two-game ban after Europa final","bodyText":"Phil Jones has denied directing foul and abusive language at a doping control officer after the Europa League final last season and said the two-game ban imposed by Uefa was harsh, although he opted not to appeal. The Manchester United defender, an unused substitute in the final against Ajax in May, and Daley Blind had been selected to undergo post-match drug tests in Stockholm, with Jones infuriated at missing a dressing-room squad photograph being taken to pay tribute to those affected by the Manchester terror attack that had taken place two days earlier. Jones was banned for two European matches – the first of which he served in the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid in August – and fined £4,600. Although Jones admitted using abusive language and apologised for swearing, he denies directly abusing the official. “Anyone can understand that, in a situation like that, maybe there was language that was inappropriate, but it definitely wasn’t direct to the official himself,” said the defender, who has been one of United’s most impressive performers this season. “I definitely didn’t look him in his eye and say that he was a this and that. Looking back on it now, did I deserve a fine? Possibly. But a two-game ban is a bit out of the ordinary.” Jones and Blind had been made aware by the team doctor they had been selected for doping control after around 75 minutes of the final. “That was not a problem, fine by me, I’ve done it many times before,” he said. “I went into the doping control room straight after the game and wasn’t allowed into the changing room, which is fine as well. Usually you go in [to the doping control room], you sign, you get your chaperone so they can see what you’re doing, then you can go back into the changing room, get your mobile phone and whatever, get a drink, come back in, but that wasn’t the case. “It’s not as if we had just won the Mickey Mouse league. We had won the Europa League. I’m sure anyone can understand you work so hard all year round to win a prestige competition like that, [and then] someone says you can’t celebrate with your team. We had planned to do the banner for the Manchester attacks. It is quite close to us considering we are a Manchester team but it wasn’t to be. I fully complied with rules and did my urine sample, did my blood sample, and ended up with a two-game ban. I could understand that if I hadn’t complied with the rules, but I did. It’s slightly harsh. You see players go in for leg-breaking challenges and they get a one- or a two-game ban.” José Mourinho shared the player’s dismay at the extent of the sanction but the United manager left it to Jones to decide whether to appeal in the knowledge Uefa could impose a harsher penalty. Jones had hoped to delay the sanction so he could play against Real but landed with the United team in Skopje to discover “Uefa had sent an email saying it was a no-go”. He will complete his ban in the club’s opening Champions League group game, which is against Basel at Old Trafford on 12 September. “I 100% understand the significance of the job [performed by the anti-doping control officers] and I fully complied with the rules,”Jones said. “I did my urine and my blood, I was in and out in 30 minutes … They asked if I wanted to leave any comments and I said no. I walked out of the room and I am sure they have seen far worse in their time. I have seen far worse and nothing has happened. It’s done now, I have got the one-game ban [still to serve] and I will do that and look forward to the Champions League. I’ve moved on.” Blind, who played the full game against Ajax, did feature in the post-match photograph and was accompanied by a chaperone in some of the team’s celebrations, but was fined £4,600 for failing to report to doping control immediately after the game. He escaped a ban because Uefa ruled he had not used foul language towards the anti-doping officer. Both players tested negative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/aug/31/scottish-labour-campaign-for-socialism-jeremy-corbyn-kezia-dugdale-anas-sarwar-richard-leonard","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T18:14:48Z","webTitle":"Corbynites in Scottish Labour call for 'comradely' leadership battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/31/scottish-labour-campaign-for-socialism-jeremy-corbyn-kezia-dugdale-anas-sarwar-richard-leonard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/aug/31/scottish-labour-campaign-for-socialism-jeremy-corbyn-kezia-dugdale-anas-sarwar-richard-leonard","fields":{"headline":"Corbynites in Scottish Labour call for 'comradely' leadership battle","bodyText":"An influential pro-Corbyn group inside the Scottish Labour party has urged its supporters to avoid a civil war in the contest to succeed Kezia Dugdale. The Campaign for Socialism has called for a “comradely, respectful and constructive” contest, which has been triggered by Dugdale’s surprise resignation on Tuesday as leader of the Scottish party after two years in the post. The race to succeed her is now expected to be between only two candidates: Anas Sarwar, a centrist and former deputy leader of Scottish Labour; and Richard Leonard, a respected but little known trade unionist first elected to Holyrood in May 2016. Widely seen as the favourite, Sarwar is understood to be on the brink of confirming his candidacy. But senior party figures fear his declaration may open up divisions on the left of the party, because of Sarwar’s wealth and his political history. In a clear warning that activists needed to avoid damaging the party’s chances of winning future elections, the CfS said in a statement that it “looks forward to an engaging and compelling showcase of our party’s potential in the weeks to come … It is vitally important that Scottish Labour party members unite behind the winner of that contest in order that we can continue on the road to government for the many, not the few”. Leonard, an experienced organiser with the GMB trade union and a specialist in industrial and economic policy, is under significant pressure to become a standard bearer for the left after Neil Findlay, the most prominent pro-Corbyn MSP at Holyrood, ruled himself out of the contest. Leonard is very likely to be backed by the CfS, giving him access to a substantial campaign organisation, and is thought highly likely to gain the five signatures needed from Scottish Labour’s 32 MSPs, MPs and MEPs to qualify as a candidate. The CfS, which is the Scottish equivalent to Momentum, the pro-Corbyn group inside the UK Labour party, was formed in 1994 to combat moves by Tony Blair, then leader of the UK party, to scrap the party’s commitment to public ownership in clause four of its constitution. Sarwar, the son of the UK’s first Muslim MP, Mohammad Sarwar, was educated at Hutcheson’s grammar, a private school in Glasgow now attended by his children. The Herald newspaper reported on Thursday that his stake in the family’s wholesale food business may be worth up to £5m. Attacked by critics as a Blairite, Sarwar’s greatest challenge, according to party sources, is gaining the support of members on the left after he signed an open letter last year attacking Corbyn’s leadership. Labour sources say Sarwar has now withdrawn that letter privately and has won over Corbyn’s allies at Holyrood, but faces a challenge to secure support across all wings of the party. Senior figures in the centre and left of the party are desperate to avoid Scottish Labour being split by the factional conflicts that tore the Westminster parliamentary party apart last year, so far avoided by the party at Holyrood. Sarwar is expected to launch his leadership bid within days, after an away-day meeting for Labour MSPs on Friday. The party’s Scottish executive committee is meeting on 9 September to decide on the timings of the contest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/01/i-cant-tell-my-best-friend-im-gay-as-he-is-a-straight-man-who-has-romantic-feelings-for-me","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T11:19:00Z","webTitle":"I can’t tell my best friend I’m gay as he is a straight man who has romantic feelings for me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/01/i-cant-tell-my-best-friend-im-gay-as-he-is-a-straight-man-who-has-romantic-feelings-for-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/01/i-cant-tell-my-best-friend-im-gay-as-he-is-a-straight-man-who-has-romantic-feelings-for-me","fields":{"headline":"I can’t tell my best friend I’m gay as he is a straight man who has romantic feelings for me","bodyText":"I am a woman in my mid-20s and my best friend is a straight man.

Robert McCrum’s Every Third Thought: On Life, Death and the Endgame is “proof, yet again, that death makes for lively reading”, wrote Maggie Fergusson in the Spectator; “witty, companionable and compulsively readable … [bringing] evidence that however bleak, however short the time left, it is never too late to be surprised by joy”. The Sunday Times’s John Carey admitted that it “might sound pretty dismal, but McCrum’s investigative spirit takes hold of the narrative and keeps pathos at bay … this is a brave book”, and even Andrew Marr (like McCrum, a stroke survivor), who “worried that [the book] might be unremittingly bleak”, was “encouraged and fortified” in the Mail on Sunday. In the New Statesman, Kirsty Gunn found it a “beautifully contemplative account of what it means to be dying, as we all are, in the midst of life … There is not a single story that he tells, no matter how grave, that is not made joyous by the fine attention of his writing and its judicious and intelligent use of quotation and literary and scientific material.” Reviewers were equally moved by Maggie O’Farrell’s I Am, I Am, I Am, a memoir of her 17 brushes with death – from childhood illness to an encounter with a murderer on a remote hilltop. “Each chapter is an accomplished piece of memoir-writing in its own right. The cumulative effect is extraordinary and I felt my understanding of what it means to be a human and a mother grew,” wrote Cathy Rentzenbrink in the Times. “Where other writers may be playing with paper, O’Farrell takes up a bow and arrow and aims at the human heart.” It was “ingenious and original … a rich celebration of every breath O’Farrell’s taken”, according to Lucy Scholes in the Independent and “extraordinary … uncomfortable and compelling – a page-turner … fluent, poised and packed with colourful details” according to Kate Kellaway in the Observer. In the Irish Times, Claire Kilroy hailed it as “electric … [it] should be read by everyone working with sick children … By stripping herself of the storytelling apparatus of her novels – or perhaps by applying that storytelling apparatus directly to her life – O’Farrell has arrived at something more affecting: wise, terrifying, vital and important.” James Kelman’s ninth collection, That Was a Shiver, and Other Stories, did not disappoint. The Observer’s Natasha Tripney praised his “considerable facility for voice” while the Daily Mail’s Eithne Farry enjoyed the characters’ “interior dialogues, recited in a brilliantly realised Scottish vernacular”. “Some of them are bleak, but not all; there are some moments of joy,” wrote the Scotsman’s Allan Massie. “Kelman has always been a true and honest writer, which is why he is one of the fairly few who really matter.” In the Irish Independent, the collection’s darkness was a strength. “These little nuggets are more like philosophical essays about what it means to be alive. Or, seen from another angle, what it means to be on a slow road to death,” wrote JP O’Malley. “Kelman’s vision of the world is bleak – but redemption is forthcoming … Uncompromising in vision, and yet strangely adaptable in style and content, Kelman’s harsh tales of dirty realism have sympathy for how suffering is a central component of the human condition. This collection shows a writer who is still at the top of his game, brimming with creativity, vitality and artistic integrity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/01/coming-out-kezia-dugdale-homophobic-fear-of-rejection-gay-shame-lgbt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"Think coming out is easy nowadays?

Then ask Kezia Dugdale","bodyText":"Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, says she was outed as gay by a magazine last year. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire show on BBC2, Dugdale said that she had frequently been asked about her sexuality and always answered honestly – but then would ask the journalist not to print the comments. All respected her wishes until an interview in the Fabian Review last year revealed her same-sex relationship. The author of the interview says that Dugdale never asked her not to publish. I can understand the confusion a publication might face. The cultural narrative is that being gay is no longer something to be ashamed of. So it wouldn’t seem unreasonable to ask a politician in an interview about their partner and then to think it strange that she wouldn’t want it printed. I faced a similar issue when I hosted a discussion with the leads from a gay-themed film recently. I thought it was relevant to ask how their personal experience informed their performances, but realised I couldn’t presume that they would be happy to publicly state that they were gay, straight or bi. Frustrating, but fair enough. This all highlights the contradictions of where we are at the moment. If being gay is more and more accepted and gay people so proud, surely everyone can just be open about it? In reality, coming out is still scary. It’s true that prejudice still exists. The minister Alan Duncan said on Derbyshire’s show that he believed that being the first Tory MP to come out had cost him a promotion. Even today figures such as Owen Jones receive a ton of homophobic online abuse. But times are less homophobic than ever. Dugdale was “fascinated” by the fact that the public was more interested in her partner’s political rather than sexual orientation. In other words, she thought her sexuality was more of an issue than it was, which shows, perhaps, that the bigger issue is perhaps how gay people feel about it themselves. Some gay people accept their sexuality easily and go off into the world to live authentic and successful lives. But for many of us, the journey is more complicated. As children, we all want to fit in. When LGBT kids start to realise there is something fundamentally different about them, many literally can’t cope and subconsciously bury those feelings. Some “split” their awareness, presenting one acceptable part of themselves to the world and keeping the other hidden: as if the gay part only exists in secret, and cannot cause people to reject them. In other words, we hide who we are. Coming out is hard not because of other people failing to accept our true selves, but because it means we have to accept ourselves. Telling the world what once was a terrifying secret will always be a moment of extreme vulnerability that connects us back to teenage feelings of “Am I good enough? … Is it OK to be who I am? … Will I be rejected? Will people still love me?”. Dealing with this legacy of gay shame is the next frontier for the LGBT community. I have no doubt that it is behind the higher levels of addiction, depression and suicide that our community lives with. Significant numbers of gay/bi men who seek help for “chemsex” problems still struggle with these questions. It might not fit the “gay pride” narrative but it is the reality. Underneath the drug use, many – sometimes in their 30s or 40s – still present saying “I’m not good enough … It’s not OK to be who I am … I deserve to be rejected…I am not lovable”. The psychologist and writer Alan Downs addresses this issue in his books, as do I – and recent films have too. Both Moonlight and the heartbreakingly beautiful new film God’s Own Country (in cinemas from today) are about gay men who have shut down their ability to feel. In Moonlight, Chiron beefs up and loses himself in performed masculinity. In God’s Own Country, Johnny, a Yorkshire farmer, drowns his inability to connect in alcohol, something I did for 20 years. It is something therapists all over the world will recognise. It’s easy to scoff at the athlete Colin Jackson coming out later in life, or to think it odd that Dugdale might not have been comfortable with revealing her sexuality. But we must understand that accepting being gay is not as simple as just having some food preference, or being left- or right-handed. People can only do it in their own time. If we can address these issues, then more and more people will feel that being themselves is nothing to be scared of. • Matthew Todd is a former editor of Attitude magazine and the author of Straight Jacket: How to Be Gay and Happy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/31/victims-culture-wars-muslim-fostering-row","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T18:46:47Z","webTitle":"The Muslim fostering row is a culture war in action | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/victims-culture-wars-muslim-fostering-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/victims-culture-wars-muslim-fostering-row","fields":{"headline":"The Muslim fostering row is a culture war in action","bodyText":"Wherever there is war there is invariably propaganda. Conflict feeds on half-truths, twisted out of shape; on myths and misinformation, and sometimes downright lies. The challenge for reporters is to pick through all these competing versions of the truth, in places where emotions run high and facts are hard to prove. And that is becoming as true of the culture wars now gripping Britain and the US as it always was of conventional battlefields. A little white Christian girl is taken from her London home and fostered by a niqab-wearing Muslim mother who doesn’t speak English. The cross around this five-year-old’s neck is supposedly snatched away and she is denied her favourite food, spaghetti carbonara, because it contains bacon. The clear and inflammatory inference of the Times’s exclusive story this week was that a child’s identity was being heinously erased while a council unwilling to confront religious intolerance – at least, when perpetrated by Muslims – stood back and let it happen. True, the paper glossed suspiciously quickly over why the child was taken from the birth family in the first place. But the story was apparently based on leaked official reports, and written by the same fine reporter who meticulously exposed the scandal of child-grooming gangs across Britain. MPs demanded something be done. Commentators piled in. The far right had a field day. Finally, the Times reported that a judge had intervened and sent the little girl to live with her grandmother, for all the world as if its reporting had saved the day. And it is only thanks to that judge’s published ruling that we now know how much of this was either grossly misleading or plain untrue. Far from Islam being scarily alien to her, the grandparents of little AB (as she is known to the court) are of Muslim heritage, if non-practising. The foster family did speak English – unsurprisingly, since it’s a requirement of being approved to foster – and it was the child’s grandmother who actually needed a translator. Tower Hamlets always wanted relatives to take her if possible, but had her fostered while the grandmother was checked out; when the report came back positive, the judge effectively rubber-stamped the decision. Although little can be said with confidence about spaghetti carbonara, a court-appointed guardian asked to investigate the birth mother’s complaints found that AB was “settled and well cared for”. And even if half of what was alleged was true, it should be weighed against the potential danger she faced at home. (She was taken into care after police intervened; her birth mother is reportedly an alcoholic and possibly a cocaine addict.) It would be lovely if every child could find the perfect family but, given a national shortage of foster carers, sometimes it’s all councils can do to get them somewhere safe. There’s a scandal here all right, but not the one you think. Mistakes do happen, sometimes to good journalists, and it ill behoves any of us to get on our high horse. Reporting on children in care, or in hospital, or in custody battles, is incredibly tricky because you only really get one side of the story; constrained by a legal duty of confidentiality to the child, professionals can’t disclose much even if they want to, which makes it devilishly difficult to know who is telling the truth. Even abusive parents often desperately miss their children, who in turn may beg to go home even when it could literally be the death of them. But that’s precisely why caution is needed, and doubly so when a newspaper is playing with fire. For this isn’t just about fostering, any more than recent events in Charlottesville were about removing a statue. Both stories tap into the fears of a white majority that feels its privileged status slipping away, and is suddenly terrified of being treated as it often treated minorities in the past; of having its identity erased. If a Muslim girl had been fostered by a Christian family who wouldn’t cook halal food, doubtless some of those raging at this story would have bent over backwards to argue that at least it’s better than whatever hell the child was rescued from, that you can’t expect miracles, that after all this is a Christian country. But when a white child is the supposed victim – well, that’s different. What makes the Tower Hamlets story so titillating for some readers is the idea of little Christian children in east London being forcibly subjugated by Muslims, which evokes both an age-old racist trope and a contemporary fear among Europeans under attack from Islamic State. Even if every word were true, which it clearly isn’t, the story would have needed handling responsibly. For when this nebulous anxiety about identity finds something concrete to cling to, the consequences can be serious. Charlottesville ended in the death of a young woman. If Great Ormond Street hospital staff got death threats following reporting of the Charlie Gard case, imagine what might be spewed at Tower Hamlets staff in the next few days. The facts will never, ever catch up with the headlines, at least for those who get their news chiefly from far-right Facebook pages. And what makes it doubly frustrating is that there are legitimate concerns about looked-after children in sore need of exploring. Fostering is tough, draining work – and work is the right word. Foster carers aren’t just kindly earth mothers with a room to spare, but trained people increasingly doing the job of professionals, working round the clock with children who can be violent or inappropriately sexual, or have witnessed unspeakable things; children who might arrive with only a few hours’ notice, distressed and confused and with little more than a change of clothes, after being forcibly removed from home in the middle of the night. It’s basically a full-time job that pays a pittance, and the resulting shortage of recruits does raise questions over the quality of service councils can realistically provide. The trouble with culture wars, and the immense pressure they create to take a side and stick to it, is that thoughtful discussion of difficult questions goes out the window. The idea of a foster carer hidden behind a veil, even if only when she’s outside the house, will make many people uneasy. Some kids doubtless wouldn’t bat an eyelid at a niqab, but for their own survival children from violent homes can sometimes become hyper-vigilant to adult emotions. Might they find it unnerving not to be able to read a stranger’s face quickly? But broadly speaking, Sir Martin Narey, former chief executive of the children’s charity Barnardo’s and author of a forthcoming government report on fostering, is surely right that skin colour and religion don’t matter all that much when matching kids to loving families, “so long as the carers are sensitive to the child’s cultural, religious or other needs”. What matters is attracting enough flexible, conscientious people into fostering to cater for whatever children need. Cheap sensationalism seems unlikely to help with that. Little AB is, one hopes, at least safe now. But she has been failed badly enough already by grownups in her short life; the last thing she needs is to become a pawn in a bigger political game. In this particular war, we cannot afford to let truth be a casualty. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/01/europe-unveils-worlds-most-powerful-x-ray-laser","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T16:00:44Z","webTitle":"Europe unveils world's most powerful X-ray laser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/01/europe-unveils-worlds-most-powerful-x-ray-laser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/01/europe-unveils-worlds-most-powerful-x-ray-laser","fields":{"headline":"Europe unveils world's most powerful X-ray laser","bodyText":"The world’s most powerful X-ray laser has begun operating at a facility where scientists will attempt to recreate the conditions deep inside the sun and produce film-like sequences of viruses and cells. The machine, called the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL), acts as a high-speed camera that can capture images of individual atoms in a few millionths of a billionth of a second. Unlike a conventional camera, though, everything imaged by the X-ray laser is obliterated – its beam is 100 times more intense than if all the sunlight hitting the Earth’s surface were focused onto a single thumbnail. The facility near Hamburg, housed in a series of tunnels up to 38 metres underground, will allow scientists to explore the architecture of viruses and cells, create jittery films of chemical reactions as they unfold and replicate conditions deep within stars and planets. Scientists are already engaged in a fierce competitive bidding process to be the among the first to get time on its six beamlines. “The laser is the biggest, and the most powerful, source of X-rays ever made,” said Olivier Napoly, a member of the French Atomic Energy Commission who helped build the complex. XFEL is the world’s third major X-ray laser facility – projects in Japan and the US have already spawned major advances in structural biology and materials science. The European beam is more powerful, but most significantly has a far higher pulse rate than either of its predecessors. “They can send 100 pulses out per second, we can send 27,000,” said Robert Feidenhan’l, chairman of the European XFEL management board. This matters because to study chemical reactions or biological processes, the X-ray strobe is used to capture flickering snapshots of the same system at different time-points that can be stitched together into a film sequence. At XFEL, scientists will be able to collect data at a far quicker rate and miss less of the action between shots. Allen Orville, who runs the XFEL hub at the UK’s Diamond Light Source, is among the first users who will start data collection in two week’s time. Orville is focused on understanding the molecular mechanics of how enzymes make antibiotics, such as penicillin, with the ultimate goal of being able to develop new ways to produce antibiotics in the future. Previously, scientists have been able to measure the crystal structure of the beginning and end-products. But, according to Orville, this is like trying to understand an Olympic high-jump contest based on pictures of the athlete on the bench before the jump and lying on the mat afterwards. “We’re trying to get the enzyme at the top of that high bar,” he said. “We hope we’ll be able to see the very complex reaction cycle including some of the short-lived intermediates that have never been seen before.” Another planned experiment will aim to reveal the process by which molecules capture light and turn it into energy during photosynthesis. “You might use that as an input to make an artificial device to do the same,” said Feidenhan’l. “That’s my dream.” The centrepiece of the facility is the world’s longest – a mile long superconducting linear accelerator, designed to provide the energy needed to generate X-ray flashes a billion times brighter than the best conventional radiation sources. The tunnel’s temperature is kept at 2C above absolute zero. The electrons are then beamed between a series of magnets that send them on slalom-like path, where at each wiggle they emit X-rays, which coalesce into an intense laser beam. The wavelength of the X-rays is about 0.05 nanometres, comparable to the radius of a hydrogen atom. It hits the target and the resultant scattered radiation, picked up by detectors, reveals the sample’s internal structure – just before it is destroyed. XFEL will also house a powerful optical laser to go alongside the X-ray gun, which scientists will use to exert extraordinary pressures on materials in order to reproduce conditions similar to those at the centre of the Earth or inside the Sun – or simply to morph materials into previously unseen configurations. Justin Wark, a professor of physics at the University of Oxford, said: “The pressures you can produce are enormous; 10 million atmospheres and above, which is more than three times the pressure at the centre of the Earth.” Wark and others will use the dual laser setup to blast samples with the optical light and then take a picture with the X-ray beam to address previously unanswerable questions. “It’s still not resolved exactly what the centre of the Earth might look like,” said Wark. “You could also study the melting point of iron up to pressures relative to much larger planets.” Extremely high pressures, theory predicts, could also produce entirely new materials, including a new form of diamond with a crystal structure that would make it even harder than the conventional kind. Scientists are also planning to harness the X-ray beam’s tremendous heating effect – the focal region can reach 200 million degrees within a millionth of a billionth of a second. Wark believes this will allow XFEL to investigate processes within the sun, such as how radiation makes its way from the centre to the surface. “How the X-rays leak their way out until finally you just see optical radiation depends on how opaque the sun is at each point,” he said. “People are wanting to make little slabs of matter that look a bit like the Sun and see how transparent they are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/31/mike-pence-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-harvey-recovery-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T16:49:05Z","webTitle":"Mike Pence accused of hypocrisy over Harvey recovery comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/mike-pence-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-harvey-recovery-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/mike-pence-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-harvey-recovery-comments","fields":{"headline":"Mike Pence accused of hypocrisy over Harvey recovery comments","bodyText":"On Monday, as the damage wrought by tropical storm Harvey became increasingly apparent, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, made a promise to Houston residents. “What you’re going to see is the national government – and we anticipate the Congress – are going to make the resources available to see Texas through the rescue operation, through the recovery,” Pence told Houston’s KTRH radio station. It was a fairly standard statement from a politician during a crisis. But in 2005, when the House was weighing a $50bn relief package for Hurricane Katrina, then-congressman Pence was less effusive. “As we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do in like circumstances and expects this Congress to do,” Pence told the House. “Let’s figure out how we’re going to pay for it. Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren.” Pence’s Katrina comments – that the government should give victims financial aid, but only if the money can be cut from elsewhere (and so not cost the government anything) – have been circulating again this week, with some accusing the vice-president of hypocrisy. But Pence – who was visiting Texas to view the damage caused by the storm on Thursday – is not the only Republican whose commitments to Harvey do not tally with their past actions. This week, Texas senator Ted Cruz issued a statement supporting federal money for his state. “I’m thankful for the assurances from President Trump and Vice President Pence that full federal assistance stands at the ready once we begin the recovery and rebuilding process,” he said. But after Hurricane Sandy devastated the north-east in 2013, both Cruz and his fellow Texas senator, John Cornyn – as well as all but one Texas congressman – voted against the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, which aimed to provide $60bn in federal aid to repair damage. At the time Cruz described the legislation as being full of “pork”. “Unfortunately, cynical politicians in Washington could not resist loading up this relief bill with billions in new spending utterly unrelated to Sandy,” he said. The bill ultimately passed without those Texas politicians’ support, and Cruz’s pork claims were rubbished by the Washington Post’s Fact Checker. It remains to be seen how much scrutiny Cruz will apply to any Senate bill that proposes funding for his own state. But both Democrats and Republicans from states hit by Sandy have been quick to remind the Texas senator of his reluctance to fund the Sandy recovery. “Ted Cruz &amp; Texas cohorts voted vs NY/NJ aid after Sandy but I’ll vote 4 Harvey aid. NY wont abandon Texas. 1 bad turn doesnt deserve another,” Republican congressman Peter King, from New York, wrote on Twitter. “Disasters &amp; emergencies are just that...disasters &amp; emergencies. Must stand together as Americans, not be hypocritical based on geography,” said Republican congressman Frank LoBiondo, from New Jersey. Perhaps the most scathing criticism came from New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who was critical of the speed of the response to Hurricane Sandy. “The congressional members in Texas are hypocrites, and I said back in 2012 they’d be proven to be hypocrites. It was just a matter of time,” Christie told reporters on Monday. “We were the disaster that was the longest in waiting in terms of federal aid, and I hope that’s not what happens to the folks in Texas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/31/john-lewis-rolls-out-scheme-to-take-the-hassle-out-of-finding-a-tradesperson","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T19:00:07Z","webTitle":"John Lewis rolls out scheme to take the hassle out of finding a tradesperson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/31/john-lewis-rolls-out-scheme-to-take-the-hassle-out-of-finding-a-tradesperson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/31/john-lewis-rolls-out-scheme-to-take-the-hassle-out-of-finding-a-tradesperson","fields":{"headline":"John Lewis rolls out scheme to take the hassle out of finding a tradesperson","bodyText":"Can they fix it? John Lewis reckons it knows someone who can. Middle England’s favourite retailer has signed up an army of plumbers, electricians, decorators and gardeners to offer a new home maintenance service launching next month. The retailer, which has built up one of the most trusted brands in the UK partly thanks to its highly rated customer service and “never knowingly undersold” pledge, is now aiming to make employing a tradesperson a lot less hit and miss. The Home Solutions service is part of the department store’s effort to fend off competition from online upstarts such as Amazon by providing more services. New boss Paula Nickolds said the business needed to bring in more beauty salons, home design, personal styling and other services as shoppers’ behaviour changes “profoundly and fast.” In a bid to add pizzazz to shopping trips the company is also sending store staff to theatre school to teach them entertainment skills and its new Oxford store, which opens in October, will have an experience manager dedicated to organising daily in-store events. The new Home Solutions service has already been tested in Milton Keynes and is being extended to Bristol, Cardiff, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Taunton from 12 September. About 150 tradespeople have been signed up to the scheme so far and the number is expected to increase as the trial expands this year. They will remain independent contractors rather than becoming partners, the term John Lewis uses for its staff who jointly own the company. The independent tradespeople have all been through a “rigorous” six-stage recruitment process in partnership with trade associations including interviews, background checks, reviews of their past work and training in customer service. The retailer says it will also carry out spot checks responding to customer feedback. Customers select a job that needs doing and pick a time slot before being matched with available tradespeople via the service’s website, app or call centre. The work is then guaranteed for a year. Tom Athron, group development director at the John Lewis Partnership, said: “As a trusted retailer of home products our customers often ask us if we can help them with tasks in their homes. We are delighted to be expanding our trial and have taken a lot of care to find professionals who will deliver service to the standard that people expect from John Lewis.” Maureen Hinton, group research director at retail consultancy Global Data, said the new service was a way of responding to the “peak stuff” trend in which people are tending to buy fewer physical items in favour of services. “John Lewis is really exploiting the potential of the brand and current lifestyle trends,’ she said. “There is a huge amount of trust in John Lewis which is a big advantage but if there is any kind of problem that’s going to reflect badly on the brand. The tradespeople will have to be of a very high standard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/aug/31/st-olaves-grammar-school-is-tip-of-iceberg-in-a-system-all-about-delivering-results","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T18:34:02Z","webTitle":"St Olave’s controversy is tip of iceberg in system obsessed with results | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/31/st-olaves-grammar-school-is-tip-of-iceberg-in-a-system-all-about-delivering-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/aug/31/st-olaves-grammar-school-is-tip-of-iceberg-in-a-system-all-about-delivering-results","fields":{"headline":"St Olave’s controversy is tip of iceberg in system obsessed with results","bodyText":"I am glad to see leading academic schools’ practice of weeding out underperforming pupils to bolster their A-level league table position coming under the spotlight (Grammar school ‘unlawfully threw out’ students who failed to get top grades, 30 August). This behaviour has to be widespread at the top of the league tables: in any cohort of teenagers there will be some whose adolescence is not plain sailing, and the proportions of A-star and A grades published by “top” schools are simply unrealistic, unless they are the result of ruthlessly throwing out those likely to get B and C grades. The result is that young people who have achieved well enough at 16 to be accepted by these highly selective sixth forms are having to change school halfway through their A-levels, and are likely to end up with qualifications far below their potential. When a school prioritises its league table position, it suits its interests better for a pupil to get no A-levels once off their hands, than for that pupil to get mediocre A-levels while still on the school roll. The pupils involved and their families don’t usually make a fuss, because they are humiliated and don’t want to identify the young person. I would like to see the league tables show the number of students who started the A-level course two years earlier, alongside the number taking the exams (just as university league tables incorporate completion rates). This would incentivise schools to do their best for all the pupils they admit for A-level courses, not just the ones with no problems. Lucy Binney Oxford • The culling of year 12 students who might possibly lower the school’s results next year is not only shameful but short-sighted. Learners develop at different rates. With A-levels now linear, the final grades will depend solely on next summer’s exams, by which time these rejected students may well have caught up. It doesn’t say much for the school’s confidence in their teachers that they’re unwilling to give these youngsters the chance to do so. While those responsible for the policy put their own kudos ahead of students’ needs, the media’s tendency to highlight only the successes of these highly selective schools doesn’t help. Those who support students of all abilities to the highest grades they can achieve, even if those grades end up at C or below, are of course well used to this, but then we didn’t enter teaching to make the headlines. Shame on St Olave’s. David Hampton (Sixth-form teacher), London • It is high time that a school is taken to task for the widespread practice of “dumping” students at the end of year 12 and it is not just confined to grammar schools. This practice is also commonplace in many London comprehensives. Over the last 10 years interviewing in an FE college each September, I have been faced with many distraught students in this situation. For the record, could headteachers who do this stop telling students they will easily get an FE college to take them for year 13. In reality this is next to impossible. These students are just being cynically abandoned to sink or swim. Often they sink! This is not in their best interests. Jane Weake (Former progression director at an FE college), London • Had North London Collegiate School ejected me in 1968, halfway through sixth form, for unpromising prospective results in my A-levels, I might not have gone on to art college and become a teacher in schools, adult and further education. I later experienced the pressure to produce “good” results as a manager in further education. I was cheered by Robert Winston’s comments on a recent You and Yours programme on BBC Radio 4 when he pointed out that what is seldom mentioned is whether people are happy in their lives. It’s not all about where you go to school and what your exam results are like. Alison Churchill Lichfield, Staffordshire • While schools are under enormous pressure to deliver results they will cheat. Who says so? Not only me but also Durham University’s Professor Rob Coe in evidence to a House of Commons committee investigating primary school assessment. Bromley’s St Olave’s grammar school dumping 13 weaker A-level students is just the tip of the iceberg. Exclusions are on the up. Thirty five children a day are sent packing. Junior schools can’t deliver progress targets because infant teachers are manipulating key stage 1 assessment to their advantage. The parliamentary inquiry, even with its Tory majority, concluded that high-stakes testing was harming teaching and learning. St Olave’s is just another example of how it’s harming children too. Philip Kerridge Bodmin, Cornwall • As an Old Olavian who left in 1980 with an A, B and E grade at A-level, I was surprised to read of the school’s policy of removing pupils midway through sixth form if they failed to attain a B in all of their subjects. If such a punitive system had been in operation when I was at the school then I, and most of my schoolmates, would have been asked to leave, and it is unlikely that I would have gone on to complete a PhD, teach at the University of London, publish over 100 scientific papers, and build a successful scientific consultancy. The senior management team at St Olave’s need to rethink this shameful policy before it damages more of the young people in their care. Mark Crane (Environmental toxicologist), Faringdon, Oxfordshire • What astonishes me most about the furore over St Olave’s, and its decision to “demote” students who might have a negative effect on its position in the A-level league tables, is that anyone is still astonished that this should have happened. A simple internet search will unearth multiple examples of the tens of thousands of young people who are “lost” from schools’ registers each year, of the invitations to parents to consider “fresh starts” for their sons and daughters, of academies paying other academies to take their less successful students off their hands. If exam performance remains the major driver of the Ofsted inspection regime, and thus the judgment most likely to affect a headteacher’s job prospects, only a fool would be surprised that desperate men and women will sometimes resort to desperate measures. The parents who are now seeking legal redress against St Olave’s should count themselves lucky it is a maintained school, and as such governed by laws that make what amounts to an exclusion on these grounds illegal. The government’s drive to turn all schools into academies will effectively close off such an option for all but the most determined, and wealthy, parents. Chris Dunne (Retired headteacher), Campaign for State Education, London • Huge sympathy for the kids, but for the parents… which bit of “grammar school” and “selective education” and “only the best” did they not understand? Presumably the spare spaces are going to children who did better than their children? As some of us keep saying: grammar schools are popular with winners. No one who supports them ever considers for a moment – at least in any article I’ve ever read – that their child might not make the grade, metaphorically or literally. Farah Mendlesohn Stoke-on-Trent • While you are right to highlight what appears to be happening around St Olave’s and “a number of other schools”, it is hardly a surprise. I taught in post-16 for over 30 years. Particularly in recent years the only thing that matters has been success rates. Falling results, and a resulting poor Ofsted, are disasters for all concerned. “Persuading” weaker students to leave has thus become commonplace. I don’t blame the schools and colleges involved. The emphasis successive governments have placed on league table standings is the real driver of this crazy system. Declan O’Neill Oldham, Greater Manchester • Schools rejecting “underperforming” sixth-formers is not new. I was advised to leave my boys grammar school in 1979, having just completed my O-levels. The school operated streaming and there were 30 in the A stream and 60 in the B stream. Only one of my fellow B streamers got as far as taking his A-levels. And this was before targets, but image and prestige were just as pernicious. (By the way, I am now a university lecturer.) Andrew Vincent Cheltenham, Gloucestershire • If I remember rightly, the first line of St Olave’s school song was “Olave to right the wrong”. Time to live up to the claim.

The development, which follows the revelation of cheating allegations involving Eton and Winchester, could put the future of the Pre-U exam under threat. The investigation by Ofqual was given the backing of the schools minister, Nick Gibb, who said it was necessary to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the exam system. Ofqual said it would look closely at the involvement of teachers who set final exam questions while also working in the classroom. Because so few teachers are familiar with the exam, any change to the rules could make the exam’s standards significantly harder to ensure. Last week, the Guardian revealed that a deputy headteacher at Eton, Mo Tanweer, had been dismissed after he was found to have leaked questions in the Pre-U certificate in economics to students and staff. It later emerged that Winchester College had suspended its head of history of art, Laurence Wolff, after allegations he gave students prior information on questions. Wolff has now retired. Pupils at both schools have had their marks in a Pre-U history of art paper revoked. “Ofqual will conduct a review of the rules under which serving teachers take part in writing and reviewing question papers, and the safeguards in place to prevent disclosure of confidential information,” a spokesperson for the regulator said on Thursday. “The involvement of serving teachers in the process of exam setting has many benefits and exam malpractice by teachers is rare. However, access to live materials must be appropriately controlled and risks to security minimised. We will investigate whether the safeguards in place are sufficiently robust and whether changes are needed.” Ofqual said it would give an update on its progress in its review of the 2017 summer exam season, which details complaints of maladministration by schools and pupils. Gibb, the minister responsible for school standards, said: “The public must have confidence in the integrity of the exam system and cheating of any kind is unacceptable. Exam regulator Ofqual is now reviewing the rules under which teachers take part in writing and reviewing question papers and have confirmed to me that they are considering whether action is needed. “The overwhelming majority of teachers act appropriately when working with exam materials but where they do not schools have a responsibility to report it to the exam board for investigation.” Critics of the Pre-U certificate say its questions are often set by teachers at one of the small number of private schools that have adopted the exam, giving their pupils an unfair advantage in the subjects and topics to be covered in the exams. Pre-U certificates are sat by as few as 4,300 candidates a year, compared with 828,000 A-levels sat in the UK this summer. The Pre-U certificate is run by a department of Cambridge University named Cambridge Assessment, through its arm Cambridge International Examinations. The exam board OCR, which offers conventional A-levels and GCSEs, is also part of Cambridge Assessment. CIE and Cambridge Assessment did not respond to requests for comment. Ofqual is responsible for certifying the exam for use in schools in England and has the power to force exam boards to make changes or else face having recognition withdrawn. A number of headteachers of independent schools have privately expressed their unease at the damage the controversy has done to the sector. Several have said they are considering dropping Pre-U exams to avoid any suggestion of impropriety. The Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC), which represents 285 private schools in Britain, has called for an urgent meeting with the CIE exam board over its concerns. “Pupils, parents and schools deserve an examination system which is open, transparent and supported by the best teachers. While exam malpractice is very rare, it has no place in any school as demonstrated by the decisive action taken by HMC heads involved in recent instances,” said Chris King, the HMC chair and headmaster of Leicester Grammar School. The headmasters of both Winchester and Eton have said they deeply regret the leaks, and emphasised that in both cases the teachers involved are no longer employed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/31/police-issue-description-of-croyden-cat-killer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T16:55:02Z","webTitle":"Police issue description of ‘Croydon cat killer’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/31/police-issue-description-of-croyden-cat-killer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/31/police-issue-description-of-croyden-cat-killer","fields":{"headline":"Police issue description of ‘Croydon cat killer’","bodyText":"The first description has been released of a suspected serial cat killer who has eluded police for almost two years. The culprit is behind the death and mutilation of about 250 cats, as well as dozens of foxes and rabbits, since October 2015, according to South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty (Snarl). He was originally known as the “Croydon cat killer”, but as bodies began to turn up in other areas of London and beyond the capital, the charity urged people to drop the label. He then became known as the “M25 cat killer” but attacks have since occurred as far afield as Manchester, Birmingham, Brighton and the Isle of Wight. The description of the individual believed to be behind all of the attacks has been published on the Snarl website. He is said to be a white man in his 40s with short brown hair, dressed in dark clothing, possibly with acne scarring to his face. It also says he may be wearing a headlamp or carrying a torch. Snarl’s co-founder Tony Jenkins said the description had been shared with his organisation by Surrey police and was based on witnesses to three recent cat killings in Caterham, Surrey. “It matches similar descriptions from other areas,” said Jenkins. “We’ve been working on this case since October 2015, going up and down the UK, tracking the bodies he leaves behind. I am very hopeful it’s a major breakthrough.” Anyone who sees the suspect is advised to call 999 and quote Operation Takahe but not to approach him. Jenkins said: “He is obviously carrying at least one knife, so if anyone does approach him they’re putting themselves in danger.” He said emotions were running high. The Snarl website warns the attacker to hand himself in “before members of the public get hold of you”. But Jenkins cautioned that the person in the description may not be guilty and that people should not jump to conclusions if they saw someone offering toys or food to cats. In one recent incident, a cat was found without its head and tail in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The tail of another cat was found in the same spot. Another cat was found mutilated in Northamptonshire on Monday and another tail was found near a children’s playground in a park in Ewell, Surrey, this week. Jenkins said that postmortems, carried out on about 40 cats before the RSPCA – which was funding them – ran out of money, had proved that the same person was behind the attacks, as did distinguishing marks on the corpses. “Unfortunately, I have seen most of the bodies and there are some signature injuries which allow us to link them,” he said. The charity is so concerned about the rising death toll that it is urging people not to let their cats out at night, when most of the killings have taken place. A message on the website reads: “We are not taking this step lightly. This is a warning for cat owners from Manchester down to the South Coast. Please keep your cats indoors at night until further notice and during the day if you can.” The animal charities Peta UK and Outpaced are offering a reward of £10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person “responsible for the killing and mutilation of cats and foxes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/17/norman-foster-president-pyramid-architects-built-astana","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T06:30:06Z","webTitle":"'Norman said the president wants a pyramid': how starchitects built Astana","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/17/norman-foster-president-pyramid-architects-built-astana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/17/norman-foster-president-pyramid-architects-built-astana","fields":{"headline":"'Norman said the president wants a pyramid': how starchitects built Astana","bodyText":"If you could see through the forest of selfie-sticks, the view from the top of the central pavilion of the Astana Expo was a prospect like no other. It was strange enough to be standing on a glass footbridge at the summit of the tallest spherical building in the world – nicknamed the Death Star – with glass bubble elevators zooming up a central neon-lit atrium behind you and a precipitous void plunging beneath your feet. All that was missing was Luke Skywalker dangling from the bridge. But then you looked out to the horizon to see an assorted collection of pyramids, golden cones and bulging mirrored towers, lined up like a row of awards in a particularly gaudy trophy cabinet, stopping abruptly to give way to the rolling grasslands of the Eurasian steppe. Expo sites are always surreal affairs, as souped-up fairgrounds of nationalist hubris, where novelty pavilions compete for attention with multicultural buffets, marching bands and cavorting mascots. But the weirdness on show here wasn’t the Expo. The chief novelty was the city of Astana itself. At one end of a monumental axis stands the biggest tent in the world, the Khan Shatyr shopping mall designed by British architect Norman Foster in the form of an inflated plastic yurt that glows pink and green by night. Housing dodgems, a rollercoaster and an artificial beach (with sand imported from the Maldives), it is a tacky pleasure dome that Kublai Khan could only dream of. At the other end of the boulevard rises an enigmatic silver pyramid, also by Foster, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, conceived as a meeting place for world religions, crowned with a stained-glass lantern of doves. It stands on a grassy mound like a venerable tomb, on axis with a lake in the shape of a bird in flight. Between these totems of the sacred and profane are the mechanisms of state. There is the presidential palace, modelled on the White House, but eight times larger and topped with a big blue dome; a gateway of conical gold mirror-glass towers for the state bank and insurance fund; a polished grey egg for the national archives. At the centre of it all rises an observation tower, a golden orb at the top of a splayed white steel tree, like a Ferrero Rocher chocolate nestling in an upturned shuttlecock. This unbridled architectural fantasy is the singular vision of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the first and only president of Kazakhstan, lifelong leader of the nation since 1989 and chief architect of the capital, who has spent the past 20 years building a city-sized monument to himself in the middle of the Asian steppe. “Like people, cities have destinies,” wrote Nazarbayev in the Heart of Eurasia, his treatise on architecture and city planning, which reads a little like the brochure of an architect out to secure future work. “Each has a name and an individual biography of its own, a character which cannot be confused with that of any other place on earth.” Walking the streets of Astana, you feel definite echoes of elsewhere. It has the petrodollar glitz of the Gulf and the monumental axial planning of Pyongyang, but each mirror-glass facade is drenched with a more explicit desire to hark back to an imagined past, searching for legitimacy in the forms of ancient civilisations and Kazakh folk motifs. “No other modern-day leader has used the myth-making power of architecture to construct a sense of national identity like Nazarbayev,” says Frank Albo, author of a new book on the Kazakh capital, Astana: Architecture, Myth and Destiny. “What you see here is a blend of postmodernism, Central Asian art, Islamic decor, Russian baroque, neoclassicism, orientalism, all melded into something that looks like Las Vegas meets Disneyland on nationalist steroids.” In a bid to cast off the shackles of the Soviet era, the president has embraced practically everything else. Architects tend to have a thing for strong men, and with the arrival of a dictator with a gushing pump of oil money and a keen interest in architecture, few big practices have managed to resist beating a path to Nazarbayev’s door. Japan’s proudest export, Kisho Kurokawa, was the first to be employed, conjuring a cosmic masterplan for the city that has mostly been ignored. Italian architect Manfredi Nicoletti designed the city’s concert hall, a mess of turquoise glass wings that writhes like a crash-landed kingfisher near the presidential palace. Calatrava Grace, the company run by Santiago Calatrava’s son Micael, is in discussions with the president about building an elaborate canopy the full length of the main boulevard. The competition for the Expo site was won by Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill – long-time darlings of authoritarian regimes, as authors of Dubai’s tallest tower – while runners-up included Zaha Hadid, Moshe Safdie, UN Studio, Snøhetta, Mecanoo and others. Newspapers are shut down, critics locked up and protesters tortured, but cor just look at that parametric blob. The new Khan Nazarbayev decided to move the capital in the early 1990s, soon after taking office. His reasoning has been the subject of considerable speculation ever since, particularly among the civil servants forced to move here. Home to the town of Akmola (“the white graveyard”) since the 1830s, this exposed plain, which ranges from -40C in winter to +40C in summer, was an unlikely choice, a thousand kilometres north of the balmy former capital of Almaty. Some say it was to shift the centre of gravity away from the border with China, while others argue that it was to cement Kazakh presence in an area that was predominantly ethnically Russian. Either way, it was primarily an opportunity to start from scratch, providing a blank slate on which the new leader could inscribe his new world, following in the footsteps of Darius the Great and Persepolis. As if there was any doubt about his self-image, at the inauguration of Astana in 1997 Nazarbayev performed an “alastau”, the ancient Mongolian fire-purification ritual culminating in a processional walk along a white carpet, of the same kind used to elevate the great Khans to their position of power. The origin story of the city is told at some length in the Nazarbayev Centre, a gigantic stone bowl topped with a bulbous glass lens, tilted towards the presidential palace like an all-seeing eye and surrounded by a high-security perimeter fence patrolled by soldiers. Another product of the Foster office, it houses an exhibition of the president’s personal effects, from the suit he wore on inauguration day to the gold fountain pen with which he co-authored the national anthem, each reverentially illuminated in its own glass case. Gifts from adoring nations fill more vitrines on the cascading levels of the building – a silver model of an oil pipeline from China, a bejewelled train carriage from Turkmenistan – along with a 3D holographic presentation of medals that Nazarbayev has received from world leaders. My young guide was particularly keen to point out the signed photo of Margaret Thatcher, who wrote the foreword to another of the president’s works, The Kazakhstan Way, and he was eager to show me the leader’s personal collection of 4,000 books, housed in a special glass shrine. “He has read them all,” he added diligently. “He is a very learned man.” The centrepiece of this eerie mausoleum is a display of architectural models, wrought in silver, gold and semiprecious stones, shown alongside some of the initial napkin sketches drawn by Nazarbayev himself. There is his scribble of the shuttlecock-shaped Bayterek Tower, designed to represent the magic tree of life where Samruk, the mythical Kazakh bird of happiness, laid its golden egg. There is also the original model of Kurokawa’s masterplan, designed according to his principles of “metabolism and symbiosis”. He proposed an organic model of development that would integrate the existing Soviet-era town on the right bank of the river with the new city on the left, surrounding the capital with a dense belt of trees to protect it from the icy winds. They have never been planted. Walking the gaping boulevards of new Astana today, it is clear that Kurokawa’s plan was abandoned from the very beginning. The new city is an alienating place of six-lane roads punctuated by vast object buildings, conceived with a total absence of human scale, making the former Soviet centre across the river feel like a cosy village in comparison. It is a place obsessed with size: Nazarbayev even had the Ishim river widened, so it would have the majesty of other capitals’ rivers, like the Thames, Danube or Seine. If you look at the map, the watercourse shrinks back either side of Astana, only bulging out in the centre of the city, like a snake digesting its lunch. Adil Nurmakov, a political scientist and co-founder of Urban Forum Almaty, who recently relocated to Astana for his wife’s work, with their young child, is still reeling from the move. “I am honestly so embarrassed by our capital,” he says. “I don’t understand how it is possible to build a city from scratch and make it so unfriendly to people. It is too monumental and car-centric and has no sensitivity to the harsh climate. The buildings are so far apart that there can be no life on the streets. In winter, it’s just about getting from one underground car park to the next, while in summer there’s no shade in these barren open spaces.” On a warm August evening, there is little sign of life in the city centre. Groups of teenagers are to be found wandering the promenade along the old right bank of the river, while across the water, a handful of families stroll down the central Nurzhol boulevard, admiring the illuminated buildings, which twinkle like the battery-operated toys being hawked by a few lonely street vendors. Nazarbayev’s face looms from a five-storey high video screen, intercut with lurid fly-through films of the city’s weird buildings, merging the monuments and their maker together in one candy-coloured montage. “The whole place is a combination of Kafka and Orwell,” says Yevgeniy Zhovtis, director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law, an NGO based in Almaty. “It has cost dozens of billions of dollars to build this vanity project, yet there are towns and villages a few kilometres away which don’t have proper roads, electricity or basic civic services. All the money that is spent on heating these huge buildings in winter and cooling them in summer could be used to fund decent services and infrastructure for the rest of the country.” It is a common sentiment for which the $3bn Expo has become a potent focus, as a painful symbol of profligacy when almost half the population still lives on $70 a month. The project was mired in scandal from the beginning, accused of diverting money from the national pension fund and subject to claims of public sector employees being forced to buy tickets to bolster visitor numbers. Three top Expo officials were arrested for embezzlement. “The Kazakh people are now very angry,” says one primary school teacher, visiting the Expo with her class of children from the town of Esil, six hours’ drive away. “We are proud that the Expo is here, but the leaders of our country have spent far too much money on it, trying to show off to the world.” The chosen theme of “future energy” also jarred with an event that is mostly sponsored by petrol companies, in a country where oil and gas accounts for 70% of exports. I was welcomed into the Shell pavilion and invited to generate my own kinetic energy by running inside a Zorb. I was invited to ponder the effects of global warming in the French pavilion, with the Total oil logo looming above a glowing Earth. Following the Expo’s announcement, heralding the country’s transition to green energy, president Nazarbayev was quoted saying: “I personally do not believe in alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar,” adding that “oil and gas is our main horse, and we should not be afraid that these are fossil fuels”. The banners and mascots have now been swept away, and the 174-hectare site is being converted into the new International Financial Centre, intended to lure foreign companies with the promise of English law, tax exemptions and an independent financial court. It is the usual free zone model favoured by dictatorships around the world, creating a thin bubble of democracy that evaporates as soon as you leave the compound. The PR pays off? The western-friendly mirage is something Nazarbayev has been at great pains to cultivate over the years, cementing his position as the best of a bad bunch of despots in charge of the former Soviet states of central Asia. Following in Thatcher’s footsteps, Jonathan Aitken wrote a fine hagiography of the president in 2009, while Tony Blair famously enjoyed a £5m-a-year deal advising Nazarbayev on such matters as how to deal with the massacre of striking workers in the oil town of Zhanaozen in 2011. (“These events, tragic though they were,” Blair wrote in 2012, advising on a speech to be given at Cambridge University, “should not obscure the enormous progress that Kazakhstan has made.”) Some of the PR is paying off. Between 2016 and 2017 Kazakhstan leapt from 51st to 35th place on the World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings. Yet, on the world press freedom index, it languishes at 157th out of 180 countries and stands at 131st on the corruption perceptions index. Now aged 77, Nazarbayev is cracking down more than ever before, silencing critics and crushing opposition, his advancing age accentuating his paranoia and desire for control. Kazakhstan has not had an election that could be considered free and fair by independent monitors in 25 years of Nazaybayev’s rule, according to Human Rights Watch. The president has exempted himself from laws limiting presidential terms and received 97.7% of the vote in the last election. The main opposition newspapers were all banned in 2013 and the internet is now closely controlled. Peaceful protests against the government’s proposed land reforms in 2016 ended with the two organisers being given five-year prison sentences. In May this year, a prominent government critic and journalist was stabbed by two unidentified attackers on an overnight train journey to Astana, where he planned to brief European diplomats about imprisoned activists and journalists. “Our lack of democracy can be felt on the streets of Astana,” says Nurmakov. “When the president still chairs the televised planning meetings and has the final say over every project, there can be no discussion about what the city needs and what public money is being spent on.” Nazarbayev, for his part, makes no pretence of democratic planning. “When it comes to the design and overall appearance of our capital,” he wrote, in Heart of Eurasia, “I believe that this should emanate, in the first instance, from the central organs of power.” ‘We’ve never worked directly for anyone in Kazakhstan’ In the west London offices of Foster and Partners, at a big round meeting table overlooking the Thames, Astana’s great pyramid of peace flickers up on a big screen. A model of the Apple Campus sits on a table nearby, its primary geometry and vast scale giving it a Nazarbayevian air. “In the summer of 2004 we got a phone call from Norman, who was on holiday in Cap Ferrat at the time,” recalls senior partner Nigel Dancey. “He said the president of Kazakhstan wants a pyramid. It has to be finished in 21 months. Let your imagination soar.” They flew to Astana to present their first scheme, something the size of the Great Pyramid at Giza, 227 metres across, which proved too big even for Nazarbayev’s ambitions. It was hastily redesigned in the hotel lobby, scaled down to almost a quarter of the size, and given the president’s blessing. After being regaled with stories of how they spent a day driving around Astana to find the only printing shop in town, I ask how can the office justify working for a regime like this? “We’ve never worked directly for anyone in Kazakhstan,” says Dancey, in a frosty turn. “Our client has always been the Turkish contractor, Sembol, who pay their workers very well.” David Nelson, the company’s head of design, elaborates: “When we first got the phone call, Kazakhstan was halfway up the Amnesty International list,” he says. “It was somewhere in the middle of a lot of other countries that we and a lot of other people work in as well. We certainly have no interest in encouraging anything that hurts people or puts people into difficult conditions.” I suggest that “we work for other bad people too and some of them are even worse” isn’t much of a defence, that these are monuments to Nazarbayev not facilities for the public good, and that Foster and Partners is implicated in reinforcing the regime. “When, on paper, you’re designing a palace to encourage peace between world religions,” says Dancey, “that sounds pretty honourable. That’s a pretty good thing to do. And the Khan Shatyr – if you can design a sustainable building where millions of people can go and have a good time in a harsh climate, that’s pretty good, too.” He is less keen to talk about the merits of the Nazarbayev Centre. A look at its troubled evolution might indicate why. In 2009, the fashionable Danish firm BIG, led by Bjarke Ingels, beat Foster and Zaha Hadid to design a new national library for Astana, conceived as a gravity-defying Möbius strip, an “infinite loop” of knowledge. But it seems Ingels’ outlook didn’t quite gel with the way things are run in Kazakhstan. As he recounted in a New Yorker interview, his client demanded haste, delayed the signing of a realistic contract, and showed no interest in the library’s interior arrangement. He also said he was asked to pay bribes while in Kazakhstan. BIG got as far as building the foundations and the four elevator cores, before withdrawing from the project – to be replaced by Foster. The scheme was hastily redesigned, placing a structural ring over the four cores and covering it with a big glass dome. In an apt reflection of the president’s view on public access to information, the planned national library was reborn as the Nazarbayev Centre, bookshelves replaced with glass cases of presidential memorabilia. Ingels, for his part, advises any architects working in Kazakhstan to appoint a project leader who weighs three hundred pounds “and has enormous hands”. ‘It’s like a teenager trying to show off’ While residents of urbane cosmopolitan Almaty are sniffy about their brash northern counterpart, for many young people in the capital, who have moved here from more remote regions, life in Astana provides a thrilling taste of the future. “I found it quite alienating when I first came here,” says Aigerim Kagarmanova, a student at the local Nazarbayev University, who grew up in Oskemen in the east of Kazakhstan and now lives near the new Mega Silk Way mall, built as part of the Expo development. “But now I feel like it’s giving hope, showing what the rest of the country could be like in the future. People like the strange buildings because they give the city an identity. Without them there would be nothing except wind in winter and mosquitoes in summer.” To her, Astana’s teething problems are merely a symptom of its newness. “It’s like a teenager or a person in their 20s, trying hard to be more than it is, to show itself off to the world.” There are signs of hope in the shape of a relatively progressive new mayor, Asset Issekeshev, a former minister of trade and industry with a reputation for innovation. As one of his first acts he set up a new Centre of Urbanism to breathe some new life into the Astangenplan, the city planning office that still has a whiff of the Soviet era. The centre is headed up by young architect Askhat Saduov, who is well-versed in progressive planning ideas and is optimistic that things will improve. “The capital has always been planned from the top-down and, as you can see, it doesn’t really work,” he says, standing over a big model of the city, where a large number of yet-to-be-built spheres, towers and obelisks extend outwards along ever-growing axes. “We want to make it more pedestrian-friendly, with a focus on human-scale public spaces and a city without suburbs. The mayor thinks the era of ‘starchitects’ and tall buildings is over; he wants creative young architects rather than expensive stars.” Saduov is sincere, but it’s hard to believe that his small team will have much effect on the city-making machine, which is still very much ruled from the top. Starchitects and their tall buildings continue apace. The billion-dollar Abu Dhabi Plaza is currently rising out of the ground in the centre of town, soon to reach its full height of 382 metres. This Emirati obelisk will be the tallest building in central Asia, dwarfing the Bayterek Tower, as if to show which petro-state is really in charge. A glossy model of an undulating white U-shaped canopy stands in the planning office, billowing upwards into an angled spire, like a toilet seat ready to give you a nasty surprise. It is a “memorial complex” for an island in the river, once again designed by Foster and Partners, awaiting the green light from above. “Astana is a city in the making,” says Nurmakov, “but it is not making itself. Maybe that’s the problem. It is not being allowed to develop itself, because everything is directed by the one and only architect of Astana.” We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences.

Awkward recriminations over a restaurant table. Why you’ll love it: Another horribly moreish commission from BBC3, Eating With My Ex dishes up eight seven-minute documentary vignettes, each featuring a former couple who meet for a meal to dissect old passions. Click on one as a starter and you will stay for the full tasting menu. The format is reminiscent of Channel 4’s First Dates, but rather than switching focus between the couples during a longer episode, these snack-sized tasters allow you to eavesdrop on one pair to speed-digest the entire story of their relationship in a single gulp. It is like one delicious oyster after another. If you are the kind of person who gradually lowers your restaurant conversation to earwig on the obvious breakup happening at the next table, you will love this show but also be furious that only 56 minutes of it is available to watch. Obviously, participants who answer an ad for a TV show that will reunite them with their ex come with an agenda, so the drama arrives readymade. But this isn’t a shouty recrimination bonanza in the mode of Jeremy Kyle. It is young folks, poking nervously at their lentil curry, and shyly attempting eye contact with someone who, often, has had a profound effect on them. Some want a reunion, others want an apology or just simple closure, the severing of an elastic band that pings them back to the bad situation to make the same mistakes again. To move the conversation along, each course (there is only time for main and pudding) arrives on a plate with a leading question printed around the edge. “Why are you polyamorous now?” asks one. “Why did you cheat on me?” says another. I’ve picked the two most tabloid-sounding queries, but the resulting conversation is anything but. The answers are laced with regret, sometimes a twinkling eye over the rim of a fiddled-with wine glass or a micro-expression that leaks the inner tempest. “I could tell you the day you slept with someone. It was on a Tuesday,” says Kris to her ex-girlfriend, Luka, three years after the fact. Every word is loaded with meaning as she goes on to explain that she is happy in the three years she has remained single since their separation. She’s fine. Sarah was scarred in an accident and met male model Bogdan soon after. The scar on her chin is something she is coming to terms with. He told her it was beautiful. She wants him, and what he represents, back. That one is a tough watch but no one leaves the table any worse off for the experience. Not every interface has a romantic undertone, sometimes it’s just two old friends wanting to put away the past and embrace their platonic future. This is not the shrill slanging-match you might expect, but rather a series of discreet firework displays over a dinner table; short plays about young love, very nicely directed by Paddy Hughes.

We discovered how fake news spreads like wildfire through social networks, how Google’s dominance of search and ownership of YouTube can distort the public sphere and how “alt-right” political activists have mastered the affordances of the technology to build a formidable propaganda system. We also discovered what we ought to have known a long time ago, namely that the internet holds up a mirror to human nature, and that some of what we see reflected in it ain’t pretty. Throughout all of this it’s been instructive to observe the intellectual contortions of the internet giants. Their pole position has always been a claim to the freehold of the moral high ground. They stand by the first amendment to the US constitution and are mere conduits for the free expression of free citizens. It is not for them to determine what can and cannot be uttered on their platforms. And if some of what is uttered is tasteless, cruel or otherwise vile, well, that’s just how folks are. If Google’s search algorithms favoured sites that specialised in hate speech, antisemitism and worse, well that was nothing to do with Google. After all, none of its employees was involved in highlighting that stuff. The fact that the more free speech there is, the better their corporate bottom lines was, conveniently, downplayed. And when the public – and politicians – began to notice the horrible stuff that happens online, the companies’ first response was to pooh-pooh the concerns. “Of all the content on Facebook,” wrote its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, “more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” The PR downsides of being conduits for hate speech and worse were viewed initially as just the cost of doing business. But then came Brexit and the election of Donald Trump and it looked as though things were getting serious for the internet behemoths. People were beginning to suspect that they were messing with our politics. Suddenly the companies discovered that their support for the first amendment was not unconditional. They pledged to take action to detect and expunge the horrible stuff that was flowing through their servers. Thousands of contractors were recruited to monitor and expunge the bad stuff. “The bottom line,” declared Zuckerberg, “is: we take misinformation seriously.” Google discovered that it could, after all, modify its algorithms so that Holocaust-denying sites would not figure in “autocomplete” suggestions in searches about Jews. And so on. So now we find ourselves in a strange place where huge corporations are in a position to determine what is published and what is not. In a working democracy, this kind of decision should be the prerogative of the courts. It’s as if society has outsourced a critical public responsibility to a pair of secretive, privately owned outfits. And it raises a really interesting question: why have two companies that have hitherto always maintained that they are mere conduits for free expression suddenly become conscientious censors? The answer is that they fear that if they are not seen to be doing something about it, then the lawmakers will act. Until recently, this didn’t seem very likely. But things have changed. In June the German Bundestag passed a law requiring social media sites to remove hate speech within 24 hours or face swingeing fines. That was alarming enough for the net companies, but now an existential threat has appeared. A bipartisan group of US senators led by Democratic senator Claire McCaskill has introduced a bill that opens a crack in the legislation that has hitherto provided internet companies with rock-solid legal immunity from responsibility for what is published on their sites. This vital immunity is provided by section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which says that: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” The McCaskill bill proposes to “clarify” section 230 so that websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking can be held liable for what they publish. It’s cleverly drafted to target a particularly odious use of the immunity provided by section 230. But the internet companies are deeply alarmed by it, because they know it could be the thin end of a powerful wedge – a wedge that could, effectively, destroy their business models (and change the internet). But they’re in a bind because – after all – they’re all opposed to sex slavery. Just like they were once all in favour of the first amendment. This is soon going to get really interesting. Stay tuned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2017/aug/31/popularity-cash-isas-collapses-tax-rule-interest-rates","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T16:58:49Z","webTitle":"Popularity of cash Isas collapses in space of year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/31/popularity-cash-isas-collapses-tax-rule-interest-rates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/aug/31/popularity-cash-isas-collapses-tax-rule-interest-rates","fields":{"headline":"Popularity of cash Isas collapses in space of year","bodyText":"Cash Isa savings accounts have collapsed in popularity, with a £20bn fall in the amount invested in the space of 12 months. A combination of changes to tax rules and continuing low interest rates have been blamed for the 33% decrease in the amounts being invested in cash Isas during the 2016-17 tax year. Revenue &amp; Customs said the total fell to £39.2bn, down from £58.7bn the previous year. Financial advisers Salisbury House Wealth said savers were “cottoning on to the fact that cash Isas offer very poor value”. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy at insurer Royal London, said the data showed that “the shine has really come off” the accounts. The figures do not mean people are not putting money away for the future; they are just doing so in different ways. Since April 2016, the first £1,000 of interest that an individual receives from savings is now tax-free if they are a basic-rate taxpayer. For a higher-rate taxpayer the threshold is £500. This is called the personal savings allowance and means most people no longer pay tax on savings interest, a change the banking body UK Finance said recently had reduced the attraction of cash Isas. Low interest rates are driving many people to put their money in the stock market: the HMRC figures show that investing in stocks and shares Isas hit a record high of £22.3bn in 2016-17, up from £21.1bn the previous year. Danny Cox of the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “Low interest rates and the new personal savings allowance have precipitated a collapse in cash Isa saving. While understandable, this may prove to be short-sighted, as neither low interest rates nor the personal saving allowance are necessarily a permanent fixture of the financial landscape, though it’s fair to say both do look set to remain in place for the foreseeable future.” Salisbury House Wealth said the interest rates offered on cash Isas were lower than inflation, “leaving savers in danger of their investments devaluing over time”. This month the financial data provider Moneyfacts said the average easy access cash Isa paid only 0.62% interest. The HMRC data also shows that the number of cash Isa accounts opened fell by 1.6m, down from 10.1m in 2015-16 to just under 8.5m. The accounts have continued to take a hit in recent months. Last week UK Finance said there was a net outflow of £1bn from cash Isas held by UK high street banks in July. Isas were introduced in 1999, replacing the earlier Peps and Tessas. There are three main types: cash, stocks and shares, and innovative finance. More recently, three other types have been launched: junior, help to buy and lifetime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/aug/31/profit-margins-at-big-six-energy-firms-hit-highest-level-on-record","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T17:21:31Z","webTitle":"Profit margins at big six energy firms hit highest level on record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/31/profit-margins-at-big-six-energy-firms-hit-highest-level-on-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/aug/31/profit-margins-at-big-six-energy-firms-hit-highest-level-on-record","fields":{"headline":"Profit margins at big six energy firms hit highest level on record","bodyText":"Profit margins at the big six energy providers have hit the highest level on record, according to the regulator, Ofgem, in data that comes just weeks after British Gas raised some prices by 12.5%. The Ofgem data reveals that the average pre-tax margin among the major power companies rose to 4.48% in 2016, up from 4.15% the year before and just 0.89% in 2009, when the regulator began collecting figures. The data was first released in July but Ofgem has only been able to present a complete picture now after the inclusion of figures from all of the big six. Centrica, which owns British Gas, enjoyed consistently the highest margins, running at 7.18% in 2016. SSE and E.ON were the second most profitable, both on a margin of 6.95%. Centrica provoked uproar this month when it raised prices for 3 million customers, which the chief executive of its consumer business, Mark Hodges, blamed on “an underlying increase in policy and transmission costs”. The Ofgem data throws doubt on the persistent complaints by the energy companies about shouldering a worsening burden of environmental costs. The figures show that the cost of environmental and social obligations on the energy companies fell from £109 in the typical dual-fuel bill in 2009 to just £86 in 2015, with a small rise to £91 last year. Centrica said, while wholesale costs have decreased, they have been offset by rising network and transmission costs, including the rollout of smart meters, and that government mandates and policy costs now represent the most significant part of electricity bills. It added that on a post-tax basis, its profit in 2016 was equal to £52 on the average dual fuel bill of £1,112. However an earlier analysis of energy company profits by Lazarus Research, looking at all the big six providers except SSE, found that gross margins had expanded from 20.7% to 22.6%, a fourth consecutive annual increase. It singled out gas supply as “particularly profitable”, adding that the figures “highlight why the sector is in the political spotlight”. The figures are likely to provoke fresh controversy regarding overcharging of consumers. An investigation into the energy market by the Competition and Markets Authority concluded last year that the big six suppliers were overcharging by £1.4bn annually. During the election campaign, Theresa May pledged to cap bills for 17 million families on the worst-value energy tariffs, but the plan was missing from the Queen’s speech – to the delight of big energy companies. Instead, the business secretary, Greg Clark, told Ofgem to safeguard “customers on the poorest value tariff”, with policy expected to focus on extending an existing ceiling on bills for 4m households on prepayment meters to a further 2.6 million vulnerable customers. Ofgem said consumers are also increasingly switching suppliers to find better deals. In the month of June 2017, the number of electricity switches reached 380,000, their highest level since June 2011, while gas switching was at its highest since June 2009. An Ofgem spokesperson said: “In a competitive market, we expect suppliers to drive down costs and the prices they charge their customers; if they don’t, their customers will switch to rivals who do.” They said the latest data showed the number of customers on standard variable deals had fallen by almost 1 million over the past six months as more people switched. They added: “We want many more customers who remain on standard variable tariffs in particular to get a better deal and are stepping up our efforts to make sure that competition works for everyone, whilst also putting in place protections for the vulnerable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/31/south-western-railway-balloted-strike-rmt-first-mtr","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T17:15:42Z","webTitle":"South Western Railway workers to be balloted over strike action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/31/south-western-railway-balloted-strike-rmt-first-mtr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/31/south-western-railway-balloted-strike-rmt-first-mtr","fields":{"headline":"South Western Railway workers to be balloted over strike action","bodyText":"The dispute over guards on trains, which has wreaked havoc on Southern and will result in more strikes in the coming days, is threatening to spread to another rail franchise, South Western Railway. The RMT union said it was in formal dispute and was preparing to ballot members for a strike over what it called the failure of the new franchise owner, First MTR, to give “clear, cast-iron assurances” over the future of guards on South Western trains. The announcement came as the RMT prepared to stage strikes between Friday and Monday across three rail networks – Southern, Northern and Merseyrail – in protest at changes to the role of guards or conductors, as more driver-only operated trains were brought into service. Merseyrail and Northern both expect to run a reduced train service terminating at about 7pm on strike days, although Southern said there would be minimal disruption. Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies and Network Rail, said: “Britain’s railway connects communities across the country and train companies are doing all they can to keep passengers moving on the day many students return to school or college, and people are going back to work. Opportunistic strikes by the RMT leadership seek to disrupt, as they did during the Grand National and Tour de Yorkshire.” South Western, which took over the franchise 11 days ago, said the action was unnecessary and premature. However, the union said it had unsuccessfully tried to obtain guarantees on the role of guards in the months since First MTR, a consortium of First Group and Hong Kong-based MTR, was awarded the franchise – but had “been met with a barrage of spin and prevarication”. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: “They have refused to give us those guarantees and it is that failure which leaves RMT with no option but to declare a formal dispute with the company and to move towards a ballot for action. “This dispute can be easily resolved if the company are prepared to stick to existing agreements, give staff and passengers alike a guarantee of a second, safety-critical member of staff on all current services and an assurance that safety and access are the absolute priority.” Referring to marketing posters which referred to guards on South West Trains – as it was then known – as “legends”, Cash said: “It is time for First MTR to stand by those legends and to withdraw the threat to throw them off the trains.” He said the union remained available for talks. A South Western Railway spokesman said: “This dispute is unnecessary. We have made it perfectly clear that we plan to retain a second person on our services as we know that our passengers value the assurance and assistance a second member of onboard staff provides. “During our franchise, we will increase the numbers of drivers and guards so we can deliver more services for passengers. We look forward to talking with our teams and the trade unions about how we can work together to deliver the best possible service for our passengers. In fact, we already have a meeting in the diary with the RMT which makes today’s announcement very premature.” Passengers on South Western have just experienced a month of disruption due to major engineering works on the network’s London Waterloo terminus. Services to the UK’s busiest railway station were affected again on Thursday, three days after the works to rebuild platforms were completed. A signalling problem meant fewer trains were able to run on lines out of Waterloo, causing more delays and cancellations. Network Rail said the latest signalling problem was not connected to its engineering works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/10/bread-for-all-the-origins-of-the-welfare-state-chris-renwick-review-chris-mullin","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"Bread for All: The Origins of the Welfare State by Chris Renwick – the labour before Labour’s triumph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/10/bread-for-all-the-origins-of-the-welfare-state-chris-renwick-review-chris-mullin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/10/bread-for-all-the-origins-of-the-welfare-state-chris-renwick-review-chris-mullin","fields":{"headline":"Bread for All: The Origins of the Welfare State by Chris Renwick – the labour before Labour’s triumph","bodyText":"Contrary to what some may believe, the welfare state did not come into existence solely as a result of some sort of post-second world war big bang caused by the election of the Attlee government. To be sure it was the Attlee government that supplied the political will, but many of the principles and some of the measures evolved over the preceding half-century. One or two were of even earlier origin. Chris Renwick, who lectures in modern history at the University of York, has produced an account of the origins of the welfare state, from the Elizabethan poor law to the Beveridge report, which is at once both learned and highly readable. Until the mid-19th century, most politicians and political philosophers were instinctively against the notion that the welfare of its citizens was any business of the state except maybe in the direst circumstances, and perhaps not even then. The late-18th-century philosopher Malthus argued that the poor law was an interference with the natural checks and balances on a growing population. There were also arguments that will be familiar today about escalating cost, fecklessness and the undermining of the market, with the result that early social reformers sometimes found it easier to focus, not so much on the moral arguments, but on the suggestion that it was simply not efficient to have perhaps one-third of the population unable to make any meaningful contribution to the wealth of the nation if they were laid low by disease, malnutrition and lack of education. The first stirrings of ruling-class interest in the welfare of the masses began in the 1830s with the appointment of a royal commission into the workings of the poor law. Remarkably, however, it concluded that the existing patchwork of local provision was too generous and needed to be replaced by a centrally imposed system of workhouses where living conditions were sufficiently unpleasant that no one save the destitute would want to live there. Gradually, though, the grim realities of working-class life in 19th-century Britain began to impinge on the comfortable world of the Victorian middle classes. A combination of the rise of trade unions, the founding of the Labour party and the extension of the franchise, along with a handful of enlightened employers and social reformers, forced social welfare on to the political agenda. The revelation, during the Boer war, that up to two-thirds of the recruits from industrial cities such as Manchester were physically unfit to fight came as a particular shock to the political classes. Only with the election of the 1906 Liberal government did the state start to take a serious interest in the welfare of its people. One of the new government’s first measures was to introduce legislation permitting local authorities, should they choose, to introduce free school meals. Predictably, however, many declined to do so with the result that, after five years, only a relative handful of children benefited. The first old age pensions were introduced in 1908 (£13 a year for the over 70s), but once again provision was far from universal. Only those with incomes of less than £31 a year qualified. David Lloyd George’s attempt to introduce a national insurance scheme to cover the sick and unemployed, funded by increased taxes, was famously blocked by the Tories in the House of Lords and needed two further general elections to force through. It took two world wars and the extension of the franchise to women before the welfare state as we know it today, universal and comprehensive, became politically possible. Although the greatest credit lies with the Attlee government, Labour did not pluck ideas and legislation out of thin air. During the first four decades of the 20th century, governments of all persuasions had begun to turn their attention to improving the education, housing and welfare of all citizens. As the author says, “The fact that there were Labour, Tory and Liberal fingerprints on the welfare state was an important reason why it was not instantly dismantled by the Tories when they regained power in 1951.” • Bread for All: The Origins of the Welfare State by Chris Renwick is published by Allen Lane (£20).

The UK Statistics Authority chair has written to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, voicing strong concerns over the partial leak of the report to the Daily Telegraph last week, pressing her to ban the release of their official statistics to ministers and officials in advance of publication. Sir David Norgrove told Rudd that the Telegraph report, which claimed 97% of international students left the UK after their studies and that there were tens of thousands fewer immigrants in the country than previously thought, was seriously misleading. “The main leak was to the Daily Telegraph. Whoever spoke to the journalist seems only to have half understood the data or inadequately communicated them. The result was seriously misleading, creating confusion where clarity was important,” he said. “But a more accurate leak would still have been misleading, because it would have been partial (in all senses), and left the journalist and the public lacking context. The leak was the more damaging in view of the sensitivity of migration data.” The Home Office report published last Thursday said exit check data showed that 97% of non-EU international students left when their visas expired, but 20% extended their visas upon graduation for up to five years to work or for other reasons. An initial investigation by the Home Office into the leak has established that about 50 people were given access to the figures before the report’s publication. The Office for National Statistics has recently ended its policy of pre-release access to official statistics for ministers and officials “in order to strengthen public trust”, and Norgrove pressed Rudd to follow suit. The Royal Statistical Society’s chief executive, Hetan Shah, added to the pressure, saying: “This incident from the Home Office shows that the more you have pre-release access to statistics, the more likely those numbers will be leaked. The ONS has set a good example in ending the practice of people having early access to the numbers, and it is now time that the rest of government followed its lead, starting with the Home Office.” The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused the Conservatives of leaking the figures. “Under this Tory government, one of the great offices of state has been brought into disrepute,” she said. “Whether it is letters being erroneously sent out to EU nationals in order to propagate Theresa May’s risible ‘hostile environment’, or leaked national statistics being used to mislead the British people about the shambles that is Tory immigration policy, ministers face some serious questions. “How can the public trust a word the Tories say on immigration when they feel the need to leak information to mask the failure of their policy?” The Home Office is not expected to change its policy on pre-release access. A spokesperson said: “The government has clear rules around pre-release access to official statistics and the Home Office followed these to the letter. “We have already submitted a report to the Office for National Statistics and we are committed to investigate this matter working with the UK Statistics Authority. It would be inappropriate to comment further.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/01/journal-star-peoria-community-engagement-illinois","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T13:00:03Z","webTitle":"Our newspaper was irrelevant to Peoria's South Side.

Here's how we changed that","bodyText":"On an evening last September, I received a call from Robbie Criss, a member of a readership group my publication, the Journal Star in Illinois, started three years ago to improve coverage of Peoria’s South Side, a neighborhood where many residents struggle with poverty. Criss told me his two teenage sons were arrested in a park at gunpoint and were brought into the Peoria police station because they “looked like” suspects in an armed robbery. About five hours later, after police determined the young men had nothing to do with the crime, they were released. Criss was furious and I could barely understand him during the call. He said the only reason his sons were detained was because they were black. The police department completed its investigation of the incident and found that while the teens were detained in a proper manner, some professional standards were violated. Police would not explain in detail what they meant by that. However, during our coverage of the story, the police department apologized to the Criss family. Not too long ago, the Journal Star wouldn’t have received a call like the one from Criss. Frankly, we weren’t a factor in the life of the neighborhood. We were told by some that they believed the only reason we went to the South Side was to cover crime, or when free meals were handed out to the needy during Christmas or Thanksgiving. It was a community underreported, and it had given up on the Journal Star. For a local newspaper to truly be part of a community, it needs to be there and tell the stories about the good things happening in neighborhoods as well as the struggles. Readers need to see themselves reflected in our coverage and we need to make that our goal. Peoria is a three-hour drive south-west of Chicago and home to Caterpillar Inc, a Fortune 100 company that employs 12,000 and manufactures earth-moving machines sold worldwide. But Peoria is a city of disparity. One South Side zip code – 61605 – is among the poorest in the United States. Forty-eight percent of the 7,400 households there meet federal guidelines for living in poverty, compared with 17% of households across all of Peoria. Household earnings in 61605 are $21,527 compared with $46,062 citywide, according to 2010-2014 data. And the recent unemployment rate was 21.6%, more than double the city’s overall rate. Our mission today is to show the positive things happening in Peoria as well as the obstacles to success residents face. As part of our work, I lead monthly meetings at agencies throughout the neighborhood, such as South Side Mission, Neighborhood House, Helping Hand Resource Center and Dream Center Peoria, and share the more than one dozen stories the Journal Star writes each month as a result of our growing community source list. We talk about stories we should be covering, current local and national events and concerns people have with news coverage. Our meetings attract between one and two dozen people, from community and social service leaders to private citizens wanting to share a story. We also have a Facebook group (Journal Star Readers) and our email distribution list includes more than 100 people. As a result, the Journal Star’s coverage of the South Side went beyond the routine and feelgood stories. Throughout 2016, we produced a series of in-depth articles about the inequities facing Peoria’s black population. The series – City of Disparity – included examinations of healthcare, housing, education, employment, the judicial system and what’s next for Peoria. The series won a first-place national award this year from the Associated Press Media Editors for Community Engagement. And in February, we published a special section called South Side Gems, highlighting neighborhood features Peoria residents should consider exploring. Is our community engagement working? Last summer, a colleague and I were invited to meet at Peoria city hall with leaders of Washington DC-based National Resource Network. The Network is working with Peoria on a Strong Cities initiative, which partners with communities trying to rebound from major economic challenges by helping them to determine and implement solutions to guide them toward economic recovery and growth. During the meeting, the Network leaders said they wanted to meet us because in their years of working with cities, they’d never seen such a reversal in the perception of the local newspaper. They said in their interviews the year before, many people on Peoria’s South Side had little good to say about the Journal Star, but they were now hearing nothing but good things about the Journal Star’s coverage and involvement in the community. Sherry Cannon, a community advocate who works for Hope Renewed Youth Conference and the Elite Youth Outreach Program, said that “one of the greatest benefits has been the networking opportunities. So many community organizations have come together to coordinate and collaborate on community projects through the Journal Star’s monthly meetings.” Some readers outside of the South Side have also taken notice. For instance, I saw a reader call us on Facebook the “Black Journal Star”. To me, that’s an acknowledgement of our work and commitment to serve all of Peoria.

This unauthorised biography of the great Irish republican survivor seeks to psychoanalyse Adams like no other book before. It is a journey into a heart of darkness and in particular the dark secrets that were only unlocked in 2009 about Adams’s abusive father, and the shadow that cast on the entire family. The author is critical of Adams’s role in support of the IRA’s “armed struggle”, but is also scrupulously fair in noting that without him there would be no ceasefire, no peace process, no movement from violence into constitutional politics. One of the most striking revelations in this book is how, from even the 1980s, the British security and political establishment saw Adams’s survival at the top of the republican movement as essential in directing the organisation away from armed insurrection. Cynically, as O’Doherty reveals, others were targeted by loyalist paramilitaries so that Adams could remain in power. • Gerry Adams: An Unauthorised Life by Malachi O’Doherty is published by Faber (£14.99).

No, this is the new normal","bodyText":"One way to contemplate the mind-boggling millions Premier League clubs have spent signing footballers in this record-breaking transfer window is to reach for the handy device of the illustrated dictionary. Look up the word inflation now, and it gives you a picture of Kyle Walker. Amid the maelstrom of arrivals and departures as the clubs have repeatedly dipped into their deeper money pots – leaving Paris Saint-Germain’s excesses to one side as a special case – Walker’s fee, £50m, stands as a price barometer. The right‑back he has replaced at Manchester City, Pablo Zabaleta, was a thoroughbred when they signed him in 2008, aged 23, from Espanyol; already an Argentina international. The fee, for a supremely consistent full‑back who proceeded to play 417 matches for City through their Abu Dhabi‑fuelled reconstruction, was reported to have been £6.45m. Yet if the instinct is to bridle at a game gone mad again, and see the spending, a gross £1.24bn by the 20 clubs at the start of deadline day, as a bubble inflating to bursting point, the reality is more balanced. City’s £50m for Walker may be considered a huge premium (for all the England full-back’s dynamic talents), but this overall level of vast spending can more genuinely be considered the new normal. Last summer’s £1.2bn, itself a record, and this summer’s surpassing of that have been the first in which the Premier League clubs have been handling their share of the £8.4bn, 2016‑19 TV deals. This bonanza, reaped from BT’s challenge to BSkyB for the golden prize of football supporters’ direct debits, and the rising value of the Premier League as media content overseas, meatily exceeds the £5.14bn the clubs fed on in the previous three years. In June the Premier League published the clubs’ share of this £2.4bn annual feast – £400m was set aside principally for parachute payments; £100m, 3.6% of the total, is invested in grassroots facilities and projects. All but the three relegated clubs were paid more each than that total for the whole football community nationally. Sunderland, who finished bottom and have struggled for years to make convincing signings, were paid £93m. The champions, Chelsea, earned the most, as the payment structure rewards finishing places in the table and the number of times a club is shown live on television. Their total, £151m, was utterly inconceivable when the First Division clubs first burrowed their way out of sharing TV money with the other three divisions of the Football League and formed the breakaway Premier League 25 years ago. City were the second highest, banking £147m; Liverpool were paid £146m; Tottenham Hotspur £145m. The middle‑ranking clubs all made comfortably more than £100m. Bournemouth’s share of the TV money was £118m. Nobody in the history of football ever foresaw that sentence being written. For the clubs who competed in the Champions League, add the lucre from their hearty share of the €1.3bn Uefa distributed last season, and their TV earnings alone exceeded £200m. Yet just as Uefa implemented financial fair play (FFP) rules to prevent all this boom-time money leaking through to players and their agents, the Premier League did the same in anticipation of the first massive BT-induced increase of 2013-16. Renewed last year until the end of the 2018-19 season, the Premier League’s financial regulations limit the losses clubs can make and cap the amount by which they can increase player wage bills, to £7m on the previous year. The intention – spelled out by the Stoke City owner, Peter Coates, when the rules were introduced – was, “We cannot have all the new money going in inflated wages and payments to agents … We will have the same players, they won’t get better because we pay them more.” Uefa’s FFP and the Premier League regulations do not apply to transfer fees in themselves, but these have to be aligned with the need to approach breaking even every year, and to not swell the wage bill too much. The introduction of the Premier League rules for 2013-14 instantly recalibrated most clubs into financial stability – 15 made a profit whereas just eight had done so the previous season . The fees being paid now are eye‑watering, the wages are unthinkable, the top agents’ fees – often payable to their bases in tax havens – difficult to accept, but most clubs are in fact living within their outsized means. Within that context there are variations in clubs’ management and internal politics; how shrewd they are with their bounty, how well they assess the improvements they could make to their squads, how efficiently they negotiate the multiple transfer-market hurdles. Across Europe, with the Premier League riches so far exceeding those of the other leagues – the TV deal is twice the value of the Bundesliga’s – there is a premium for players signed, as clubs see the English coming. In the frenzy there is no time taken for bigger questions. Last summer, after England were defeated by Iceland in the European Championship, there was a short period of breast-beating about the paucity of England-qualified players gaining experience at the highest level. This summer there has been no international tournament and the football world is consumed by watching Premier League clubs wield their spending power again. As ever, the overwhelming majority of signings are of overseas players, from European clubs. Of last season’s top six clubs, by the morning of transfer deadline day, the only England-qualified players recruited were Walker and Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain by Liverpool. The other 21 players, mostly bought at vast cost for first teams, were from overseas. In the out columns, as ever, are long trails of English players who have been at the clubs since their infancy, being released or loaned out. Now all young footballers and their parents should clearly see the reality of their prospects: England’s top clubs can spend £50m on a 27-year-old ready-made England right-back and still be living within their means."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/31/hollywood-is-racist-says-actor-chloe-bennet-amid-whitewashing-row","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T17:17:49Z","webTitle":"Hollywood is racist, says actor Chloe Bennet amid whitewashing row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/31/hollywood-is-racist-says-actor-chloe-bennet-amid-whitewashing-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/31/hollywood-is-racist-says-actor-chloe-bennet-amid-whitewashing-row","fields":{"headline":"Hollywood is racist, says actor Chloe Bennet amid whitewashing row","bodyText":"The row over whitewashing in Hollywood has taken a new turn after the actor Chloe Bennet said she had changed her name from Chloe Wang because Hollywood is “racist” and would not cast her in roles because of her surname. Bennet, who stars in Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD, said her original surname made Hollywood “uncomfortable”. Earlier this week the British actor Ed Skrein pulled out of his role in a forthcoming film reboot of Hellboy because the character he was playing has an Asian heritage. Bennet made her comments on Instagram in response to a follower asking why she had changed her name. “Changing my last name doesn’t change the fact that my blood is half-Chinese, that I lived in China, speak Mandarin, or that I was culturally raised both American and Chinese,” she wrote. “It means I had to pay my rent, and Hollywood is racist and wouldn’t cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable. I’m doing everything I can with the platform I have to make sure no one has to change their name again just so they can get work.” Bennet praised Skrein for pulling out of Hellboy and “standing up against Hollywood’s continuous insensitivity and flippant behaviour towards the Asian American community”. She added: “There is no way this decision came lightly on your part, so thank you for your bravery and genuinely impactful step forward. I hope this inspires other actors/film-makers to do the same.” Skrein has said he was unaware his character, Maj Ben Daimio, had originally been drawn in comics as Asian, and he pulled out of the role after claims that it was another example of Hollywood whitewashing. “There has been intense conversation and understandable upset since that announcement and I must do what I feel is right,” he said in a statement. “It is clear that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people and to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voices in the arts. I feel it is important to honour and respect that.” The producers of the film, Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin, subsequently made a joint statement with backers Lionsgate and Millennium to add their support to his decision. They have committed to recasting the role “with an actor more consistent with the character in the source material”. Other recent castings that sparked accusations of whitewashing in Hollywood were the choice of Tilda Swinton to play a Tibetan mentor, the Ancient One, in Doctor Strange, and Scarlett Johansson starring in Ghost in the Shell, which was based on a Japanese animated film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/01/uk-perfume-shops-hope-new-chanel-fragrance-can-mask-foul-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T19:26:24Z","webTitle":"UK perfume shops hope new Chanel fragrance can mask foul sales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/01/uk-perfume-shops-hope-new-chanel-fragrance-can-mask-foul-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/01/uk-perfume-shops-hope-new-chanel-fragrance-can-mask-foul-sales","fields":{"headline":"UK perfume shops hope new Chanel fragrance can mask foul sales","bodyText":"There is likely to be a very heady aroma floating across the nation’s beauty halls this weekend as a small army of shop assistants mobilises to spray shoppers with Gabrielle – Chanel’s first new perfume in 15 years. The perfume industry’s equivalent of a new blockbuster movie, the hype has been building for months, and peaked this week with the release of an ad featuring the actress Kristen Stewart dancing her way into a wall of Gabrielle bottles. Chanel is putting its considerable financial muscle behind the new brand at a time when the UK perfume market – along with key European markets – is in the doldrums. The number of bottles sold is falling by between 5%-10% a year as millennials turn their nose up at traditional scents. Perfume sales put £1.5bn a year into the tills of UK retailers but in recent years growth has only been maintained by manufacturers hiking prices and well-heeled shoppers trading up to expensive products like Creed aftershave, which costs more than £100 for a 30ml bottle, and Gabrielle, which starts at £79 for 50ml. “We think this will be one of the biggest launches in our 25-year history,” says Gill Smith, the managing director of the The Perfume Shop, the UK’s biggest specialist retailer. “Chanel has a universal appeal and we know our customers love the interlocking C’s. It’s also pay day this weekend so lots of people will see it and want to buy it.” The Mintel analyst Roshida Khanom says specialist chains and department store counters have been having a tough time selling scents. Savvy shoppers sniff testers in store and then scour the web for the best price. Perfume is also having to battle for consumers’ cash at a time when Britons are spending more of their spare money on experiences. Most perfumes are made under contract by beauty conglomerates such as Estée Lauder and L’Oréal but at the top end, luxury goods companies such as Hermès and Chanel continue to make their own. A big problem area is the mass market, where manufacturers are struggling to replace dwindling sales of celebrity fragrances, which have fallen out of favour. “The celebrity fragrance is not as aspirational as it once,” says Khanom. “Celebrities have become more accessible; we see the good, bad and the ugly on social media.” Sanjay Vadera, who runs the 183-store chain The Fragrance Shop, said sales of celebrity fragrances have slumped more than 10% in the last year. In their place has come a new breed of brands linked to fashion stores, such as Babe Power, the first perfume from the online fashion retailer Missguided, which has been among the year’s biggest sellers to date. The boom in celebrity perfumes ranged from movie and music stars such as Elizabeth Taylor (White Diamonds), Jennifer Lopez (Glow), Beyoncé (Heat) and Britney Spears (Fantasy, Curious), to footballer fragrances such as David Beckham (Instinct, Intimately). Some of the brands have had surprising longevity, including the late Jade Goody’s Shh! and Controversial. “Britney Spears launched 10 years ago but it still sells because it’s a good juice,” says Vadera. “Jade Goody still sells because of the price. They are not buying it because of Jade Goody but because the juice is very good value at £10 and they are getting it in a nice bottle. At the end of the day it is about product and value.” Vadera says the UK perfume market has seen low single digit growth, in value terms, over the last few years but after inflation is stripped out the underlying picture is one of flat or falling sales – although The Fragrance Shop has continued to perform strongly as it cashes in on demand for big ticket scents such as Dior Sauvage. “It’s been more of a slack market than anything else,” he said. But the buzz around Gabrielle, as well as a slew of other new perfumes, including Jean Paul Gaultier’s Scandal and Bloom from Gucci, means perfume retailers are hoping for a lucrative Christmas period. “We’ve not seen a lineup like this for a long time,” says Vadera. But with perfume sales also falling in key luxury markets such as France and Italy, the industry has begun to ring the changes. The use of Stewart by Chanel suggests a willingness to drop some of the romantic boy-meets-girl cliches it has been using to sell perfume since Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel launched No5 in the 1920s. Marketing budgets are also being deployed to buy social media promotions rather than space in department store windows as shopping habits change. The cut-throat nature of the perfume industry means that despite months of hype around Gabrielle in the fashion press, what it actually smells like was left to remain a mystery until the first bottles were opened in stores. With characteristic fashion industry hyperbole, Chanel describes the smell as a “solar vibration”. Smith, who had to sign a non-disclosure agreement to sniff a Gabrielle tester six months ago, offered a rather more down-to-earth description: floral and quite fresh with an air of French chic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/lostinshowbiz/2017/aug/31/bromans-these-caesar-geezers-need-terry-pratchetts-steamroller-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T15:09:11Z","webTitle":"Bromans: these Caesar geezers need Terry Pratchett's steamroller treatment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lostinshowbiz/2017/aug/31/bromans-these-caesar-geezers-need-terry-pratchetts-steamroller-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/lostinshowbiz/2017/aug/31/bromans-these-caesar-geezers-need-terry-pratchetts-steamroller-treatment","fields":{"headline":"Bromans: these Caesar geezers need Terry Pratchett's steamroller treatment","bodyText":"In a week where up increasingly seems like down and purple is apparently orange (with Prince’s sister having made an incendiary claim regarding the singer’s real favourite colour), there is something reassuring about the sight of a crushed hard drive. To be more specific, the sight of a hard drive once housed in Terry Pratchett’s computer, and thought to contain up to 10 unfinished novels, being annihilated first by a steamroller and then by a concrete crusher, in accordance with the late author’s wishes. We were left with the author’s final, perhaps greatest, creative statement: that there should be no room in this world for substandard art. With news of ITV’s autumn schedule dropping on the same day, it feels like a waste of a good six-and-a-half tonne steamroller for such destruction to be restricted to the creative works of the deceased. Efforts may be wasted on attempts to eradicate season 76 of The X Factor: it feels as if this curiously resilient singing contest will outlast us all, the only hint of human life 1,000 years from now consisting of a defibrillated painter-decorator singing Maroon 5 in a bombed-out conference room for the benefit of an animatronic approximation of Nicole Scherzinger. But could ITV2’s new effort, Bromans – “Eight 21st-century lads are to be transported back to the Roman empire to see if they can cut it as gladiators” – provide a good test subject? In the name of managed expectations, please understand that ITV2 has not spent its Love Island ad revenue perfecting the art of time travel. This show is pretend. It’s also, necessarily, presented with tongue in cheek. This primetime “modern geezers in the time of Caesar” romp was described by executive producer Ben Kelly using the following words: “The Romans gave us roads, viaducts and basic sanitation but Bromans may prove to be their greatest legacy.” Fair enough, but let us turn this on its head: let’s mix it with Pratchett’s own greatest legacy, and tune in on launch night to watch TV executives competing to prevent the destruction of tapes containing Bromans’ first series. Then we will see how much they really believe in what they’re selling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/aug/31/more-london-sixth-form-schools-face-threat-of-legal-cases-for-exclusion","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T19:17:57Z","webTitle":"More London sixth-form schools face threat of legal cases for exclusion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/31/more-london-sixth-form-schools-face-threat-of-legal-cases-for-exclusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/aug/31/more-london-sixth-form-schools-face-threat-of-legal-cases-for-exclusion","fields":{"headline":"More London sixth-form schools face threat of legal cases for exclusion","bodyText":"Lawyers acting for families who claim their children have been illegally excluded from St Olave’s grammar school are considering launching proceedings against a number of other London schools after being contacted by parents. The news came as a former St Olave’s governor complained about a lack of transparency in the governance of the school and called on the headteacher and current governing body to “right the wrong” being done to pupils. The row at St Olave’s, in the London borough of Bromley, over sixth formers being kicked out halfway through their course has prompted a number of inquiries from families who say they are facing similar situations in other selective and non-selective London schools. Parents launched legal action against St Olave’s after about 16 sixth-form students were told their places at the school were being withdrawn because they had failed to get top grades in AS and equivalent internal exams before their final A-level year. Other students were told they would be allowed to continue on a discretionary basis and were asked to sign a contract stating that if they did not get a minimum B grade in their mock exams the school reserved the right not to enter them for their A-level exams. Lawyers have issued judicial review proceedings against the school’s governing body, also naming Bromley, the local authority responsible for maintaining the school, as an interested party. A hearing has been set for 20 September. Dan Rosenberg, of Simpson Millar Solicitors, who is representing the St Olave’s parents, said a number of other families whose children were facing a similar situation elsewhere in London had been in touch and letters threatening legal action would be sent to schools which appeared to be operating unlawful policies. St Olave’s and its headmaster, Aydin Önaç, have refused to comment on the Guardian revelations about the legal action. Tony Wright-Jones, who was a parent governor at St Olave’s between 2012 and 2015, said he believed there was a lack of transparency in the governance of the school and claimed that when he and fellow governors raised concerns, they were not properly addressed. Wright-Jones said he and his governor colleagues had tried to challenge the school’s plans to raise the entry requirements to the sixth form but their objections were batted off. “The headmaster wants everything his way and wants to run that school his way, but we should be asking: are the pupils there for the school or is the school there for the pupils?” he said. “They are just using them and if they are not up to scratch, they are turfing them out. It’s that simple. I respect the position of headmaster but I don’t respect this headmaster.” The Department for Education has not commented directly on the St Olave’s case because of the legal proceedings, but in a statement released on Wednesday it said its pupil registration regulations made clear that schools are not allowed to remove pupils from sixth form because of academic attainment once they are enrolled. “Excluding pupils temporarily or permanently for non-disciplinary reasons is unlawful,” it said. Wright-Jones said: “The motto of the school is ‘Olaf to right the wrong’. I believe the headmaster and the governors need to look at that motto and practise what they preach, because it is clearly wrong what’s going on.” With the school year starting next week, parents of affected children are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the legal action. Others are looking into possible alternatives, with one family saying they would probably extend their mortgage to pay for their child to complete sixth form privately. Meanwhile, current and former students at St Olave’s continue to contact the Guardian to describe their experiences. “No matter how gifted or intelligent the students of Olave’s are, this kind of pressure and this kind of heartless elimination of the students that struggle slightly is a sign that Olave’s and other super-selective grammar schools do not have their priorities straight,” said one. “I attended Olave’s from year 7 up until year 13 in 2011,” said another. “Throughout school it was drilled into us that the minimum expected grades at AS level should be BBB, but I was shocked when my AS results of AAC meant that my position at school was at risk. I was asked to sign an agreement that if my grades did not improve I would have to leave the school. My C grade was subsequently re-marked and changed to a B but the agreement still stood.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/aug/31/the-joy-of-specs-eyewear-starring-role-in-cinematic-history","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T17:31:28Z","webTitle":"The joy of specs: eyewear's starring role in cinematic history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/31/the-joy-of-specs-eyewear-starring-role-in-cinematic-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/31/the-joy-of-specs-eyewear-starring-role-in-cinematic-history","fields":{"headline":"The joy of specs: eyewear's starring role in cinematic history","bodyText":"Once upon a time, not too long ago in cinematic history, there was an easy way to make a Hollywood star instantly less attractive: put them in glasses. Think Cary Grant as the palaeontologist in Bringing Up Baby; Donna Reed as the librarian in It’s a Wonderful Life; Bette Davis as a repressed spinster in Now, Voyager. Even Clark Kent, who can only become Superman once he’s taken his specs off. A new exhibition in Manchester explores the history of spectacles on screen, charting the journey of the humble ophthalmic aid from geek prop to shorthand for sophistication. The show, at Home, is the brainchild of the Society of the Spectacles, a creative research club formed by Robert Hamilton and Susan Platt, artists who lecture at Manchester School of Art. Both proud specs wearers, the pair want to challenge the idea that people are better looking without their glasses. “We’re trying to argue the opposite,” said Hamilton, who has four different pairs that he wears according to his mood and outfit. Hamilton founded the society in 2012 after watching The War of the Worlds, which features Gene Barry “wearing a really great pair of glasses”. “I thought, oh, I wonder if anyone has done anything about glasses in cinema,” said Hamilton. “The glasses played a part in the narrative. Barry arrives at the meteor site and there’s a young woman who doesn’t recognise him because he’s wearing glasses. He asks her: ‘So, what does Dr So-and-So look like?’, and she goes: ‘Oh, I’ve got his photograph here.’ And Barry goes: ‘Does he look like [whips off his glasses to illustrate] this?’ They fall instantly in love and then get attacked by aliens.” Hamilton made a list of all the films he could remember in which glasses had played a part, such as Battleship Potemkin, where the woman on the Odessa steps is shot through her spectacles, and Alfred Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train, where a murder is reflected in the victim’s lenses. He decided to find a way to celebrate them in art. The Home show, called Strelnikov’s Glasses and Other Stories, takes its title from the character played by Tom Courtenay in Dr Zhivago – a Russian soldier who wears small, round, wire-rimmed specs. Hamilton’s own contribution to the exhibition includes a letter he wrote to Courtenay asking for his recollections on wearing those glasses for the role. The show presents the work of 24 artists, designers and filmmakers based in Sheffield, Manchester, Chicago, Panama and California. All were tasked with producing a work that responds to a pair of glasses (or its wearer) in a film of their choice, in the format of the 27 x 40in film poster. Platt, who curated the exhibition, has contributed her own piece, called Never Make Passes? With the help of General Eyewear – a London-based firm that makes bespoke spectacles for films, including works by Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton – she transforms herself into the most famous glasses-wearing female characters in cinema over the past 75 years. The artist pays homage to Miranda Priestly, the fashion magazine editor in The Devil Wears Prada, as well as Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire – a watershed moment for specs on screen, Platt believes. “It was Marilyn Monroe who first sexualised glasses, because she gets the man without taking her glasses off.” Another work, by Libby Scarlett, examines intimacy on screen: when a specs-wearing character takes off their glasses and puts them on the bedside table, you know a steamy bit is coming up. Platt, who rocks a cartoonish thick black frame, is delighted that glasses in movies are now more often used to signal a character’s cool urbanity. “Take the Tom Ford film Nocturnal Animals. Amy Adams is in that as an LA gallery owner, and she’s successful and glamorous and she’s got the biggest-framed glasses on in the world.” Strelnikov’s Glasses and Other Stories is at Home, Manchester, from 1 September until 29 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/aug/31/texas-flooding-chemical-plant-harvey-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T02:29:13Z","webTitle":"Texas flooding: 100,000 homes damaged by Harvey – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/31/texas-flooding-chemical-plant-harvey-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/31/texas-flooding-chemical-plant-harvey-live","fields":{"headline":"Texas flooding: 100,000 homes damaged by Harvey – as it happened","bodyText":"This live coverage is now closing. Read our latest news story here: The number of confirmed deaths related to Harvey reached 35 on Thursday, and the figure is expected to increase. President Donald Trump pledged to donate $1m to relief efforts. Harvey has been downgraded from a category 4 hurricane to a tropical depression and has moved over Louisiana and Mississippi. There were fires and explosions at a chemical plant near Houston early Thursday, leading to a federal investigation. High levels of E coli were found in floodwaters, and there are growing concerns about other storm-related health hazards. Vice president Mike Pence visited Texas on Thursday and faced questions about his controversial position on relief funding as a member of the House during Hurricane Katrina. The US transportation secretary announced $100m to rebuild Texas infrastructure. The National Weather Service has forecasted flooding in Kentucky and Tennessee. Downtown Houston is showing signs of recovery. Houston emergency officials said the number of calls for service is diminishing. An official estimated that 100,000 homes have been affected or damaged by Harvey. Houston city officials have provided an update on the response to tropical storm Harvey, noting that the calls for service are declining. Houston fire chief Samuel Peña said the city has received 16,000 calls for service throughout the storm, but 800 calls today since midnight – 22 of which were water rescues. “They are steadily diminishing,” he said. Peña also warned about potential wildlife, including snakes and rodents, winding up in damaged properties: “Be very cautious. It is a hazardous environment.” A Houston police official said that over the last day, there have been 69 arrests, eight of which were for looting. He said that was lower than the typical rate of burglary or looting on an average day. He also said there have been 30 missing people reports since the storm began, and 19 remain pending. Here’s footage earlier of Houston officials surveying damage by helicopter: Federal law enforcement officials and Texas and Louisiana leaders have formed a working group to investigate and prosecute illegal activity related to Hurricane Harvey, the Associated Press reports. Authorities said they are bringing together roughly a dozen agencies into a single group to address Harvey-related scams. Houston-based acting US attorney Abe Martinez said storm victims already have suffered devastation and “the last thing that victims of the damage need is to be victimized again”. Some tips on how to avoid scams: Vice president Mike Pence just dodged a question at a press conference about whether he believes the federal funding for Harvey should be offset by cuts elsewhere. Critics have pointed out that as a House member in 2005, Pence argued that the government should provide aid to Hurricane Katrina victims only if the budget was cut in other areas, a controversial stance that has put him and some Texas Republicans in an awkward position this week. Pressed on the question of offsets at the news conference, he said: “President Trump’s top priority now is focusing on rescue and recovery efforts.” He later added: “The resources will be there ... I’m very confident that members of both political parties will work with our administration to rebuild Texas.” US transportation secretary Elaine Chao has just announced $100 million in financial support for Texas infrastructure at an ongoing press conference: Elaine Duke of the Department of Homeland Security said at the news conference that the government has rescued more than 10,000 people from the state and has approved 100,000 requests of individual assistance, totaling $50m. It has become increasingly difficult in parts of Texas for people to fill fuel tanks, according to the Associated Press, which is reporting on a steep increase in pump costs and stations across the region out of gas: In Dallas, lines of cars a block long were common for the few gas stations that had gasoline to sell Thursday. The scene was reminiscent of the gas lines seen during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. One Chevron station in downtown Dallas that sold regular gas for $2.29 a gallon just before the storm was charging $2.99 on Thursday. Others charged well over $3, and one downtown Shell station charged $3.97 for a regular gallon of gas. At three gas stations in north Dallas, yellow bags or caution tape was wrapped around pumps just after noon. The US Department of Energy on Thursday also released 1 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and the White House has said more could flow due to Harvey inundating Gulf Coast refineries and driving up fuel prices, according to Reuters. The US Chemical Safety Board has launched an investigation into the explosions at the Arkema chemical plant in Crosby, Texas. Chairperson Vanessa Allan Sutherland said in a Facebook post that the board has begun a probe that will include significant document requests related to the chemical processes and storage at the site as well as “implications for emergency preparedness and response efforts”. The board will not be deploying its staff until the facility is deemed safe, Sutherland added. President Trump earlier this year proposed eliminating the chemical safety board, drawing strong criticisms, including from Christine Todd Whitman, the former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, who said, “If you want to put the American people in danger this is the way to do it.” Sam Levin here, taking over our ongoing live coverage of tropical storm Harvey, which now has a confirmed death toll of 31 people, a number expected to rise. The AP is now reporting on a Texas A&amp;M University analysis of Houston floodwater samples, showing E coli levels that are 125 times higher than is considered safe for swimming. Walking through the floodwater could lead to infections and other problems, said Terry Gentry, an associate professor in the university’s department of soil and crop sciences. A test in a suburb northwest of Houston showed bacteria levels 15 times above the safe level, according to the AP. Here’s an ABC News segment with more detail: The Environmental Protection Agency and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality have also just released a statement noting that there can be “releases of wastewater from sanitary sewers occur during major flood events”, adding: Floodwaters may contain many hazards, including bacteria and other disease agents. Precautions should be taken by anyone involved in cleanup activities or any others who may be exposed to flood waters. These precautions include heeding all warnings from local and state authorities regarding boil water notices, swimming advisories, or other safety advisories. Harris County, which has seen the majority of deaths from Harvey so far, says its morgue is close to capacity because of storm-related bodies and deaths that are not related to the flooding. Tricia Bentley, spokeswoman for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences said Thursday that funeral homes have been unable to retrieve the bodies in the aftermath of the storm and it has asked for a large refrigerated 18-wheeler to store more of them. The county has confirmed 18 storm-related deaths and is investigating 10 more as potentially Harvey-related. Bentley says the morgue has about 175 bodies total most of them not related to the storm and it has a capacity of 200. The agency has requested approval from the state for the tractor-trailer and expects to receive it Friday. So far, the death toll from Harvey is at least 30. Via the Associated Press The National Weather Service is forecasting flooding in Kentucky and Tennessee as Tropical Depression Harvey travels inland. Forecasters say the storm is expected to drop 2 to 6 in (5 to 15.2 cm) of rain in Kentucky, with the highest totals expected in western Kentucky near the Tennessee border. The heaviest rainfall for a wide swath of the state is expected to start late Thursday and last through Friday afternoon. Forecasters say high winds from the storm could also produce tornadoes. Some locations in Tennessee could get more than 10 in (25.4 cm), though most will get 4 inches to 8 inches (10.1 to 20.3 cm). The say high winds from the storm could also produce tornadoes. The weather service issued a flood warning for areas along several rivers in West Tennessee while a flood watch included the whole region and stretched into Middle Tennessee. Via the Associated Press White House Press Secritary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Donald Trump plans to donate $1m of his own money to relief efforts in Texas and Louisiana. Surprisingly, given the administration’s antipathy for the news media, Huckabee Sanders asks reporters for their help, on behalf of Trump, in choosing a charity to give that money to, “since you are very good at research and have been doing a lot of reporting into the organizations that are best and most effective in providing aid and he’d love some suggestions.” Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert spoke to press from Washington DC, and here are some of the highlights from his update. About 100,000 homes have been damaged by floodwater so far by Harvey. About 7,000 hospital patients will likely by moved to less compromised facilities in the coming days. Cautioned that often a second wave of lost life comes in this phase after a disaster. “people will start using chainsaws, people will remove debris, people will be stressed... tend to get sick,” Bossert said. “Try to avoid strain and stress, try to get where there’s food clothes and shelter.” Did not say whether or not the US would be accepting aid offered by Canada or Mexico. Said a supplemental disaster relief request would be put together by the White House shortly for congress to vote on. On undocumented immigrants: “In terms of immediate lifesaving, no [individuals] should worry about their immigration status unless they’ve committed a crime,” adding that undocumented immigrants in Houston area that have broken the law will be “rounded up” by law enforcement regardless of the ongoing humanitarian disaster. Houston School District Superintendent Richard Carranza tells CNN the district’s first day of school will be September 11. It had originally been scheduled for September 5, but Carranza said there would not have been enough available facilities or employees to start by that date. It’s crazy...It’s an unbelievable testament to the good of people. But now it’s a big task, trying to make sure this money goes directly to the people.” -JJ Watt While Harvey may be raining itself out as it continues to push north and east across the US, it’s potential to inflict serious damage persists. Only round one? Tropical storm Irma will likely strengthen into a Hurricane today and is en route for the Caribbean. Some of the forecast models for the storm have it heading right back into the gulf and the ravaged Texas and Louisiana coastlines. “As we reach the midpoint of the hurricane season and with Hurricane Irma intensifying over the eastern tropical Atlantic, this is a good time for all of us to make some ‘halftime adjustments’. Find out your evacuation zone and plan your evacuation route today, go shopping now to restock supplies, and do everything you can to strengthen your home. Hurricane Irma is expected to become a major hurricane and threatens to affect portions of the Caribbean next week, and then we cannot rule out eventual impacts in the continental U.S. This is the reality of what we contend with during the peak of the season, one that has been forecast to be very active and with three more months to go. -Dr. Rick Knabb Hurricane Expert with The Weather Channel Vice President Mike Pence is in Rockport, Texas survey damage sustained during Harvey. Our Adam Gabbatt has more on the hypocrisy some see in his response to the disaster: ‘What you’re going to see is the national government – and we anticipate the Congress – are going to make the resources available to see Texas through the rescue operation, through the recovery,’ Pence told Houston’s KTRH radio station. It was a fairly standard statement from a politician during a crisis. But in 2005, when the House was weighing a $50bn relief package for Hurricane Katrina, then-congressman Pence was less effusive. ‘As we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do in like circumstances and expects this Congress to do,’ Pence told the House. ‘Let’s figure out how we’re going to pay for it. Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren.”’ The Washington Post is reporting that “amid the many feel-good stories about strangers helping strangers in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, a feel-bad story has almost inevitably surfaced: Scammers are using robo-calls to try to fleece storm survivors.” The robo-calls tell people that their premiums are past due and that they must send money immediately or else have their flood insurance canceled. “That is pure fraud. You should only be taking information from trusted sources,” said Roy E. Wright, director of the National Flood Insurance Program at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Every natural disaster attracts unscrupulous contractors and outright con artists. They’re like disaster parasites, looking to exploit the pain and confusion of a catastrophe for their own profit. “They’re storm chasers. We know they’re here. We’re know they’re coming. Scammers,” said Saundra Brown, who handles disaster response for Lone Star Legal Aid in Houston. The Associated Press is reporting that Congress is gearing up for a vote as early as next week on a multibillion-dollar down payment on relief aid for Harvey. White House and congressional aides said Thursday an emergency request to replenish rapidly shrinking aid reserves is coming from the Trump administration within days and that votes in both the House and Senate would quickly follow. Members of the Texas and Louisiana delegation are pressing for immediate action when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill next week from their summer recess, and they have pledges from top GOP leaders such as Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., that the House will quickly respond. McCarthy told lawmakers from Texas and Louisiana on a conference call late Wednesday that “we are with you.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency is spending existing disaster aid reserves just $2.3 billion as of Wednesday at a high rate. “The president has made very clear that he is here to help and has made very clear he will do what is needed whether it is to implore Congress next week to come up with the funding for those who are affected,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends.” One concern, however, is that the government’s cash reserves are running low since the nation’s debt limit has been reached and the Treasury Department is using accounting measures to cover expenses. Billions of dollars in Harvey aid are an unexpected cost that at least raises the potential that Congress will have to act earlier than expected to increase the government’s borrowing authority. The initial aid money would be a down payment for immediate recovery efforts to be followed by larger packages later on. It will take weeks or months to assess the full extent of the damage and the needs. EPA director Scott Pruitt issued a statement this morning about the ongoing situation at the Arkema chemical plant is Crosby. EPA has emergency response personnel on the scene and the Agency is currently reviewing data received from an aircraft that surveyed the scene early this morning. This information indicates that there are no concentrations of concern for toxic materials reported at this time. “We will consider using any authority we have to further address the situation to protect human health and the environment.” Lines are beginning to form outside stores in Beaumont where both the primary and backup water supply sources have now gone down. With the stench from stagnant waters hanging over parts of the city the Houston health department urged residents to take precautions to minimise contamination and disease. “Practice good hygiene such as hand washing after any contact with #Harvey floodwaters,” it tweeted. “Do not eat any food that came in contact with #Harvey floodwaters. When in doubt, throw it out.” Regular trash collection was due to resume on Thursday but the the Houston Chronicle warned readers that the public health threat was just beginning. “From the bacteria, viruses, and fungi harbored in floodwaters to new breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes to a potentially staggering mental health toll inflicted on those hardest hit by Harvey, the risks are expected to be great,” it said, citing public health experts. Mayor Sylvester Turner said the city remained calm. “No city curfew citations or arrests for a second night in a row. Thank you Houston for your understanding and cooperation,” he tweeted. Overnight police rescued 18 people from floodwaters, he said. “Crisis ebbing but far from over.” Rory Carroll has been inside the Houston convention centre talking to folks stranded by Harvey. Here’s some of what he’s heard: Enrique Martinez, 29, office administrator “Our house and car got flood, no power or water, so we came here on Monday. The first night only my grandmother had a cot, the rest of us slept on the floor. “She needs dialysis so we’re leaving today for my uncle’s house. It’ll be easier to get her medical treatment from there.” Aaron Reynolds, 30, entrepreneur “This shelter is fucked up. There were people having sex two cots down from me. Bed bugs. And fleas from people’s dogs. I got bit all over. “And you can’t go out at night. It’s like prison. I’m moving to a hotel today.” Dimon Brody, 22, student and leasing consultant “I’ve been volunteering at the information desk, giving people maps, telling them where to go, what’s happening. It’s been challenging. “Last night a man had a seizure. We put him in the recovery position until paramedics arrived. Overall it’s been enjoyable. I like giving back to people in need.” Charlene Hamilton, 58, retired nurse “When I woke on Sunday the water was up to my chest. I’ve got arthritis but I was able to get out the living room window with some help. I’m blessed to be alive. “Everyone here is helpful and nice, they’re wonderful. I’ve no flood insurance but as long as I keep focusing on the Lord I know I can make it through this. I lost stuff but stuff can be replaced. I still have my life.” Read more: Our Rory Carroll reports that, in part of Harvey-battered Houston, dry land, normalcy and hope are finally coming back in view: “It’s dry as far as you can see,” said Liz Spencer, 64, an artist, who viewed a panorama from a skyscraper’s 45th floor. She was now out walking with her nine-year-old granddaughter Ivy and had just scooped up some litter. “This feels like the start of getting back to a normal state of affairs.” The mayor, Sylvester Turner, struck a similar tone at a news conference, calling for the city to return to routine as swiftly as possible. Airports were due to reopen with limited service later on Wednesday and schools will reopen on 5 September, he said. “Let’s play ball, let’s keep moving.” It was a marked contrast to the mayhem Harvey’s second landfall was unleashing on Port Arthur a hundred miles east and to the widespread devastation in outlying areas of Houston, where aerial footage showed entire communities still submerged. Grim news will continue to unfold as waters recede, revealing more bodies – the official death toll stood at 23 – and the scale of damage. Some analysts estimate it will exceed $100bn. Yet downtown Houston, which this week celebrates its 181st birthday, was already showing the first, halting steps towards recovery, or at least normality. Good morning. Jamiles Lartey here with our continuing coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. We’re leading off with the situation at the Arkema chemical plant in Crosby, Texas. Early on Thursday morning a trailer containing liquid organic peroxide compounds caught fire, sending thick plumes of acrid black smoke into the air and forcing 14 sheriff’s deputies who responded to hospital with smoke inhalation injuries. All but two had been released as of Thursday morning. In a press conference around 8.30am local time an Arkema executive said that given the condition of the plant, the company fully expected the remaining eight trailers to experience similar combustion events. The compounds require cooling to remain stable and Arkema has seen four levels of cooling redundancy go down due to floodwater according to a spokesman. “We believe that the safest thing to do is to allow the other eight containers to degrade and burn,” said Rich Rennard, an Arkema executive. “These things can burn very quickly and very violently and it would not be unusual for them to explode.” In the press conference, Harris County law enforcement officials explained that they were enforcing a 1.5 mile evacuation zone around the plant, going door to door and asking residents to leave. There was confusion during the press conference as local law enforcement and the Arkema executive offered different take on exactly what kind of public health impact the compromised organic peroxides might have. Harris County sheriff Ed Gonzalez and fire marshal Bob Royall initially indicated that the smoke and any related fumes were non-toxic and would be no more or less dangerous to inhale than that from a BBQ pit or a campfire. Pressed on the same question, Rennard refused to agree with that assessment. “I heard the comment,” Rennard said. “I don’t want to make any comparison on the kind of smoke that’s coming from our fire. The smoke is noxious. Toxicity is relative thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/sep/01/losers-weepers-readers-stories-lost-property-honesty-greed","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T09:41:45Z","webTitle":"Losers weepers?

An academic who taught it in Egypt has been accused, by her own university, of spreading “destructive ideas” that have disturbed “public order … in an anarchic call disguised as a comparative literature textual analysis”. Most strikingly, she is accused of “glorifying Satan”. The 10,000-line poem, one of the most influential in English literature, displays the vanquished Satan’s attempt at revenge as he journeys through the universe towards Eden to tempt Adam and Eve, before all three are punished by God. But Milton’s portrayal of his most striking character isn’t what the Egyptian authorities think it is. While we may certainly feel sympathy for him and even admire his ambition, we also see his obvious and fatal flaws, not least entering a face-off against God that even he admits is unwinnable. I spent six years writing a book about Milton in the Arab-Muslim World, which involved visiting students and tutors at universities across the region, and investigating the poem in light of the modern-day political, social and religious context. One particularly eye-opening moment was when a group of Cairo-based students explained that they understood their own value systems better after encountering Milton’s Satan, though one of them quickly added that her parents wouldn’t have allowed her to read Paradise Lost if they knew what it was about. I noticed a range of themes that spoke directly to these students. Muslims believe in Satan’s existence more than any other group today. Belief in his day-to-day impact remains a part of popular culture, which links the devil to sinning, anger, nightmares and, in more remote regions, black magic and exorcism. Many Muslims still enter rooms with their right feet and eat with their right hands so the devil doesn’t join them. While Satan isn’t mentioned in Genesis, the Qur’an has well over a hundred references to him, and far from being silenced in Islamic tradition, he plays a key role in differentiating truth from falsity. Milton’s is probably the most astute representation of a complex, psychologically driven Satan in the history of literature. More important, given its current political situation, the Arab world could really benefit from a good dose of Milton, particularly his Satan. Put plainly, Milton was a revolutionary and Paradise Lost is an anti-authoritarian text. A staunch republican at a time when most people believed that the monarch was divinely chosen, Milton advocated the execution of King Charles I in 1649 before serving in Oliver Cromwell’s government. As if that wasn’t enough, he also spoke out against the Catholic church, didn’t believe in the trinity and wrote pamphlets about the merits of divorce. By the time he came to write Paradise Lost, he had lost his sight and, with the monarchy restored, he was under house arrest with many of his friends having been executed. Satan’s opposition to God in the poem has long been interpreted as a metaphor for republican opposition to the monarchy. Any apparent glorification of Satan in the poem, then, might be down to Milton’s belief that seemingly unchallengeable systems should indeed be challenged. That’s why one Kurdish columnist during Saddam Hussein’s time defended Satan’s challenge to authority as “motivated only by his revolutionary emotion”. But it’s also why, at the start of the uprisings against Bashar al-Assad, a Syrian state newspaper warned citizens about reading the recently translated poem, reminding them that Satan’s rebellion against God was unsuccessful and that Milton’s republicanism ended disastrously. Like God and the monarchy, the article concluded, the Assad regime will win out. Despite its fluctuations, the Arab spring has shown how millions of people realised that overthrowing long-established regimes isn’t the distant dream it once was, but a possibility worth pursuing. At its heart, Milton’s work is concerned with the problem of unshakable hierarchy, especially when it appears unjustified. Satan doesn’t understand why God’s new creation, the Son, is given a higher status than him. He wonders why the fallen angels are either imprisoned in the dungeons of hell or killed in massive numbers (like Milton’s fellow rebels). Both detention and mass executions chime with the responses of Arab states to any form of dissent against the established powers. And the hierarchies imposed in the Arab world aren’t limited to dictatorships, but can extend to the coercive nature of globalisation, to unashamed patriarchy, and to anything that is elevated to a sacred and unimpeachable status: supreme monarchies, militaries, institutions and public figures. Arabs reading such a daring text may question the establishments that have controlled them for decades, whether in the name of religion or nationalism. Milton’s Satan also offers insights into the danger of new forms of authoritarianism and the use of appealing principles or rhetoric. To begin with, Satan is a great public orator, a populist figure for the fallen angels. By the end, he faces their “public scorn”. God punishes the fallen angels by taking away their ability to talk: a stark reminder of modern day censorship, but also of the flaws of sacred, idealised figures and how today’s hero can become tomorrow’s villain. Though Suez University bemoans the fact that by reading an imaginative version of Satan’s story we are “rejecting that which is sacred in favour of the authority of the human mind”, to me, questioning authority and individual reflection both sound quite useful. Particularly in these troubled and troubling times. • Islam Issa is a lecturer in English literature and the author of Milton in the Arab-Muslim World"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/31/kofi-annan-uk-freedom-of-movement-brexit-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:36:36Z","webTitle":"Kofi Annan says UK should allow freedom of movement after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/kofi-annan-uk-freedom-of-movement-brexit-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/31/kofi-annan-uk-freedom-of-movement-brexit-eu","fields":{"headline":"Kofi Annan says UK should allow freedom of movement after Brexit","bodyText":"Free movement of people is an absolutely essential human right that Britain should abide by after it leaves the European Union, former UN secretary general Kofi Annan has said. In an interview with the Guardian, Annan said it was a shame that Britain was leaving the EU and urged ministers to find a solution to protect the rights of foreign workers after March 2019. “Without that right, without freedom of movement, it is very difficult for individuals to live their lives to the fullest and live their dreams. To live is to choose, life is choices, and that often entails movement,” he said. “Movement in search of one’s dreams, movement in search of something meaningful to do, movement in running away from persecution. It is absolutely essential.” Annan, secretary general of the UN between 1997 and 2006, made his comments ahead of a visit to Hull where he will deliver the annual Wilberforce lecture on Saturday. The Nobel peace prize winner will address the theme of freedom in the 21st century during the speech at Hull city hall. Annan said he hoped freedom of movement between Britain and the EU would not end in March 2019. He said: “I hope one will be able to find a solution because we live in such an interdependent world and the European system – the European Union – has been so successful. “Let’s not forget it came up after two large wars in the last century. But today the system of changes, the system of cooperation and working together has been so successful that a war in Europe is today unthinkable. “That has been the outcome of this cooperation and, if you wish, a celebration of diversity in various countries and cultures living side-by-side and working together. I think it would be a shame to dismantle that.” Annan said he sensed a determination among the EU’s remaining 27 member states to make the union “even more successful and much more efficient and effective” following the UK referendum result last June. “I think the Brexit experience has woken up lots of countries and people around the continent,” he said. “I think it’s a shame because Britain has made lots of contributions and has also gained a lot [from the EU]. A united Europe, a strong Europe, has an important role to play in the world and we should not underestimate that.” The Ghanaian diplomat, who backed the remain campaign before the referendum, said he did not wish to interfere in British politics but said: “Brexit is turning out to be much more complicated than those who advocated it thought. Now they are at the stage of working out the details. “I don’t know what will happen and how successful it would be, or whether one will have a rethink and reconsider the issues, but that is something for the British citizens and their government to decide.” He was critical of the “take back control” slogan used by prominent Brexiters including Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and said British ministers would return to more moderate language during the difficult negotiations ahead with Brussels. “I think we are at the beginning of the process and I hope the outcome in the end will be something satisfactory for everyone and will protect the interest of the individuals,” he said. “In the end, I hope we will not be hearing a repeat of such phrases as ‘taking back our boundaries’.” Annan was invited to Hull by John Prescott, the former deputy prime minister, to deliver the Wilberforce lecture to remember the work of Hull-born abolitionist William Wilberforce, who lobbied to ban the slave trade and introduced anti-slavery motions in parliament.

According to the latest figures released by the UN’s refugee agency, 4,337 people are believed to have drowned since September 2016 while attempting to reach European shores. Most departed from Libya bound for Italy, from Turkey bound for Greece or, more recently, from Morocco bound for Spain. A further 4,185 people died in the previous 12 months, from 1 September 2015 until the end of August 2016. The figures have been released by the UNHCR to mark the second anniversary of the Syrian boy’s death, which has also inspired Khaled Hosseini, the bestselling author of The Kite Runner, to write a short story about a Syrian father and son facing an uncertain future on a boat. Hosseini’s short story, Sea Prayer, has been transformed into a virtual reality project published by the Guardian on Friday, made in collaboration with the UNHCR. In it, the protagonist pleads with the waters to keep his child safe. Hosseini, a UNHCR goodwill ambassador, has been an advocate for refugees since 2006, travelling to Afghanistan, Chad, Iraq, Jordan and Uganda. Photographs of Alan’s body lying face down on the sand near the Turkish resort of Bodrum on 2 September 2015 dominated front pages worldwide, and touched a nerve with Hosseini. “The way I thought about it, when I saw the photo, was all the unseen work that goes into the raising of a child,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “All the private worries, the private anxieties … We worry and fret over their wellbeing, and to have done all that work, and see the person that you poured all that love and all that passion and all that work into, and to see that body lying face down on the beach …” The UNHCR said that although the number of refugees arriving in Europe had “drastically decreased” since Alan’s death, perilous sea journeys continued to result in the deaths of thousands. Clampdowns on routes to Europe via Libya and restrictions imposed on the Turkey-Greece route are partly responsible for the reduction in the number of people arriving, but this is leading hundreds to risk their lives crossing the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco to Spain on inflatable vessels and rickety fishing boats. The refugee agency urged the international community to take action to prevent further tragedies, saying in a statement that if poor conditions continued in countries such as Syria, people “will continue to gamble their lives making desperate journeys”. “Many of the children trying to reach Europe travel on their own, making the journey even more terrifying and perilous,” the UNHCR said. “This was the case for 92% of the 13,700 children who arrived to Italy by sea in the first seven months of 2017.” According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 120,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, with about 82% travelling to Italy from Libya. In June, Italian coastguards rescued about 5,000 people in one day in the Mediterranean. In August, 600 people were rescued by the Spanish maritime safety and rescue agency and the Red Cross in a single day. They arrived in at least 15 different vessels off the coast of Tarifa. Hosseini, whose books have sold 38m copies worldwide, was once a refugee himself, arriving in the US at the age of 15 speaking little English. His father was an Afghan diplomat working in Paris, and the family fled to the US after the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Hosseini practised as a doctor before embarking on his writing career."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/01/rudd-rabb-or-rees-mogg-readers-on-the-next-tory-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T13:51:47Z","webTitle":"Rudd, Rabb or...

Rees-Mogg? Readers on the next Tory leader","bodyText":"Theresa May says she’s not going anywhere, telling television interviewers she “is in this for the long term” while touting for post-Brexit business in Japan. But some Tories have said it would be difficult for May to fight another election – due in 2022 – and instead expect her to stand aside for fresh leadership in 2019. We asked our readers – some Tory-supporting, others significantly less so – who they think is best qualified to lead the Conservatives into the next election. Ruth Davidson The Scottish Conservative leader would need to stand as a Westminster MP if she was to lead the party - something she has ruled out, at least for now. But a lot of our readers felt that Davidson has something all the other candidates lack. David, a Green voter in Bristol, said Davidson was “a unifying, modernising figure that could bring the country together – and that should be a top priority. “She would certainly provide a major challenge to Labour.” David Davis If Brexit negotiations are a success – and it’s a big if – could David Davis be best placed to lead the Tories into an election? “He’s the only Tory MP that will be able to reach out to a broader cross section the party and the country, positioning himself as someone in tune with and delivering for the British people on the referendum results, as a Leave campaigner himself,” argues James Davies in London. Philip Hammond Seen as one of the most pro-Remain figures in cabinet, Hammond was the target of negative briefings in the summer by more pro-Brexit figures. But he was a popular, “safe pair of hands” candidate with our reders. “Hammond talks common non-ideological sense when it comes to Europe. He’s the only one in cabinet with a level head and a sense of proportion,” said Hugh Allen. Amber Rudd Amber Rudd impressed many in the party with her campaigning in the lead up to the June election, the only problem being she only barely managed to cling on to her own seat. Would her wafer thin majority of 346 put her off from considering a leadership bid? “Rudd has the capability to mount an eloquent and convincing defence of the party’s track record, the absence of which undoubtedly led to a poor general election performance this year. She has also indicated sensible centrist sympathies on matters such as Brexit, which will be seen as an advantage with voters in the City, said Michael in Surrey. Jacob Rees-Mogg Right-wing backbench MP, constant media presence and occasional Twitter meme Jacob Rees-Mogg has been talked up as a potential leader, though the man himself described leadership talk as a side-effect of the August “silly season” – albeit not too convincingly. Nevertheless he was very popular with some of our right-leaning readers. Raj Patel, in London, said Rees-Mogg is “very charismatic and articulate, he comes across well on television and radio and he can get people’s attention and enthusiasm – particularly people who don’t usually vote Tory. “I’ve been quite pleasantly surprised with the empathy he’s shown for ordinary people in recent months: post-Grenfell being a good example.” Dominic Raab Another pro-Brexit leadership suggestion from readers searching for a “fresh face” to lead party, Raab came under pressure for his comments on users of foodbanks earlier in the summer, but is seen as one of the more reasonable figures on the party’s pro-Brexit wing. “Raab is young(ish), a fresh face to many, and on the right in a way that would satisfy the members but not frighten the electoral horses,” said Freddy Starmer in London. “He’s also a Brexiteer, which is important, but not a rabid one.” Who would you like to see as the next Tory leader?

This summer Marcelo Bielsa took charge of Lille and quickly compiled a list of 11 players whom he did not plan to use – and then he relayed the news by text message. Between them the XI had 274 caps, with Nigeria’s Vincent Enyeama holding 101 of those. He seemed unlikely to add to that tally but now, as the Super Eagles face a critical pair of World Cup qualifiers against Cameroon, the African champions, many of his compatriots wish they could call on a goalkeeper of Enyeama’s pedigree. Technically Nigeria could still have called on Enyeama. The goalkeeper has suggested he is open to returning to international duty, from which he withdrew two years ago following a dispute with the then manager Sunday Oliseh. But as he is out of favour at his club and not match fit, Gernot Rohr reckoned the 35-year-old was not the man to help them out of their predicament. Carl Ikeme had proved an accomplished successor over the past two years but the Wolverhampton Wanderers man has been rising to a more important challenge since a diagnosis of acute leukaemia in July. That left Rohr with a big decision to make for the double-header with Cameroon, which kicks off later today in Uyo, followed by the return match in Yaoundé on Monday. Of the three goalkeepers in his squad, none jumped out as an obvious No1. “We have a local goalkeeper [Ikechukwu Ezenwa of Ifeanyi Ubah FC], we have a very young one [20‑year‑old Dele Alampasu] and we have another one who is more experienced [31-year-old Daniel Akpeyi], so we will see with our goalkeeper coaches to determine who starts the game,” said Rohr earlier in the week. Since then his options have been reduced, as Akpeyi suffered an injury in training. Previously Rohr had plumped for Akpeyi’s experience. The Chippa United keeper started the last World Cup qualifier against Algeria, when Ikeme was unavailable and Nigeria took their record in a formidable group to two wins from two matches with a 3-1 home victory. But Algeria’s goal in that match was struck from 30 yards by Nabil Bentaleb and Akpeyi got nowhere near it; and in June he was redeployed for an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against South Africa, with the fact that he plays his club football there (for Chippa United) considered an added advantage. But he was among several Nigerians to underperform as the Super Eagles lost 2-0 at home, their first competitive defeat by Bafana Bafana and their first of any kind under Rohr, who was appointed a year ago. Although Akpeyi warned afterwards against over-the-top reactions, calls inevitably came for the gloves to be entrusted to Alampasu. That would have been audacious. Alampasu has been much admired since excelling in Nigeria’s conquest of the under-17 World Cup in 2013 but he has yet to make a senior appearance and, indeed, has not made a start this season for his club, Feirense in Portugal. Throwing him in against Cameroon would be a spectacular show of faith. Or of scepticism in the other option. On Thursday Rohr announced a decision that he hopes minimises the risk: the goalkeeping mission has been assigned to Ezenwa, a 28-year-old who had been the regular No2 behind Ikeme but saw Akpeyi promoted ahead of him when the Wolves’ keeper was forced out of action. Friday is the biggest match of Ezenwa’s international career. Alampasu may not have been picked this time, but Nigeria will field various other representatives of an exciting generation of Nigerian players. Already significant impacts have been made by Leicester’s pair of 20-year-olds, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho, with the former one of the few players to come out of the South Africa defeat with credit. Two others were the forward Moses Simon, a 22-year-old who plays for Gent, and Etebo Oghenekaro, 21-year-old midfielder who is a club-mate of Alampasu at Feirense (where he is a regular starter) and had shone against Algeria. Rohr could also give a debut to Ola Aina, the 20-year-old right-back who is on loan to Hull City from Chelsea and is the latest overseas-born player to declare for Nigeria, following other bright prospects such as Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi (21) and Bursaspor’s Netherlands-born centre-back William Ekong (23). The two outstanding players in the win over Algeria were Victor Moses, a senior player at 26, and Mikel John Obi, still influential no matter that he is now a China-based 30-year-old. That was made clear against South Africa when, without Mikel, there was a hesitancy about the midfield and then, after they fell behind, a headlessness as they pursued an equaliser with ruinous abandon. Ndidi looks certain to prove a fine replacement, probably even an upgrade, for Mikel in the long run, but he may be the one to make way for the veteran against Cameroon. The visitors, meanwhile, arrive needing at least four points from the double-header, or six if they are to emerge on top of the group. They, too, are without a fine goalkeeper as Ajax’s André Onana is one of nine players, including Liverpool’s Joël Matip, to abstain from international duty because of the interminable machinations of various officials at the Cameroon FA (Fécafoot). Almost everything the truly Indomitable Lions have achieved in recent years, including January’s victory at the Africa Cup of Nations, has been despite the activities of their FA. Last week Fifa appointed a “normalisation committee” in an effort to end four years of feuding at Fécafoot so that the decision to award the country hosting rights for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations ends up looking more sensible than it currently does. In the meantime, Cameroon players take on Nigeria in the hope that they can yet again triumph amid adversity. And Onana’s absence will not affect them because they have a wealth of talent in that position, with their regular starter, 21-year-old Fabrice Ondoa, an excellent goalkeeper. Nigeria hope that he is not the difference between the teams over the coming days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/02/salman-rushdie-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Salman Rushdie: ‘A lot of what Trump unleashed was there anyway’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/02/salman-rushdie-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/02/salman-rushdie-interview","fields":{"headline":"Salman Rushdie: ‘A lot of what Trump unleashed was there anyway’","bodyText":"The image that came to Salman Rushdie, around which he would build his new novel, was an enclosed garden in downtown Manhattan. It is a space that exists in real life (although, as one of the characters in The Golden House observes, real life is a category from which it is increasingly hard to distinguish less reliable entities) and with which Rushdie is familiar; old friends inhabit one of the houses backing on to the garden. “The idea of there being a secret space inside this noisy public space,” he says. “I had this lightbulb moment that it was like a theatre – with a Greek tragedy, amphitheatre quality – where the characters could enact their stories. It also had a Rear Window quality, of being able to spy on everybody else’s lives. At that point, the Golden family decided they wanted to move in.” We are in the offices of Andrew Wylie, Rushdie’s agent of 30 years – “my longest relationship!” he says gleefully – a mile north of Rushdie’s apartment in lower Manhattan. He is looking particularly Rushdie-esque today: part rumpled intellectual, part something less sober. At 70, Rushdie has had more public incarnations than most writers of literary fiction – brilliant novelist, man on the run, subject of tabloid scorn and government dismay, social butterfly, and, in that singularly British designation, man lambasted for being altogether too Up Himself – but it is often overlooked what good company he is. His humour this morning is not caustic, nor ironised, nor filtered through any of the more protected modes of engagement, but is a kind of jolliness – a giggly delight – that simply makes him a good laugh to hang out with. The Golden family are transplants to New York from Mumbai (or “Bombay” as the author continues to call it in conversation, with what feels like particularly Rushdian obstinacy), an outlandishly wealthy father and his three dysfunctional sons in flight from a personal tragedy; the loss of their mother during the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. We never discover their “real” names; on arriving in the US, the patriarch renames himself Nero Golden – Rushdie, anticipating a collective eye-roll perhaps, points out in the novel this is no more ridiculous a name than Huckleberry Finn or Ichabod Crane – and tests the principle that the US is a place where one can leave one’s past at the door. It is an issue with which Rushdie is intimately familiar; the split in identity, the ability to shed one’s skin after a trauma and potentially skip off scot-free, and he explores both the impossibility and, ultimately, the undesirability of this. That the novel opens with the inauguration of Barack Obama and closes with the election of President Trump, “the Joker” as Rushdie brands him, is the novelist’s reminder there is no progress in history that can’t be undone. The week of our meeting last month, reverberations from the fascist march in Charlottesville are still being felt, along with myriad other stories from Trump’s White House. “I remember when there wasn’t that much news,” says Rushdie, “when the biggest news of the day used to be that Charlie Sheen did cocaine. Now there are 10 colossal news stories a day.” It would seem to be a bad time to be a novelist and if Rushdie’s new novel seeks to compete with real life, it is by retreating from the polemicism of so much news and social media to get inside a non-partisan reality. There are a lot of topical references in The Golden House – from “no-platforming” and illiberal campus activism to the transgender debate and other iterations of identity politics, which Rushdie approaches as symptoms of a broader cultural change. “In America when you talk about identity issues, at the moment a lot of that is gender identity. If you’re in England, there’s this other argument about national identity, which was behind the Brexit catastrophe; and in India, when people talk about identity, they’re really talking about religious sectarianism. In all three places, the identity subject is colossal but it is understood completely differently. I was thinking about that, too.” Although Rushdie is of a vintage inclined to get grumpy about aspects of the gender identity debate – the suggested replacement of he/she with a spectrum of alternative gender markers – he tried to remain open-minded. “I wanted to approach the subject completely not judgmentally, just get into it. What is it? All this language stuff. The 73 pronouns, all of that. I’m a writer, I should know this. The point was to enter into it as seriously as I could and present it without preachiness. And I think in real life that’s what’s happening; people are wrestling with it. And they don’t always resolve it properly for themselves.” One of the novel’s protagonists works at the “Museum of Identity”, a mildly satirical invention that “I was very happy to have come up with”, says Rushdie, “and that I’m sure will exist in the next five years”. Meanwhile, Nero Golden’s youngest son, D, struggles to suppress his transgender leanings. “This modern obsession with identity revolts me,” says D. “It is a way of narrowing us until we are like aliens to one another. Have you read Arthur Schlesinger? He opposes perpetuating marginalisation through affirmations of difference.” This sounds less like the talk of the 20-something fictional character and more like the novelist addressing the reader. Rushdie isn’t persuaded that solipsism on the left contributed to the rise of Trump, nor that economic disparity was the only cause. “I had a lecture gig in a city called Vero Beach in Florida: big audience, older people, quite affluent, very well educated, and almost all Trump voters,” he says. “Not at all the cliche of the ignorant blue-collar Trump voter. These were people with college degrees who’d had highly paid jobs, many retired, readers.” When the author mentioned climate change, he says, “this gentleman – they were all very courteous – disagreed with me and he said: ‘When you say that all the scientists agree on this, that’s not true.’ And I said: ‘Yeah, it is true actually.’ And he said: ‘No it’s not.’ And I said: ‘Sir, we can’t go on like this, it’s silly. But let me put it to you this way: if you say the world is flat, it doesn’t make the world flat. The world doesn’t need you to agree that it’s round in order to be round, because there’s this thing called evidence.’” Did he get the impression these positions were held partly as a way to punish condescending liberals? “Well, I do think there’s some of that; this idea that the elite is now the educated class, rather than the wealthy class, so you’ve got a government with more billionaires in it than ever in history, but we’re the elite – journalists and college professors and novelists, not the ones with private planes and beach front properties in the Bahamas. It’s a weird time.” Rushdie has been in the US for more than 15 years, but he is still on the outside, a survivor, or beneficiary depending on your view, of a double displacement, first as a child moving from India to England to attend boarding school and then as an adult, when he left London for New York in 2000. It is a gift, he says, “to feel really connected to three places”, and it has nourished his fiction. The 70th anniversary of partition this year reminded one of the startling effect of Midnight’s Children when it was published in 1981, Rushdie’s second novel that is still unmatched for exuberance and a sense of talent unleashed. His third novel, Shame, cemented his reputation, since when he has produced novels ranging wildly across the spectrum between here and there, now and then, fantasy and reality. Fury, Rushdie’s 2001 novel, was a less intimate portrait of New York than The Golden House, his panoramic social novel of the city. While his two sons, Zafar, who is in his late 30s, and 20-year-old Milan, both live in London, Rushdie feels his roots in the US have deepened enough to get inside the city with something like the assurance with which he tackles London and Mumbai. (His youngest son, meanwhile, is threatening to move in with him in New York, as 20-year-olds will, reminding Rushdie that “children take up a lot of time and brain space”. He smiles. “But on the other hand, there are rewards.” ) And of course Trump came as a great shock. Rushdie recalls sitting next to him in Madison Square Garden many years ago, at a Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash concert, accompanied by “the then much younger Ivanka and the disgusting boys. And the thing that surprised me was that he was on his feet and knew all the words to all the songs. Donald Trump knows the words to “Woodstock”?!” Setting the novel against the backdrop of the years preceding Trump’s election was not only a way of creating an elegy to the Obama era, but of suggesting that Trump didn’t emerge from a vacuum. “One of the reasons why I think it was possible to write the book is that a lot of what Trump represents and unleashed was there anyway, if you were looking properly, and would not have been destroyed by his defeat. Once you take the cork out of the bottle, things fly out.” And while the rise and fall of Obama’s US – “the journey from that moment of optimism to its antithesis” – gave the novel a structural symmetry that has, says Rushdie, “horrible to say it, but a formally pleasing quality”, he is clear of the connection between then and now. “A big chunk of white America has been unable to stand the fact that for eight years there was a black man in the White House. Couldn’t stand it. And unfortunately Hillary was a bad candidate, and I think everybody underestimated, including me, the incredible hatred for her, including among leftwing people, young people and women.” ... All successful people are status aware, but it is a rather endearing quality in Rushdie, who is either disinclined or unable to disguise it. It was there in Joseph Anton, his 2012 memoir (the title is the pseudonym he assumed while living for 10 years under the fatwa) and in which his willingness to appear in less than flattering light – going on bitchily about his ex-wives, grumbling about protection officers calling him “Joe”, documenting the end of his marriage to Elizabeth West and the infatuation that led to his marriage to Padma Lakshmi – made it a more revealing memoir than most, although it was hard to know, at times, whether this was due to a surfeit of self-awareness or its opposite. When he first joined Twitter, he says, “one and a quarter million people rushed in my direction. Which sounds like a lot until you look at people who really have a lot – Stephen Fry, Neil Gaiman, and so on, and that’s before you get to the real aristocrats, Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, the gods.” He giggles. “Even down here among writers a million people is a lot, so that was nice, to feel that you were having a conversation with a lot of people who were interested in you and your work, because it’s a self-selecting group.” Twitter suited Rushdie, his belligerence and his sense of fun. He rolled up his sleeves and got stuck into fights and responded to people with puny numbers of followers. He was funny and generous and not at all like the popular view of him as pompous, plaintive, pain-in-the-arse Rushdie. Then, as has happened with many early fans of the platform, “I began to really dislike the tone of voice of Twitter. This kind of snarky, discourteous, increasingly aggressive tone of voice. I just thought I don’t like this. These people would not speak like this if they were sitting in a room with you. I had planned to stop earlier and then it was the election campaign and I got into it, and the last thing I tweeted was this pathetic tweet, having just voted: ‘Looking forward to President Hillary’.” He laughs. “After which total silence. And I thought, just stop, and I did and I haven’t missed it for one second.” Too much exposure to strangers online can collapse one’s faith in humanity. In the novel, Rushdie refers to “synderesis”, the philosophical principle that people are born with an innate moral consciousness directing them towards good. Does he believe that? “I think there is an ethical sense,” he says. “I do believe that we’re born with a need to know what is right and wrong, which is why children accept the instruction of parents on the subject. We need to know what are the boundaries of good and bad behaviour in order to function in the world. I don’t think we automatically know what is right or wrong, but I think we have the desire to know.” These are hard calls at the moment, when the very nature of reality and the meaning of “facts” are in dispute, long before one gets to the big existential questions. In the wake of Charlottesville, the issue for the left has been to what extent should one tolerate the intolerant and defend their right to freedom of speech. “I think the great boundary is to not tolerate people who would destroy the world that makes it able to tolerate people,” says Rushdie. “That’s the great mistake made in Germany during the rise of nazism, which was to allow it to rise through the ballot box and then abolish the ballot box. Something similar happened in Algeria, where the old administration thought that they would defeat the insurgent FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] and GIA [Armed Islamic Group] by letting them run for election and defeating them. Instead they ran for election and won and then abolished elections. There is a limiting point. If the thing that is happening would destroy the system that allows it to happen, that’s a deal breaker. I’m a huge admirer of and supporter of the ACLU [the American Civil Liberties Union, which defended the marchers’ right to protest] and I give them money and so on, but I think they might have been wrong about Charlottesville. I think when people are running over other people with motor cars, that’s not legitimate free speech. And they went there for a fight. And got it.” This is, of course, the “provocation” argument which was directed at Rushdie during the years of the fatwa; “oh, well, he brought it on himself, he went looking for a fight and found it”. “Provocation” was also the word used by Francine Prose about the offence caused by some of the cartoons in Charlie Hebdo, the satirical French magazine. Along with other high profile members of PEN, she withdrew from a PEN event at which the magazine was to be honoured in 2015. “Provocation is simply not the same as heroism,” wrote Prose, a statement for which Rushdie attacked her on Twitter. These weren’t just fellow writers, but old friends: Peter Carey, Michael Ondaatje and Prose herself, who had been Rushdie’s vice-president when he was president of PEN. “Those people were wrong,” he says now. “In light of what’s happened in France subsequently, I hope they’re embarrassed. Because it’s quite clear that people can get killed for anything. Get killed for going out to a club on Friday night. The idea that that particular group of people in some way called down their own damnation is not even tenable. It was a terrible division inside PEN and it’s left some very bad wounds; Francine and I don’t talk any more – and we go back.” Rushdie won’t hold with the argument that the cartoons were racist. “There was a problem of taking up positions before they really looked for information. For instance, Le Monde had done a survey of Charlie Hebdo covers over a 10‑year period: 520 covers. And the number of covers that dealt with Islam was six. The number of covers dealing with Catholicism, or Israel, was much higher. But then hundreds and hundreds attacking the Front National and Sarkozy. So here you have this anti-racist, anti-state little paper, which is being accused of being an organ of the establishment and racist. The exact opposite of what it is. And I said: ‘Just look at this. And think again.’ And nobody thought again. I’d met one or two of the people who were killed and they were just these … sweethearts. These old, soixante-huitard lefties. And nobody read the fucking magazine.” He laughs. “Another big French survey showed that a very substantial majority of French Muslims identifies as primarily secular, and only a small minority identifies as religious. I thought: ‘Look at this; they don’t care. They have real issues of employment and racism and this isn’t the thing that’s attacking them.’ Anyway it was a horrible fight and it has left damage. I did patch it up with Michael O. I’ve been friends with Michael since 1980.” But no other fences were mended. There is an assumption that Rushdie has been pushed to a more extreme position on Islam because of the years of the fatwa, something he finds irritating and belittling. He does react very strongly against bullying, but along with everything else at the moment, who is the bully and who the victim is a question on which no one can agree. Trump, he says, “is someone who has successfully bullied the country”, and there is bullying elsewhere on the political spectrum. Did it, I wonder, give Rushdie any satisfaction to see Germaine Greer, who was unsupportive of him during the years of the fatwa, be “no-platformed” for her remarks about transgenderism? “No, I felt sad for her. I felt it’s so stupid. I hate it when the liberal progressive left becomes stupid. Because we’re supposed to be smarter and they’re supposed to be stupid. I’ve known Germaine since the dawn of time, and we’re not close, but I thought that was stupid.” Brexit has been depressing him, too. “It made me think I’ve been wrong about this place all this time. And I know, anecdotally, that rudeness towards people with brown skin and eastern European accents has exploded. People going up to people on the bus and saying: ‘We’ve voted now so when are you leaving?’ In the same way as Trump here has enabled the far right.” Rushdie thinks he might like to write about the Other Side next; the part of the US that is, to those living in downtown New York, completely alien. “I have an itch to get outside the bubble. There’s such a rift in this country. Maybe you have to go to the other side of the rift.” The Golden House, viewed as representative of a social class and wealth category rather than characters moving around a fictional space, may attract the remark “check your privilege”, which Rushdie responds to by saying of course that’s what people said about The Great Gatsby; “who cares about these rich people?” They’ll still say it, I suggest. “Well,” says Rushdie, momentarily eliding into his image as impossibly grand, “read another book.” And he bursts into laughter. • The Golden House is published by Jonathan Cape."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/31/alexis-sanchez-manchester-city-arsenal-improved-bid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T16:45:00Z","webTitle":"Alexis Sánchez to stay after Arsenal run out of time to sign Thomas Lemar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/31/alexis-sanchez-manchester-city-arsenal-improved-bid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/31/alexis-sanchez-manchester-city-arsenal-improved-bid","fields":{"headline":"Alexis Sánchez to stay after Arsenal run out of time to sign Thomas Lemar","bodyText":"Alexis Sánchez is staying at Arsenal, after seeing a £60m move to Manchester City collapse on deadline day. Arsenal were open, in the end, to selling him to City, despite a summer of insistences to the contrary, but they maintained they would do so only if they could sign a new attacking player. Monaco’s Thomas Lemar was the one they wanted and, incredibly, they met the Ligue 1 champions’ €100m (£92m) asking price. City, meanwhile, put forward a second cash offer for Sánchez, which was worth £55m plus £5m in add-ons. Arsenal were inclined to accept it. But with Lemar playing for France against Holland in a World Cup qualifier – he scored twice in a 4-0 victory on Thursday night – Arsenal said they ran out of time to conclude what would have been a complicated financial package – not to mention put Lemar through a medical. And so, to the disappointment of Sánchez, who had pushed for the move, he found the path to the Etihad Stadium was blocked. Pep Guardiola had demanded the signing of Sánchez, with whom he had worked at Barcelona in the 2011-12 season, and there was the belief at City on Thursday morning that everything was in place – most important, Arsenal’s deal for Lemar. That would prove to be incorrect and there has been the feeling at City that Lemar simply rejected Arsenal. The Sánchez saga has dominated the summer. He has long made it plain he will not sign a new deal at Arsenal, despite the club offering him fresh terms on around £300,000 a week; his contract pays him £130,000 a week. He hoped Arsenal would relent in the face of standing to lose such a valuable asset for nothing next summer. But instead, with Arsène Wenger the public face of the policy, the club insisted they would rather keep him for one last year, even if it meant losing him as a Bosman free agent. Arsenal did the sums and they concluded that they have a better chance of returning to the Champions League with Sánchez in the team and reacquainting themselves with the £40m-a-year revenue streams from the competition. Therefore, they were never going to accept any offers for him of £40m-£50m. They rejected City’s opening offer of £50m on Tuesday yet, by then, their stance had altered. It became clear there was a tipping point on Sánchez, albeit an expensive one, and City were encouraged. They were so confident on Wednesday night they would be able to push through a deal that they put a medical team on standby in Chile – where Sánchez has been on international duty. Everything depended on Arsenal making a marquee attacking signing but, in short, they were unable to do so. There had been fears at the club that getting such a deal over the line in a short space of time would be impossible. Arsenal made three bids for Lemar earlier in the summer – the biggest being worth €50m. But even the €100m offer did not end with it getting the job done. Arsenal are in turmoil after the 4-0 humiliation at Liverpool last Sunday but, at least, they stuck to their guns over not selling Sánchez without adding a new player. In the past, they have caved in over players who have one year to run on their contracts whereas this time, they have refused to put £60m in the bank at the expense of the make-up of the team. The fervent hope at the club is that Sánchez will demonstrate his innate fighting spirit and reapply himself when he returns from the international break. But against that is the feeling in some areas of the squad Arsenal might have been better off to cut their losses on a player who no longer wants to be there. Certain players have had their fill of the Sánchez situation and everything that has gone with it. After the Wenger contract saga of last season, they are conscious that Sánchez promises to be this season’s distraction. Arsenal also received a €40m deadline-day inquiry from Juventus for the right-back Héctor Bellerín, which felt like a bolt from the blue or an opportunistic strike from the Italian champions. Perhaps, they felt that they could exploit the turbulence at Arsenal or they were aware Bellerín had wanted out earlier in the summer – to his boyhood club, Barcelona, who had shown a keen interest. The offer was dismissed. Arsenal did complete the season-long loans of Lucas Pérez and Joel Campbell to Deportivo La Coruña and Real Betis, respectively. Pérez joined from Deportivo for £17m last summer. Campbell had been against going out on yet another loan but he was talked around. He has now had six loans since joining Arsenal in 2011. His contract at the club runs until 2019. Wenger was unable to move Mathieu Debuchy and Chuba Akpom, while Jack Wilshere also stayed put."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/06/country-diary-stinkhorn-fungus-phallus-impudicus","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-06T04:30:21Z","webTitle":"Rude, erect and smothered in flies, this fungus has no shame","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/06/country-diary-stinkhorn-fungus-phallus-impudicus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/06/country-diary-stinkhorn-fungus-phallus-impudicus","fields":{"headline":"Rude, erect and smothered in flies, this fungus has no shame","bodyText":"The stench of death, the buzz of flies, the indecent exposure – it was a stinkhorn. Rude, erect and smothered in bluebottles, the fungus was at the side of the path to the follies at Hawkstone Park, though bank holiday visitors paid it little attention. In the 18th century, when this landscape theme park was created, Linnaeus named the fungus Phallus impudicus, literally “shameless phallus”. I imagine visitors then would have been familiar with what the herbalist John Gerard called the “prike mushroom’ in 1597; other folk names included deadman’s cock. Gwen Raverat, the engraver and granddaughter of Charles Darwin (in her 1952 memoir, Period Piece), told a story about her Aunt Hetty (Darwin’s daughter) collecting stinkhorns from the woods and burning them in secret. This was reportedly to protect the morals of the maids but, given Hetty’s neopagan interests, perhaps it was something more fun. The stinkhorn is saprobic, feeding on dead tree stumps, and its stink, which contains dimethyl trisulfide – the chemical that is given off by necrotic lesions – makes the smell of carrion irresistible to blowflies. Shiny, metallic blue, green or black, the flies cluster on the gooey green gleba – the spore-bearing gel that covers the cap of the fungus and is liquefied by the vibrations of the fly’s proboscis. The fly is attracted to the stinkhorn by the smell but, instead of rotting flesh to lay its eggs in, finds a sugary liquid and gorges on that instead, ingesting the fungal spores suspended in it. The fly benefits from proteins in the gleba that help develop its eggs. The fungus benefits from the fly carrying its spores away and depositing them in faeces. The spores are unaffected by passing through the fly. Stinkhorns are also more numerous around badger setts, attracting flies that will lay their eggs on dead animals; this disposes of them quickly, reducing the risk to the badger colony from disease. In warm weather (for a macabre example) fly maggots can consume 60% of a human body in less than a week. Sex, death and dirty jokes: unmanaged, irreverent, obscene, stinkhorns infiltrate a landscape made for refined pleasures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/31/ryanair-may-brexit-deal-michael-oleary-uk-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:30:49Z","webTitle":"Ryanair chief: May should be doing Brexit deal, not drinking sake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/31/ryanair-may-brexit-deal-michael-oleary-uk-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/31/ryanair-may-brexit-deal-michael-oleary-uk-europe","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair chief: May should be doing Brexit deal, not drinking sake","bodyText":"Ryanair has stepped up warnings that flights between the UK and Europe are imperilled by Brexit, with the airline’s chief executive Michael O’Leary claiming that the prospect of disrupting aviation was one of the quickest and best ways for the EU27 to “stick it to the British”. O’Leary said that only “panic and fudge” would now allow flights to continue, and an interim deal would effectively mean Britain “rolling over” on its previous red lines on freedom of movement and submitting to European regulation. As airline schedules and flight bookings released almost a year in advance, Ryanair insists it needs legal certainty before autumn 2018 in order to sell flights departing after March 2019, when Brexit takes effect. He also criticised Theresa May on Sky News: “I fail to see what she’s doing in Japan for three days at the moment, why she’s not in Brussels or in Frankfurt or in Paris, which is where these negotiations need to take place. “She’s just come back from three weeks’ holidays in the Swiss Alps. Now, everybody is entitled to their holidays, but there’s a crisis coming down the road here for the UK economy in the next 12 months. “Brexit is going to be a disaster for the UK economy. She needs to be over there negotiating or at least removing these roadblocks, not swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake.” He said earlier: “If Britain gets pushed out of the EU, it is absolutely the legal position that flights must stop. You’ve got to negotiate that bilaterally. And yet David Davis and the other geniuses in Brussels can’t negotiate the departure bill, the EU citizen rights ... they haven’t got round to talking about aviation. “If we don’t know the legal basis for which they’re being operated we’ll be forced to cancel those flights by December 2018 so we can put those flights on sale in Europe.” He said Europe was set against a deal: “What the British have underestimated is to the extent that the voices in Europe are lobbying against a deal on flights ... There’s an increasing awareness in the corridors of power in Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt that aviation is the one to stick it to the British government over, because [its effects] come six months before March 2019.” O’Leary claimed: “All bookings for summer 2019 will carry a government health warning, that this is subject to regulatory approval.” He added: “What is increasingly likely to happen is that there will be no flights. Mrs May and the Brexiteers will be trying to explain that to you in 12 months’ time, why getting a car to Scotland or a ferry to Ireland are the only options on offer.” Accused of being hysterical, he conceded he did “not really believe there will be disruption of flights in April 2019 – but only because Britain will roll over. It’s the whole myth of Brexit.” While Ryanair has this week joined the industry group Airlines UK, to lobby for more certainty over Brexit, his competitors have not aired concerns in such drastic terms, and easyJet has described O’Leary as scaremongering. O’Leary said other airlines were “in denial”, but added: “You’ll see not just us but other airlines start to scream at Mrs May.” He claimed easyJet was “secretly shitting themselves” over Brexit. O’Leary produced a document which had been circulated in Brussels showing that carriers including Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were demanding full regulatory convergence in any deal, and stopping all cabotage rights – meaning UK carriers such as easyJet would not be able to fly domestic routes within Europe. EasyJet recently took out the £10m insurance policy of setting up a new company in Austria, easyJet Europe, to operate its intra-EU flights after 2019, although the head office of easyJet plc remains in Britain. O’Leary predicted: “That ownership and control structure won’t survive a hard Brexit. Even the Germans can see their way through that one. The charade is going to be hugely ineffective. “The French and Germans aren’t sitting on the sidelines: they’re going to actively shaft [British Airways owner IAG] and easyJet. This is an historic opportunity for them.” Responding to O’Leary’s claims, an easyJet spokesman said: “All passengers, all airlines and all governments want there to be flights between the UK and Europe because of the huge value they bring. “EasyJet Europe is just as secure as Ryanair – it is a Europe-based, European-owned airline.” O’Leary was speaking in London as Ryanair announced six new routes for 2018 as part of its biggest ever flight schedule from the capital, with flights from Stansted to Aalborg, Denmark, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in Germany, Oradea in Romania and Pardubice in the Czech Republic, as well as Luton to Bydgoszcz, Poland. He used the opportunity to reiterate Ryanair’s call for a crackdown on alcohol sales at airports, saying: “We have to deal with the discomfort to our fellow passengers, diversions of aircraft, and danger when it becomes out of hand.” He said the airline had written to the Civil Aviation Authority proposing reforms including limiting purchases to two alcoholic drinks per boarding card, but had yet to receive a response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/01/posh-lemonade-taste-test-which-supermarket-fizz-is-the-biz","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T11:18:37Z","webTitle":"Posh lemonade taste test: which supermarket fizz is the biz?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/01/posh-lemonade-taste-test-which-supermarket-fizz-is-the-biz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/01/posh-lemonade-taste-test-which-supermarket-fizz-is-the-biz","fields":{"headline":"Posh lemonade taste test: which supermarket fizz is the biz?","bodyText":"Furtive as his late-night fridge-raiding may have been, 40 years later, R White’s “secret lemonade drinker” embodies a more innocent age. Back then, and for decades after, lemonade was a cheap, if not always cheerful drink, necked by thirsty kids on hot summer days with zero thought given to its frequently vile synthetic aftertaste. Now, things are very different. Invigorated by a new foodie culture and encouraged by declining alcohol sales – according to the latest ONS figures, 27% of 16-to-24 year-olds do not drink – the last decade has seen a wholesale “premiumisation” of soft drinks. Manufacturers are digging out traditional recipes and reverting to real ingredients in order to appeal to more sophisticated adult palates. Even R White’s now does its own (rather poor) traditional cloudy lemonade. So, which of them are an acrid, sugary mess, no better than generic lemo (a notional 2/10 for this test)? And which offer a refreshing mix of zesty acidity, sweetness and real lemon flavours in a way that rivals, for instance, Fever-Tree’s Sicilian lemonade? A preservative-free lemonade – not overly gassy, elegantly tart, subtly sweet – its flavours shine as brightly as the midday sun on a Mediterranean island (9/10, 500ml, £1.69, Ocado). Please note, however, as Action On Sugar did in 2014, that fantastic flavours often come at a high calorific price. Many traditional and cloudy lemonades contain significant amounts of sugar (for example, Fever-Tree’s packs 7.6g sugar per 100ml), with some even topping Coca-Cola’s 10.6g per 100ml. Much like the cost of such drinks, that is a good reason to keep children away from them. Proper lemonade is too big a treat for kids. M&amp;S freshly squeezed lemonade 1l, £2.70 Like a Williamsburg furniture-maker who plays in a bluegrass band at weekends, this still, unpasteurised cloudy lemonade is taking it back to pre-industrial basics. Shake the bottle to wake its fruity sediment, and the aromas and freshly-squeezed flavours it delivers are terrific. You get a vivid, tangy burst of sun-drenched lemons gently softened by the added sugar. It is smooth, rounded, gently puckering. Purists will love that it is, essentially, just 12% lemon juice and water. Those raised on carbonated lemonades may feel like they are drinking watered down fruit juice. In a way, you are. 8/10 Tesco no added sugar cloudy lemonade 2l, 50p Now staring down the barrel of the sugar tax, the soft drinks industry is scrabbling to get its marzipan house in order. This will inevitably lead to aberrations such as Tesco’s low-calorie cloudy lemonade. A concoction of “comminuted” lemon (a puree used to manufacture some mid-range lemon drinks), preservatives and the artificial sweetener sucralose, it smells like lemon toilet cleaner and tastes precisely how a drink also made with further concentrated citrus juices (2%) and two citric acids would: harsh, stunted and, if far more lemony than standard lemonade, no classic. 3/10 Asda extra special freshly squeezed cloudy lemonade 1l, £2 Another flat, fresh, traditional lemonade with a comparatively short shelf-life. It contains a whopping 11g of sugar per 100ml and 16% lemon juice, and is rather OTT. Yes, it is tart, refreshing and boldly lemony in way that bests much of the competition here. But, in the final analysis, where the M&amp;S version is pin-bright and balanced, this is too sweet, too sour, too stridently lemony and, rather than clearly defined at the edges of its flavour, dulled and hazy in a way vaguely reminiscent of Lemsip. A sound lemonade, but ham-fisted. 6/10 Co-Op sparkling cloudy lemonade 500ml, 95p Another cloudy version trying to have its lemon drizzle cake and eat it, this Co-Op “carbonated lemon flavour soft drink with sweetener” may contain less than 0.5g of sugar per 100ml, but it lacks good flavours, too. Like drinking Fanta Limon on a Costas holiday in 1986, it seems surprisingly lemony initially (compared to cheap, mainline lemo). But that soon fades, to reveal a thin, rather watery, overly sweet, aggressively bitter lemonade. A few swigs in and the aftertaste is far from refreshing, full of cloying artificial sweetness and mouth-puckering citric compounds. 3/10 Aldi Ridge Valley cloudy lemonade 700ml, £1.49 A preservative-free version made from very lightly sparkling spring water and 8% lemon juice – not concentrated juices or comminute – this lemonade is a serious cut above. Where so many lemonades are obnoxiously aggressive, this is chilled-out and approachable, yet it offers a full-spectrum of lemon flavours: from the bright-eyed freshness of just-juiced lemons to the varied flavours you get in baking from using the zest, oven-roasted lemon rinds or syrup-preserved lemons. Sweet as it undoubtedly is, the aftertaste is relatively clean, too. It stops short of sickliness. Excellent. 8.5/10 Waitrose cloudy lemonade 1l, 60p Remember Action on Sugar’s warning? Well, this lemonade – 11.4g of sugar per 100ml – is definitely not worth the calories. That noise when you open the bottle (like a bus applying its air brakes at traffic lights), is an indication of how ridiculously gassy this drink is. Upfront, are you tasting acerbic carbonation or bitter lemon compounds? It is impossible to tell. As the lemonade settles, you get a comminute-and-concentrated-juice dose of lemon flavour that, while obviously purer and stronger than bog-standard lemonade, lacks mellow comeliness. This lemonade tastes short, spiky, narrow and unsurprisingly way too sweet. 4/10 Sainsbury’s Taste The Difference Sicilian lemonade 750ml, £1.90 It smells a bit like floor cleaner, but the flavour is highly persuasive: zesty, sharp, invigorating without being dramatically harsh. Sainsbury’s lemonade is closest in spirit and ingredients (12% lemon juice, some comminute), to Aldi’s Ridge Valley lemonade but, befitting its southern Italian heritage, it is far bubblier (literally), vivacious and ebullient in its flavours – a little too intensely acidic and sweet, ultimately. This is a mouthy young buck of a lemonade, a Sicilian wideboy careering around Catania on his scooter, where the Aldi version has a certain, preferable, refined English reserve to it. 7/10"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/01/floods-the-amazon-at-risk-and-the-price-of-plastics-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T14:59:10Z","webTitle":"Floods, the Amazon at risk and the price of plastics – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/01/floods-the-amazon-at-risk-and-the-price-of-plastics-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/01/floods-the-amazon-at-risk-and-the-price-of-plastics-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Floods, the Amazon at risk and the price of plastics – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news UK citizens are taking air pollution monitoring into their own hands Summer washout drowns hopes of UK wildlife bonanza Romania may seek to pull gold mine from Unesco protected list Global warming doubles growth rates of Antarctic seabed’s marine fauna – study Brazilian court blocks abolition of vast Amazon reserve Consumers ‘betrayed’ over sustainability of world’s biggest tuna fishery Javid ‘misunderstood planning policies’ in approving fracking site, court hears Tourists doubting value of trip to Great Barrier Reef, dive operator tells inquiry Sea Shepherd says it will abandon pursuit of Japanese whalers Kenya brings in world’s toughest plastic bag ban: four years jail or $40,000 fine In depth In an era of dire climate records the US and South Asia floods won’t be the last Why are the crucial questions about Hurricane Harvey not being asked?

The Portuguese weekly magazine Visão reported: “Madonna is no longer a tourist, she now lives in Lisbon.” It republished several pictures from Madonna’s Instagram account that show her visiting Portugal over the past couple of months. The singer has been staying in a Lisbon hotel after buying a house in the resort of Sintra, 17 miles (27km) north-east of the Portuguese capital. The 19th-century building was put up for sale for €7.5m (£7m) and could take about six months to renovate, according to Visão. David Banda, who Madonna adopted from Malawi in 2006, has joined the Benfica training centre in Seixal, Correio da Manhã reported. The club accepted David Banda after his first test in the spring. He will stay at the academy until starting at a French high school in Lisbon, the newspaper reported, quoting a source close to Benfica. Rumours about a possible move began when Madonna was spotted at the school in May. She joins celebrities including John Malkovich, Monica Bellucci and Michael Fassbender in owning a home in Lisbon. The city has enjoyed a cultural renaissance in recent years and is regarded by many as hip, cheap and innovative. David Banda is one of four children that Madonna, 59, has adopted from Malawi. She adopted twin four-year-old girls from the country in February and accepted undisclosed damages from Associated Newspapers last month over an article published by Mail Online. The article revealed the twin girls’ names, race, age and the fact that they lived in an orphanage in Malawi, and were the subject of pending applications for adoption by Madonna. Her solicitor said the singer would donate the damages to the Mercy James Institute for Paediatric Surgery in Malawi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/aug/31/bertelsmann-profits-500m-euro-despacito-american-gods-13-reasons-why","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T13:31:48Z","webTitle":"Despacito drives Bertelsmann to record €500m profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/31/bertelsmann-profits-500m-euro-despacito-american-gods-13-reasons-why","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/aug/31/bertelsmann-profits-500m-euro-despacito-american-gods-13-reasons-why","fields":{"headline":"Despacito drives Bertelsmann to record €500m profits","bodyText":"The global success of 2017’s song of the summer, Despacito, together with sales of the TV series American Gods and the popularity of controversial book-turned-Netflix series 13 Reasons Why has helped drive record first-half profits at German media group Bertelsmann.

Other hits included Into the Water, the second thriller from The Girl on the Train author, Paula Hawkins, which sold 600,000 copies in just two months. Bertelsmann is increasing its stake in Penguin from 47% to 75% in a $1bn (£780m) deal with Pearson announced in July. Bertlesmann’s music business, BMG, also enjoyed a strong first half, with profits rising from €32m to €40m year-on-year and revenues surging 28% to €233m. BMG said there had been strong performances in the UK, where it signed Kylie Minogue, and the US, which included deals with Avril Lavigne and Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie. The business benefited from the chart success of clients including Nickelback, DJ Khaled and the runaway global hit Despacito. Revenues at Bertelsmann’s TV arm, RTL, Europe’s biggest ad-funded broadcaster and owner of X Factor co-producer Fremantle Media, grew from €2.87bn to €2.97bn. The company credited the rise in part to the success of American Gods, the TV adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel, which aired on Starz in the US and Amazon’s Prime Video service internationally. However, RTL profits fell from €676m to €624m in what it said was a challenging environment for the TV industry. The company said it would benefit from the revival of American Idol. The talent show is to return to US screens after being cancelled two years ago after a 15-season run. Thomas Rabe, chairman and chief executive of Bertelsmann, said the increased stake in Penguin Random House was especially worth noting because Bertelsmann would now own “a strategic three-quarters majority in the world’s largest trade publishing group – the best possible conditions for successfully further developing this core business”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/aug/31/city-workers-what-are-attitudes-to-cocaine-use-in-your-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:35:11Z","webTitle":"City workers: what are attitudes to cocaine use in your industry?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/31/city-workers-what-are-attitudes-to-cocaine-use-in-your-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/aug/31/city-workers-what-are-attitudes-to-cocaine-use-in-your-industry","fields":{"headline":"City workers: what are attitudes to cocaine use in your industry?","bodyText":"Cocaine use among the middle classes is once again an issue after comments by Tony Saggers – former head of drugs strategy at the National Crime Agency – who spoke about the prevalence and acceptance of cocaine use in some industries, particularly in the City, and the need for corporate social responsibility schemes.

It’s one of my all-time favourite movies, but the older I get the more amazed I am that a film like this ever got green-lit. Middle-class Jewish teenager gets her parents’ blessing after hooking up with a Catholic, working-class, possible statutory rapist at a summer resort? Only in the 1980s could you get away with a storyline like that. And only in the 80s do the lovebirds go on to shatter class divisions by flash-mobbing hotel guests at dinner time. It’s a plot more improbable than sci-fi, and yet Dirty Dancing still manages to highlight two important truths – first, that youthful indulgence can help solve society’s ills, and second, daddy’s girl privileges can be harnessed to foster social unity (Ivanka Trump take note). The main character, Baby (played by Jennifer Grey), is a naive teenager on vacation with her parents at a summer resort, who ends up dating the hotel’s principal dancer, Johnny (Patrick Swayze), after he invites her to grind against his crotch. How old is Baby? Is she even legal? In any case it’s clear that she’s the one who wears the trousers in this relationship. Johnny is diffident and chippy, a man so passive he is practically ravished against his will by a cougar hotel guest. And that’s not the only adult theme in the movie – snobbery, robbery and abortion are all touched upon too. They are the kind of issues that today’s Hollywood would handle with Christopher Nolan-esque gravity or sidestep altogether for fear of criticism. In the 20th century, however, life’s sourness was smothered beneath sugary idealism. Batman was a camp clown in tights with a boyish ward clad in lycra, not a solipsistic Dark Knight, and Gigi could Thank Heaven for Little Girls without triggering a police investigation. When Baby dates Johnny, then gets her physician dad to tend to someone’s botched abortion, she cuts a swath through class and religion. But the girl is no heroine – she takes action not so much because social justice is consciously on her agenda, but because she can’t imagine her parents not letting her have her way. This becomes clear when Johnny is wrongly blamed for a string of thefts. His alibi is that he was in bed with Baby on the night of the crime. The girl causes outrage by confirming this to the hotel manager. In front of her parents. At the dinner table. Put in the same position, most of us wouldn’t live long enough to examine the dessert menu, but Baby survives largely because she is daughter to a pair of pushovers. Mum is more or less mute, while doe-eyed Dad can only stare at the lake and sob over his daughter’s defilement. Baby proves that a sense of entitlement can breed a fearlessness that delivers results. If only Ivanka Trump would do the same. That, however, would depend on her ability to command the same influence over her dad, which is doubtful: we’re talking about a man who said he would date his little princess in a parallel universe, after all. Anyone given the name “Baby” in the Trump household would probably need to tighten her chastity belt. Baby’s is the ultimate liberal story in which adolescent rebellion takes the moral lead and drives society forward. It dovetails nicely with my belief that indulgence, when pursued responsibly, makes the world go round. Nothing unites us as a species quicker than food, love, music and dance. In the final scene of Dirty Dancing, Johnny and Baby unite society in one big dance that’s pure Hollywood magic: guests, staff, gentiles, Jews and even a blink-and-you’ll-miss them black couple who break out on to the dance floor to the I’ve Had The Time of My Life. It’s beautiful, life-affirming stuff, culminating in an epic, aerial-parting shot. I won’t lie – that scene has choked me up at times. Over the years I and countless others have tried copying that foot-shuffle thing that Johnny and his colleagues perform down the aisle. But much like the ability to ride roughshod over our parents’ wishes, very little of the movie’s dancing is replicable in real life. Never have so many moves been imitated so often with such shambolic results. Most of us can’t do the pachanga or salsa properly, either. As for the eponymous crotch-grinding, this is an absolute no-no. Dirty dancing is filthier than twerking and demands 100% synchronicity – anything less and you’ve got a shocker of a hump fest. “Nobody puts Baby in the corner,” Johnny famously says. I agree. The rest of us, on the other hand, should stay put in that corner and just watch. • Noo Saro-Wiwa, daughter of the Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, is the author of Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/04/how-we-made-dont-die-of-ignorance-aids-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T16:30:18Z","webTitle":"'It was a life-and-death situation.

Wards were full of young men dying': How we made the Don't Die of Ignorance Aids campaign","bodyText":"Norman Fowler, health secretary, 1981-87 I first heard about Aids as a serious issue in 1985. I didn’t know much about gay culture at the time; I didn’t have any gay friends. But the attacks on gay people motivated me. Some people thought anyone with HIV should be left to their own fate, and there were certainly people in government who felt uneasy about homosexuality. I thought – this is unjust. We had no knowledge of this disease and no drugs with which to treat it. I was reading a note the other day from the chief medical officer at the time and some of the predictions as to what could happen were terrifying – we were talking millions and millions of people becoming infected. That’s why we launched what is still the biggest public health campaign there’s ever been in this country with leaflets sent out to every home. Not everyone was on board with the idea. Margaret Thatcher wasn’t a natural supporter. She had the view that if you told young people about HIV and unprotected sex, you’d be telling them about things they didn’t know about, and the implication was that they’d want to go out there and do it. I always thought that was an eccentric view. We were warning people, not urging them. The TV adverts we ran were certainly hard-hitting. There was no point spending a load of money to send out innocuous adverts. We did follow-up research that said 90% of the public recognised the advert and a vast number changed their behaviour because of it. Columnists at the time said we were going over the top but the public didn’t agree. It was a life and death situation. I’d been to San Francisco, where the wards were full of young men dying. Same in Germany, same in the United Kingdom. There was no time to think about whether it might offend one or two people. And history shows we were right – people took care and HIV cases went down. I’ve heard it said that the advert was so scary it put a whole generation off having sex. Well I don’t think there’s any evidence that it actually did! What I do know is that I get letters from time to time from people who say thank you – that it saved their life. In politics, you don’t get that sort of letter very often. Malcolm Gaskin, designer My agency, TBWA, had been working on health campaigns for the government for five or so years – nurse recruitment, blood donations, rubella epidemics. So when Aids hit the news they turned to us. The big problem was that nobody knew anything about it. It was like an alien plague. Where did it come from? How big would it get? Panic and speculation was spreading. Norman Fowler and his team gathered a hefty bunch of people around – people from the prison services, the army, immigration and social services – to discuss how to tackle it. It was agreed we would attack the disease itself rather than the people who had it, which is how other agencies might have gone about it. Nobody even knew what to call it. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome wasn’t very catchy, but when they came up with the acronym Aids it was something we could work with. For the posters we went for modern typography – we wanted people to know this was a new thing, not just another bunch of medical letters –with an underscore on the word Aids. Almost like a logo. The phrase “don’t die of ignorance” was coined by [fellow designer] David O’Connor-Thompson. The death part was important – and knowledge was really the only thing we had at the time to defend ourselves against it. With the TV advert we knew we had about 40 seconds to get people’s attention. That’s not enough time to explain anything complex – we just needed viewers to make sure they read the leaflets that would be arriving through their door. Scaring people was deliberate. The director Nic Roeg was specifically chosen for his doom and gloom sci-fi aesthetic. It starts with a volcano because it’s about the end of the world. Originally it was even scarier: we had metallic sirens blaring like the beginning of a nuclear war. But Thatcher thought we were overdramatising it and she was probably right. If we’d kept it like that I think everyone would have headed for the beaches. People remember the tombstone but there were a lot of smaller, softer campaigns that went with it – tailored messages for people who might be affected such as dentists or tattooists. We had to inform people and reassure them – we didn’t want hairdressers shutting down because suddenly people were scared of catching something from scissors. We also had post marked by Royal Mail with the campaign slogan. I know some people didn’t like that – receiving a letter from their auntie with “don’t die of ignorance” stamped on it. I knew at the time that what we were working on would be history so I kept a lot of stuff – including an actual black granite Aids tombstone. Not the original – that was three tonnes – but I’ve got one in lock-up that’s about a hundredweight. I had to get it out the other day because it’s being exhibited, so it was in the garden when my builder arrived. He jumped back and shuddered when he saw it – so it can definitely still scare people. • Can Graphic Design Save Your Life? is at the Wellcome Collection, London, from 7 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/31/asda-legal-challenge-increase-pay-shop-floor-staff-equal-pay-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:20:13Z","webTitle":"Asda urged to drop equal pay challenge and raise shop-floor wages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/31/asda-legal-challenge-increase-pay-shop-floor-staff-equal-pay-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/31/asda-legal-challenge-increase-pay-shop-floor-staff-equal-pay-claim","fields":{"headline":"Asda urged to drop equal pay challenge and raise shop-floor wages","bodyText":"Asda is being urged to drop a legal action and increase pay on the shop floor after the supermarket lost its appeal against an equal pay claim from 15,000 workers. On Thursday, the employment appeal tribunal backed an October ruling that workers in roles across the shop floor can compare their jobs with those done predominantly by men for a higher wage in Asda’s warehouses. Asda has indicated it would seek permission to take the case to the court of appeal. If the ruling continues to hold, the retailer could be forced to adjust the pay of many of its 100,000-plus shop-floor staff and make back payments going back to 2002, at an estimated cost of up to £100m. Lawyers representing the mostly female claimants said the they typically earned between £1 and £3 an hour less than staff at Asda’s distribution centres. The supermarket challenged the ruling on 10 different grounds, but was unsuccessful on all. It said no comparison between the two groups of workers was possible partly because different departments ran the stores and the distribution centres and there were different methods for setting pay in each workplace. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, which is backing the equal pay case, said: “GMB look forward to Asda management sitting down and finding a sensible negotiated solution to recognising that our female members in stores should be paid and valued as equal to the men. “Instead of wasting money on litigation, we ask Asda to be a market leader in solving this wide-ranging industry problem.” Chris Benson of Leigh Day, the law firm heading the case for the claimants, said: “After yet another defeat, we hope that Asda take this opportunity to reflect on the merits of the claims, and concentrate on why they pay men more than women for jobs of equal value, rather than trying to stop the claims going ahead at all.” An Asda spokesperson said: “We are disappointed with this appeal ruling which relates to a technical preliminary issue of whether jobs in different parts of the business can be compared. “The employment appeal tribunal have given us permission to appeal against this judgment, to the court of appeal. We continue to strongly dispute the claims being made against us. “The employment tribunal has yet to consider whether the jobs are of equal value in terms of their demands and if some jobs are, only then will the tribunal move on to consider the reasons for the differentials, including the existence of different market rates in different industry sectors. “At Asda, hourly paid colleagues doing the same job in the same location are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our retail stores are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our distribution centres are paid the same. Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors.” The judgment is expected to have implications for other supermarket equal pay claims, including a case Leigh Day is bringing on behalf of hundreds of Sainsbury’s workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/aug/31/paul-oliver-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T12:45:35Z","webTitle":"Paul Oliver obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/31/paul-oliver-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/31/paul-oliver-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Paul Oliver obituary","bodyText":"Only 1% of houses around the world were designed by architects. Paul Oliver, who has died aged 90, devoted himself to studying the remainder: architecture that was of the people rather than built for them. His books on vernacular architecture range from Dunroamin: The Suburban Semi and Its Enemies (1981, with Ian Davis and Ian Bentley) to a three-volume Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World (1997), produced with 780 contributors from 80 countries. An artist by training who became a distinctive commentator on both architectural history and music, especially the blues, he considered himself a generalist, though writing from an architectural background; when pressed, in 1998, he accepted the term “architectural anthropologist”. His opportunity to develop this perspective came from taking a part-time job as drawing master at the Architectural Association (AA) in London in 1960. When the leading academics Robert Furneaux Jordan and Sir John Summerson both quit, he was left as the principal lecturer in architectural history. Oliver’s inspiring teaching took two strands. One was the study of modernism, with its emphasis on simplicity, quality and economy. The other was vernacular architecture. His interest had been aroused when his parents moved to Symondsbury, near Bridport in Dorset, a village with a strong music tradition, a mummer’s play and a close-knit cottage community. Then in 1953, six articles in the Architectural Review by EA Gutkind, a planner, revealed the diversity of traditional building around the world. The study of vernacular traditions offered ideas on honest construction and functionalism attractive to modern architects, while also contributing to Britain’s emerging conservation movement. An international dimension took hold when in 1964 Oliver was invited to teach at the School of Architecture in Kumasi, Ghana, where his AA colleague John Lloyd was principal. Oliver and his students studied the ways of managing a humid climate and restricted resources, patterns of use and the buildings’ cultural values. His eyes were opened by the housing of the Gurunsi people, compounds with “the formal beauty and logic of pottery”, as he later wrote, which were being swept away for a reservoir and replaced by rows of prefab dwellings that paid no respect to Gurunsi traditions. The Ghana trip coincided with Bernard Rudofsky’s exhibition Architecture Without Architects at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Although it was important in popularising vernacular architecture as a subject, Oliver was enraged by its emphasis on the buildings as art objects, which he considered patronising. Working with colleagues from the AA, including students from its small department of tropical architecture, he offered a broader cultural perspective in his book Shelter and Society (1969). Further books on Africa, Greece and symbolism in buildings followed. His greatest love was perhaps sub-Saharan Africa where, under Islamic and Christian influences, architecture predominates among the visual arts. His contributors were architects and anthropologists, but the disciplines seemed entirely separate; only archaeologists took a holistic view, and Oliver considered their approach to be as valid for the present as the past. He advised on conservation issues in French towns and villages for the Patrimoine Historique et Artistique de la France. The British Council supported research and teaching in East Africa and India, and he worked for the Overseas Development Administration in Turkey, the Balkans, Central America and Mexico. Some projects focused on the vulnerability of vernacular buildings to earthquakes and floods, and the failures of post-disaster housing that had not taken account of the lessons of older cultures. Oliver became head of the AA’s graduate school in 1971, but left two years later to lead the art and design department at Dartington College of Arts, at Dartington Hall, Devon. He became an associate head of the architecture school at Oxford Polytechnic (now Oxford Brookes University) in 1978 and founder of the Shelter and Settlements Unit there. His greatest concern was to safeguard traditions in the face of technological change. He believed that the wisdom, skills and satisfaction of human needs embodied in traditional buildings were fundamental to the housing of millions in the 21st century. In 1987 Oliver took early retirement, though he continued as a visiting professor, so he could devote himself to his research, stimulated by the suggestion of Alyn Shipton, reference editor at the publisher Blackwell, that he produce an encyclopedia of world architecture. His three-volume study was organised by cultures rather than countries, with the first volume explaining general traits, environments, materials and services. Oliver was particularly proud of the section on Ethiopia, which was entirely written by local scholars, while gamely taking on himself areas in which no research existed. Born in Nottingham, Paul grew up in Pinner, north-west London, the son of W Norman Oliver, an architect, and his wife, the former Dorothy Edmunds. His father was keen that Paul should follow him into the profession, but he lacked any talent for mathematics and turned instead to painting. At the age of 16, Paul entered Harrow Art School, where he met his future wife, Valerie Coxon (they married in 1950), and began a lifelong interest in African-American music. He trained as an art teacher at Goldsmiths, University of London, and in 1949 returned to his old school, the Harrow county school for boys, as art master. There he established a department teaching crafts as well as art, acted as client for a new building, and introduced an African-American music society after the headmaster refused to allow a jazz club. When he left this post for the AA, the drop in his income forced him to write more music reviews. In 2003 Oliver was appointed MBE. His archive and photographs of vernacular architecture from around the world are held by Oxford Brookes University. In 2015, photographs demonstrating the inclusive and cross-cultural approach that he championed were exhibited in Oxford as Architecture for All. Valerie died in 2002. Tony Russell writes: For many, the name of Paul Oliver cued not vernacular architecture but vernacular music: the blues. His book and LP Blues Fell This Morning (1960) inspired a generation to discover this music, some to make it themselves, others to listen and develop their own ideas. Later books included Conversation With the Blues (1965), interviews from an American field trip in 1960; The Story of the Blues (1969), the first attempt at a comprehensive history; and Songsters and Saints (1984). They were accompanied by a constant flow of sleeve notes, articles, reviews, lectures and broadcasts. Paul first encountered the music as a teenager, hearing black American servicemen singing a work song. In the 50s he studied the field recordings made for the Library of Congress by John and Alan Lomax, corresponded with collectors of rare 78s and began to write for blues and folk magazines. He illustrated some of his writings and record sleeves with his own drawings, and many of his books with his own photographs. His exhibition of blues photographs at the American embassy in London in 1964 was a rare instance, at that time, of institutional recognition of the music. As “sheriff of Bluesville” he welcomed young guns, sharing what he knew, holding, with Val, memorable blues evenings at their Highgate home, and tolerating us when we wrote cheeky reviews of his books. In 1970–71 he edited the Blues Paperbacks series, leading off with his own Savannah Syncopators, about African retentions in the blues, and giving a voice to new blues scholars including David Evans, John Fahey and Bill Ferris. His reputation now international, he was frequently invited to blues festivals and conferences. He gradually stoppd research and article-writing, but continued to write books until 2009; before being prevented by illness, he was working on a couple more. His friends will regret that he did not complete his autobiography. I knew Paul for more than 50 years, but I never reached the boundaries of his wide-ranging interests. • Paul Hereford Oliver, historian of architecture and the blues, born 25 May 1927; died 15 August 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"gnm-press-office/2017/aug/31/guardian-media-group-and-founders-factory-kick-off-search-for-new-mediatech-start-up-successes","type":"article","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","sectionName":"GNM press office","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:27:24Z","webTitle":"Guardian Media Group and Founders Factory kick off search for new MediaTech start-up successes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/aug/31/guardian-media-group-and-founders-factory-kick-off-search-for-new-mediatech-start-up-successes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-press-office/2017/aug/31/guardian-media-group-and-founders-factory-kick-off-search-for-new-mediatech-start-up-successes","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Media Group and Founders Factory kick off search for new MediaTech start-up successes","bodyText":"London 31 August: Guardian Media Group (GMG) and Founders Factory are today issuing a new call for promising MediaTech start-ups to join their accelerator programme.

The former Citigroup economist, who joined the Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) last year as one of the four external members, warned that the UK economy was performing well enough for inflation to become a challenge. The response, he said, should be a modest rise in the cost of borrowing for businesses and households. Within days he encountered a distinct problem. Official figures showed inflation falling back. Over the summer the annual rise in consumer price inflation (CPI) declined from a peak of 2.9% to 2.6%. Worse was to come. Consumer and business confidence data showed both groups were becoming more nervous about the future. Later, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed GDP growth failed to rebound from its miserable performance in the first quarter. It was stuck in the slow lane, only inching higher from 0.2% in the first three months of 2017 to 0.3% in the second. Surely the gloomy data was a humiliating blow to Saunders’ forecasting prowess. He reckoned inflation was heading upwards to 3% and possibly beyond. The hard facts pointed in the opposite direction. Undaunted, he voted again on 3 August for a 0.25 percentage point rise. A speech on Thursday in Cardiff provided Saunders with the perfect platform for an admission that he had mistimed his interest rate call. But far from it. He maintained his warning, claiming that the fall in inflation was temporary and it was still in danger of becoming entrenched. His explanation centred on three things that would force employers to hike pay rates. First, that unemployment would stay low despite Brexit jitters. Second, that a flight of EU nationals back across the channel would restrict the supply of labour, putting upward pressure on wages. Third, he pointed to studies that showed most workers are unwilling to take on more hours. It is true that some industries are already screaming for skilled staff. The construction industry is certainly under pressure to find people to fill the holes left by departing Polish and Lithuanian workers. As for evidence that the impact is feeding through to the broader economy. There isn’t much more to go on. At the moment the only harm to the economy flows from the EU referendum. In the first instance there was the uncertainty that killed off business investment. A year after the vote, businesses remain reluctant to buy new equipment or expand capacity. Subsequently, the low pound pushed up the cost of imported goods, hitting disposable incomes. Saunders probably feels safe from criticism after his colleague Ian McCafferty joined him in calling for a rise and the Banks’ governor, Mark Carney, almost went as far, hinting that a tougher regime might be necessary before the end of the year. Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street’s chief economist, was another to say he could envisage a base rate of 0.5% before Christmas. Which leaves us to ponder the forecasting prowess of the MPC as a whole. It beggars belief that while the government maintains its austerity drive and businesses consider the known unknowns thrown up by the Brexit talks, why the central bank would withdraw just about the only support the economy has from an agency of the state. Carney and his team do themselves little credit when they talk about raising rates and winding down quantitative easing while the status quo persists. If they urged the government to push ahead with extra spending on infrastructure and higher pay for nurses and teachers as a way to stimulate the economy, allowing the Bank to withdraw its own, that would make sense. But while the UK resembles a hospital patient on heavy medication, albeit out of intensive care, withdrawing the only stimulant that still works would surely be negligent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/aug/31/apple-consortium-bid-toshiba-chip-business-bain-capital-iphone-saamsung","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T12:02:06Z","webTitle":"Apple joins consortium in revised £14bn bid for Toshiba's chip business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/31/apple-consortium-bid-toshiba-chip-business-bain-capital-iphone-saamsung","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/aug/31/apple-consortium-bid-toshiba-chip-business-bain-capital-iphone-saamsung","fields":{"headline":"Apple joins consortium in revised £14bn bid for Toshiba's chip business","bodyText":"Apple has joined a consortium of businesses led by the investment company Bain Capital in a last-ditch £14bn offer for Toshiba’s chip unit. Toshiba is the world’s second-largest producer of Nand memory chips, which are used in smartphones and computers. A deal may be crucial for Apple in keeping down prices of components for its iPhone, as well as reducing dependence on the market leader, Samsung. According to reports by Reuters, Apple has been brought in to help bolster the bid as Toshiba and the hard drive manufacturer Western Digital struggle to strike a deal, despite partnering on the joint venture chip business. Frank Gillett, an analyst at the market research company Forrester, said: “Apple is so big they need to multisource.” Apple had to ensure there were as many chip suppliers as possible in the market to keep prices competitive, he added. A successful Toshiba bid could also provide an important source of chips for Apple, reducing its dependence on Samsung, the smartphone maker’s chief rival. Samsung produces some of the company’s A series processors alongside chips for the iPhone, iPad and other devices. Alternatively, a combined Toshiba and Western Digital business could be almost as large as Samsung’s memory unit, giving it more negotiating leverage against Apple. Toshiba has been scrambling to sell its flash memory unit to cover billions of dollars in losses at its bankrupt US nuclear business, Westinghouse. Toshiba’s relationship with US-based Western Digital has been rocky throughout the auction process, to the point that other bidders were favoured first. Western Digital has also initiated legal action that threatens to derail any deal that does not have its consent. The revised offer from Apple, Bain and others is worth 2tn yen (£14bn). Bain and the South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix will be responsible for 1.1tn yen, while Apple will provide up to 400bn yenand Japanese banks about 600bn yen in support. The proposal also calls for Toshiba to be part of the deal, investing 200bn yen, according to Reuters. A Bain-led group had previously been chosen by Toshiba as its preferred bidder. But those talks lapsed as Japanese government investors who had been part of the consortium told Toshiba they were reluctant to close a deal in the face of the legal risks posed by Western Digital’s demands. Bain’s new offer is designed to negate that problem, inviting the state-backed investors Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and Development Bank of Japan to invest in the business only after any arbitration with Western Digital is settled. The bid surpasses the 1.9tn yen offered by the Western Digital-led consortium, which also includes the US private equity company KKR &amp; Co. However, banking sources have previously said Western Digital was working to get its proposal up to 2tn yen. Bain’s revised bid was first reported by Japanese broadcaster NHK, which said it would be structured so it and Toshiba would each hold 46% of the unit. Toshiba wants to reach a deal soon and it is not clear whether it will give serious consideration to Bain’s proposal, but it missed a self-imposed deadline of Thursday for a deal with Western Digital."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/01/trojan-horse-the-real-story-behind-the-fake-islamic-plot-to-take-over-schools","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"Trojan horse: the real story behind the fake 'Islamic plot' to take over schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/trojan-horse-the-real-story-behind-the-fake-islamic-plot-to-take-over-schools","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/01/trojan-horse-the-real-story-behind-the-fake-islamic-plot-to-take-over-schools","fields":{"headline":"Trojan horse: the real story behind the fake 'Islamic plot' to take over schools","bodyText":"In November 2013, Birmingham city council received a strange document in the post. It was a photocopy of a letter, which seemed to be part of a correspondence between Muslims conspiring to take over local schools and run them according to strict Islamic principles. The photocopy was accompanied by a note from an anonymous person claiming that they had found these pages in their boss’s office. The letter – supposedly written by an Islamist offering advice to a co-conspirator – outlined a five-stage strategy called “Operation Trojan Horse”. Step one: identify vulnerable schools where most of the pupils are Muslim. Next, identify a group of sympathetic parents to agitate for an Islamic agenda. Then put in place governors who adhere to the same conservative Islamic beliefs. Next, identify staff to disrupt the school from within by changing rules and undermining unsympathetic colleagues. Finally, run anonymous letter and PR campaigns with the aim of forcing the headteacher to resign. The letter stated that this strategy “is tried and tested within Birmingham”, and named specific schools where it had supposedly been carried out. In December, the council passed the letter to the Home Office and the Department for Education (DfE). In early 2014, the documents were leaked to the media. Headlines began to appear alleging that a number of schools in predominantly Muslim areas of Birmingham had been imposing hardline religious teachings and fomenting extremism. The “Trojan horse” letter itself was quickly discredited as a fake, but the allegations it contained took on a life of their own. “Revealed: Islamist plot dubbed ‘Trojan Horse’ to replace teachers in Birmingham schools with radicals”, said one Daily Mail article a few weeks after the story broke. “Council leader calls for fightback on ‘schools jihad plot’”, said the Birmingham Mail not long after. In response to the allegations, Ofsted carried out emergency investigations in 21 schools in Birmingham. Of these, five were judged to be inadequate – despite some previously being rated as outstanding – and placed in special measures, the lowest possible rating. Inspectors alleged that these schools had provided inadequate sex education, failed to teach students enough about belief systems other than Islam, segregated some classes according to gender, and discouraged boys and girls from socialising with each other. In some cases, it was claimed, staff who disagreed with these changes had been bullied and harassed. When the Spectator ran an article about the case not long afterwards, the cover illustration showed a child with a Qur’an in one hand and a sword in the other, under the words “Taught to hate”. Every day, as the story developed, journalists jostled outside the schools involved. They roamed the local area, asking random passersby – “anyone who looked Muslim”, said one resident – for their opinion on extremism in Birmingham’s schools. By the time exam season arrived, students found themselves having to push past reporters to take their GCSEs. Over that summer, the scandal escalated once again when the then education secretary, Michael Gove, publicly criticised the approach of the Home Office – then run by Theresa May – to tackling non-violent extremism. The infighting between Gove and May continued for weeks. One of May’s top advisers was sacked. The allegations dominated the news for months, triggering hundreds of headlines, hours of news broadcasts, and at least four major government investigations. Three years on, the Trojan horse affair remains perhaps the best known and most polarising story about Britain’s relationship with its Muslim citizens. For many, the story has come to symbolise the failures of multiculturalism and the threat that hardline Islamic ideology poses to the future of the country. It was mentioned in the 2017 Ukip manifesto, and it is rare for a month to go by without some reference to the scandal in the rightwing press. (Several reports this year in the Telegraph and the Times have warned of a “new Trojan horse plot” in different parts of Britain.) For others, it is a confected scandal promoted by rightwing newspapers, the product of a climate in which all British Muslims are viewed with suspicion, and complex questions about faith and integration are reduced by politicians and the media to hysterical debates about terrorism. Despite numerous government reports, parliamentary hearings, and a bewildering array of legal processes, the truth has been hard to pin down. The implicated teachers and governors have always denied that there was any conspiracy to “Islamise” the schools, arguing that their intention was to increase community engagement and raise attainment among disadvantaged Muslim children. But even observers who are sympathetic to these claims seem to agree that something did go wrong in the administration of the schools involved in the scandal. And after successive investigators found no evidence for the claim that students were being radicalised, public perception that there was a sinister Islamist plot still persists. What really happened? * * * One striking aspect of the Trojan horse affair is that both sides largely agree on the basic facts. No one disputes that there was a concerted effort to recruit Muslim staff and governors across schools in east Birmingham, nor that prayer rooms and, in some cases, calls to prayer were introduced, and that there was a focus on core subjects such as English and maths, at the expense of drama and music. With the exception of a few incidents which come down to one person’s word against another, what is in question is not what happened, but how what happened should be interpreted. In the media, the term “Trojan horse” quickly became shorthand for a broad, often vague, range of anxieties about Muslims gaining undue influence in Birmingham’s schools. More than 20 schools fell under suspicion, but over time, the allegations came to focus on the five schools that were downgraded by Ofsted in its snap inspections. These were the secondary schools Park View, Golden Hillock and Saltley, and primary schools Oldknow and Nansen. All five were located within four miles of each other, in a part of east Birmingham where almost 80% of residents are Muslim. The neighbourhoods – Washwood Heath, Small Heath, Sparkhill and Alum Rock – are some of the most deprived in Britain. Gang crime is common, and extremist groups sometimes try to recruit there. Many children at Park View and Nansen grow up in poverty, with all the associated problems – overcrowded homes, poor nutrition, chronic stress. “Nothing good is happening outside, nothing good,” says Henna Rashid, a former teaching assistant at Oldknow primary school. Razwan Faraz, who was deputy head at Nansen when the scandal hit, grew up in Sparkhill in the 1990s. His parents, who emigrated from Pakistan in the 1970s, worked hard – his dad had two jobs – often leaving Faraz and his two brothers to their own devices, playing in a nearby derelict bingo hall. They went to the local secondary, Golden Hillock, where the proportion of children achieving A*-C grades in their GCSE exams was routinely below 10%. “I didn’t feel it was an adequate education I received,” Faraz said. “It was almost like, ‘If they’re quiet and behaving, that’s as much as we can expect.’” For Faraz, there was no continuity between home and school. Almost all the students were from Pakistani families, but almost all the staff were white. He felt as if he was living a parallel life. As a young teenager, he got involved in gangs, hanging out on the street, dabbling in petty crime. But after his dad told him he would be sent to Pakistan if he did not change his ways, he began to gravitate towards a group of conservative religious boys. They hung out, prayed together and remained friends for a few years. Despite not applying himself, Faraz passed his GCSEs and went to sixth-form college. At university in Birmingham, he felt out of place. “I couldn’t converse with anybody who wasn’t from the Pakistani community,” he said. Like many others in the area, he married young, at 18, but it was an unhappy union, which collapsed by the time he graduated at 21. He questioned his religious convictions, and turned to Sufism, the mystical strain of Islam. “Sufi culture really appealed to me – the idea of going into yourself and discovering your own strengths,” he said. In 2004 he decided to apply for an administrative role at a local educational charity, the Al-Hijrah Trust. Here, he came into contact with a man named Tahir Alam. At the time, Faraz had no idea that this encounter would change his life. For more than two decades, Alam has been a towering figure in the world of Birmingham education. He is an imposing presence: a large, well-spoken man with unwavering confidence who, over his years as a governor, schools inspector and adviser to the council has occasionally rubbed people up the wrong way. “He is an assertive person, a capable person,” says Dr Marius Felderhof, a theology professor at the University of Birmingham, who worked with Alam on the city’s religious education syllabus. “I thought of him as a rational person, committed to improving the education of Pakistani boys in particular, because he thought the Pakistani community was being disadvantaged.” In 1997, Alam became a governor at his alma mater, Park View, which locals sarcastically referred to as “Park View Grammar”. That year, only 4% of students attained A*-C grades at GCSE. Alam recalls a conversation from that time with a councillor about how to raise standards at the school. The councillor told him he would need to ship in students from other areas – meaning whiter, more affluent areas. Overhauling this culture of low expectations became Alam’s focus. “We focused on the big things, like academic progress, monitoring, employment of good staff,” Alam told me. Not long after Alam became a governor, Park View applied for permission to make the school’s daily assembly Islamic in nature – this meant that they would contain moral lessons based on an Islamic framework. There was nothing particularly unusual about this: every school in Britain is legally required to provide a collective act of daily worship (although, in practice, many ignore it). According to the legislation, this should be “wholly or broadly Christian in nature” unless permission is granted to change the designation. Despite opposition from some staff members, the governors pushed ahead with the decision to give Islamic assemblies. Alam believes schools should not “try to save Muslim children from Islam”, and that incorporating their home culture into their school lives not only helps behaviour, but improves educational attainment. Little research has been done on this in Britain, but educationalists in the US have studied similar approaches with black and Latino children, finding that when school celebrates children’s identity, results tend to improve. In 2001, Alam, who was chief governor, hired a new headteacher, Lindsey Clark, who was not Muslim. Together, they hired new staff and worked to improve data collection and monitoring – keeping track of each student’s results to ensure they were improving. Within a year, the percentage of students getting A*-C went up to 11%. By 2003 it was 18%, by 2005 it was 27%, and in 2006 it hit 41%. The critics grew quieter. For Faraz, meeting Alam was a turning point. He had long felt as if he didn’t belong anywhere, and now, suddenly, he had a role model. “Meeting him made me realise, ‘Hang on, I’ve got something to contribute to society.’ He was like, ‘Come on, what are you doing with your life?’” Over the next few years, Faraz discovered his passion for education, progressing from his administrative role to meeting headteachers around the country to promote teacher training. In 2005, Faraz joined the governing body at his old school, Golden Hillock, where he felt standards were as low as ever. “I didn’t see any change, 10, 15 years on,” he says. Once, when Faraz was reviewing the work experience placements for year 10 students, he noticed that they were mostly in high-street shops and restaurants. He asked the other governors why none of the kids were going to law firms. A white governor told him that although parents might want their kids to become lawyers or doctors, the reality was they were going to work in the service or retail sectors, and should be prepared. “I thought, ‘This is not right at all, if this is the expectation,’” Faraz says. Along with other governors, he began to push for changes. In 2008, Faraz started training as a teacher, working as a trainee at Park View. * * * Throughout the 2000s, Alam worked with Birmingham city council to increase diversity on school governing bodies. At a grassroots level, too, teachers, governors and school administrators in east Birmingham were encouraging more Muslims to train as teachers. “There was some emphasis on Muslims going into teaching,” said Mazhar Hussain, who taught at Park View from 2004-2012 and later at Golden Hillock. “I didn’t see anything wrong with that. I just thought, ‘Fine, as a community, they’re getting involved to improve education.’” Local communities taking ownership over their schools was once an uncontroversial idea. Under Tony Blair, it was a policy Labour championed. But in sharply segregated areas, it can raise difficult questions over who has the final say when what the community wants from their school deviates from prevailing national norms. The question of how far the wishes of culturally conservative minorities should be accommodated strikes at the heart of debates about multiculturalism. “We knew we needed to recruit more Muslim parents, but there’s a question about balancing,” said one non-Muslim governor, who wished to remain anonymous, at a school in Birmingham which was not involved in the Trojan horse affair. “What do you do after they’ve come on board if they’re religious nutjobs?” One of the first people to raise concerns about the growing influence of Islam in schools in Birmingham was Tim Boyes, a former headteacher, who is now chief executive of the Birmingham Education Partnership, a non-profit company established in 2013 to improve schools. Boyes started teaching in Birmingham in 1987, and has spent most of his career in schools where the majority of students have Pakistani heritage. He recalls instances as far back as the early 1990s when parents clashed with teachers over issues such as hymns being sung in assembly, or teachers keeping wine in the staffroom. “Folk in a leadership position [in Birmingham] have not always known well how to respond to a culturally unfamiliar set of behaviours,” he told me. These tensions rumbled on in the background alongside the push for greater civic engagement in schools. “Alam caused me concern over many years,” says Boyes. “He was very deliberately and strategically looking for people to be embedded in the education system.” While Boyes felt that part of Alam’s mission was “hostility to the establishment”, Alam characterises himself as an educational insider. “It was government policy that there should be an increase of ethnic representation,” Alam says. “This was something local authorities were measured and inspected against. There was nothing clandestine about it.” In 2007, Alam was invited to Downing Street to meet Blair, in recognition of his work on diversity. Faraz, meanwhile, finished his teacher training in 2009 and moved to Adderley primary school to take up the position of assistant head. At the time, his personal life was strained, partly because of his difficult relationship with his brother, Ahmed. While Faraz was Sufi, Ahmed was Salafi – an orthodox Sunni sect that advocates a return to the practices of early Islam. Ahmed ran a bookshop in Birmingham, which was raided in 2007 and 2010 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act because of the inflammatory literature on its shelves. In 2011, he was convicted of spreading terrorist propaganda. “Because of his line of thinking, I didn’t really have a relationship with him,” Faraz said. Nonetheless, after the conviction, Faraz appeared on a local BBC news broadcast defending his brother’s right to free speech. Later, when the scandal broke, Faraz was often identified in the media as the “brother of a convicted terrorist”. No mention was made of the conflict between them. During this period, results at Park View were steadily improving. In 2011, students achieved their highest-ever grades: 73% A*-C. For an inner-city school in one of the UK’s most deprived areas, this was outstanding. Park View is not a large school; it accepts less than 600 pupils aged 11-16. It was heavily oversubscribed, so its catchment area was just a few streets. Many families who lived there were not just Pakistani, but originated from the same few villages. When Laura (not her real name) started at Park View as a teacher in 2009, she was taken aback by how well behaved the children were. “Kids were expected to get the grades and go to college. That was powerful,” she said. “Kids and parents really respected the fact they were at that school.” The religious activities of Park View have been the focus for the media, lawyers and government investigators, but it was no seminary. “I really enjoyed my time at Park View,” said Alia (not her real name), a former student who left in 2014 to go to sixth-form college. “I have the impression that our school was unusual, because of the enthusiasm of the teachers and the fact that they really wanted us to succeed. Our teachers went above and beyond.” She recalls extra-curricular activities such as mock trials and debates, and a visit to Warwick University. There was even an X-Factor-style music competition. Religion came into the school day at numerous points. There were assemblies that used Islamic texts and traditions to address broad themes, such as kindness and respect. A prayer room was available, and posters around school listed the times for Friday prayers. (These posters were later cited in various news reports as evidence of pressure on children to pray.) While teachers and students say that Friday prayers were optional, some claim it wasn’t always an entirely free choice. “I went to an assembly once where they made anyone that didn’t go to Friday prayers stand up and lambasted them in front of everyone,” Laura said. During her three years there, she says that more and more students attended Friday prayers. Despite having reservations about the role that religion played at Park View, both Laura and another teacher I spoke to, Mike (not his real name), believed that it contributed to the sense of community. “They had a really clear ethos and everyone was on board,” said Laura. “The religion helped to build some of that.” One year, she remembers, students and teachers fasted before the year 11 pupils broke for study leave ahead of GCSEs – a religious practice to bring good luck. Staff and students broke their fast together, and Laura describes it as a happy coming-together of the school community. This was later cited in the media as an example of excessive religiosity. (“Year 11 pupils about to sit their GCSEs at the supposedly secular school were asked to go on an Islamic fast to put them in the right ‘spiritual frame of mind’ for exams”, said a Telegraph story in May 2014.) Although Park View was co-educational, boys and girls were segregated for certain subjects, including PE and sex education, which is not uncommon. One particular sex education lesson that took place in 2010 would later become a cornerstone of the case against the school, appearing in the news and government reports. In this class, teachers presented PowerPoint slides that focused on marital life but skirted around the subject of sex. During a Q&amp;A session that followed, one student said that he had been told in the mosque that women couldn’t refuse sex within marriage. The teachers were accused of agreeing with this. When I asked one of the teachers involved in the class, Mazhar Hussain, about this, he gave a long explanation about where in Islamic scripture this originated, and how his grandparents’ generation might have believed it. “I did not go into all that,” he told me. “I said it’s not something people believe now.” Exactly what was said in this class is one of the few points in the affair where the facts are contested. But everyone agrees that some boys came away with the impression that according to Islamic law, a woman cannot say no to sex with her husband. One male student, troubled by the lesson, asked Laura if this was correct; she was horrified. In the following days, teachers say that some boys taunted girls, saying: “You can’t refuse sex when you’re married”. When this was brought to the attention of the two assistant headmasters – Monzoor Hussain, who is Mazhar’s older brother, and Arshad Hussain (no relation) – they called an assembly to explain that marital rape is legally and morally wrong. Everyone I spoke to confirmed that this assembly took place. Around the same time, Boyes was gathering together a dossier with his concerns about Islamisation in schools in Birmingham, and what he saw as the mounting pressure on headteachers from conservative Muslim parents. In 2010, he gave a three-hour presentation to then schools minister Jonathan Hill. “I was saying, ‘You don’t understand how dangerous the language of benign Anglicanism is when it’s in the hands of Salafists from a Pakistani or Yemeni background,’” Boyes told me. “You don’t understand how problematic it is when schools think they can do their own thing and communities can run their own schools.” Yet when Ofsted inspected Park View in 2012, it became the first school to be ranked “outstanding” under tough guidelines introduced by new chief inspector Michael Wilshaw. Ofsted singled out its excellent provision for social, moral and religious care. “You can sense a good school as soon as you walk in,” said Wilshaw when he visited to observe a lesson after the top rating came out. Lindsey Clark, the headteacher who had overseen the school’s transformation between 2001 and 2012, was given an OBE. The Independent and other newspapers published gushing profiles of the school. “It was amazing,” said Muneeza (not her real name), a year-10 student at the time. “The stereotype about Alum Rock is that the boys become taxi drivers and the girls get pregnant, but we were showing that we were more than that.” * * * Park View’s success stood out in part because other local schools were doing so badly. On 28 August 2012, the year after Park View celebrated its best-ever GCSE results, 50 parents and students gathered outside Golden Hillock, three miles south of Park View, to protest against poor results. Headteacher Matthew Scarrott blamed harsh new marking criteria. Tension had been building between governors and senior leadership, and Scarrott later said that governors had mobilised parents to push him out. (Faraz was still on the board of governors at this point, but says he was only aware of the protests afterwards, and that the governors who had been involved were reprimanded.) In March 2013, Scarrott resigned. Soon after the glowing Ofsted report, Park View became an academy. While normal state schools are run by the local council, academies operate as charitable trusts – in this case, the Park View Educational Trust, headed up by Alam – with greater autonomy over pay and curricula. Introduced by Labour in 2000, this model was massively expanded by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. In May 2010, when the coalition took power, there were 203 academies in England; by November 2013, there were 3,444. While the education secretary, Michael Gove, celebrated the notion of schools being “freed” from the meddling of local government, the rapid expansion of the academies programme meant that ultimate responsibility for thousands of schools suddenly shifted from local authorities to the DfE. Previously, if a parent or teacher wanted to complain about governors, they could go to the local council; with academies, they’d have to go to national government. At the same time, the coalition’s austerity policies were shrinking local authority budgets, which meant oversight for non-academy schools was drastically reduced. Birmingham city council had £650m cut from its budget between 2010 and 2016. “It’s soul-destroying,” said Brigid Jones, Labour councillor for Selly Oak, in south-west Birmingham. In 2010, the school improvement division, responsible for oversight of schools, had more than 100 officers. In 2012, when Jones took over as cabinet member for children, families and schools, the number had been cut to 16. It was later cut to just eight officers, who were expected to oversee around 400 schools. Under the academies programme, the government actively encourages successful schools to incorporate failing ones into their educational trusts and oversee their management. One such school was Nansen Primary, the feeder school for Park View. In May 2012, Faraz began working at Nansen as deputy head, and with other senior leaders, he focused on trying to improve results. “He had broad horizons, he wasn’t talking purely about Muslim things,” said John (not his real name), who taught at Nansen during this period. “We had some interesting discussions around integration and the issue of the school having students from a single demographic. He suggested it would be a good idea to do sports days with schools with white and black Caribbean children.” In October 2012, Nansen converted to academy status and became part of the Park View Educational Trust. As an academy, decisions about staffing and curriculum at Nansen would be made by the Park View Trust’s senior leadership team, which was composed of a mixture of Muslims and non-Muslims: Tahir Alam, Monzoor Hussain, Hardeep Saini (who is Sikh) and Lindsey Clark (also non-Muslim). Just six months after being established, Park View Educational Trust was running two schools: Park View and Nansen. In October 2013, a third school, Golden Hillock, was incorporated into the Trust. With three schools to oversee, Faraz and other staff at the schools felt that the management team behind the Trust was overstretched. “Lindsey, the headteacher, took a step back,” said Laura, the Park View teacher. “She started being an executive head and going to other schools and wasn’t at our school as much. Monzoor Hussain started to take over a bit more.” Former colleagues describe Monzoor Hussain, who became acting head of Park View in 2013, as friendly and charismatic. That year, he set up a Whatsapp group for male Muslim employees of the three schools run by the Trust to keep in touch. It was called the Park View Brotherhood. A similar group existed for female Muslim members of staff, the Park View Sisterhood. These WhatsApp groups would, like the sex education lesson, go on to be one of the central sources of controversy in the Trojan horse affair. Among thousands of mundane messages about school events and news articles were some worrying comments, which were later leaked to the press. At one stage, teachers discussed how to stamp out flirtatious behaviour among students. After someone shared a news story about gay men in Pakistan using Sufi shrines as pickup points, Faraz described them as “animals”, adding: “As teachers we must be aware of combatting their satanic ways.” Faraz was also a member of another WhatsApp group, called Educational Activists, which included different people from the Birmingham school system. In 2014, messages were exchanged celebrating the appointment of a female Muslim headteacher at a local school. “Please don’t pressurise her to start the Islamising agenda first – that will be a lot easier when she is respected as a leader,” Faraz wrote. He claims that he was trying to convey that introducing measures such as prayer time should not be high priorities. There is no dispute that a number of messages exchanged on WhatsApp were grossly offensive, but when it comes to the wider significance of what was said in these groups, interpretations differ wildly. For those who believe that a conspiracy existed, as set out in the original faked letter, they are by far the most damning evidence. For those who do not, these thousands of messages, most of which are unremarkable, are broadly the kind of discussion you might expect from people who openly want to encourage an Islamic ethos in schools because they believe it coheres with children’s background and will help achievement. According to this view, even the worst of the messages do not show that there was any conspiracy. Either way, the WhatsApp conversations raise uncomfortable questions. Some of the views expressed were appalling, but people have a right to freedom of speech and thought, particularly in a private sphere. It should also be no surprise that some teachers, in common with the rest of the population, hold bigoted or ill-informed views. But at what stage do these views make it inappropriate for someone to be a teacher? All the teachers involved claim that the views expressed on WhatsApp did not affect their behaviour within school. “There were lots of couples in my year. No one ever suggested or told me that I should report them to anyone,” said Alia, the former Park View student. “Lindsey Clark used to tell children off for holding hands in the corridor and so on, and we were aware of the school rules about no physical contact. My understanding was this was part of the need for us to be smart and behave properly in our school.” But it is hard to believe that every teacher who expressed bigoted views via WhatsApp was able to check their private views in at the school gates, and that such attitudes did not sometimes filter, however subtly, into school life. Mike, the former Park View teacher, recalls that a pupil once said in class that Hitler was right to kill gay people. “You find a level of homophobia [among pupils] in all schools,” he told me. “The difference is if the school finds out, they challenge it.” When Mike informed the child’s head of year, no action was taken. Mike also chose not to tell colleagues he was gay. “I wouldn’t have felt comfortable coming out, but that might be more to do with me rather than the school,” he told me. Still, for the most part, these issues remained below the surface. Owing to Park View’s academic success, in late 2013, shortly before the scandal broke, the DfE was pushing the Trust to support more failing schools, and had approved it to take over two more, meaning it would be running a total of five. Park View itself seemed like a remarkable success story. “It had been lauded by Ofsted, Wilshaw had visited and said how amazing it was,” said Brigid Jones, the Labour councillor. “All the signs were that it was a great school.” * * * In November 2013, the “Trojan horse” dossier arrived at the leader’s office at Birmingham city council. The author of the anonymous note threatened to take the story to the press if action was not taken against the alleged conspirators within a week. The letter in the dossier is now broadly accepted to be a forgery, though the true author has never been uncovered. Brigid Jones had the portfolio for education, so the Trojan horse letter was passed to her. “I vividly remember reading it for the first time,” she said. “I knew it was going to be huge. What was in it was so inflammatory, whether it was true or not.” She ordered an immediate investigation and passed the letter to the West Midlands Police. Tim Boyes, chief executive of the Birmingham Education Partnership, also saw a copy. “This letter was a piece of creative writing that brought to life some of what I’d been explaining,” he told me. Although he felt the allegations were “pretty much true”, he worried that if it was amplified, it would “generate more racism and conflict”. In early 2014, Michael Gove met with Sir Albert Bore, the leader of Birmingham city council, to discuss the letter and allegations from a member of support staff at Park View that the school was practising gender segregation and that non-Muslim staff were being passed over for promotion. According to Jones, Gove said “‘We’ve had these allegations about Park View, what are you going to do?’” Bore responded, “‘No, actually, what are you going to do? The school is an academy. You’re responsible.’” This, Jones said, “didn’t go down remotely well”. (Gove declined to comment for this article.) The Sunday Times was the first newspaper to pick up the story. On 23 February 2014, buried on page 13, an article appeared with the headline “Top academy investigated for ‘sidelining’ non-Muslim staff”. A week later, it ran a bigger story (though not on the front page), with the headline “Islamist plot to take over schools”. Its subheading said: “Leaked papers reveal an alleged plan to target ailing schools, force out heads and convert classes to Islamic principles”. It was at this point that Faraz learned of the letter’s existence. “It was laughable,” he says. “That was my initial response: ‘This is ridiculous.’” Like Faraz, Alam also learned of the letter for the first time in the papers. He noticed that the article had been co-authored by Richard Kerbaj, the security correspondent. “I thought that was rather odd – why is a security correspondent co-authoring an article on a school?” That week, Alam called a meeting of the senior leadership team at Park View Educational Trust to discuss the possibility that the story was going to grow. “It was taking a ‘Muslim direction’, if you know what I mean,” said Alam. Over the next few weeks, former staff from Park View, Nansen, Golden Hillock and other local schools came forward with increasingly inflammatory claims, which were picked up by reporters as further evidence of an Islamic conspiracy to take over schools. Many of the most widely reported allegations were challenged or revealed to be false. There were accusations of “morality squads” of prefects at Park View (strongly disputed by the school), a £70,000 speaker system installed to broadcast the call to prayer (the schools said the cost was nowhere near this high, and the speakers were for general use), of extremist propaganda videos played in classrooms (it later emerged this was a Panorama documentary that the police had asked to be played as part of the government’s Prevent programme). “[These allegations] were happening to so many schools across Birmingham,” said Mazhar Hussain. “It was unbelievable. It reminded me of Lord Voldemort coming back in Harry Potter,” he said, referring to the atmosphere of terror and suspicion that sweeps through Hogwarts in the fifth Harry Potter book, as the teachers are unceremoniously sacked or replaced. For many local Muslims, the affair felt like just the latest attempt by the media and authorities to vilify the community. The scandal coincided with Isis seizing territory across Iraq and Syria, and the stories often ran next to each other. “There is no doubt that a small group of people in our city went on a massive power trip and behaved completely inappropriately – going way beyond the remit and the parameter for governors,” Shabana Mahmood, MP for Birmingham Ladywood, told me back in 2014. “But counter-terrorism? What is the community supposed to think when their children’s education is viewed as a matter of national security? My constituents shouldn’t feel they have to justify their religion or culture.” Amid the wilder accusations were many reasonable, if smaller-scale, complaints: female staff members reported that they had been marginalised by male Muslim teachers. Questions were raised about nepotism and the way governors had handled employment disputes; some former and current headteachers alleged bullying and harassment by governors or parents, and others felt they had been unfairly passed over for promotion. It is hard to imagine these kinds of stories garnering such levels of media attention had they not involved Muslim staff or pupils. On 16 March, excerpts from the Park View Brotherhood and Educational Activists WhatsApp groups appeared in the Telegraph after being leaked to the journalist Andrew Gilligan. “The WhatsApp conversations alone are, in my opinion, sufficient evidence that Razwan Faraz and Monzoor Hussain should never be let near schoolchildren again,” Gilligan told me recently via email. The fallout from the scandal began to take its toll on Faraz. “People started to get stressed, particularly my mum. She suffers from depression so it affected her big time,” he told me. He lost friends. “They all got afraid that my phone must be bugged. I became like a leper.” * * * Far from calling for caution and calm, the DfE, led by Gove, added fuel to the fire. Former Park View staff recall confidential internal reports and financial information being leaked to the press almost as soon as they were submitted to the DfE. In April, Gove ordered Peter Clarke to head an investigation into the Trojan horse allegations. The appointment of the former head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism division removed any ambiguity about how the government viewed the affair. Clarke set to work, sharing resources with the educationalist Ian Kershaw, who Birmingham city council had appointed to lead a separate investigation into what had happened. They interviewed more than 50 witnesses, including the teachers accused of wrongdoing and female Muslim teachers who had criticised the schools and sought advice from the Muslim Women’s Network, a Birmingham-based advocacy group. Clarke and Kershaw ended up with more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts. Within the schools affected, it was difficult for staff and students to focus. “The media helicopters above made such a noise zooming down on the school,” says John, the Nansen teacher. “Kids felt unsettled and uneasy and they could see the adults did too.” When parents asked John what was going on, he didn’t know how to answer. “You either say, ‘Your child is at risk of becoming extremist’, or you say, ‘The community you belong to is being demonised and scapegoated and misrepresented’”. At Golden Hillock, some staff were suspended, including Mazhar Hussain, who had moved there when it was incorporated into the Park View Educational Trust. In May, Ofsted carried out snap inspections of 21 schools in Birmingham. Their initial recommendation, that Park View retain its outstanding rating, was leaked to the Guardian. A few days later, inspectors returned and it was placed in special measures: downgraded from the highest rating to the lowest, overnight. (Ofsted has denied any suggestion that inspectors were leaned on.) All three Park View Educational Trust schools – Park View, Nansen and Golden Hillock – along with Oldknow and Saltley, were downgraded, accused of “failing to prepare children for life in modern Britain”. “Morale was terribly low,” said John. “It felt like reading a tabloid newspaper, not an Ofsted report.” As the story developed, the schools almost fell into the background, obscured by political squabbling. In June, Gove took aim at Theresa May’s Home Office’s for adopting an insufficiently tough approach to extremism, saying government should “drain the swamp” and not wait for “the crocodiles to reach the boat”. In retaliation, a letter was leaked to the press in which May connected the scandal to Gove’s academies policy: “The allegations relating to schools in Birmingham raise serious questions about the quality of school governance and oversight arrangements”. David Cameron stepped in, ordering Gove to apologise, and ordering May to sack her closest aide, Fiona Cunningham, for briefing against the DfE. (When she became prime minister, May rehired Cunningham – now Fiona Hill – as her chief of staff. She resigned after the disastrous 2017 election.) Soon after the summer term ended and the entire Park View Educational Trust stepped down, Clarke and Kershaw published their reports. They found no evidence of radicalisation – fomenting extremist views – but concluded (to different extents) that there was a concerted effort to “Islamise” schools, and run them as de facto faith schools. The Kershaw report stopped short of saying there was a conspiracy, but the Clarke report, which drew heavily on the material from the WhatsApp groups, concluded that there was a “sustained, coordinated agenda to impose segregationist attitudes and practices of a hardline, politicised strain of Sunni Islam”. It remains impossible to separate the way that the Trojan horse allegations were treated from the wider context of how Muslims are viewed in British society: as a potential threat, a fifth column. Gove himself is the author of an inflammatory book, Celsius 7/7, about the Islamic threat to Europe, which contains a chapter called “Trojan Horse”. “Gove decided to turn it into a culture war,” says Liam Byrne, Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, the constituency in which Park View is situated. “The schools in question were academies, so the buck stops with the secretary of state. My view is that he turned it into this great Islamist controversy in order to deflect attention from his own neglect.” (In March 2015, the education select committee – a group of MPs tasked with assessing the performance of government departments – published a report that was sharply critical of how the affair was handled, highlighting the lack of oversight that resulted from the rapid expansion of the academies programme.) The real losers, of course, have been local children. Many graduates of Park View feel that the name of their school, which was previously a source of pride, now carries a stigma. “If I apply for a job, I’m always worried they’ll see where I went to school and think: is she an extremist?” said Muneeza, the former Park View student. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the intense media scrutiny and the high turnover of staff, A*-C GCSE results at Park View, which was renamed Rockwood Academy in 2015, dropped to 58% in 2015 and 42% in 2016. This summer, A*-C results rose back to 57%, still 16% lower than in 2011. * * * In late 2016, I visited Faraz at his house in Walsall, about four miles from Park View, where he lives with his wife and three sons. He was suspended in the summer of 2014, and by the time we met, he had been unable to teach at schools for more than two years, as the DfE pursued professional misconduct charges against him and several other teachers at schools in Birmingham. Faraz’s living room is full of books on a wide array of subjects, and in the corridor there is a piano and several guitars propped up in different spots; Faraz plays, and his kids are learning, too. He and his wife host foreign exchange students from Europe every year, and as we spoke, some of these girls were coming in and out of the house. The exchange students are always girls, Faraz told me, since with three sons, his wife doesn’t want more boys in the house. “I don’t practise gender segregation or the banning of music in my own house, so why would I seek to impose it at school?” Faraz said, shaking his head. “It’s just funny.” Faraz finds it bizarre to see himself characterised as a hard-line conservative. “I am the complete opposite of a Salafi and so are many of the other teachers. [To the prosecutors and media] the nuances that separate us are irrelevant. We are all brown Pakis basically, who wanted to take over schools that served majority Pakistani Muslim children, and push Islam upon them when they were already Muslim.” In the immediate aftermath of the scandal, Faraz says he entered a period of reading and reflection. He now describes his homophobic comments as “ignorant” and spends some of his time arguing with Facebook friends who post bigoted remarks. (He showed me these arguments, which he had posted over the course of several months.) During his years in limbo, Faraz has also taught workshops on fatherhood and parenting. “‘Trojan Horse’ plotters dodge teaching ban” was the headline for Gilligan’s article in the Times about these workshops. (This was erroneous – the ban was specifically on teaching in schools, while Faraz was teaching workshops to adults.) Back in 2014, it was initially suggested that more than 100 teachers and teaching assistants in Birmingham could be banned from schools as a result of the Trojan horse affair. This was soon reduced to 50 – and when misconduct hearings began in 2015, only 15 people faced charges. The misconduct hearings took place in public, in a drab room in the DfE building in Coventry, where legal teams spent months arguing over different forms of Islamic practice. After the tabloid allegation of radicalisation dissipated, the key accusation against the teachers – whose hearings were grouped according to which school they taught at and their level of seniority – was that they worked together to promote the “undue influence of Islam”. There is no specific definition of “undue influence”, and much of the defence case rested on showing the statutory obligations on schools to include religion. (Alam, not formally an employee of the schools and not subject to the same procedures, was banned by the DfE for life from having anything to do with education, and accused of “undermining fundamental British values”.) On Tuesday 30 May 2017, a grey morning, the DfE’s professional body, the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL), met to discuss the disciplinary case against the senior leaders connected to the Park View Trust – Razwan Faraz, Lindsey Clark, Hardeep Saini, and Monzoor and Arshad Hussain. The verdict on their lifetime bans from teaching had been delayed for over more than two years, and lawyers for the teachers had filed to have the case thrown out. Faraz didn’t go to Coventry for the hearing; he was expecting another delay and simply couldn’t bear to engage. The only accused to turn up were Lindsey Clark and Arshad Hussain, who broke down in tears before the decision was announced. At around 10.30am, Faraz received a text from his lawyer. “They have dropped the case.” According to the NCTL disciplinary committee, the repeated failure of the government’s lawyers to share crucial evidence from the Clarke inquiry had “brought the integrity of the process into disrepute.” As a result, the case would have to be thrown out. Lindsey Clark’s lawyer, Katie Langdon, summed up her client’s mixed feelings about this outcome: “Although Ms Clark is pleased that the proceedings are not continuing, today’s victory is a hollow one. She had very much fought for, and sought to obtain, a verdict clearing her of any wrongdoing. This, now, is no longer possible.” The decision also meant that the hearings against the other teachers in the Park View Trust’s schools (including Mazhar Hussain) would be dropped. After several years and hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money, just one teacher – the former acting head of Oldknow – has had any disciplinary charges upheld in relation to the Trojan horse case. The other 14 have all had their cases overturned, dropped or dismissed. The verdict doesn’t appear to have changed anyone’s mind about the right and wrongs of the case. “The collapse of the cases doesn’t prove anything one way or another about the plot,” Gilligan told me, citing the fact that it collapsed on a “technicality”. The DfE is doggedly pursuing the issue; some have speculated that they do not want to lose face, given the scale of the national scandal and the amount of public money already spent. Soon after the cases were thrown out, the DfE opened up a new process: to place some of the former Park View teachers, who are now in theory allowed to return to the classroom, on the Disclosure and Barring Service register. They would not only be banned from classrooms, but would not be allowed to work in any setting involving children. There are limited opportunities to challenge such allegations. Three years after the Trojan horse letter surfaced, there is still no proof that a conspiracy existed. The central claim that remains about Park View and the other implicated schools is that they had become too Islamic, that some invisible line was crossed from the compulsory level of religion that schools must provide to the point where it was “undue”. But in an education system that is not secular, such as Britain’s, there is no unambiguous way to draw such boundaries. Among those who believe that a conspiracy existed, as set out in the original dossier, there is a tendency to fall back on vague, dark statements. Several people in Birmingham I spoke to referred to “an ideology, a mindset”, but could not elaborate. “People have hinted darkly to me there were other things going on,” said Felderhof, the educationalist. “That’s interesting isn’t it? My response is always: show me the evidence. I haven’t seen it.” Main image: Oldknow Academy, now known as Ark Chamberlain Primary Academy.

Actually, this podcast drama has been back for a few weeks now, but I deliberately didn’t listen: I enjoy binge-listening when it comes to my favourite shows, rather than having to wait a week for my fix. (I’m not alone in this, of course, and many podcast producers have noted it: S Town and Jon Ronson’s The Butterfly Effect released all their episodes at once. With a non-newsy, finite yarn, it often makes sense to do so.) Anyway, I plugged in while on a long drive and was immediately sucked back into the strange world of the Homecoming memory programming scheme of Walter Cruz, Heidi Bergman and horrible Colin Belfast. Should I do a recap of series 1? You don’t really need to have listened (I’d forgotten everything until I heard the new series), though you should, because it’s really good. Both series of Homecoming have the same things going for them: a mystery gradually revealed, a sense of time running out, fallible heroes who can’t always remember what actually happened to them and the old-fashioned notion that there are companies and governments running sinister secret systems that can draw in innocent people as collateral. This last concept reminds me of The Prisoner, or Nineteen Eighty-Four, of those old fear‑of-communism stories that assumed that, in the future, people in power would bother to keep minutely detailed information on every aspect of your life, when in fact, no one seems able to locate your repeat prescription even when you turn up in person with your NHS number tattooed across your face. So, Homecoming 2. I’m not going to reveal the plot, or tell you who our heroes are, but it’s clear who we’re not rooting for: Colin Belfast, played by David Schwimmer, who co-stars with Catherine Keener and Oscar Isaac. The key to Colin Belfast, and to most of the characters, is status. We hear conversations in bars, on doorsteps, on the phone (a lot) and in each case, Belfast changes his demeanour, moving himself up and down the status bar, depending on who he’s talking to. He’s wily, condescending and triumphant with those he considers beneath him; pleading and officious with those above him. He flips between scenes, and sometimes even within scenes, revealing everything simply by changing his attitude. No need to spell out motivation or intention; it’s there in the voice. It’s not just him; the acting (and writing) is uniformly great – nothing is flagged up, everyone comes with a realistic and believable outlook, with baggage that reveals itself as conversations progress. In fact, my only problem with Homecoming 2 is the advert for an iBook within it. The book is meant to enhance your experience by offering you an extensive backstory to one of the characters, released week by week. But a) I don’t need to know about the book until the episode is over and b) I don’t actually want to know what’s been going on, I’m happy to imagine for myself. That is, though, my only quibble. It’s an excellent series and, as ever, a showcase for just how slick and absorbing audio drama can be. The very opposite of slick, but also weirdly absorbing, is 5 Live’s Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show. Here are Phil Tufnell and Michael Vaughan chuntering on, trying to sound cross but failing, trying to sound ecstatic but failing at that too, grumbling a bit, analysing a bit, offering insights such as, “Gotta get a 100. Not even a pretty 30, couple of nice clips.” “Two half centuries?” “A 70 or 80 minimum, for me”. England are not doing well (I gather), but there isn’t the despair or vitriol of football analysis. Even though the show opened with, “The West Indies have pulled off a stunning victory to win a Test match in England for the first time in 17 years!”, nobody seems that bothered in Tuffers/Vaughan world. “If you’re bowling well and you can swing the ball away, it doesn’t matter if you’re running up doing jazz hands,” reports Tuffers. Chappers (Mark Chapman) is here, too, keeping things in line and on time. He asks stats questions, like: “In total, three different England head coaches have had 14 picks, in terms of specialist batters. Name the coaches. And how many of those 14 have become permanent?” God. It’s all very pub quiz, three middle-aged blokes having a chat and a laugh. Amiable, informed, comforting. A good accompaniment to sorting out the washing or doing other little jobs. And yes, that is a compliment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/31/us-citizenship-test-love-the-country-high-taxes-never-work-in-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:48:59Z","webTitle":"Would you say you love America to get a US passport? | Emma Brockes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/us-citizenship-test-love-the-country-high-taxes-never-work-in-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/us-citizenship-test-love-the-country-high-taxes-never-work-in-britain","fields":{"headline":"Would you say you love America to get a US passport?","bodyText":"Every few years in Britain, the subject of the citizenship test comes up, to the sound of collective scoffing. Native Britons try it, fail it, and poke fun at the whole thing as a meaningless gesture. In the US, by contrast, the citizenship process is taken more seriously, in a way that is both easy to mock and also the delivery system via which, Trump notwithstanding, foreigners are able to become Americans – in contrast to the way that, in the UK, they can’t become wholly British. The US idea is more porous and inclusive, and as a result is more vigorously defended. This week, a Spanish friend went for her US citizenship test, the first time she had sat an exam for almost 40 years, and she had a panic attack on the subway. In advance of the test, she did some mock drills on the internet. The questions ranged wildly from the bleeding obvious to the abstract, to the one she least wanted to answer: “Why are you here?” Open questions can seem like a trick, but clearly the response being fished for in this case was: “I’m here because I love America.” She wasn’t convinced she could say it. I have been in the US for almost 10 years and I can’t say I love it, either. I admire it. I find it awesome, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. But even after all these years I can’t see its vulnerabilities clearly enough to say that I love it. Even if I did, however, being forced to state that love to an immigration official would strongly incline me to withhold. This is, of course, a cultural hangover of my own. Any British test probing for patriotic fervour would do well to reward an applicant for sneering at the question, since the only proper way to express love for this country is to cheerfully deride it as useless. In the event, my friend was asked which three colours are on the Stars and Stripes – and why the colonisers came to the US. “What did you say?” I said. “To escape high taxes,” she said. “What did you say that for?” She looked glum. “I have no idea. It just came to me.” Anyway she passed, and was ecstatic. The next thing will be the citizenship ceremony, which even the most cynical are said to find moving and, unlike that in the UK, never conjures thoughts of Ukip-style allegiances. Back to the stone age The best test for exposing one’s ignorance is children. At the weekend, I took my two year old daughters to New York’s Natural History Museum, and we wandered around while they made bear sounds and tried to press things that weren’t buttons. In the geology hall, we gazed at huge fossils that hung behind glass. “That’s a fossil,” I said importantly, feeling virtuous for doing something educational on a weekend. “What’s a fossil?” asked my daughter. Why do I never learn? There was a long pause. “It’s a very old stone that something died in,” I said. This hung in the air while I became aware of a group of tourists immediately to my right, whom I hoped weren’t speakers of English. “Oh,” she said brightly and skipped up the ramp to look at something to do with the water table, for which I would be offering no introduction. Wild at heart The other trip we took at the weekend was five minutes on a ferry across the East river to Governors Island. It is an uninhabited nature reserve which, in the summer, serves as a recreation ground for New Yorkers. It is lovely: huge butterflies, tall grasses, over the top of which appear the reassuring sight of the skyscrapers of downtown. It is often said there are no truly wild spaces left, but there is something about being in a place without cars, separated by water but 30 minutes from home, that feels to me wilder than anything.

A paper released by the Australia Institute on Friday in turn accused the foreign-funded Minerals Council of Australia of spending millions of tax-deductible dollars on political advocacy aimed at reducing its tax liabilities. A Treasury inquiry is considering changes to the rules on which organisations can claim deductible gift recipient status – the latest stage in a long-running campaign by the Coalition government, miners and some media outlets to limit the advocacy activities conducted by environmental NGOs. The inquiry has sought “stakeholder views” on a list of recommendations made by parliamentary inquiries established by the Coalition. They include the proposal to force environmental charities to devote up to 50% of their expenditure to “remediation” and monitor more closely the advocacy activities of all charities. The Minerals Council of Australia released its submission to the inquiry this week, in which it calls for a further gagging of charities’ advocacy roles, suggesting they be banned from using more than 10% of their expenditure on advocacy. Currently, charities are allowed to engage in advocacy but it must not include “promoting or opposing a political party or candidate for political office”. The Minerals Council submission contains eight pages of photographs of campaigns by environmental and progressive charities it says break that rule. The submission also calls for the identity and location of donors to charities that engage in advocacy to be revealed – an issue not raised in the Treasury discussion paper but one that has been raised by another parliamentary inquiry that proposed banning foreign donations to all groups that spend money on political activity. Not revealing the identity of those donors, the submission says, “constitutes a potential threat to Austalia’s [sic] sovereignty, by allowing foreign interests to exert political influence by covertly funding domestic environmental groups”. But on Friday the Australia Institute – itself a registered charity – released a paper analysing the degree of tax-deductible advocacy engaged in by foreign-funded mining lobby groups such as the Minerals Council. It found the Australian mining industry was 86% foreign-owned and had spent more than half a billion dollars lobbying Australian governments over the past decade – most of which would have been a tax deduction for the companies, resulting in forgone tax revenue of about $162m. The report lays out ways in which the foreign-funded mining lobby has exerted political influence, most of which has aimed at reducing the tax revenue collected from those miners. The report notes: Lobbying by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton has prevented an inquiry into the $75bn-a-year iron ore industry. The Minerals Council lobbies to maintain subsidies and tax concessions for mining companies that cost Australian taxpayers billions every year. In 2013, taxpayers paid $4.5bn in subsidies and concessions to the mining industry. The mining industry spent at least $100m from 2010-12 lobbying for the repeal of the minerals resource rent tax, or “mining tax”, which budget papers estimate has reduced tax revenue by $5.3bn. Hannah Aulby from the Australia Institute, author of the report, said: “Foreign corporate mining interests are attempting to influence government to help increase their profits. They are not acting in the public interest and in fact can distort sound economic decision making.” Aulby said many Australians thought of some of the big miners as Australian companies but they were mostly foreign-owned. BHP is 76% foreign owned and Rio Tinto 83%, meaning both companies are officially foreign corporations under Australian law, the report noted. The push to gag environmental groups has been seen as a threat to the whole charity sector by some in the industry. The Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) – the body representing Australia’s international development organisations – strongly opposed the proposed limits to the advocacy activities of charities in its submission to the Treasury inquiry. “Charities undertaking advocacy has been recognised as both a legitimate activity and one essential to our system of parliamentary democracy,” their submission says. “It is an important approach which charities can use to address the causes of social and environmental problems, rather than just the symptoms – an approach that often requires seeking policy change.” The chief executive of Acfid, Mark Purcell, told the Guardian the attack on environmental groups was the “thin edge of the wedge”. “In a liberal democracy you can’t go around trying to shut down groups on the basis of their activities. If they are carrying out work that is of benefit to the community and they’re doing that consistent with their charitable purpose then that’s the test. It should not be governments arbitrarily setting percentages of how much of particular activities you can do.” Labor’s spokesman on charities and not-for-profits, Andrew Leigh, said the government “seems to think that charities should be seen but not heard”. “Labor disagrees. We believe that charities and non-profits have an important role to play in advocating for a better world,” Leigh said. “Wouldn’t it be great if the Turnbull government started working with the non-profit sector, rather than waging a non-stop war on charities?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/31/putin-holiday-mansion-revealed-russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:13:10Z","webTitle":"Putin 'holiday mansion' revealed by Russian opposition leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/putin-holiday-mansion-revealed-russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/31/putin-holiday-mansion-revealed-russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny","fields":{"headline":"Putin 'holiday mansion' revealed by Russian opposition leader","bodyText":"The Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has published aerial footage of a hidden island mansion near the Finnish border allegedly used by Vladimir Putin as a holiday retreat. The mansion, known as Villa Segren, is located on a picturesque 50-acre site on and around Lodochny island in the Gulf of Finland. It was used as the backdrop for a Soviet TV adaptation of Sherlock Holmes filmed in the 1980s. Drone footage of the site shows several large new houses, including the newly extended villa, a helipad and a pier. Navalny said the site was heavily guarded, including by a large fence, and that locals were barred from the area. In the video, Navalny alleges the property is owned by close friends of the Russian president, but is for his use. “All the evidence clearly points towards one of Vladimir Putin’s standard corruption schemes. His personal assets are registered under the names of his close friends who have become fabulously wealthy over the last 17 years,” said Navalny in the video, which had been viewed almost 2 million times on Thursday, less than 24 hours after it was uploaded to YouTube. The land the property was built on is rented from Sergei Rudnov, a businessman, according to Navalny. Rudnov is the son of a friend of Putin’s, and also worked for the Russian cellist Sergei Roldugin, who has known Putin for years and was linked in documents leaked in the Panama Papers to offshore companies with cash flows of up to £1.4bn. In a similar investigation into the ownership of Villa Selgren earlier this month, the liberal TV news channel Dozhd published design sketches for the interior of the “secret dacha”, which show a large indoor swimming pool and a richly furnished office with the double-headed Russian eagle engraved in gold above a desk. Work to fit out the property for Putin’s use began after 2010 and the president “has vacationed there at least once”, Dozhd reported. Navalny’s anti-corruption investigations have targeted a string of high-profile Russian officials, as the opposition figurehead continues to campaign to be allowed to run in presidential elections scheduled for next year. A video about luxury properties allegedly linked to the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev – including a 5bn rouble (£66m) mansion near Moscow and a vineyard – has been watched more than 24 million times on YouTube since it was uploaded in March. The issue became a rallying cry at two subsequent nationwide protests organised by Navalny that were attended by tens of thousands of people. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison after calling for supporters to attend an unsanctioned rally. At the time, Medvedev’s spokesperson said it was “pointless to comment on propaganda attacks from an opposition figure and a convict”. There has been no official reaction to Navalny’s latest claims. The Kremlin did not respond when contacted by Dozhd. Villa Selgren is not the first country mansion linked to Putin, with former Kremlin insiders alleging a palace built near the Black Sea coast was also for the personal use of the Russian leader. Navalny has repeatedly accused top Kremlin officials of graft and of amassing illicit fortunes. A fortnight ago he detailed the lavish lifestyle of Nikolay Choles, the son of Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/01/me-robin-hood-deadclub-best-uk-theatre-dance","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T09:30:40Z","webTitle":"Me & Robin Hood and DeadClub: this week’s best UK theatre and dance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/01/me-robin-hood-deadclub-best-uk-theatre-dance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/01/me-robin-hood-deadclub-best-uk-theatre-dance","fields":{"headline":"Me & Robin Hood and DeadClub: this week’s best UK theatre and dance","bodyText":"Theatre 1 Me &amp; Robin Hood In his last show, The Duke – which took its title from a porcelain figure that his late father bought as an investment – Shôn Dale-Jones asked what the things we value say about us.

Yet there was cause for at least minor concern. Nadal’s four-set win to reach the third round of the US Open, a few hours after Roger Federer’s much patchier effort in five sets against Mikhail Youznhy, left the impression that two of the greatest rivals in the history of the game might never get to play each other at Flushing Meadows. They are slated to meet for the first time in the semi-finals, yet neither is nailed on to get out of the quarters. Nadal next plays Leonardo Mayer, over whom he holds a 3-0 career advantage, and Federer plays Feliciano Lopez, who has not beaten him in 12 attempts. Nevertheless, there is insurrection in the air; anything is possible here – as we have already witnessed. Daniel, loser of seven of eight matches before arriving in New York, made a mockery of his 121 world ranking when he made the most of nearly every exchange – he even threatened to break Nadal for a third time as served for the match – and he walked away from his debut on Arthur Ashe with the respect of his illustrious opponent as well as the consolation cheers of an appreciative audience. The Spaniard, who has been champion here twice, eventually closed down his slightly built opponent with the popgun serve and tenacious attitude, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, after nearly three hours. Nadal’s strength, class and grit got him through. The relief on his face was there for all to see. On the same court, Federer was less impressive against Youzhny, who still hasn’t beaten him in their 17 matches. But these were two curious performances by the virtual co-favourites in the absence of Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka and Andy Murray. They own 34 grand slam titles between them, yet both were red-lining nervously in matches they should have won without fuss. Daniel, who was born 24 years ago in New York, where his Japanese parents met while working on Wall Street, played perhaps the match of his life. His break at the end of the first set was the product of relentless pressure; when he did it again at the start of the second, Nadal knew he was going to have to dig deeper than he might have imagined beforehand. He did so, broke back twice and levelled at a set piece when he served out to 30 with a solid serve down the T on which Daniel could only put a tired racket. Nadal will surely have sensed that Daniel, who played three hours and five sets on Thursday at the back end of a rain-wrecked schedule, was growing steadily more weary under the weight of his heavy hitting. However, the drawn-out exchanges will have taken their toll on 31-year-old Nadal, too, and he hardly helped himself by receiving serve so deep he was almost treading on the ballkids. It is his clay way, of course, but, hitting from so far behind the baseline, he is not getting the purchase on the ball on the hard court, the revolutions dying by the foot. Certainly, once he made his breakthrough, there was an inevitability about the result. Even by the standards of this tournament, where underdogs have bitten hard at the heels of their betters, Nadal losing to Daniel would have been seismic. He probably is in better shape than Federer. The five-time US title-holder was broken eight times – twice as many as his in his entire triumphant Wimbledon campaign – and, despite trying to make light of his ordeal, seemed to be feeling the effects of the back trouble that flared in Montreal and kept him out of Cincinnati. His movement was uncertain, his ball-striking after a one-sided first set equally unconvincing. He has been on court for five hours and 45 minutes in two matches – a long time for a 36-year-old in a seven-match tournament of five-setters. The paradox is that both Youzhny and Daniel did to Federer and Nadal respectively what those champions so often have done to lesser lights: stretched them to the point of physical and spiritual exhaustion. Yet both lost. There is life in the old dogs yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/02/to-be-better-dads-men-need-parental-leave-and-flexible-working-and-a-culture-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"To be better dads, men need parental leave and flexible working.

And a culture change","bodyText":"The nature of fatherhood is changing. In the past, fathers bore the burden as a family’s sole breadwinner. Nowadays, just as many mothers want to to pursue their careers, many fathers want to be actively involved in raising children. Gennaro Folino, a retail design manager, is one such dad. He took time off work to support his wife when she wanted to return to work and became the main carer for his baby son. “I Iost my father a couple of years ago – I didn’t get to see him that much when we were growing up, because he was working long hours in a factory and I didn’t want to miss out on time with [my son] Julian.” Folino was lucky because his employer, Stockland, provides parental leave benefits, which he was able to take knowing that it would not negatively impact his career. But not all Australian fathers have the same opportunity. Data from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency shows that only about half of non-public sector organisations with more than 100 employers offer paid primary carers’ leave. However, unsurprisingly, the data also shows a predictable pattern of primary carers’ leave being taken overwhelmingly by women. When primary carers’ leave is available to men during the first year of a child’s life, it creates the opportunity for men to take up the full-time caring role when their partner is ready to return to work – a true win-win. But even when it is offered, many employers tell us that men are often reluctant to take up their parental leave entitlements. It is a similar situation with flexible working arrangements – the other crucial element in encouraging fathers to take on caring responsibilities. Our data shows almost two-thirds of non-public sector organisations with more than 100 employers had either a flexible working policy or strategy in place. Yet far fewer men than women are accessing flexible work. So why is it that more men are not taking parental leave and working flexibly? One of the reasons is gender bias in the workplace. The impact of workplace gender bias on women is severe. However, it can also affect men, particularly fathers. A 2014 report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, for instance, found that 27% of fathers and partners reported experiencing discrimination related to parental leave and return to work. Men are also more likely to have their requests for flexible work rejected and may be considered less committed to their job. The example of Andrew Jamieson debunks this notion. Before starting work at not-for profit aged care provider, Benetas, Jamieson had deeply-held assumptions about the role of men. “I was full-time, the main breadwinner and left the majority of caring responsibilities to my wife who is a teacher. I think there was a belief that there was a trade-off between flexibility and career, and you couldn’t have both.” Jamieson purchased leave to have an additional two weeks’ leave each year, which he uses to share caring responsibilities for his son. He now thinks differently about being a father, husband and working professional. “A career can co-exist with flexible working, and I’m hoping this will also allow my wife to develop her career further without many of the impediments that existed previously.” Achieving gender equality in the workplace requires more employers to introduce parental leave and flexibility policies that encourage take-up by men. But changing mindsets and workplace cultures is equally important. These two stories show how it can be done for the benefit of employers and employees alike. Stockland’s parental leave scheme, for example, has seen a higher return-to-work rate and increased loyalty from employees. Gender equality is about women and men working together to create more equal opportunities and genuine choice for everyone. This Father’s Day, let’s talk about ways to make it easier for dads to share the caring responsibilities for their children. It will help us all in the long run.

Fox’s comment follows a tense press conference in Brussels on Thursday after the third round of exit talks, in which the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, accused the UK of being mired in “nostalgia” rather than taking a realistic approach. Speaking in Tokyo on Friday, where he is accompanying Theresa May on a trip focused on post-Brexit trade, Fox was asked by ITV news whether it was time for Britain to agree on the much-disputed departure settlement with the EU, hastening progress towards the second, trade-focused part of the process. “We can’t be blackmailed into paying a price on the first part,” Fox said. He continued: “We think we should begin discussions on the final settlement because that’s good for business, and it’s good for the prosperity both of the British people and of the rest of the people of the European Union.” Speaking later to Sky News, Fox said he was concerned the Brexit talks were “stuck” on the initial issues. “I think there is frustration that we have not been able to get on that longer-term issue, that we’re stuck on this separation issue, and we’re not able to get on to the issues that will matter in the longer term for the future prosperity of the UK and the people of Europe. “And I had representations from businesses from across Europe – from Germany, from Spain – to say: ‘Can we put more pressure on the commission to try and get us a better idea of what that final picture will look like because we need to maintain an open and liberal trading environment in Europe?’” Fox was speaking ahead of May’s final leg of a three-day trip to Kyoto and Tokyo, focused in part on defence and security, but primarily as an exercise in reassuring Japanese businesses that post-Brexit Britain can remain a gateway to the EU. After a series of talks with her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, May won a formal agreement with Japan that the two countries will seek to strike a rapid replacement trade deal once Brexit is completed. This would be closely based on a long-negotiated economic partnership agreement between the EU and Japan, which both sides aim to sign soon. May hopes such instant copycat deals – termed “cut-and-paste Brexit” by opponents – could be reached with other nations, creating continuity and confidence. They would officially be interim but could last some years before bespoke UK deals are reached. The release of the joint statement saw Downing Street hail May’s trip to Japan as a great success. However, as she was holding a cordial press conference with Abe in Tokyo, a very different equivalent event was taking place in Brussels. EU negotiator Barnier, speaking alongside the Brexit secretary, David Davis, warned that the UK’s approach to Brexit was nostalgic, unrealistic and undermined by a lack of trust, his strongest criticism of the UK’s stance at the talks so far. Barnier said some of the recent British proposals showed “a sort of nostalgia in the form of specific requests which would amount to continuing to enjoy the benefits of the single market and EU membership without actually being part of it”. This drew an acid response from Davis, who remarked that Barnier should not “confuse a belief in the free market with nostalgia”. Barnier said he had been left impatient by the British approach and complained there had been “no decisive progress”. Again, Davis disagreed, insisting progress had been “concrete”. May was due to meet Japan’s Emperor Akihito in Tokyo on Friday morning before attending a wheelchair basketball match, connected to a UK promise to assist Japan ahead of the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo. She was then scheduled to fly back to London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/01/coalition-hails-success-of-cashless-welfare-card-and-says-kalgoorlie-will-be-next-site","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T03:45:21Z","webTitle":"Turnbull says cashless welfare card about 'practical love' while announcing new site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/01/coalition-hails-success-of-cashless-welfare-card-and-says-kalgoorlie-will-be-next-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/01/coalition-hails-success-of-cashless-welfare-card-and-says-kalgoorlie-will-be-next-site","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull says cashless welfare card about 'practical love' while announcing new site","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has described the Coalition’s cashless welfare debit card as “an exercise in practical love” while announcing Kalgoorlie as the third trial site for the card. The Coalition says its two existing trial sites – in Ceduna, South Australia, and in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia – have had significant reductions in alcohol consumption and gambling since trials began in March and April last year, and despite some controversy it was keen to expand the program. “This is an exercise in practical love, in compassion,” Malcolm Turnbull told the assembled media in Kalgoorlie, in the Goldfields-Esperance region of WA, on Friday. “If you looked into the eyes of the children who are suffering from foetal alcohol syndrome, who are suffering from neglect, who are suffering from violence at home because their parents are on the grog all the time, you wouldn’t hesitate to say that this card is an act of love. “It is also important to remember that in this community, in the Goldfields, most of the people who will be on the cashless card are non-Indigenous. “In Coolgardie-Boulder itself ... about two-thirds of the people using the card will be non-Indigenous and we believe across the whole of the Goldfields it’s about 58% non-Indigenous, that’s a very important factor.” To coincide with the announcement of Kalgoorlie as a third trial site for the cashless debit card, the government has released a final evaluation report of its two existing trial sites, conducted by ORIMA Research. The report found the cards have had a “considerable positive impact” in the communities where they have operated and concludes the card “has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption and gambling in both trial sites and [is] also suggestive of a reduction in the use of illegal drugs”. It found 41% of people who drink alcohol have reported drinking less frequently and 37% of binge drinkers were doing so less frequently. It also found a decrease in alcohol-related hospital presentations, including a 37% reduction in Ceduna in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the first quarter of 2016. In the East Kimberley, it found decreases in alcohol-related pick-ups by the community patrol services in Kununurra (15% reduction) and Wyndham (12%), and a reduction in referrals to the sobering up shelter in Kununurra by 8%. It found a decrease in the number of women in East Kimberley hospital maternity wards drinking through pregnancy. It found 48% of gamblers who were using the cashless card reported gambling less. In Ceduna and surrounding local government areas, poker machine revenue was down 12% during the trial period, which is the equivalent of almost $550,000 less spent on poker machines in the 12-month trial. In Ceduna and East Kimberley, where the cards have been used by 2,141 people across both trial sites since early last year, a large majority of participants have identified as being Indigenous Australians. Participation in the trials has been mandatory for all working age recipients of income support payments in the trial sites, but wage earners, age pensioners and veterans’ affairs pensioners who live in the trial sites have been able to volunteer for the cards. The cards are designed to reduce the levels of harm in those communities that is underpinned by alcohol consumption, drug use and gambling. They limit participants’ access to cash and prevent the purchase of alcohol or gambling products (other than lottery tickets) in local stores. The cards work by directing 80% of participants’ income support payments, as well as other supplementary payments, to a restricted bank account, accessed only by the debit card. Alan Tudge, the minister for human services, who has led the design and implementation of the trials, said the evaluation report showed the trials had been a success in reducing alcohol, gambling and drugs. “The card is not a panacea but it is has led to a fundamental improvement in these communities. There are very few other initiatives that have had such impact,” Tudge said on Friday. “As many local leaders noted, these communities were in crisis largely due to massive alcohol consumption paid for by the welfare dollar. “I hope that we can look back in a decade’s time and say that this initiative was the beginning of the turnaround.” The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, said the cashless welfare card had been a “great success” but he did not say if it should be rolled out nationally. “We are having great success in reducing alcoholism and also the things associated with it such as family violence, women getting beaten up,” Joyce said on Friday. “What we can say at this point in time is it’s got a good outcome. “We are also noting places that have had the cashless welfare card, they certainly don’t want to go back to the alternate system. They like the safer society they live in. “We should be supporting that. Especially for families, especially for mothers, for kids.” In the 2017-18 budget, the Turnbull government announced it would expand the cashless debit card into two new regions. Friday’s announcement refers to one of those new regions. A fourth location will be announced in coming months. The government will still require legislative change to come into effect to expand the card."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/01/10-things-new-season-premiership-pro-14-england-wales-bristol","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T11:00:42Z","webTitle":"Ten things to look forward to in the new rugby season | Gerard Meagher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/01/10-things-new-season-premiership-pro-14-england-wales-bristol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/01/10-things-new-season-premiership-pro-14-england-wales-bristol","fields":{"headline":"Ten things to look forward to in the new rugby season","bodyText":"1) Lions tour could take its toll Ireland broke the mould in 2014 but before that, as sure as death and taxes, France would win the first Six Nations championship after a Lions tour, often with a grand slam to boot. Getting back on the treadmill a couple of months after a draining southern hemisphere tour is not easy and while the majority of Test Lions will not been seen in the first couple of weeks of the season rediscovering form can be difficult indeed. As Ben Youngs explained last week when discussing his withdrawal from the tour of New Zealand due to family reasons: “I know in 2013 how much I struggled to hit form and get back. It was basically two seasons rolled into one.” An unexpected draw against the All Blacks has meant a number of players’ stock has risen before the new season but it will be a tall order living up to those standards throughout the campaign. 2) International players not always wanted Why did Exeter win the Premiership title last season? Was it because of Gareth Steenson’s nerveless kicking at Twickenham or Henry Slade’s colossal left-footed punt against Saracens? Or maybe it was their 10-match winning run that began during the early stages of the Six Nations. The Chiefs do not suffer nearly as badly as their rivals when it comes to the international windows and it must be considered a significant factor behind their success. Other sides have taken notice and recruitment across the board is beginning to reflect an awareness that the best value is in players who will not be lost for large parts of the season. There is not an influx of overseas players as in France yet but the number is growing because, increasingly, form during the two international windows will be key to the end-of-season shake-up. 3) New challengers needed at top For all that the climax to last season’s Premiership was thrilling – the two semi-finals will linger long in the memory – it must be remembered that it was the same four sides contesting the play-off as 12 months previously. Bath came a lot closer to getting back into the semi-finals but the jockeying for positions five and six is more competitive than the top four. This term, with Todd Blackadder enjoying a full pre-season at The Rec, there is the expectation that Bath will again be more competitive but when it comes to Harlequins, Gloucester and Northampton, as well as the upwardly mobile Sale and Newcastle, it is hard to see them moving ahead of last year’s top four in the pecking order. It would be a shame if the top four becomes a closed shop. 4) Chiefs out to conquer Europe The champagne was still flowing after last season’s Premiership triumph when the Exeter chairman, Tony Rowe, declared that his ambition was to be the best in Europe. It would appear the logical step – of Exeter’s four appearances in the European Cup they have made it to the knockout stages once – but pitted against Leinster, Glasgow and Montpellier they are in a fiercely competitive pool. Last season, they were outclassed at Sandy Park twice by French opposition but this season there is a determination to assert themselves on the continent. Rob Baxter has expressed concerns that his hardest task is re-motivating what is a similar-looking squad after their Premiership success so it may be the case that we see the best of Exeter in the Champions Cup. 5) Greater expectation on England Considering that the All Blacks are not among their opponents, for England this would appear to be a less than stellar autumn set of fixtures. Australia will always relish the prospect of an upset at Twickenham and there will no doubt be some verbal jousting between Eddie Jones and Michael Cheika but, with the greatest respect to the Wallabies, Argentina and Samoa, they are matches England are expected to win. In Stuart Lancaster’s era these matches would have added intrigue because England were a transitional side and demonstrating development was just as significant as the result. This time last year, however, Jones had made winning his modus operandi – England were yet to be beaten under him – and so the manner of victories against South Africa, Fiji, Australia and Argentina mattered less. Each was far from faultless and there will be a greater expectation on England to win with greater precision this time around. 6) New laws should increase the pace The season kicks off on Friday with six new law amendments for players, coaches and referees to get their heads around – three at the scrum, three at the ruck/tackle area. First, the scrum where the changes include a compulsory strike for the ball, allowing the No8 to reach in and pick up the ball and a tweak to the put-in; all effectively done to speed things up by reducing the number of penalties and reset scrums. The three other amendments are that a ruck can be formed by a single player, that a defender cannot kick a ball forwards out of a breakdown and that a defender can only play the ball from their side of the tackle. Again, three changes to encourage quickly recycled ball for the attacking side. It may explain why Leicester’s Matt O’Connor, along with George Ford and Jonny May among the summer arrivals at Welford Road, said: “The new law variations have changed the way teams will play and we’re more equipped for that than we would have been 12 months ago.” 7) Watch out for Manu Tuilagi’s future For reasons of simplicity, the RFU has opted against making England’s elite player squad public this season. It is unlikely there are any surprise names among it if for no other reason that Eddie Jones was without 30 players for the trip to Argentina and, as a result, there are upwards of 60 he has recently called upon in some form or another. It means that in terms of personnel the greatest intrigue of the autumn series will be if and how Manu Tuilagi plays – Jones recognised as much last month and talked him up to set the agenda on his terms, but it backfired. Still, if fit, Tuilagi is likely to get his chance. Second, it means that time is running out for players who are not on that lengthy list to stake a claim for the World Cup. If there is to be a bolt from the blue they are likely to have to start the season at a considerable rate. 8) New era for South African sides A new dawn for the Pro14 with a blend of optimism that things will be all right on the night after a tireless summer working behind the scenes to reshape the competition, now in two conferences of seven teams, with the addition of the two South African franchises. But for all that the Pro14 chief executive, Martin Anayi, has confidently outlined that this is just the start of the expansion, trumpeted the commercial benefits and moved to allay fears over player welfare in what is now a cross-continent competition, it will not be a good look if the Southern Kings and the Cheetahs are not competitive. The Kings have one player with international experience in their squad – the Bloemfontein-born Dries van Schalkwyk who has 15 caps for Italy – and the Cheetahs three, with fewer than 10 Springbok caps between them. The Kings are away to the defending champions the Scarlets on Saturday, the Cheetahs at Ulster on Friday. A thrashing for either will be an early cause for concern. 9) Wales v NZ; Gatland v Hansen The jewel in the crown of the autumn fixture list is undoubtedly Wales hosting New Zealand on 25 November. Warren Gatland is back at the helm for Wales and gets another crack at Steve Hansen, as will a number of his players. Traditionally, Wales do not fare particularly well during the autumn – in the past it has been a time of year when Gatland tries (often unsuccessfully) to unearth a few unpolished gems but last year Rob Howley was criticised for not introducing enough new blood during an insipid campaign. Gatland’s approach will be fascinating, but you sense the visit of the All Blacks is not the time to turn to youth. Other autumn highlights include Ireland hosting South Africa, a test of how resurgent the Springboks actually are, and Georgia’s trip to Cardiff the week before New Zealand – all credit to the WRU for arranging that match. 10) Bristol’s big chance Spare a thought for Hartpury College. Newcomers to the Championship, and playing on Sky Sports for the first time, they gained promotion to the second tier by winning all 30 of their National League One matches last season. It is highly unlikely that their winning streak will be extended on Sunday. They are away to a Bristol side who have bolstered their squad with the signings of Ian Madigan, Steven Luatua and Alapati Leiua to name just three. Bristol will also begin the season knowing that this time they cannot be tripped up by the end of season play-offs – the winner of the Championship now rewarded with automatic promotion. It could be a long afternoon for Hartpury but it will be a short season for Bristol."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/01/hurricane-harvey-us-billion-dollar-weather-disasters-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T18:29:07Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Harvey is a billion-dollar disaster – America's 10th in 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/hurricane-harvey-us-billion-dollar-weather-disasters-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/01/hurricane-harvey-us-billion-dollar-weather-disasters-2017","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Harvey is a billion-dollar disaster – America's 10th in 2017","bodyText":"Even before Hurricane Harvey began to form, out in the north Atlantic, federal climate experts signalled that 2017 was going to be a bad year for weather and climate catastrophes in America. According to scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), there had already been nine climate and weather-related events that caused more than $1bn of damage. This “rapid succession of disaster events” from 1 January to 7 July 2017 was part of a years-long increaseand cost a total of $16bn and 57 lives. Such events included flooding in California, Missouri and Arkansas; hailstorms in Colorado and Minnesota; and a sudden, crop-killing spring freeze across South Carolina and Georgia that destroyed an abnormally early fruit blossom. It is possible that on top of this, economic damage from Harvey will exceed the inflation-adjusted $160bn cost of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Noaa experts told the Guardian. But despite Noaa’s work to track what is happening to climate, weather and the oceans, and how society is affected and might react, Donald Trump proposed earlier this year slashing the administration’s budget by almost $1bn. That would cut US and international research as well as funding for other environmental studies and protections. From 1980 to 2016, according to Noaa records, the US experienced an average of five and a half $1bn-plus “weather and climate disasters” a year. From 2012 to 2016, that reached 10.6 such events a year. Many such events are increasing in intensity, the agency warns. Such increases are chiefly due to a combination of climate change and people spreading into vulnerable areas, especially coasts and floodplains. There is an element of chance in where catastrophic weather systems hit, but another important factor is growing prosperity: Americans have more property to be damaged when serious weather strikes. “The trend in these disasters is clearly up and that reflects more extreme weather events, including more ‘big rain’ events that show up as flooding, and also reflects where people live and how valuable their assets are,” Deke Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring branch of Noaa National Climate Data Center, told the Guardian. “We are seeing an increase in ‘big rain’ brought by tropical cyclones, thunderstorms and severe weather, and ‘big heat’, where the magnitude and duration of heatwaves are up, and these big events are getting bigger, and are clearly related to the changing climate.” Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) tracks and analyses thousands of weather and climate events across the US every year, examining those “that have great economic and societal impacts”, recording deaths and calculating the estimated cost of each disaster in which damage goes over $1bn. Since 1980, the NCEI has found that the US has suffered 212 such disasters, collectively costing more than $1.2tn. Texas has had most such events, at 89. The nine events across the US prior to Harvey put 2017 on track to challenge the recent highs of 2016, with 15 such events, and 2011, which saw 16. The NCEI noted that there were four inland, non-tropical major flooding events causing more than $1bn in damage in the US in 2016. There were two in the first half of 2017 before Harvey, which the experts found “surprising” because before 2016 no more than two $1bn inland flooding events had occurred in any year since 1980. The magnitude of the impact of a disaster is often proportional to the scale of government response required and paid for by taxpayers, said Adam Smith, a Noaa applied climatologist and the primary researcher for the analysis of $1bn disasters. “This is particularly true for hurricane and inland flood events,” he said, “since many US households lack flood insurance and are at risk of losing everything. We are now seeing this unfold on an unprecedented scale due to Hurricane Harvey.” Smith added: “The US has seen an increase in costly, historic flooding disasters in recent years, which is very troublesome when looking into the future. It’s unclear if Harvey’s costs will ultimately surpass Katrina. However, since this is an unprecedented extreme precipitation event over a major city, in addition to the damage to other cities and regions from wind, storm surge and flooding, it’s very possible.” NCEI cost estimates are based on a range of public and private data sources. They take into account total direct losses incurred in weather and climate events, of both the insured and uninsured, including damage to all buildings and the assets within; the cost of business interruption; damage to vehicles, boats, offshore energy platforms and public infrastructure; and destruction of agricultural assets. Smith cited analysis from Erwann Michel-Kerjan, a risk management expert, partner at McKinsey and former adviser to the World Bank, which concludes that the cost of catastrophic hurricanes in particular hitting the US is increasingly being borne by the federal government. The taxpayer shouldered less than 10% of the cost of Hurricane Diane in 1955 and a quarter of the cost of Hurricane Hugo in 1989, according to Michel-Kerjan, but 50% the cost of Katrina in 2005 and 80% of the cost of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Noaa has been developing new methods of flood forecasting, which advocates fear will come under threat, with many other aspects of the agency’s work, if federal funding is cut. The Noaa experts refused to comment on funding issues. Jeff Watters, director of government relations for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, said: “Noaa’s research is crucial in so many aspects and its new methods of flood forecasting, for example, can be a matter of life and death.” The Senate rejected almost all of Trump’s proposed cuts to Noaa when it reviewed his budget earlier this year. Congress resumes business next week, beginning negotiations to produce a federal budget by the end of September. Robert Stavins, professor of energy and economic development at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said: “I would hope that Noaa would continue to be a center of scientific excellence for the US government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/01/derryn-hinch-second-thoughts-on-referring-himself-to-high-court","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T23:38:40Z","webTitle":"Derryn Hinch has second thoughts on referring himself to high court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/01/derryn-hinch-second-thoughts-on-referring-himself-to-high-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/01/derryn-hinch-second-thoughts-on-referring-himself-to-high-court","fields":{"headline":"Derryn Hinch has second thoughts on referring himself to high court","bodyText":"Derryn Hinch has back-pedalled on his intention to ask the Senate to refer him to the high court next week, saying if the government thinks he is eligible to sit in parliament then he won’t bother. The Victorian senator revealed this week he had sought legal advice about his eligibility because he has an American social security number from his time working in New York as a journalist in the 1960s and early 70s. He said he may need to refer himself to the high court to settle the matter, which would make him the eighth parliamentarian to face the high court since the citizenship imbroglio began with the resignation of two Greens senators, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam. Senior members of the government have looked at Hinch’s proposition with some scepticism this week. Malcolm Turnbull dead-batted when asked about the matter on Thursday, saying Hinch needed “to get some advice on that and form his own judgment as to what he should do”. Late on Thursday, Hinch revealed to Sky News he had spoken to the attorney general, George Brandis, and was now waiting to hear what the government thought of his situation. He said he would not refer himself to the high court if he had no case to answer – despite previously saying it would be best to proceed to the high court regardless so he couldn’t be accused of hiding anything. “I don’t want to go to the high court, and I hope I don’t have to, because it will be a waste of the court’s time,” he told Sky News. “I’ve talked briefly to George Brandis today. If I can get a ruling from the government and the solicitor general that they don’t think I’m in breach [of the constitution] then I won’t go. He said he was “bewildered” by his situation and he dismissed suggestions he was merely seeking publicity. “I didn’t raise it, someone vindictively told the Herald Sun and they got it to me,” he said. Hinch had earlier told the media he had sought advice on Wednesday evening from a couple of constitutional lawyers about whether his social security number was an issue that could render him ineligible to sit in the parliament, and “they think I’m in good shape”. He said he wanted to be transparent but was concerned about wasting the high court’s time. “It’s now got to this damned if you do, damned if you don’t,” Hinch had said. “If I say I’ve got this constitutional advice, out there in voter land they’ll say what are you scared of, what are you hiding, why won’t you go to the high court?” Three government ministers – Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash and Matt Canavan; the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts; and Nick Xenophon, leader of the NXT, will also have their eligibility examined by the high court. The first batch of cases will be heard in October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/aug/31/jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T18:57:49Z","webTitle":"Jadon Sancho joins Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City for £8m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/31/jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/aug/31/jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund-manchester-city","fields":{"headline":"Jadon Sancho joins Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City for £8m","bodyText":"Jadon Sancho has become the latest young English player to move overseas after Borussia Dortmund confirmed the 17-year-old has joined from Manchester City for a fee understood to be around £8m.

Georgia had been found unconscious in the garage of her home in Rotorua in New Zealand’s North Island. A priest and a doctor had been cycling past when they noticed something amiss. Another couple playing Pokémon Go rushed to help. In all up to 10 people scrambled to revive the 19-year-old. But she had planned to die. For Georgia’s mother, Suzy Taylor, her daughter’s suicide has been like torture. “It’s like she died 365 times. Every time I wake up I’m forced to live in this world. There’s no pill I can take, nothing I can drink, no place that I can go to, no person that I can see that is going to make this any different – it’s a life sentence.” Taylor has known the grief of suicide before. Her husband took his own life in 1995; so did her best friend in 2001. Suicide is New Zealand’s silent epidemic. The country has the highest youth suicide rates in the developed world – five times that of Britain and twice as high as Australia. Latest figures released this week show more New Zealanders are taking their lives than ever before. The number of deaths has risen for three years in a row to 606 in the year ending 30 June, from 579 the previous year. For such a crisis the response has garnered little attention, according to some who are pushing for this national tragedy to be addressed head on. In early August, three bereaved mothers, who all lost children aged under 25, sent a letter to political parties on behalf of 200 other bereaved families, asking for six things: an independent inquiry into mental health; restoring NZ$2.3bn (£1.3bn/AU$2bn) in health funding; setting a suicide reduction target; increasing primary health and GP funding; committing to safe staffing; and making every home healthy. “As families who have lost loved ones to suicide, we know a bit about courage. We’ve had to ask ourselves difficult, uncomfortable questions,” they wrote. “We need you to have courage too. We need you to ask difficult questions about our mental health system. You’ll need the courage to put aside politics and do what is right for every Kiwi.” Cross-party support is now mounting for introducing suicide reduction strategies. Labour supports a reduction target and new leader Jacinda Ardern reminded thousands at her election campaign launch that every New Zealander knew someone affected by mental health problems or suicide. “Yesterday I asked a room full of young people if they did, and every single hand in that room was lifted into the air. Every single one,” she said. “While there is a lot of talk about targets, I know I will never be satisfied so long as there is even one life lost.” Labour says it will inject $8bn into health funding and review mental health services in its first 100 days if elected. While the governing National party has been accused of dragging its heels on supporting a suicide reduction goal, health minister Jonathan Coleman saying he is “seeking advice”. An expert panel was established to advise the ministry of health on ways to reduce the suicide rate. It recommended a reduction target as key to the ministry’s new suicide prevention strategy. Current government spending on mental health is not keeping up with demand, economists say. But outside the political sphere, New Zealanders are battling over how to tackle the issue. Some say children should not be exposed to talk of suicide, while others say it is precisely what needs to happen to tackle stubborn suicide rates. Mental health crusader and comedian Mike King speaks to schools across New Zealand about suicide rates. But recently he was prevented from going into three South Island schools, as part of a planned eight-school tour, on advice from the district health board suicide prevention co-ordinator, Annette Beautrais. Beautrais has repeatedly declined to comment to media, but reportedly told schools King’s talks were “dangerous” to children. King argues that viewpoint is “misinformed”. Samara Read, a 16-year-old who has lost three of her teenage friends to suicide, and has depression herself, believes the only way forward is to talk openly and to give young people something to hope for in the future. She called on prime minister Bill English to put himself in her place. “Can you walk in my shoes for a month and make another decision,” she urged English when she addressed a gathering of the shoe project. “We poison our livers getting drunk trying to find some healing, and go to our friends’ graves to cry.” This week, Suzy Taylor stood holding a pair of Georgia’s white sandals at a gathering on the lakefront in Rotorua. Those shoes were among 606 pairs of heels, boots, trainers and sandals laid out starkly in rows to represent the annual suicide toll. Her daughter Georgia first tried to take her life on mothers’ day in 2016. “The only emotion I saw on her face was that she meant to die,” Taylor says. Georgia had been diagnosed with depression three years earlier in Dunedin, in South Island, and had been prescribed antidepressants and treated by a counsellor. Taylor says her daughter had made progress and believes things had been looking brighter. But she says the country needs a wake-up call: that the way people in New Zealand are treated when they try to take their lives has not changed in the 22 years since her husband died from suicide. “This needs to be talked about. Our young people need to have something to look forward to.” The shoe project is supported by the YesWeCare health coalition and the Public Service Association, New Zealand’s health union. • Lifeline Aotearoa can be reached in New Zealand on 0508 828 865.

Now he faces deportation to Mexico","bodyText":"A decorated US Marine Corps veteran who a federal judge ruled was an American citizen is facing deportation to Mexico, in a case that has been criticized as a cruel and extraordinary application of immigration laws. The US government’s continuing effort to deport George Ybarra, who is currently locked up in an Arizona detention center, has shed light on the vulnerabilities of foreign-born Americans who have served in the military, along with the deportation threats that can plague even those who are deemed to be citizens and have deep ties to the country. Ybarra, who was honorably discharged after serving in the Persian Gulf war and earning numerous badges and medals, is facing deportation due to a criminal history that his family says is tied to mental health struggles and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from his service. While there have been growing concerns about the removal of veterans and the harsh policies of deporting people for minor crimes, Ybarra’s case is particularly troubling to immigrant rights’ advocates given a judge’s acknowledgment that he is US citizen. The government argued in a statement to the Guardian that Ybarra had not proven his citizenship. Luis Parra, Ybarra’s attorney, told the Guardian: “George hopes he will be able to stay in the country he fought for ... He is a third-generation [US] citizen … It would be a very extreme hardship for George to have to relocate to Mexico.” Ybarra, whose story was first reported in the Tucson Sentinel, has a complex immigration and citizenship battle dating back more than a decade, including deportation threats under Barack Obama’s administration. Ybarra, also known as Jorge Ibarra-Lopez, was born in Nogales in Mexico, just south of the Arizona border, in 1964, according to his court filings. He moved to the US months after he was born, and his maternal grandfather was a US citizen, born in Bisbee, Arizona, his lawyers wrote. Ybarra has long argued that he has “derivative citizenship”, meaning he is a citizen by virtue of his mother’s status. An immigration judge eventually agreed that there was “sufficient evidence” that the 52-year-old father of five should be considered a US citizen, but the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) challenged that decision in 2011 and has since continued to try to deport him, records show. The deportation proceedings stem in part from a number of criminal offenses, including drug-related charges. He was also convicted of firing two rounds through the front door of his home in Phoenix in 2011 in the direction of two police officers, according to the Sentinel. The news organization reported that no one was hurt and that Ybarra said he was suffering from a PTSD-induced episode of delusion at the time and believed federal authorities were coming to “take away” his family. Ybarra ultimately served a seven-year sentence in state prison for aggravated assault, but instead of returning to his family after he completed his time, he was transferred into the custody of federal immigration authorities last month. Ybarra and his family now fear he could soon be deported. Parra argued that Ybarra should be released while the dispute about his citizenship is resolved. US Citizenship and Immigration Services had previously denied his application for a certificate of citizenship, but there are numerous ways he can have his status formally recognized, according to Parra. His family has argued that he should get treatment and other government support as a disabled veteran with PTSD. “He basically has no family in Mexico,” said Parra, noting that Ybarra’s children and grandchildren and other relatives in Arizona are all US citizens. “He has a very supportive family living in the Phoenix area, including his mother, who depends on George.” Ybarra was distraught and worried about his continued detention, Parra said. In a Sentinel interview in July in an Arizona state prison, Ybarra said: “I’ve got a lot of anger, a lot of anxiety over this. They know I’m a citizen, they know I’m a combat veteran. I don’t see where they’ve ever shown that they care.” A spokeswoman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not initially respond to questions about Ybarra’s case, but after publication of this article on Friday, released a statement defending the government’s position and alleging Ybarra has not proven he is a citizen. Without acknowledging the judge’s ruling, the statement said: “No evidence has been provided to the courts or Ice to support the claim that he has acquired or derived US citizenship.” It added that Ybarra was an “aggravated felon”. An immigration judge will determine “whether he has any legal basis to remain in the United States”, the statement said. The spokeswoman added that Ice “has stringent protocols to protect against the possibility that a US citizen is not detained or removed”. A Northwestern University analysis of government data found that hundreds of US citizens have, in fact, been detained by immigration authorities. Margaret Stock, an immigration attorney and expert on military cases, said the deportation of veterans has been an ongoing challenge under both Obama and Donald Trump, but that she has never seen a case like Ybarra’s, in which the government has threatened to deport someone ruled a citizen by a judge. “If you can deport this guy, you can also try to deport all kinds of other people,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/02/on-the-road-with-hurricane-harvey-what-it-was-like-to-cover-the-storm","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"On the road with Hurricane Harvey: what it was like to cover the storm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/02/on-the-road-with-hurricane-harvey-what-it-was-like-to-cover-the-storm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/02/on-the-road-with-hurricane-harvey-what-it-was-like-to-cover-the-storm","fields":{"headline":"On the road with Hurricane Harvey: what it was like to cover the storm","bodyText":"The rain started about an hour south of Dallas, specks bouncing off the windshield. It thrummed heavier, eased, then hammered down in waves, a syncopated rhythm. By Buffalo it was sluicing, blotting out the moon, stars and landscape, everything except the blurry headlights ahead. Cars, then trucks, started pulling off the I-45. By Centerville roadside signs started flashing a mantra: “If you see flooding, turn around, don’t drown.” It was Sunday night and Hurricane Harvey was unleashing unimaginable quantities of water on Houston, America’s fourth-biggest city. The airports were shut so I was driving down from Dallas, almost marvelling at rain that seemed horizontal. After Madisonville the only other vehicles headed south were towing boats. With visibility negligible I halted at Conroe, 42 miles outside downtown Houston. It would take three days to finish the journey, an at-times surreal zig-zag through a waterworld of flooded highways and towns. For swaths of Texas and Louisiana, Harvey’s impact is just beginning. Dozens dead, thousands of homes damaged and destroyed, perhaps $100bn in damage. Recovery will take years. Travelling through the storm’s passage was uplifting – people showed remarkable resilience and generosity. And dismaying. Everywhere, peeking above the waters, was evidence of hyper-development that had devoured wetlands and prairies which used to serve as natural sponges. A century of lax regulation had pushed nature to the brink. Now nature was pushing back. “I was sitting on a stool with the water up to my ankles when this snake swam by me,” said Jennifer Shardlow, 35, huddled over coffee at an IHOP diner which became a refuge for displaced families in Conroe on Monday. “Alligators are coming up through the bayous,” said William Miles, seated a few tables away. His wife Erin noted the gloom. “We haven’t seen the sun in four days.” Back on the I-45 I got about 10 miles south and diverted to the Hardy toll road, which seemed higher and drier. I took a wrong turn, doubled back and tried to re-enter Hardy, only to encounter a foaming surge. Steve Perez, 60, a Houston police officer, drowned trying to get onto the toll road. Marooned in a community called Woodlands, everything was shut except Chinese restaurants and an Alcoholics Anonymous centre offering coffee and wifi. “Are you an alcoholic?” one man asked. He grinned. “You might be before this is over.” Spring Creek was overflowing, inundating a neighbourhood called High Oaks. Seven rescue vessels were in action, two from the fire department, the rest owned and operated by private individuals like John Brown, a 41-year-old metal worker with a battered fishing skiff. He plucked people and pets from their homes and delivered them to Sawdust Road, where other volunteers, knee-deep in water, led them to trucks. “I think it’s beautiful, everybody coming together to do this,” said Brown. On Tuesday I got as far as Cypress, a northern suburb of Houston, and encountered the Cajun navy: volunteers from Louisiana with canoes, skiffs, airboats and jet skis. Trump supporters, mostly, who had paid their own way to help one of America’s most diverse cities. “Put a gay or black person in need next to them and they’ll help. But in a voting booth they’ll turn around and cut their healthcare. It’ll just blow up your mind,” said a self-described liberal member of the navy. He requested anonymity. Television footage showed dramatic rooftop rescues but in the chaos many would-be rescuers drove around in vain seeking people to help. They got lost, stuck in traffic and struggled to launch their boats. Those who launched in Twin Lakes, a submerged estate with mock Tudor houses, encountered a different problem: residents did not want to leave. They were reluctant even to show themselves to the crews paddling past their windows. “We’re staying, thank you,” said one woman, clicking her door shut. Brad Johns, 39, tired and drenched after a 22-hour journey hauling and paddling his boat to get to this point, was stumped. “We’ve come all the way from Louisiana to help.” That night a motorist crashed into his truck, damaging the truck and boat, forcing a retreat to Louisiana. Here is another aspect television does not show: boredom. People hunkered in mercifully unscathed homes grew antsy with confinement. “Two kids bouncing off the walls – I had to get out,” said one volunteer in Cypress. Humanity gleamed in acts of generosity and courage – not least that of the mother who drowned while saving her three-year-old daughter. Less visible was humanity’s role in aggravating the storm: endless strip malls and suburban tract homes where once were swamps affording natural flood protection; an energy industry, headquartered in Houston, accelerating climate change. The sky cleared on Wednesday – Harvey moved east, towards Louisiana – and the waters began to recede around Houston. Driving the final stretch into downtown, sun glinted off a skyline whose towers proclaimed oil, money, construction. Downtown escaped relatively unscathed but you could see the storm’s human cost in the convention centre, which at one point sheltered 10,000 people. Some wandered outside, hauling bags and pillowcases stuffed with clothes and food. A shirtless Bob Marley fan strode among them shouting: “The rasta say everything’s gonna be all right.” It wasn’t all right. Inside the shelter, Eloy Martinez, 57, a plumber, picked from a mound of donated clothes. His home was gone, he was sick and he had no flood insurance. “It’s going to be real difficult to get established once again. It’s going to be a mess, that’s all I know.” An elderly Latino man at a desk for information about missing people gazed ahead, apparently not hearing questions, his eyes vacant. Officials warned of cholera and typhoid outbreaks. On Thursday explosions rocked a chemical plant and on Friday rescuers were still trying to reach people trapped in flooded suburbs and cities to the east. Where the high waters receded they revealed devastation: homes, streets, entire towns, silent and sodden. Harvey, a storm for the record books. Until the next one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/02/brawl-in-cell-block-99-review-vince-vaughn-venice-film-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T16:14:12Z","webTitle":"Brawl in Cell Block 99 review – Vince Vaughn has a riot in ultraviolent thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/02/brawl-in-cell-block-99-review-vince-vaughn-venice-film-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/02/brawl-in-cell-block-99-review-vince-vaughn-venice-film-festival","fields":{"headline":"Brawl in Cell Block 99 review – Vince Vaughn has a riot in ultraviolent thriller","bodyText":"Humanists and liberal types may blanch at the idea, but sometimes a man has to do manly things – maybe even throw a few punches – when the circumstances demand it. If some low-life scumbag is bothering your woman, for instance, or, God forbid, your kid. It might not be nice, it may not be pretty, but with the best will in the world it cannot be avoided. Even the most peaceable man can be pushed to his limit. Take Bradley Thomas (Vince Vaughn), the put-upon hero of S Craig Zahler’s uproarious Brawl in Cell Block 99. Chances are that we all know somebody like Bradley: he’s your average glowering inner-city drug dealer, with a regulation black T-shirt and a crucifix tattooed into the back of his scalp. The sort of chap who wouldn’t ordinarily say boo to a goose. Except Bradley’s facing a seven-year prison stretch, where his pacifist nature is proving a major inconvenience. “I’d rather knit baby booties out of pink yarn than hit someone who didn’t deserve it,” he explains early on. So it’s all the more surprising when he suddenly starts marauding up and down corridors, indiscriminately maiming every guard and inmate he sees. If anything, Brawl in Cell Block 99 undersells itself. I counted five full-on brawls in Block 99, plus a couple more nearby – pretty much all instigated by Bradley. That’s because a wicked drugs kingpin has taken his wife hostage and is threatening to abort his unborn daughter if he doesn’t perform a prison hit. So now Bradley has to devise a cunning plan to bust out of his medium-security jail and into maximum-security Red Leaf prison and from there into Block 99, “the prison within the prison” where the target is held. This plan, without giving too much away, involves inserting his thumbs into every available eye socket and generally grinding men’s faces until their features come loose. Sometimes the simplest plans are the most efficient. Having blooded his audience with 2015’s Bone Tomahawk, writer-director Zahler seems of a mind that nothing succeeds like excess. Here he rustles up a preposterous macho romp, a juicy slab of 21st-century grindhouse, swimming in gore, salted with pantomime villainy and recasting amiable Vince Vaughn – the doofus mainstay of Couples Retreat and Fred Claus – as a raging volcano of wanton destruction. And all credit to Vaughn: he copes well with the role, playing it mostly dead straight with just the faint whiff of mischief. I also liked Don Johnson as the dandyish prison warden, Bradley’s chief nemesis at Red Leaf. Johnson looks as though he’s having fun, drawing on a cigarillo and plotting all manner of cruel and unusual punishments – first ordering the convict to be locked in a rotting cell filled with excrement and then moving him to a rotting cell filled with broken glass. Conceivably there exists a third rotting cell, filled with dirty needles and angry bees, although we never get to see this one because, as Bradley draws closer to his quarry, every minute the film spends locked inside a rotting cell is a minute that might be better spent gouging out eyeballs and stamping on heads. And this, I suspect, is Zahler’s raison d’être. It’s no surprise to learn that Brawl in Cell Block 99 is playing “out of competition” at this year’s Venice film festival. That’s probably for the best. Zahler’s film is entertaining, incorrigible and borderline incoherent – it is the violent drunk at the party, liable to lash out. Imagine if they threw it in amid the gilded nominees. Imagine the horror if it then didn’t win. It would start overturning tables, body-slamming the judges, biting off noses. Far safer to keep it securely quarantined, away from polite society. Approach this one with caution. And whatever you do, don’t look at it funny. •Brawl in Cell Block 99 was showing at the Venice film festival and will open in cinemas in October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/31/houston-hurricane-storm-harvey-recovery-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T03:53:51Z","webTitle":"Receding waters reveal Harvey's devastation as death toll reaches 44","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/houston-hurricane-storm-harvey-recovery-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/houston-hurricane-storm-harvey-recovery-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Receding waters reveal Harvey's devastation as death toll reaches 44","bodyText":"Rescuers continued plucking people from floodwaters across Texas on Thursday even as waters receded from Houston, revealing swathes of devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey. Donald Trump pledged to donate $1m in personal funds to the relief effort. Emergency crews and volunteers in boats, trucks and aircraft scoured inundated suburbs around Houston and cities to the east for people still in need of evacuation. Police rescued 18 people from floodwaters overnight, said Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner. “Crisis ebbing but far from over.” In dryer areas recovery crews started to assess damage and remove debris. They braced for the discovery of bodies. Harvey, once a category 4 hurricane, was downgraded to a tropical depression and moved over north-eastern Louisiana and into Mississippi. Fires and two explosions early on Thursday at a chemical plant in Crosby, north-east of Houston, jolted residents to the presence of new dangers as waters recede. The plant, which makes organic peroxides used in plastic resins and paint, lost refrigeration due to the storm. An executive warned that eight more tanks could burn and explode. Contradictory messages from officials left people unsure if emissions were toxic. The Texas department of public safety said 48,700 homes sustained flood damage, including 17,000 with major damage and 1,000 that were destroyed. The storm has killed at least 44 people in Texas, officials said on Thursday, and forced 32,000 people into shelters since it came ashore last Friday near Rockport on the Gulf of Mexico coast. It was the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in half a century. Officials ordered mandatory evacuation of some communities near the Barker and Addicks reservoirs, which continued to discharge water. But much of Houston was dry and baked under a blazing sun. The heat aggravated the stench from stagnant waters and flood-damaged properties. “Man, oh-ooh, that is foul,” said a shirtless man on Discovery Green, a park beside a convention centre which is sheltering 8,000 people. The city’s health department urged residents to take precautions to minimise the risk of contamination and diseases such as cholera and typhoid. “Practice good hygiene such as hand washing after any contact with #Harvey floodwaters,” it tweeted. “Do not eat any food that came in contact with #Harvey floodwaters. When in doubt, throw it out.” Regular trash collection was due to resume on Thursday. Airports have resumed a limited service. Despite the havoc of recent days, Houston remained calm. “No city curfew citations or arrests for a second night in a row. Thank you Houston for your understanding and cooperation,” tweeted the mayor. Meanwhile, the White House announced on Thursday that Trump was pledging $1m in personal funds to the relief efforts. The press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called on the media to help decide which specific group or organisation he should give to. “He’d love some suggestions from the folks here and I’d be happy to take those if any of you have them,” she told reporters in the briefing room. “But as I said, he’ll pledge proudly a million dollars of his own personal money to help the people of both Texas and Louisiana.” She said she was uncertain whether the donation would come from the president directly or his private foundation, which has been a source of controversy. Trump and his wife, Melania, will travel back to Texas and to Louisiana on Saturday, Sanders added. The tentative plan includes the Houston area in Texas and possibly Lake Charles, Louisiana, but this may change depending on conditions. The president visited Corpus Christi and Austin on Tuesday. Tom Bossert, White House homeland security adviser, estimated that about 100,000 homes would be affected by the floods. “That’s a big number. We’re going to have 100,000 affected homes, all with different degrees of insurance, some with flood insurance, some under-insured, some uninsured.” The White House would soon send a supplemental spending request to Congress to help ease the recovery process, Bossert added, insisting that he was “not worried at all” about having sufficient funds for the current effort. “The disaster relief fund is strong, it’s got plenty of money in it now, and we’re going to ask for some very responsible surplus supplementals.” Bossert claimed that “coordination is happening better than any storm we’ve seen before” and noted that 28 search and rescue teams and taskforces from 16 states had been sent to Texas. “In fact, I believe that that’s the first time we’ve activated all the taskforces since 9/11, so this is an all-hands-on-deck operation.” The adviser said undocumented immigrants seeking government help should not be worried about their immigration status “unless they’ve committed a crime on top of coming here illegally”. No one would be denied help based on their legal status and shelters would not be subjected to inspections. Asked about explosions at the Arkema chemical plant near Crosby, he said the situation was not a public health hazard in the sense that people around the facility had already been evacuated. “If they were there, it would be dangerous and they have to keep an eye on it and take it seriously, but for right now the people don’t seem to be there, so a tree falling in the woods, if you will.” But further deaths in Texas are likely in the coming days, Bossert warned. “In the immediate response and recovery phase, people will use chainsaws, people will remove debris, people will be stressed ... so unfortunately, we will see additional losses of life, if history is any precedent here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/03/adan-queensland-dispute-mine-royalties","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T22:30:34Z","webTitle":"Details of royalty deal for mega mine are still being negotiated with Adani, says Queensland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/03/adan-queensland-dispute-mine-royalties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/03/adan-queensland-dispute-mine-royalties","fields":{"headline":"Details of royalty deal for mega mine are still being negotiated with Adani, says Queensland","bodyText":"Queensland’s government says it is still negotiating with Adani over the details of its royalties agreement for its $16.5bn Carmichael mine, despite the deal being officially agreed months ago. Adani announced in May it had reached agreement with the government over royalty payments, after a more generous offer of concessions was scrapped amid internal pressure from within the state Labor cabinet and caucus. But the department of state development last month blocked the release of documents relating to the deal, saying its deliberations on Adani’s royalty payments were ongoing and that “premature disclosure could negatively impact negotiations between the state and Adani”. Asked whether negotiations were ongoing, a Palaszcuk government spokesman said the royalty negotiations for the Carmichael coal were “in accordance with a resource policy framework announced in May”. This framework included that all royalties due to the state on new mines, if deferred, would be repaid with interest over the life of an agreement, the spokesman said. An Adani spokesman said there were “no ongoing negotiations” over the royalties agreement reached on 30 May. Two weeks ago the department of state development gave advice to the Australia Institute, which sought documents on the deal under right to information (RTI) laws. The department refused to release 218 pages of documents, citing reasons including the release of information that would “prejudice the economy of the state”. Its decision notice said the information was recorded to help the government in “deliberating on, and evaluating matters relating to the royalties to be paid by Adani for coal extracted and sold from the proposed Carmichael coal mine (or by any company from the first mine to be built or to extract coal from the Galilee Basin)”. “As these deliberations are ongoing, the information remains relevant to current government considerations and premature disclosure could negatively impact negotiations between the state and Adani as well as the broader decision-making and consultation process,” the decision said. Australia Institute researcher Tom Swann said the department’s RTI officer later confirmed “this was true both when we applied [mid-May] and on the date of their RTI decision [17 August]”. Swann said the new information from the RTI process threw into doubt “whether that deal was ever accepted, or whether it was a final deal”. “The Palaszczuk government insists it will not subsidise Adani, and that Adani will pay its royalties in full,” he said. “Given this it is unclear what is left to negotiate, unless the government is planning to offer further support.” A state treasury document obtained by the Australia Institute under a previous RTI request showed public servants expressing concerns about being asked to produce evidence of the economic benefits of the royalties deal after it was offered. The documents also showed that Adani agreed to a treasury proposal on the same day the company announced the new royalties pact. The Adani spokesman said the company “reached agreement with the Queensland government following a special cabinet meeting that approved a new royalties regime for the Galilee Basin and, indeed, other new mineral provinces”. “Adani had previously announced it was putting the project on hold until a royalties agreement could be reached,” he said. “It is also noteworthy that Adani announced the ‘green light’ for the project on Queensland Day [6 June]. There are no ongoing negotiations on this matter.” Government sources have previously told Guardian Australia that Adani would be expected to pay at least $5m in royalties in the Carmichael mine’s first year of production, a discount that fell each year until full royalties were due in five years’ time. This fell short of an original reported offer to Adani of a “royalties holiday” that would have cost the state up to $320m in revenue, with the company to pay just $2m in the first year. That offer triggered internal uproar in Labor, with some regional MPs citing their constituents’ support for the mine and its jobs but also for Adani, as a transnational corporation, to pay its way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/31/obamas-ex-drug-czar-call-to-ban-high-grade-opioids-at-center-of-epidemic","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T20:46:59Z","webTitle":"Obama’s former drug czar calls to ban high-grade opioids at center of epidemic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/obamas-ex-drug-czar-call-to-ban-high-grade-opioids-at-center-of-epidemic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/obamas-ex-drug-czar-call-to-ban-high-grade-opioids-at-center-of-epidemic","fields":{"headline":"Obama’s former drug czar calls to ban high-grade opioids at center of epidemic","bodyText":"Barack Obama’s former drug czar, Michael Botticelli, has backed a ban on the high-strength opioid painkillers at the heart of the US overdose epidemic now claiming about 50,000 lives a year. Botticelli supported a petition to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by families of opioid victims, doctors and health organisations seeking the removal of the powerful painkillers from pharmacy shelves. Activists see the “citizen petition”, which legally requires a response – Congress passed legislation in 2007 that requires the FDA to rule on citizen petitions within 180 days – as a test. It will show whether the FDA is finally turning away from policies that critics contend have contributed to the epidemic by putting the financial interests of pharmaceutical companies ahead of public health. Among the signatories was Dr Andrew Kolodny, co-founder of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, who said that high-dose opioids not only significantly increased the likelihood of addiction but endangered lives when taken accidentally. He said that 11 million Americans had misused an opioid pill in 2015, and many of them were borrowing pills to deal with aches and pains without knowing how strong they were. “Borrowing that one pill can lead to a fatal overdose,” he said. “These are not medicines. These are lethal weapons that should be removed from the market.” The petition says that a person taking high-strength opioids is twice as likely to develop an addiction as a person taking the low-strength version. Botticelli supported the call for their removal from the market but said that it should be matched by an effort to reduce the number of opioid prescriptions. Although the numbers have been falling since the epidemic drew political attention, doctors still wrote 240m prescriptions for opioids last year – roughly equivalent to one for every American adult. “We clearly know that high dosage increases the probability of addiction. Where we have products that are dangerous, it’s important to call for their removal. It is equally as important as doctor prescribing behaviours,” said Botticelli. The petition is part of a day of events in Washington and across the US led by an activist group, Fed Up!, to raise awareness of the opioid epidemic and to demand policy changes. Bereaved families rallied at the White House to demand the Trump administration take action to curb the distribution of opioids and fund treatment for those addicted. Victoria Allendorf, who lost both sons on the same day to an opioid overdose, spoke of the helplessness of watching a child struggle with addiction and then slowly dying. Among the drugs the activists want withdrawn are higher strength versions of OxyContin. Its launch 20 years ago with a marketing campaign claiming that it was neither addictive nor dangerous kickstarted the opioid epidemic, which swept out of Appalachia and across the country. Both claims were false and the manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to settle legal actions. Three of its executives were also convicted of crimes over the false claims. Judy Rummler, the chair of Fed Up!, signed the petition on behalf of her organisation. Rummler’s son, Steve, died of an opioid overdose in 2011. Fed Up! has been a strong critic of the FDA, saying that it is compromised by financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry and has bowed to political pressure from a powerful lobby to approve dangerous drugs. But Rummler said there were signs the FDA’s policy is shifting. In June, the FDA called for the removal of a high-strength opioid, Opana, from pharmacy shelves as a public health hazard just a decade after it was approved for sale in controversial circumstances. Opana was rejected in 2003 as unsafe but approved three years later after the rules of the process were rewritten amid accusations that pharmaceutical companies had undue influence over the process. The manufacturer withdrew the drug after the FDA call. The new FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, implicitly acknowledged criticisms of his agency when he endorsed a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in July that recommended that approval take into account “the public health effects of the inappropriate use of these drugs”. “We’ve already begun to put this policy to work. Last month, the agency requested the removal of an opioid product from the market based on concern that the product’s risks associated with its deliberate misuse outweigh its intended benefits when it was used as directed and lead to dangerous unintended consequences,” he said. On Tuesday, Gottlieb phoned Emily Walden, who has been among the strongest critics of the FDA for its approval of Opana after her son died of an overdose of the drug. Walden declined to discuss the details of the conversation but said she was impressed. “He has given me hope for sure,” she said. “I feel like for the first time in a long time we have an FDA commissioner who is willing to correct some of the mistakes. It seems like he understands this issue.” Botticelli said he thought the FDA was finally changing course. “It does seem there’s been a significant shift around FDA’s framework on opioids,” he said. Kolodny called for the federal government to commit $60bn over the next 10 years to provide treatment to people addicted to opioids to bring down the rising death toll. Botticelli was not confident it would happen. He criticised Donald Trump for his failure to follow through on a call by his own opioid commission to declare a national emergency. He said that the president could not say he takes the crisis seriously while at the same time proposing deep cuts to the healthcare funding that provides treatment for people who are addicted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/01/morning-mail-jacinda-ardern-leads-labour-to-nz-poll-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T21:09:12Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Jacinda Ardern lifts Labour to NZ poll lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/01/morning-mail-jacinda-ardern-leads-labour-to-nz-poll-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/01/morning-mail-jacinda-ardern-leads-labour-to-nz-poll-lead","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Jacinda Ardern lifts Labour to NZ poll lead","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Graham Russell bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 1 September. Top stories The New Zealand Labour party has continued its extraordinary surge under the month-old leadership of Jacinda Ardern, with a new poll putting its support at a 10-year high, and for the first time in front of the governing National party in the run-up to this month’s general election. Labour’s projected share of the vote has risen from 26% to 43% since Ardern, 37, became the party’s youngest leader. Ardern and the prime minister, Bill English, met in a leaders’ debate on Thursday in which English was asked in the opening question: “Bill, why are you losing?” Political pundits were divided on who won the debate, but the political editor of the New Zealand Herald, Audrey Young, said Ardern’s fluent style had put the prime minister under presssure. “It was Bill English but not as we know him. He sounded as though he has been in a debating bootcamp for the past week, learning about gesticulation, intonation, brevity and how good it is to smile.” Liberals in Western Australia have tabled a motion to force the prime minister to look again at repealing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, but one of their senior colleagues has poured cold water on the whole idea. WA Liberal MP Ian Goodenough, who chaired the joint parliamentary committee that developed options to reform the Australian Human Rights Commission’s complaints handling procedures for 18C cases, says though it is an “ideological goal” of conservatives in the party, those pushing for urgent reform should wait until the recommendations work their way through the system. motion will be debated and voted on in the presence of Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop this weekend. Scott Morrison has surprisingly held up the heavily unionised construction industry as a model for pay rises following growth in profits. During an interview on the ABC’s 7.30 program last night, Morrison dropped his party’s previous demonisation of the CFMEU and mentioned construction and IT security as two sectors where profit growth had generated wage rises. He said he expected that pattern to be replicated now the economy was turning around. Before the election Malcolm Turnbull promised the Coalition would stop excessive pay demands from the construction union because the revived Australian Building and Construction Commission would prevent industrial coercion. The US has ordered Russia to close diplomatic offices in San Francisco, New York and Washington by Saturday in the latest round of punitive measures between the two countries. The state department said it had cuts its mission in Russia from 1,200 to 455 as requested and had then ordered Thursday night’s reprisal “in the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians”. Experts predict the mutual expulsions won’t stop there. Meanwhile, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has published drone footage showing what he claims is Vladimir Putin’s secret holiday mansion on the Finnish border. In London, play was dramatically suspended in the cricket county championship match between Surrey and Middlesex at the Oval, when a crossbow bolt was fired onto the field from outside the ground. No one was hurt, but the bolt landed within metres of players and “could very easily have killed someone”, Surrey’s chief executive, Richard Gould, said. Sport Australia’s hopes of automatically qualifying for next year’s World Cup in Russia are hanging in the balance after a sobering 2-0 defeat to Japan in Saitama last night, which highlighted the selection challenges facing coach Ange Postecoglou. Now the Socceroos need to beat Thailand in Tuesday night’s final group game, and even that may not be enough if Saudi Arabia also win against Japan.

But the investigations into possible ties between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign continue, with a number of potentially significant developments emerging in the past few days. Here’s a look at what happened. Pressure on Manafort The team of prosecutors working under the special counsel Robert Mueller is cooperating with New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, to investigate the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his business dealings, Politico reported. Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to sway the election in his favor. Schneiderman’s presence – as a state attorney general – is potentially significant because the president’s power to issue a pardon applies only to federal crimes, not state convictions (hypothetical, in this case). Cooperation by Manafort with investigators could be damaging to Trump. Manafort and Trump have denied any wrongdoing. Schneiderman is something of a nemesis to Trump, who has accused the attorney general of carrying out a political vendetta against him. Schneiderman brought a class-action fraud lawsuit against Trump University in 2013, which was resolved in a $25m settlement 10 days after the election. Trump sought Moscow tower deal Early in the presidential campaign, Trump signed a non-binding letter of intent to build a tower in Moscow, his lawyer, Michael Cohen, confirmed in a statement to ABC News. This despite Trump’s claiming during the campaign that he “knows nothing about Russia”, has “no loans” and “no deals” there. In the absence of his tax returns, which the president refuses to publish, the truth of Trump’s holdings is unknown. Cohen said: “The Trump Moscow proposal was simply one of many development opportunities that the Trump Organization considered and ultimately rejected.” It separately emerged, however, that Cohen had written an email asking for help with the deal to a top Vladimir Putin aide in January 2016, in a previously undisclosed example of direct contact between the Trump Organization (Cohen was vice-president at the time) and Moscow during the US presidential campaign. “Over the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City,” the Washington Post quoted the email as saying. “Without getting into lengthy specifics, the communication between our two sides has stalled.” No tower was ever built. Trump associate’s email: ‘I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected’ A former broker for the Trump organization, Felix Sater, who also helped to develop Trump’s SoHo hotel tower in Manhattan, wrote an email to Cohen related to the same Moscow tower deal on 3 November 2015, obtained by the New York Times, that read in part: Michael I arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putin’s private chair at his desk and office in the Kremlin. I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected. We both know no one else knows how to pull this off without stupidity or greed getting in the way. I know how to play it and we will get this done. Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process. In a statement, Cohen said that Sater, whom he has known since their teenage years in Brooklyn and Long Island, was practicing salesmanship and exaggerating what he could do. Trump has denied familiarity with Sater, saying in a 2013 court deposition: “If he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn’t know what he looked like.” The two are pictured together below, in 2007. Separately, Ivanka Trump said she could not recall sitting in Putin’s chair. At the time the email was sent, there had been four Republican primary debates and the former and current governors Rick Perry and Scott Walker had already dropped out of the race. The overarching allegation that investigators are exploring is that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to tip the election, which could violate campaign finance laws and carry other charges. It is not clear that Sater’s email indicates collusion. Sater has not said whether he is talking to Mueller. Read a Guardian interview with Felix Sater. Cohen denies collusion In a letter to Congress, Cohen rebutted point-by-point allegations in a dossier assembled by a former British intelligence agent that he had participated in collusion between Moscow and the Trump presidential campaign. In the letter, Cohen repeatedly denies having made a trip to Prague, Czech Republic, to meet with Kremlin emissaries, a denial the letter says can be proven by Cohen’s passport. The Daily Beast obtained a copy of the letter. Grand jury interviews Trump Tower meeting figure A grand jury used by Mueller has taken secret testimony from Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American lobbyist who attended a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr, the Associated Press reported. Manafort and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner also attended the meeting. Trump Jr took the meeting on the promise of damaging information about Hillary Clinton provided by Russian agents. Investigators are trying to figure out what information, if any, changed hands at the meeting, which was followed soon after by the release of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The Trump campaign denies any collusion with Russian agents. Trump contacts judiciary chairman after news that son will meet committee Trump called senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the judiciary committee, a day after reports that Donald Trump Jr would meet with the committee behind closed doors to talk about Russia. In the call, Trump promised Grassley critical federal support for the biofuel ethanol, a key issue for the lawmaker, reported the Guardian. A spokesman for Grassley said by email: “The president called Senator Grassley and talked briefly about ethanol. It was a two-minute conversation. Senator Grassley told the president he was glad to hear him voice his support for ethanol and that he would tweet about it to the people of Iowa. Nothing more specific about ethanol policies came up. The other topics that came up were Hurricane Harvey and Ambassador Branstad in China.” Terry Branstad, a former governor of Iowa, is Trump’s new ambassador to China. Trump lawyers met Mueller team to deny obstruction of justice Lawyers for the president have met multiple times with the special counsel and delivered memos defending their client, the Wall Street Journal reported. One memo reportedly argues that Trump did not obstruct justice when he fired FBI director James Comey because he has an inherent power under the constitution to hire and fire at will. A second memo was described by the Journal’s sources as arguing that Comey is not a reliable witness to the special counsel investigation, “calling him prone to exaggeration, unreliable in congressional testimony and the source of leaks to the news media”. The meetings seem to indicate that the Mueller investigation is focused on the president’s conduct and is specifically considering obstruction of justice allegations, a charge that figured largely in impeachment proceedings against both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. The perceived integrity of Comey’s testimony is important because the nature of his private conversations with Trump could constitute key evidence for prosecutors building an argument about Trump’s motives. More to come … Sater predicted in an email to the Guardian: “[T]here are many additional stories that will be coming out about me in the future, much more timely and important than 20-year-old stock cases.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/31/dfid-200m-aid-nigeria-boko-haram","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T18:06:01Z","webTitle":"DfID defends £200m aid budget for Nigeria over next four years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/dfid-200m-aid-nigeria-boko-haram","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/31/dfid-200m-aid-nigeria-boko-haram","fields":{"headline":"DfID defends £200m aid budget for Nigeria over next four years","bodyText":"The Department for International Development has defended its aid budget for Nigeria, which is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and security crisis caused by attacks led by the terrorist group Boko Haram. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Priti Patel, the development secretary, jointly announced £200m in aid over the next four years, during a visit to the country on Wednesday. The projected average annual funding of £50m in that time period falls short of the £100m pledged to Nigeria for 2017. But DfID played down the suggestion that the new pledge amounted to a halving of the annual budget, claiming the additional funding was part of a £300m five-year package. A DfID spokeswoman said: “The first year started with a higher amount and now we’ve allocated more money for years two to five. There is also the option to top-up if necessary. We don’t want to over-allocate in case it’s not needed because the idea is we are going to restore the area – so less aid is required.” Johnson and Patel visited north-east Nigeria on Wednesday to see some of the areas worst hit by the disruption and violence caused by Boko Haram, the Islamist terrorist group. As many as 1.9 million people have been internally displaced due to Boko Haram activity, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Food is the single greatest unmet need for the displaced people, the IOM has said. Challenged about whether she felt comfortable with an aid cut, Patel replied that she did not see it as a cut because she had just announced more money for Nigeria. “My job isn’t just to give aid and money … but also to get others to contribute as well,” she said. Against a backdrop of calls for the Nigerian government to take ownership of the crisis, DfID admitted the forthcoming funding was being scaled back, but said this did not amount to halving the budget. “We massively stepped up funding in response to the crisis in 2016 and 2017 and rather than keep giving the same amount we are letting it reduce because we expect the need to become less acute,” the spokeswoman said. “This year the money will be higher than subsequent years.” The department said it was not yet able to provide a breakdown for 2018. Patel and Johnson met the Nigerian vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, on Thursday to discuss security, trade, British investment and the fight against corruption. Nigeria is widely recognised as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, hampering UK investment. Johnson described Nigeria as an “incredible country and powerhouse of the African economy”. The foreign secretary also formally opened what he described as “this wonderful, new, super, colossal British high commission” in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. Patel announced an extra £7m to combat sexual exploitation and modern slavery in Nigeria. Approximately 80% of the girls arriving to Europe from Nigeria are potential victims of trafficking for exploitation, the UK government says. The numbers have risen from 1,454 in 2014 to 11,099 in 2016. British officials have been advising Nigerian authorities on how to challenge human trafficking, particularly among poor families, with Nigerian officials now working alongside UK counterparts at Gatwick and Heathrow to profile traffickers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/01/slave-block-fredericksburg-virginia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T10:00:41Z","webTitle":"The 'slave block' in a town in Virginia: should it stay or should it go?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/01/slave-block-fredericksburg-virginia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/01/slave-block-fredericksburg-virginia","fields":{"headline":"The 'slave block' in a town in Virginia: should it stay or should it go?","bodyText":"Walking along the idyllic brick sidewalks of downtown Fredericksburg, Virginia, locals and tourists who pass the Olde Towne Butcher on the corner of William St and Charles St might notice a grayish-brown stone protruding from the sidewalk that is about the size and shape of an overturned bucket. A bronze marker at its base reveals that this stone was formerly used to auction off slaves. Locals and city officials refer to it colloquially as “the slave block” or “the auction block”. Most peoples’ reaction upon learning of the block’s past is horror. Now, especially in the wake of the recent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, the community is trying to decide what to do with it. A common reaction is to throw this rock in the same mental heap of memorials and flags that honor the Confederate south and many are rushing to have it removed. Last week, an online petition was created to demand its removal. The petition currently has more than 2,500 signatures from across the country. But for now, the block is not budging. Is Fredericksburg a town full of insensitive racists? Not quite. There are many deeply concerned residents in the town who feel that the slave block is categorically different from the monuments and statues that depict Confederate generals as heroes. “In this discussion, we are talking about what is the history,” explains the Fredericksburg mayor, Mary Katherine Greenlaw. “We are not talking about a memorial or something that is after the fact or a glorification. This is the history. That is the spot. This is the significant distinction.” The slave block is not a manmade creation to honor history; it is history. There is no question over the interpretation of the block – it is a living symbol of hate, oppression, and the agony of black families that were physically, mentally, and spiritually brutalized by their white hypocrite oppressors for generations. The question is what to do with all of this. Those who maintain that the block should stay where it is assert that rather than serving as a blow to racists, removing the block will give them the privilege of forgetting history – a privilege that they do not deserve. “The point that a lot of people make when they look at [the block] is that it makes them feel uncomfortable – frankly, that is not necessarily a bad thing,” says the city councilman and civil war re-enactor Matt Kelly. “We feel uncomfortable because it represents something that we never want to see again. Hopefully it reinforces in us the sense that we all have a role in making sure that it never happens again.” And this is not the first time the block was proposed for removal because it made people feel uncomfortable. In 1924, the local Daily Star reported that the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce came before the Fredericksburg city council to petition for the block’s removal, claiming that the block had never been used to auction slaves and that it made the town look bad. “The communication states that the rock was not a slave block,” the Daily Star wrote, “but was used years ago as a base for ladies to mount horses, and by its display to tourists as a place of selling slaves, it may serve somewhat to keep alive the sectional feeling which has long since disappeared.” Several days after the article and the petition to city council, the Confederate veteran John Tackett Goolrick weighed in with his support. In an article in the Daily Star titled The So-Called Slave Block, he asserted that the notion that the block was once used to sell slaves was “flagrantly false”. “For many reasons,” he wrote, “It should be broken up and carried away.” It may be true that the initial purpose of the block was for mounting horses –the building that the stone sits in front of used to be a hotel. Soon after Goolrick’s article, however, the local auctioneer NB Kinsey brought in an old newspaper advertisement to the Daily Star offices that clearly advertised the street corner of the auction block as the location for the sale of seven slaves. From there, the discussion went silent. Today, it is known that at least 12 slaves were sold from this location. The year 1924 was not a time of racial tolerance in the American south. It was the year Virginia passed the Racial Integrity Act, a flagrantly racist piece of legislation that set in place the “one drop rule”, which established that if individuals had “one drop” of black blood, they would be treated as black and legally subject to segregation. Legislation such as this and the models for segregation in the south were seen as models for the Third Reich’s own forms of white supremacy in Nazi Germany. It is not unreasonable to think that willful ignorance was at play when the Chamber of Commerce and Goolrick denied the block’s full history and petitioned for the its removal. Despite the differences between the petitions of 1924 and today, the fact is both groups want it removed for the same reason: they don’t want to be reminded of it any more. “Both extremes would love for this whole discussion to go away,” says Kelly. “The hardcore southerners don’t want to be reminded of slavery, and they will tell you to your face nine times out of 10 that slavery was not the cause of the [civil] war and that it was economics. You needed the slaves to make your economy work. And then the other side says: we want to obliterate anything remembering or acknowledging that slavery every happened. If we take the slave block out, both extremes win.” Indeed, we do not preserve the Auschwitz concentration camp and maintain the Holocaust Memorial museum as places for white supremacists to venerate their atrocities, but rather so that the perpetrators of these atrocities and their descendants can feel the pain of the agony that they inflicted upon others, so that we can remember those who suffered, and so that the rest of society can safeguard itself from following in the footsteps of extremists. Many who are most affected by the history of the block, however, are simply tired of looking at it. Earlier this month, more than 150 people gathered for a prayer vigil around the block, many of whom feel that the pain it causes to African Americans is egregious. The former Fredericksburg city council member the Rev Hashmel Turner is one of them. “I personally don’t need something like that to remind me of what my ancestors had endured,” says Turner. “If you want healing, why would you continue to leave obstacles in place that remind you of the suffering?” he asks. “You can’t heal if you always have the reminder. “ Opinions about the block are not clearly divided along racial lines, however. There are white people and black people on either side. “I don’t come down on one particular side because I see both sides,” says Jervis Hairston, who leads walking tours of African American history through downtown Fredericksburg. “When I see tears of anguish and weeping at that corner by that stone, I don’t know for certain all the time that the person who is experiencing those feelings is of the opinion that [the block] shouldn’t be there,” Hairston says. “I actually sometimes think that they appreciate the fact that it is there so that they can perhaps better understand what may have happened to their grandparents or great grandparents.” Although there is a tendency for outsiders to weigh in, Fredericksburg residents and city officials on both sides are firm in their position that this is a local issue. “As a representative of the City of Fredericksburg, I will not allow outsiders to come in to dictate how we handle business,” says the city councilman Chuck Frye Jr, who reopened the discussion in city council for the block’s removal. “I’m not going to have people come in and make a mockery of my city.” Nobody wants to see another Charlottesville, where extremists who have no connection with the local area are helicoptered in from all over the country to attack and disrespect the local community. In the end, a middle ground – either putting the block in a museum, or increasing the signage around the block to provide more context – might prove to be the most favorable option. One thing is clear, however: quickly nuking all traces of controversial history without engaging in community dialogue and considering the consequences is a path of passion rather than logic and can often yield results opposite to those originally intended.

Councillors in Scotland’s third largest city will get advice from three experts on the state of the regional economy, and will help the panel with the annual assessment of a credit rating agency Moody’s. Aberdeen is one of a handful of councils to raise money by selling bonds, raising £370m in November 2016 to help finance a £1bn capital spending programme. Stephen Boyle, RBS’s chief economist, Hanan Morsy, an economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Douglas Peedle, chief economic adviser to Jersey, will sit on the panel of experts. They will be paid as much as £17,000 a year for working one day a month, for a term of up to three years. The move comes amid the increasing financialisation of local authorities. Whitehall cuts are pushing councils to either scrap services or borrow to invest in profit-making schemes. Although devolution means Scottish councils are funded differently to the rest of the UK, Holyrood has also come under criticism for squeezing local authorities. As well as using the bond markets, authorities are taking out cheap loans from the Public Works Loan Board, a Treasury agency, as they plough money into property developments and other investments. Councils spent at least £1bn on property investments last year. The London borough of Newham has invested in a Welsh solar farm, and Warrington borough council spent £30m buying shares in a bank based in Hertfordshire. The trend raises questions over the qualifications of local officials to spend public money on speculative deals, and they could also be entering into relationships in the City of London with savvier partners with potentially differing interests. In the late 1980s, Hammersmith and Fulham council west London, bet on derivatives in a scandal that led to authorities being banned from such activities. Many councils’ pension funds have paid advisers, but Aberdeen is believed to be among the first to hire a standing panel of economists. Local authorities typically rely on external advice from accountancy and law firms when making investment decisions. Aberdeen might benefit from expert economic advice owing to its reliance on the oil industry, which makes the city vulnerable to movements in the value of crude. A crash in prices in 2014 – from more than $100 (£78) a barrel when the Scottish independence referendum was held in 2014 to as low as $27 last year – led local unemployment rates to rise by a quarter. The city’s move into the bond market does, however, raise the risk that speculators could bet against the council should oil prices wobble again. Moody’s also links its view of Aberdeen to the UK’s creditworthiness as a whole, which could change should the Scottish government look to hold another independence vote. Moody’s rates just five councils: Aberdeen, Warrington, Cornwall, Guildford and Lancashire. Joel Benjamin, a campaigner on council finances, said he believed a local authority could go bankrupt within the next decade. “That’s going to prompt a pretty quick reappraisal of risk by local authorities,” he added. Aberdeen makes a significant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies, with a “gross value added” contribution of more than £18bn and GVA per head of £36,726, which is 55% higher than the Scottish average. The council co-leader, Douglas Lumsden, said: “To have such a knowledgeable and experienced group in place is of great benefit, not only to Aberdeen city council but to the region as a whole.” The experts will also share their reports with the Scottish government’s own panel of economic advisers, which includes the Nobel prize-winning economists James Mirrlees and Joseph Stiglitz."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/01/soul-of-nation-turkish-tulips-best-uk-exhibitions","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T08:30:39Z","webTitle":"Soul of a Nation and Turkish Tulips: this week’s best UK exhibitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/01/soul-of-nation-turkish-tulips-best-uk-exhibitions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/01/soul-of-nation-turkish-tulips-best-uk-exhibitions","fields":{"headline":"Soul of a Nation and Turkish Tulips: this week’s best UK exhibitions","bodyText":"1 Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power Superb art and revolutionary politics fill this epic show.

Five decrees have been issued, containing what ministers said were “concrete and major measures” to overhaul and simplify the weighty Code du Travail, which covers every aspect of working life in France. In an interview before the measures were unveiled on Thursday morning, the French president said the country was “turning the page on three decades of inefficiency”. French unions gave a mixed but mostly negative response to the changes, which will reduce their influence at company level, make it easier for firms to hire and fire, and will end the jobs-for-life culture that French ministers say is a brake on economic growth. Decrees are a rarely used constitutional device that enable the government to effect the changes without a parliamentary debate or vote. The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, described the reforms as “ambitious, balanced and fair” and said they were aimed at dealing with “mass unemployment and repairing the country”. He said they gave France a chance to catch up on many “lost years”. Philippe said Macron and his centrist government had been given a clear mandate by voters in France’s presidential and legislative elections to reform the Code du Travail. The government nevertheless engaged in a three-month consultative process with business leaders, the unions and workers’ representatives. “Despite the urgency of the situation we have listened to and respected and discussed [the changes] with the unions and employers’ organisations” Philippe said on Thursday. Philippe and the employment minister, Muriel Pènicaud, outlined the four main pillars of the decrees, which they said were the result of hundreds of hours of talks resulting in 200 pages of measures aimed at adapting the code to “a changing world”. The priority was to ease constraints on small and medium-sized companies, which employ half of the French workforce, by granting them more flexibility to hire and fire, Philippe and Pènicaud said. In future, firms with fewer than 20 staff will be able to negotiate directly with employees on working terms and conditions, bypassing the national union branch. A cap has been imposed on industrial tribunal payments and the time limit for complaints reduced from two years to one. Laurent Berger, head of the CFDT union, said his members were concerned about the removal of the union’s influence, particularly in small and medium-sized firms. Union leaders fear the measures leave workers vulnerable to pressure and bullying by bosses. “We are disappointed and we have made that disappointment known to the prime minister … Our one aim is to improve the situation of workers … a company is not a proprietorial but a collective entity in which the voice of the worker must be heard,” Berger said after being given details of the decrees. The CFDT has called for a 10,000-strong workers’ rally on 3 October at a Paris convention centre, but said it would not be taking part in a day of action called by rival union, the more militant CGT, on 12 September. “We will not be in the streets on 12 September, we will find our own way of being heard,” Berger said. Jean-Claude Mailly, head of the more hardline union Force Ouvrière (Workers’ Force), sounded a conciliatory note on the work law changes. “We have three columns: things we have advanced on, things we have avoided and things we disagree on. The devil is in the detail. There are negotiations to be had and we haven’t finished talking,” he said. At a news conference, Philippe said the five decrees had to be seen as a whole and not “individual measures that might be considered curious when examined alone”. In an interview published on Thursday, Macron lamented that France’s unemployment rate of around 9.5% was almost double that of its major European rivals. “We are the only major economy in the European Union that has not defeated mass unemployment for more than three decades,” he told Le Point magazine. He said the overhaul of the Code du Travail was “a reform of profound change”. “The principal victims of our impotence of the past 30 years faced with mass unemployment are the young and the less qualified,” he added. Macron said people should not become fixated on the texts and reforms themselves as these were a means to an end: the “liberation of France’s energy”. The changes, he said, would end the constricting of France “squeezed by rules and rights … which believes itself to be a country of liberty”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/16/wallace-sewell-textiles-team-design-crossrail","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"Meet the textiles team designing for Crossrail and the tube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/16/wallace-sewell-textiles-team-design-crossrail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/16/wallace-sewell-textiles-team-design-crossrail","fields":{"headline":"Meet the textiles team designing for Crossrail and the tube","bodyText":"If you happen to be travelling in London soon, take the Bakerloo, Northern or Jubilee tube lines and try to spot the four landmarks embedded in the fabric pattern on the seats. Peer hard enough and you’ll see subtle renditions of the London Eye, Big Ben and Tower Bridge. These are just some of the many moquettes created for Transport for London by textiles duo Harriet Wallace-Jones and Emma Sewell, who have been designing together as Wallace Sewell for the past 25 years. They have also created fabrics for the Overground, Croydon tram and the new Crossrail. “For the first few Crossrail trains, which are running now, we rode the line and took lots of pictures of buildings and stations,” says Sewell. “There was a shed on the side of the track that was a beautiful grey-green colour, and that ended up as part of the design.” She still feels proud whenever she catches the tube to their north London studio. Since teaming up in 1992, the pair have designed cushions, rugs and throws for the Tate, West Elm and Anthropologie, among others. They have even recreated Jimi Hendrix’s bedspread for his former London house (now a museum). What unites their work is a love of colour. “We’re very choosy about it,” says Wallace-Jones. “Every year we have an artist whose work we refer to at the start of a new collection.” David Hockney has inspired their spring/summer 2018 scarves; other recent influences include Robert Diebenkorn and Korean artist Chung Eun Mo. They met while studying textiles at Central School of Art (now Central Saint Martins), but only really became friends during their MA in woven textiles at the Royal College of Art. “There were 15 people in our year, so we became quite a close group. We still have meet-ups,” says Sewell. Then, in 1992, they set up a stand together at the Chelsea Crafts Fair, making their own scarves but trading under the Wallace Sewell name. “An accessories buyer from Barneys in New York came to scout the show and put in an order for scarves. She came back six months later and asked what we were doing for the next season,” says Sewell. “Our accountant said, ‘Why don’t you just become a partnership? It would be simpler for the books.’” From the start, they knew they wanted to design on hand looms, but have the fabrics woven in industrial mills. “Emma and I are influenced by Bauhaus, which is very much that ethos of hand craft coupled with industrial production,” says Wallace-Jones. They chose the UK so they could be more hands-on. “We were trying to push the limits of what could be done, both with the types of thread we wanted and using multi-colours in the warp. It was quite complicated,” says Sewell. After trying a number of mills across the north of England, they settled on Mitchell Interflex, a fourth-generation, family-run, 18th-century mill. It has been weaving their fabrics for the past 17 years. It’s a busy time for Wallace Sewell: as well as Crossrail, they are launching their first collection of rugs at the London Design Festival this month and, to celebrate their quarter-century milestone, preparing for an exhibition opening at the Fashion and Textile Museum in October. “Nine years ago, I moved from London to Dorset; so now we split the collection, designing individually on our own hand looms, then meeting up once a week to discuss everything,” says Wallace-Jones. “We realise in our dotage that it’s nice we’re not together all the time, and there’s always a fresh eye looking at the work.” They also go camping together with their families once or twice a year, all over the UK. One of the secrets to their success is that they are completely honest about each other’s designs. “We might disagree a little about something, but I think that’s because we trained together and have worked so closely together for such a long time we almost pick the same colours,” says Sewell. “We have evolved our style together.” Wallace-Jones agrees. “We’ve never had a row; we’re a bit like a married couple and finish each other’s sentences.” Indeed, one will take over from the other midway through a subject. Looking ahead, Sewell would like to “go back to my roots and do some beautifully woven fashion fabrics”, while Wallace-Jones is keen on colour consulting. Which means whatever the future holds, it will be bright. • See Wallace Sewell’s work at designjunction, 21-24 September, Granary Square, London N1; Wallace Sewell: 25 Years of British Textile Design, Fashion and Textile Museum, London SE1, 20 October to 21 January 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/31/terry-pratchett-posthumous-publication-stieg-larsson-kafka-harper-lee-larkin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T11:45:09Z","webTitle":"No wonder Terry Pratchett wanted to avoid the Stieg Larsson treatment | Stephanie Merritt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/terry-pratchett-posthumous-publication-stieg-larsson-kafka-harper-lee-larkin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/terry-pratchett-posthumous-publication-stieg-larsson-kafka-harper-lee-larkin","fields":{"headline":"No wonder Terry Pratchett wanted to avoid the Stieg Larsson treatment","bodyText":"How many Terry Pratchett fans considered chaining themselves to the steamroller that flattened his last hard drives, or lying down in the mud to prevent the destruction of unknown treasures? I couldn’t help wondering how much those hard drives would have raised if they’d been auctioned, what price a devoted reader or eager academic would have been prepared to pay for a glimpse of the great man’s last unpolished thoughts? We’ll never know: Pratchett was adamant that no incomplete ideas should survive him to be finished by someone else, and left instructions detailing their characteristically dramatic end. As a reader, it’s hard not to feel conflicted. It’s been reported that Pratchett had a tantalising 10 potential novels on that computer; anyone who loved his work must be itching to know what they contained. Even a rough outline and a few notes would have felt like a gift from beyond the grave. Pratchett knew this, and he had the advantage of time to settle his affairs; he chose what he wanted to share with readers (two posthumous novels) and what was not for public view. Perhaps, as the Alzheimer’s he wrote about with such clarity threatened his sense of control, there was comfort in knowing he’d taken care of the words he would leave behind. A novel in its formative stages is a remarkably private and frequently embarrassing thing. (This feeling often lasts beyond publication too.) I don’t know any writers who’d be happy with the idea of readers – even trusted friends – rootling through the mess of early drafts and judging them by it. Every time I start a novel I’m dogged by a very particular memento mori – the clause in my contract that says that if I should die in the middle of writing it, my family must either pay back the advance or agree to let someone else finish it. The prospect of anyone making sufficient sense of my scattershot notes to assemble a story that looks anything like the one in my head (even I have trouble doing that) is enough to make me turn in my future grave. Apart from anything else, there’s the intimate and personal relationship you have with your characters, especially if you write a series; to imagine someone else trying to get inside my character’s head feels like a grotesque infidelity. Not all authors get the choice, of course. Stieg Larsson died of a heart attack before any of his Millennium trilogy made it into print; he could never have predicted the books’ colossal success, much less the bitter legal wrangling over his estate as a result. Three-quarters of an unfinished fourth novel in the possession of his partner, Eva Gabrielsson, is yet to see the light of day; that didn’t stop his publisher commissioning sequels – using the same characters – from the author David Lagercrantz. Gabrielsson has been frank in her condemnation of the project, saying he would have been “saddened” and “furious” at the thought of anyone taking over his work. Perhaps writers are not necessarily the best judges of their own legacy, though, and there’s a case for disregarding an author’s last wishes for the sake of posterity. Franz Kafka famously wrote to his friend Max Brod before his death in 1924, asking Brod to burn all his manuscripts, diaries and letters unread. If Brod had not ignored him, we would not now have The Trial, The Castle or Amerika, and Kafka’s place in the canon of 20th-century literature would look very different. “The last work of a modern master, however fragmentary, is a matter of public interest and scholarly importance,” declared the New York Times in 2007, when Dmitri Nabokov decided to ignore his father’s deathbed instructions to destroy the notes for his last novel, The Original of Laura, on the grounds that Vladimir couldn’t really have meant it. Dmitri invoked Brod in his introduction, though some critics felt he had not done his father any favours. By contrast, fans of David Foster Wallace would surely not wish to be without The Pale King, his final, posthumous novel that was pieced together by his editor. However flawed, it offers a glimpse of Wallace’s preoccupations before his suicide, and is a worthy companion to its completed predecessors. But is everything an author scribbles a “matter of public interest”? The notorious case of our time has been the 2015 publication of Harper Lee’s first novel, Go Set a Watchman, the prelude to To Kill A Mockingbird. A deep sense of discomfort vied with natural curiosity at the idea that the then 89-year-old Lee – blind, deaf and post-stroke – should have suddenly decided to allow publication of her early work just after her protective sister died. Lee’s involvement with the process of publication seemed remote at best, and though the book was undoubtedly a fascinating glimpse into the author’s development, it was hard to escape the sense that commercial rather than literary interests were the driving force here, and that the author’s wishes had been incidental. There’s a difference between publishing a lost work 30 years after its author’s death, and doing so while they’re in a nursing home, being spoken for by lawyers. Perhaps Philip Larkin had the most healthily cynical approach to his legacy. In his poem Posterity, he pictures his future biographer, “Jake Balokowsky”, grumbling over Larkin’s words in a US university. Sending a poem to his lover Betty Mackereth in 1976, Larkin wrote: “Flog it to Texas if it seems embarrassing”. This joke about the voracious appetite for British literary manuscripts of certain archives was not entirely a joke – he knew the commercial value of his poems. So maybe it’s fruitless for writers to try to control what happens to their work after they’re gone; someone will try to make money from it, so you may as well make sure it’s the people you love. Besides, it’s not so simple as burning manuscripts these days. Hard drives are notoriously indestructible; Pratchett’s survived the steamroller and had to be put through a stone-crusher. It’s not impossible that some further fragment might surface in years to come, and this will all turn out to have been an elaborate joke on Pratchett’s part. I wouldn’t put it past him. • Stephanie Merritt is an author and former deputy literary editor of the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2017/aug/31/armageddon-scientists-calculate-how-stars-can-nudge-comets-to-strik-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T17:16:23Z","webTitle":"Armageddon: scientists calculate how stars can nudge comets to strike Earth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/31/armageddon-scientists-calculate-how-stars-can-nudge-comets-to-strik-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/aug/31/armageddon-scientists-calculate-how-stars-can-nudge-comets-to-strik-earth","fields":{"headline":"Armageddon: scientists calculate how stars can nudge comets to strike Earth","bodyText":"The collision of a giant comet with the Earth is one of the most violent and cataclysmic events that could befall our planet. It has happened in the past, but the odds of another such catastrophe have remained uncertain. Now astronomers have performed the cosmic equivalent of a risk assessment. A new paper calculates how often stars stray into the Oort cloud, a vast, spherical shell of billions of icy objects that is thought to envelop our solar system. Such close encounters can dislodge these loosely orbiting comets, sending them hurtling into the solar system, risking a collision course with the Earth. Within the next million years, the paper predicts, between 19 and 24 stars will come within 3.26 light years of the sun – sufficiently close to deflect comets markedly from their original paths. “Certainly anything coming within that distance you should worry about,” said Coryn Bailer-Jones, of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg and the paper’s author. Not all close encounters would lead to comets hitting the Earth – this would depend on a mixture of luck and on where the Earth is in its orbit relative to the passing star – but the chances of a collision would peak at these time points. A further 490 to 600 stars will pass the sun within a distance of 16.3 light years within the next million years, the paper estimates. This is far beyond the predicted outer reaches of the Oort cloud, but in the case of a very large star, still potentially close enough to cause comets to swerve in their tracks. The Oort cloud has never been observed directly, but scientists have inferred its existence because the comets we see in the night sky would have disintegrated or sublimed long ago if they had always been in their current orbits. So scientists believe they must spend most of their existence in an outer reservoir and get kicked inwards by passing stars. Theoretical models suggest the Oort cloud spans from as close as 2,000 astronomical units (1AU is the Earth-sun distance) to as far as 200,000 AU. There are likely to be billions of loosely orbiting comets, with sizes up to a few or even a few dozen kilometres. Given their great distance, these comets feel only a very slight pull of the sun’s gravity – just enough to keep them in orbit – and can be easily dislodged. The latest calculations are based on data from the Gaia space telescope, which is mapping the positions and trajectories of about 1% of the Milky Way’s 200 to 300 billion stars. Within the Milky Way’s disk, stars are orbiting about the galactic centre. Our sun completes one orbit in about 250m years, sometimes crossing the paths of other stars in brief stellar encounters. The latest finding, published in the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, suggests that these encounters occur about twice as frequently as previous estimates. Previously, Gaia scientists revealed that the closest encounter on the horizon will be a dwarf star, Gleise 710, which will come within 16,000 AU in about 1.3m years. “Gaia found it’s going to come much closer than we thought. It’s quite exciting,” said Bailer-Jones. “But we’re going to have to wait more than a million years I’m afraid.” In the future, astronomers are hoping to extend their search deep into the past in the hope of finding stars that might be ultimately responsible for the demise of the dinosaurs, 66m years ago. Although it is not certain whether the impact that is thought to have caused this mass extinction was a comet or an asteroid, some speculate that a comet is more likely as these tend to be bigger and so more likely to have caused the most cataclysmic impacts. “Potentially you could imagine tracing the orbit back 66 million years and identifying whether there was any star that came close to the sun and postulating whether that ejected a comet,” said Bailer-Jones. “That would be the holy grail.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2017/sep/12/want-to-win-over-an-audience-how-to-improve-your-presentation-skills","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Want to win over an audience?

How to improve your presentation skills","bodyText":"Presentations shouldn’t be just a set of bullet points on a screen. In An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used presentation slides to provide a compelling argument to his audience. Your next business presentation may not win any awards, but there are things you can do to make an impact. Remember, it’s not about you There are many reasons why you would need to give a presentation: pitching for funding, building a business relationship or making a sale. However, the overall purpose of your presentation should always do one thing: provide something your audience needs. In his book Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey writes: “Begin with the end in mind”. Think about what you want the audience to do as a result of hearing your talk – whether it is to buy your product the next day or introduce you to their company’s senior decision-makers. Structure it first Before you do anything, you need to consider the structure of your presentation. If you’re selling a product or service, then you can start by describing a problem faced by the client, industry or market. Then describe how your product or service solves that need. If you’re providing an update on a project, consider a timeline of events. Whatever you choose, you should lay out the key points that help your audience understand the message, then gather supporting material. Supporting material includes facts, statistics, relevant quotations, client testimonials and, above all, stories. Stories create the emotional connection that makes your presentation memorable. You will need to grab the audience’s attention within the first 30 seconds, so prepare a bold opening such as “I’m going to show you how to increase sales by 20%”. Make a storyboard I like to describe each slide or deck on a sticky note in a sentence or drawing (you may prefer to use some software). For example, “chart showing that sales volume has increased by 20%” or “picture of a child playing with one of our toys”. Then arrange them in a logical order. Communications expert Nancy Duarte said that presentations fail because of too much information, not too little. For each slide, ask yourself the question, does it help this audience understand this message? If you’re not sure, put it aside for use in a different presentation. By the time you’re finished you’ll have a logical outline of your talk. Avoid death by bullet point Images have much greater impact than text, so avoid death by bullet point by looking for images that support your points and stories. You can find plenty of free-to-use photos online through Creative Commons, an organisation which releases copyright-licenses free of charge to the public, and there are low-cost photo libraries available too. Best of all would be to use your own photos. Remember that you and your message are unique, so avoid bland, generic stock photos and clip art. Use text sparingly and make sure you use a large, clear font. You should use a consistent colour scheme that matches your brand image. You may love your logo, but it doesn’t need to appear on every single slide. If you’re 20 minutes into a presentation and the audience doesn’t know who you are, then a logo on each slide won’t help. Put it at the beginning and the end, along with your contact information. Practice makes perfect Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. Feeling confident will allow you to focus on your audience. You should practise with the equipment you’ll be using. If you are using someone else’s equipment, make sure you’re familiar with how it connects and practise so that you’ll be able to do it smoothly. If you’ll be connecting to a sophisticated set up at a client’s office, find out if you can get into the meeting room in advance. Watching a salesperson spend 15 minutes trying to connect their latest iPhone to a prospect’s Soviet-era television can be entertaining on a rainy day – but it doesn’t help them get their message across. It’s all in the delivery This is where all your preparation pays off. Take a deep breath. Smile at the audience and give your presentation, with impact.

I’m not talking about the more obviously desperate items of dependency you find in the far corners of pharmacies. No, I’m referring to zip-up cardigans, nonslip shoes that you don’t have to lace, money trays, keyring holders with built-in torches, the Sunday Telegraph, historical novels. Not definitive markers of obsolescence, but first intimations of mortality. In my case, it’s a backpack. I know the young wear backpacks, but they don’t wear them in the spirit of shame in which I wear mine. The young fling them with insouciance over one shoulder, which my physiotherapist (another intimation of mortality) tells me is bad for the spine. So I strap myself rigidly into my backpack as though I’m sending myself on an Age Concern package holiday and have all the cucumber sandwiches I’ll need while I’m away. I couldn’t look worse if I wore a vest. That it should come to this after all the elegant briefcases I’ve owned and loved and polished: my professor’s Leonhard Heyden Salisbury, capacious enough to carry the complete works of Kafka and Kundera; my battered cognac Bridge bag for literary festivals; my svelte Jasper Blue Fabriano folio case that holds a single Point Of View for Radio 4. Bags denoting confidence and authority. But they either hold too little when I’m travelling abroad, or weigh too much. It used not to matter: I had the memory not to need to carry lecture notes, and I had the strength to toss Kafka and Kundera into an overhead locker. Now, if I’m to travel anywhere with more than a couple of sheets of A4, I must be backpacked. Rucksacks, we used to call them in the days we traversed inhospitable terrain. By “we”, I mean other people. I have an aversion to the accoutrements of adventure, so won’t be carrying rolled-up groundsheets and gunmetal water bottles. In their absence, I am less of a danger to fellow travellers – and where, you might ask, is the joy of wearing a backpack if you can’t smash into people with it? But that’s just another reason I look wrong in mine. I’m too obviously peaceable. I don’t cycle for the same reason. Time’s whirligig brings in its revenges.

Is Taylor Swift’s ‘verified fan’ system a way to reward followers – or rip them off? ","bodyText":"It is possible that you do not have an opinion about the font Taylor Swift employs on the cover of her new album, that you do not care who or what her new single is directed at, and that you are wholly unconcerned by whether she is currently an online heroine or a pariah. Nevertheless, it is worth paying attention to what Swift has done now – or, as she might put it, what the deficiencies of the ticketing industry have made her do. Swift does not have any tickets for sale for her upcoming tour. She does not even have an upcoming tour, yet. Still, at some point, there will be a tour and lots of people will want to get tickets. Taylor – and this is the official line – wants her most dedicated fans to get those tickets, so she has signed up with the “verified fan” system introduced by the ticket seller Ticketmaster – used for Bruce Springsteen’s forthcoming run of shows on Broadway – whereby people who are assessed by algorithms to be real fans (as opposed to touts or the automated bots touts use to hoover up tickets) are given priority in the online queue to buy tickets. Not guaranteed tickets, just a guaranteed place in a queue. The issue is how Swift’s fans can prove their devotion. They can preorder the CD of her forthcoming album, Reputation – and to receive it on the day of release costs $48.09 (That’s £37, but the CD itself costs $15, $13.99 for a digital download. And you are allowed to buy the album 13 times to boost your place in the line.) You can buy merchandise from her online shop. If you do not want to spend money, you can get a smaller boost to your position by repeatedly watching her new video, or by posting about her on social media. To a great many people, this doesn’t look like ensuring real fans get access to tickets. It looks like gouging as much money as possible out of them. It is “nothing more than a transparent cash grab”, said US magazine Alternative Press. “It makes getting tickets for a Taylor Swift concert into a game in which people with the most money get ahead,” suggested Jezebel. The thing is, it might well be those things, as well as what it claims to be. “There is no denying this is an effective way to hugely reduce the secondary ticketing market, but it is also rather forceful,” says James Sandom, who manages bands including Franz Ferdinand, Belle and Sebastian, Kaiser Chiefs and the Vaccines. “From an outside perspective, I admire the brand-driving initiative that sits underneath this. However, it is reliant upon the most dedicated fans. There is a degree of this process proving alienating to normal people.” The things is, normal people are already alienated from the ticket-buying process. Last year, Nathan Hubbard, a former CEO of Ticketmaster, explained why you can never get a good ticket for the shows you want to see. First, there are presales – tickets sold by sponsors, to fan club members, to those on venue or promoter mailing lists. The touts and bots are already at work here. Then there are the tickets taken by the artist, the record label and other organisations involved in the show for their own use. Then there are bands or promoters giving tickets direct to the ticket resale sites. (They do this because for the biggest shows, the artist may well be asking for more money than can be raised by selling all tickets at face price. The money has to be made up somewhere.) By the time tickets go on general sale, Hubbard wrote, 90% may already be sold. What tends to get brushed over is the complicity of artists in the process. Fans buying tickets want to believe the artist is on their side, and so there is an acceptance in the industry – a conspiracy might be another word – that when it all goes pear-shaped and fans realise they are being milked dry, the artist does not carry the can. Last year, one major promoter told me they knew of only one stadium-filling act they were certain did not play the resale market, either themselves or by granting promoters permission to resell at inflated prices. We know this happens, but we prefer to blame promoters, ticket agencies, managers – anyone but the artist. The real issue here – and you probably don’t want to hear this – is that the most popular artists do not charge enough for their tickets. The resale sites have proved that the market will support much higher pricing, but the artists don’t want to be the ones who look like greedy moneygrabbers by asking for those prices. So other people do the dirty work, and the artist still gets the guaranteed fee they asked for – from the sponsors who presold tickets, from revenues from resale sites, or – in Swift’s case – from the purchases her fans made to get in the ticket queue. If artists hiked the price of tickets, people would moan at them, but far fewer tickets would go to touts, because the margins would discourage them. Ticketing will change. “I expect in the future to see further growth of the tiered pricing systems we have in place in many sports, or other retail,” Sandom says, although it should be noted that where unofficial “dynamic pricing” – slashing the price to shift unsold seats – has occurred, fans who coughed up full price at the earliest opportunity have tended to complain. There is also the problem that venues, ticket sale sites and ticket resale sites are caught in a web of their own commercial relationships, which means dynamic pricing would be harder to operate, because ticket sales are controlled by those who have an interest in maintaining the current system. So if you want to see Star A playing at Arena B, you may well find Arena B sells tickets only through Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster, in turn, owns the resale sites GetMeIn! and Seatwave. Arena B has an interest in Ticketmaster making the most money possible from the show, because it helps it with its contract. Ticketmaster has an interest in getting tickets on to GetMeIn! and Seatwave, because it takes a cut of those sales. The only one who loses out is you. In the meantime, the brightest brains of the music industry – insert your own gag, thanks – ponder how to keep tickets out of the hands of touts and bots, and ensure revenue goes to the artists rather than the scammers. You can try paperless tickets, and tickets that demand the production of ID on the door. Well, here is another suggestion. It is crazy, but it would eliminate the bots, at least. Sell tickets in advance from venue box offices. People can either walk up and buy them in person, or they can send in a cheque and stamped, self-addressed envelope. And that’s it. Make those the only ways to buy tickets. What? Yes, you are right. It is how we used to buy tickets before the internet. And, yes, it worked far better for us. • This article was amended on 1 September 2017.

On Monday, claims that the child was a “white Christian” and had been left distressed after being placed with a Muslim family became the focus of a political and media storm. But as the week unfolded, and the newsprint dedicated to the dispute mounted, it became clear that the initial portrayal of the case was one-sided, if not inaccurate. The furore surrounding child AB, as she is known as in court documents, was prompted by a front-page article in the Times headlined “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care”. The paper reported that a “white Christian child” had been placed with two Muslim households by Tower Hamlets council over the past six months. According to confidential local authority reports, a social services supervisor had described the child crying, asking not to be returned to one foster carer because “they don’t speak English”. The report included a pixellated photograph of the girl in the company of a woman – alleged to be her foster carer – wearing a black niqab or burka. Elaine Dibben, a consultant for CoramBAAF, an independent membership organisation for professionals working in adoption and fostering, told the Guardian it was important to consider foster cases from multiple viewpoints. “One of the reasons we won’t comment on individual cases is we’re always aware that there’s one perspective being reported and there will be many perspectives, some of which can’t be reported,” she said. “You’re having to juggle the time you have to make that decision – you need a placement for the child on the same day – and you’re trying to juggle things like keeping the child local to the family, their school, their friends, their activities, alongside matching the other more complex aspects of the case.” At a time when studies have found media reporting about Muslim communities contributes to an atmosphere of rising hostility towards the Islamic faith, far-right groups seized on the story as a vindication for Islamophobia. Tommy Robinson, former leader of the English Defence League, tweeted links to the story to his followers. The far-right party Britain First posted a video of its leader, Paul Golding, denouncing the decision as an “absolute disgrace and an outrage” in front of a graphic of a floating union jack, holding the case up as an example of “what the future of this country is going to look like”. Behind the scenes, Tower Hamlets council was frantically trying to temper the situation. Sources within the council told the Guardian they were genuinely fearful the Times coverage would identify the girl or her family in what was a complex and highly sensitive situation. Both sides appointed QCs to mediate. The Daily Mail followed by putting the story on its front page on Tuesday under the headline “MPs’ anger as Christian girl forced into Muslim foster care”. The former Mail Online columnist and far-right commentator Katie Hopkins tweeted an image of the front page, asking: “Which individual at Tower Hamlets was responsible for the abuse of this little girl?” The Daily Mail and Mail Online did not have a photograph of the girl at the heart of the case. Instead, they used a stock picture of a Muslim family to illustrate the story in print and online. But they altered the image to cover the woman’s face with a veil. The two papers are facing an investigation by Ipso, the newspaper regulator, after complaints were made about their coverage. The Guardian approached the Times earlier in the week about its coverage. A spokeswoman referred the newspaper to the ruling made at the family court. The mounting hysteria over the case forced Tower Hamlets into a corner and the council reluctantly compiled a lengthier statement, defending its actions but also hitting out at inaccuracies in the report. Most notably, the council said the child was in fact being fostered by an English-speaking family of mixed race, undermining the central issue in the initial media reports. On Wednesday, it emerged a hearing had been held at the east London family court the previous day in which a judge had ordered that the foster care placement should end and that the child should reside with her maternal grandmother. A report of the hearing on the Times’s front page focused on the judge’s decision to place the child with the maternal grandmother and was presented as a victory for the newspaper. But in a rare move, the judge, Khatun Sapnara, decided late on Wednesday to publish the order due to the “exceptionally high degree of interest”. The 11-page document gave a more detailed, if not complete, picture of the background to and circumstances of child AB’s removal, containing some revelations that jarred with the initial reporting on the case. Firstly, the child’s maternal grandmother is a “non-practising Muslim”. In addition, the grandmother does not speak English, the order stating she required a translation of the document. The grandmother also expressed a desire to “return to her country of origin and care for the child there”. The child’s mother told the court they were of Christian heritage. The order does not elaborate on possible clashes between the two accounts. It did, however, provide some detail as to the mother’s background. The court ordered the Metropolitan police to disclose to Tower Hamlets “all papers relating to the criminal proceedings in respect of mother, and to include any notes of sentence and pre-sentence reports”. She also had applied for a Scram bracelet, a tag to monitor levels of alcohol consumption, and her solicitors requested permission to supply results for cocaine testing. The child’s biological father could not be located, the order said. Regarding the foster carers, the order revealed that a court-appointed guardian visited the child at the carers’ home and spoke to the child alone. “The guardian has no concerns as to the child’s welfare and she reports that the child is settled and well cared for by the foster carer,” the document states. The papers showed that Tower Hamlets council had wanted the girl to be placed with her maternal grandmother. Strict vetting rules meant this was not immediately possible and she had to be placed in temporary care. The grandparents underwent a full assessment and the judge was able to approve the request. Questions remain, and will likely remain in the interests of protecting the child’s identity. But Dibben said one certainty was that authorities – the police and council in this case – would have had concerns that the child’s safety was at risk in her mother’s care. “Children will only ever be removed from their families if there are significant concerns about the safety and wellbeing of the child,” she said. While matching a child to a foster family with a similar cultural background was important, it was not as crucial as keeping them in the local area, Dibben said. “If you’re a child that’s just been taken away from your family home possibly in quite traumatic circumstances with police and whoever else there, what you need is to be kept local so at least the next day you can go back into school or nursery, and you can see your family,” she said. “Keeping people local is one of the primary criteria.” Dibben added that there were “far more examples” of Muslim children being placed in white British Christian families – particularly unaccompanied asylum seekers – that worked successfully. James Sandiford, a solicitor with the children’s team at the law firm Russell-Cooke, which deals with about 150 childcare cases a year, said there was no rule or requirement that children must be placed with carers of the same cultural or religious background. “Local authorities across the country have a shortage of foster carers and many are advertising to recruit more,” he said. “For a child who has suddenly been removed from home, and who may have little understanding of what is happening to them, the most important consideration will probably be to have carers to offer them love and reassurance, and who are willing to invest in their relationship for however long they care for them.” The judge expressed dismay that the Times published a photograph – albeit pixellated – of the carer and the child. Sandiford said sensitive reporting of care cases was essential in protecting the vulnerable children involved. “As public access to children cases in the family court is only available through the media, accurate reporting that distinguishes between facts and allegations is important,” he said. But Dibben said the reporting had also encouraged the debate about the availability of families. “As part of this debate, we can highlight [that] we still have quite a great need for a whole range of families including Muslim families to come forward, that will be a good thing to come out of it,” she said. The case of child AB returns to the east London family court on 2 October with a view to settling a care plan before her sixth birthday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/aug/31/outlaws-to-in-laws-queer-histories-15-minute-plays","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T14:56:07Z","webTitle":"'Don't forget all that's happened': queer histories in 15 minutes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/31/outlaws-to-in-laws-queer-histories-15-minute-plays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/aug/31/outlaws-to-in-laws-queer-histories-15-minute-plays","fields":{"headline":"'Don't forget all that's happened': queer histories in 15 minutes","bodyText":"Jonathan Harvey, writer of the jubilant stage and film hit Beautiful Thing and the gleefully garish BBC2 sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme, is reflecting on growing up gay in Liverpool in the 1980s. “It was a tough, macho place that I couldn’t wait to get out of,” recalls the 49-year-old. “It was obviously easier then than in the 1960s but that’s still not to say it was particularly easy. And I was living in Thatcher’s Liverpool. She really didn’t like the city and she’d decimated it. I’ve moved back since but I had to get out to come out.” It was while in London that he saw the original 1992 National Theatre production of Angels in America. “It was genuinely life-changing. Whenever there was anything about HIV and Aids in the papers, I’d turn the page. I just assumed we’d all succumb to it in the end and be wiped out. And then here I was, slap bang in the front row at the Cottesloe theatre. It made me wake up and go, ‘Fucking hell, you’ve got to take responsibility.’ I became politicised about my sexuality and it’s probably scant coincidence that I wrote Beautiful Thing six months later. That was my seventh play but my first with a gay theme.” His latest, Mister Tuesday, is a bittersweet vignette, one of seven 15-minute pieces by gay writers that make up Outlaws to In-Laws – each set in a different decade, from the 1950s to the present day. This history of gay male lives in England is directed by Mary Franklin. When Harvey was invited to take part, he plumped immediately for the 1960s, to write about a man in 1965 – two years before homosexuality was decriminalised – who threatens his married lover with blackmail to deter him from a break-up. “It’s such an interesting period. Social change was up in the air and decriminalisation was on the horizon but it was all still dangerous. The rules of the day were like a blackmailers’ charter.” Portmanteau productions can have a cobbled-together, Frankenstein’s Monster feel to them but he insists there’s a continuity to this one. “Of course you’ve got a sense of progress, hence the title. But there’s still a lot of anger going on here – there’s Aids, there’s Clause 28.” Issues of race also surface in two plays set in starkly different periods. In Jonathan Kemp’s Reward, a black teenager and a National Front skinhead fall for each other during the Queen’s silver jubilee celebrations and discover an unexpected kinship. And in Topher Campbell’s Brothas 2.0, two black friends in the early 2000s peruse the profiles on a dating website that is visible to the audience, exploring the disparity between their digital and corporeal selves. Kemp was 10 in 1977, when his play takes place. “Choosing the decade I’d grown up in was a way of unpacking and trying to make sense of it. Even though I was around then, I’d been too young to experience the full impact or to really understand what was going on.” Despite the setting, he says Reward is also a comment on race in modern gay life. “The Black Lives Matter movement was just starting when I was writing the play and it felt apposite to what I wanted to address. Racism is prevalent in the gay community but then there’s no reason why it wouldn’t be. Just because someone’s gay and in a sexual minority doesn’t mean they’ll make connections with other oppressed minorities and express compassion or goodwill.” Gay dating apps in particular are an area where prejudice is often expressed brazenly. “Look at Grindr and Scruff and you’ll see profiles that say ‘No blacks’ or ‘No Asians’ or whatever. It’s a big problem in the queer community.” Brothas 2.0 approaches race from a different angle, focusing on the opportunities that the internet opened up for people outside the white gay mainstream. Campbell explains: “I wanted to say something about the 00s because of how the internet impacted on people’s lives and sex lives and identities. In particular for black men who have sex with men, it created an important space given our minority status. There aren’t that many places for black people generally to meet so cyberspace provided something that real space wasn’t offering.” The play explores the complicated layers of performance involved for the macho Dwayne, who resists the word “gay”, which he regards as synonymous with “white” and therefore “soft”, and doesn’t message people he desires for fear of seeming weak. His friend Femi, on the other hand, frequents saunas and still prizes old-fashioned physical interaction. “Femi is supposedly lower down on the scale of commercial attractiveness but in fact he has the better sex life because he doesn’t have the pressures of keeping up appearances that Dwayne has.” Campbell is 45 but there’s no suggestion from Brothas 2.0 of any censorious attitude toward the behaviour of his juniors; his play is superficially the liveliest of the seven. “The others are quite gentle,” he says. “I designed it deliberately to be high-energy because I’m the only black writer. I wanted it to have a different flavour.” There’s also a cautious enthusiasm expressed about the way people hook up in the digital era rather than nostalgia for how dating used to be. “It’s not easy to bump into people on the tube or bus and not everyone wants to go to nightclubs and dance around with their tits out. So where are you going to go? Gentrification in London is decreasing the spaces where LGBT people can meet and there’s a lot of pressure. We live in a click-and-collect society now. We can get our stuff brought to us from Tesco and Deliveroo and we consume each other as well.” Though the remit of Outlaws to In-Laws is to address the gay male experience in England (sex between women never having been criminalised), it’s disappointing to find that not one of the seven male playwrights has found room for a female character. “I can’t defend it,” Harvey admits, “though they’re all very short pieces and there’s only so much you can do in that time.” Still, it would be churlish to deny the play’s value as social history. “It’s about people taking stock,” he says. “Gay men haven’t all been off having children, so historically our stories won’t have survived. These plays should feel a bit like watching an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? and seeing where you came from. It’s a family tree that could easily die out. That’s why I think nights like this in the theatre are important. That’s a grand word but it’s about nailing your colours to the mast and saying, ‘Don’t forget, all this happened to give you the privileges you’ve got today.’” Outlaws to In-Laws is at the King’s Head theatre, London, from 29 August to 23 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/31/england-pro-immigrant-islamophobic-race-polarised","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T10:09:47Z","webTitle":"England is now more pro-immigrant – but it’s more Islamophobic too | Phil McDuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/england-pro-immigrant-islamophobic-race-polarised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/england-pro-immigrant-islamophobic-race-polarised","fields":{"headline":"England is now more pro-immigrant – but it’s more Islamophobic too","bodyText":"Reading through Hope Not Hate’s latest report on their surveys of English attitudes towards race and immigration, one comes away with a mix of optimism and pessimism. Those of us who are what the organisation describes as “confident multiculturals” – or what the tabloids would describe as out-of-touch liberal elitists – can be heartened by what seem to be an increase in our ranks. We now make up 22% of the sample, up from 8% in the first survey in 2011. The two most pro-immigrant groups now make up 39% of the overall total. At the other end of the spectrum, those who are “hostile” to immigration have remained consistent, but with a shift from those who are most fiercely opposed – down from 13% to 5% since 2011 – to the group described as “latently hostile,” up to 17% from 10% in the same period. This indicates that even those people harbouring anti-immigrant views are more likely to engage with the political process than to resort to direct violence themselves or support it in others. However, the report also details a significant rise in anti-Muslim sentiment. 42% of people said that the recent terrorist attacks have increased their suspicion of Muslims in Britain, including many of those in the more liberal groups. Around 50% of people would be willing to see relaxation of human rights protections to “help fight terrorism,” and a similar proportion see Islam itself as “a threat to the west”. Only 10% of the population see themselves as being “similar” to Muslims. This baseline perception of fundamental difference seems to reinforce the stereotype that immigrants fail to integrate and also, ironically, opposition to wanting them to do so. Muslims themselves are, overall, much more in favour of children from different backgrounds going to school together as a measure to improve integration, compared with the population at large. This polarisation is worrying because it provides more evidence that England is failing to resist the processes of cumulative extremism, or what academic Douglas Pratt calls “reactive co-radicalisation”, in which extremist conceptions of “the other” become normalised across the population. In such an environment, responses to violence themselves triggers counter-responses in a vicious cycle of increased suspicion and enmity. Media presentations of Islam and Muslims are doubtless contributing to this process. As Pratt says in his essay Islam as Feared Other, the religion is portrayed as “de facto oppositional” to “European” culture, so fundamentally different that its mere existence threatens our own. The conception of Islam in the current nationalist imagination is not so different from the antisemitic or anti-black tropes of history (which, of course, haven’t gone away), and incorporates elements of both. The fear of the primitive savage and the fear of the invading alien culture poisoning western culture from within are both old racist tropes reworked for a modern Islamophobic discourse. Even the shift towards increased political engagement by those with extremely anti-immigrant views provides little comfort if those people are simply becoming more confident that the state will effectively carry out policies based on this rising fear of the other. With an increasingly rightwing Conservative party in power, the decline of Ukip, and street-based far right groups such as the British National party (BNP) and English Defence League (EDL) may not signify a positive trend of increasing tolerance for difference. This may, instead, signify that the Islamophobic demands of the far right have been increasingly incorporated into our mainstream politics. It is easy to see how politicians, pulled to and fro as they are by electoral concerns, could find themselves tempted to pander to these fears. The path of least resistance is always to position yourself against the current enemies. Many seem to believe that they can play both sides, by denouncing obvious crimes by the “othered” population while providing boilerplate “but not all of them, of course” disclaimers to provide cover for their nudge-nudge-wink-wink invocation of racist tropes. It’s difficult to know who does this cynically and who has simply found themselves befuddled through failure to properly appreciate the environment in which they speak. It’s unlikely that Sarah Champion, for example, set out to consciously perpetuate the “dark men raping our women” trope when she wrote the piece for the Sun that led to her resignation from the shadow cabinet, yet she did so anyway. Abi Wilkinson unpicked the contradictions in the narrative in the wake of the sexual assaults during Cologne’s 2016 new year celebration: in the west “only women who conform to strict rules about appropriate behaviour deserve not to be assaulted” by white men with status, but if the assailants are refugees from Islamic countries this is presented as not simply an individual crime but a clash of civilisational values. It is not good enough for politicians, especially those on the left or liberal side, to plead ignorance of how their clumsy attempts to play both sides would be “misinterpreted”. Nor is it acceptable to try to sell immigration simply as an economic benefit, delivering a ready supply of low-waged fruit-pickers or nurses. Our society is, despite everything, moving slowly and tentatively towards being more open and less bigoted, but this cannot be presumed to be a natural process that will continue indefinitely without hard work from progressives. To preserve it, we need to actively resist the dangerous and divisive strains of bigotry in our society, not simply hope they go away by themselves. • Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/31/jacinda-ardern-lifts-labour-into-poll-lead-in-new-zealand-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T12:30:48Z","webTitle":"'Jacindamania' lifts Labour into poll lead in New Zealand election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/jacinda-ardern-lifts-labour-into-poll-lead-in-new-zealand-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/31/jacinda-ardern-lifts-labour-into-poll-lead-in-new-zealand-election","fields":{"headline":"'Jacindamania' lifts Labour into poll lead in New Zealand election","bodyText":"The New Zealand Labour party has continued its extraordinary surge under the month-old leadership of Jacinda Ardern, with a new poll putting its support at a 10-year high and for the first time ahead of the governing National party in campaigning for September’s general election. Ardern took control of the party on 1 August with Labour at an all-time low in the polls and has almost single-handedly reignited its chances of forming the next government. Labour’s projected share of the vote has risen from 26% to 43% since Ardern, 37, became the party’s youngest leader. Labour now stands two points ahead of the National party, led by the prime minister, Bill English. The election takes place on 23 September. Ardern and English met in a leaders’ debate on Thursday in which English was asked in the opening question: “Bill, why are you losing?” Ardern, whose charisma and rising popularity prompted domestic media to coin the term “Jacindamania”, told the moderator, Mike Hosking, that she was not taking anything for granted. “I’m certainly not going to decide that it’s somehow a done deal right now,” she said of Labour’s poll lead. English and Hosking tussled over the poll and whether the prime minister could reveal another private polling number, which he claimed was better. The debate between the two leaders was dominated by housing, tax and immigration. Ardern’s biggest challenge going into the debate was expected to be whether she could hold her own on economic issues alongside English, who is a former finance minister, as well as claims that Labour lacks clarity on future tax plans.Labour’s fiscal plan includes spending an additional $20bn (£11bn) over four years. Political analysts were divided over which of the party leaders came out on top. Grant Duncan, an associate professor of political theory and New Zealand politics at Massey University, called it a draw. “The moderator put more pressure on Jacinda compared with the challenges to Bill over his government’s performance, handing Bill the advantage,” he said. The New Zealand Herald’s political editor, Audrey Young, favoured Ardern. “It was Bill English but not as we know him. He sounded as though he has been in a debating bootcamp for the past week, learning about gesticulation, intonation, brevity and how good it is to smile. “It doesn’t come naturally to him. She [Ardern] looked relaxed and assured and won hands down on presentation.” English attacked what he called Labour’s “vague and confusing” policies and reiterated his party’s tax cut policies. “People can’t go shopping with your values … every person in New Zealand who does not have children will be worse off under Labour,” he said. Ardern attacked National’s record on housing, reiterating a Labour plan to build 10,000 houses a year. Home ownership rates in New Zealand have fallen to their lowest since 1951 and affordability is one of the greatest challenges, with prices increasing 34% in the last three years.English said affordability was better than it had been in 2008 due to low interest rates, to which Ardern replied: “Tell someone in Auckland that a $150,000 deposit is affordable.” English asked whether Labour would tell meat workers why it would take $1,000 a year from them by cancelling tax cuts to make university “a bit cheaper for lawyers”. Ardern had announced on Tuesday that she would fast-track a Labour policy to phase in three years of free tertiary education. Ardern said the money for Labour’s fiscal plan would come from cancelling tax cuts, paying off debt more slowly and cracking down on international tax avoidance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/sep/18/how-death-has-changed-over-100-years-in-britain","type":"interactive","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T08:45:13Z","webTitle":"How death has changed over 100 years in Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/sep/18/how-death-has-changed-over-100-years-in-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/sep/18/how-death-has-changed-over-100-years-in-britain","fields":{"headline":"How death has changed over 100 years in Britain","bodyText":"Benjamin Franklin once wrote that “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”, but just how – and at what age – we are likely to exit the world has changed dramatically over the past 100 years, thanks to changing social structures and advances in medicine and technology. While once childhood was a perilous period and adult lives were often cut short, life expectancy at birth now tops 80 years in the UK. The data collated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) encompasses all causes of death, labelled according to the World Health Organization’s international classification of diseases – hence cancer is split into different types, rather than grouped together. The labels for causes of death are those used at the time the records were made. Infant mortality and measles “The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town,” writes Charles Dickens in Oliver Twist, capturing the devastation measles could bring. Measles was the leading cause of death in children in 1915 Yet even before the introduction of a vaccine against measles in 1968, and subsequently the MMR vaccine in 1988, the rate of deaths attributed to the infection had begun to fall. The trend has been used by some as evidence of the virus becoming less deadly. But experts say in reality it is down to other factors including better nutrition, improved health services – such as the development of antibiotics, preventing death from secondary infections – and, crucially, reduced overcrowding due to better housing. “Measles is incredibly infectious so if you have got overcrowding it spreads like wildfire,” said Helen Bedford, professor of children’s health at University College London. Even so, as of 1955 measles was still the eighth leading cause of death in those under 15. Deaths from measles only became a rarity with the introduction of vaccines – a move that could also have helped to drive a drop in childhood deaths from other diseases, given that measles can leave the immune system weakened for more than two years. But measles remains a deadly disease. Between January 2016 and July 2017, 35 deaths were reported in Europe, primarily among unvaccinated individuals – a situation that has been blamed, at least in part, on the impact of anti-vaccination campaigns. “In 2015 [worldwide] there were 134,000 deaths from measles. That’s 15 deaths every hour,” Bedford added. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatrics at the University of Oxford, agreed that vaccination was a priority. “The thing we can do today [in vaccination] that would make the biggest difference to child mortality in the world would be to get the extra 20% of children vaccinated against measles who are not currently vaccinated.” War and traffic Diseases, whether acute infections or chronic illnesses, account for the vast majority of deaths, regardless of decade. But data for 1945 reveals the impact of another deadly outbreak: war. In the year the second world war drew to a close, it was the seventh leading cause of death for those aged 14 or under, and the 10th leading cause of death for those aged 15-49. The figures only relate to those who died in England and Wales and do not include deaths abroad, so those who died in world wars overseas are not in the data. Other societal changes are also reflected in the data. Probably down to both reductions in deaths from infectious diseases and an increase in traffic, in 1945 deaths linked to motor vehicles entered the top 10 causes for the first time, being the second most common cause of death in under 15s with more than 1,050 cases. Motor vehicles were the second highest cause of death among under 15s in 1945 From 1955 to 1995, “motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision with pedestrian” was the leading cause of death among children under 15, albeit with declining figures. By 2015 it had fallen out of the top 10 causes altogether. Nick Lloyd, road safety manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said the decline in deaths was probably down to a number of factors, including the use of child car seats – keeping children inside cars safe – changing car design to reduce the chances of a pedestrian being killed in a collision, better road safety education, the introduction of traffic calming measures and even a reduction in the number of children who walk or cycle to school. Suicide on the rise According to the ONS, suicide encompasses deaths that are known to have been down to intentional self-harm and death by injuries where the intent was undetermined. However, the latter does not apply for those under the age of 15 since such deaths could, for example, be down to abuse or neglect – so although suicide can be recorded as a cause of death for those aged 10 and over, the figures presented here only encompass those for individuals over the age of 14. Trends in those taking their own life are far from simple - with changes in rates over the last century showing different patterns for different age groups, sexes and even methods. “The risks for different groups of people are quite different,” said Elizabeth Scowcroft, research manager at the Samaritans. Taken together, one thing is clear: in recent decades suicide has become one of the leading causes of death among those aged 15-49 – and men are about three times more likely than women to take their own life. In 2015, suicide was one of the leading causes of death among people aged 15-49 Older population In 2015 Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and unspecified dementia all made it into the top 10 causes of death for the first time. It’s far from a straightforward shift and probably down to a combination of factors including longer life expectancy, as more people reach the oldest ages, and better survival of other illnesses. But this is not the full story. Improvements in diagnosis and changes in the ways in which deaths are recorded or classified have probably also played a role. Searching all deaths from 1945, for example, there is no mention of dementia or anything similar – yet it is unlikely that there were no deaths at all from diseases that cause dementia. Dementia was one of the leading causes of death for the over 85s in 2015 One possible clue might lie in the number of deaths in the early to mid 20th century that are classified as “senile decay” or simply “old age”. Since what are now known as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were once considered a natural part of the ageing process, it is possible that such deaths were, at least in part, swept up under these catch-all labels. The labelling system used in 1965 offers further insights with the appearance of “senile psychosis” and, in 1985, “other cerebral degenerations” – a label which included Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. It could also be that some deaths now counted as dementia might have been attributed to other illnesses present in an individual. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org. Methodology The data was collated by the Office for National Statistics from the general register officer and reflects the causes of death as reported at that time. It’s not possible to accurately draw trends from changes in the specific causes of death as definitions vary over time. No children under the age of one are included in the data. Death rates are based on the number of deaths attributable to any given cause across all age groups. All the classifications are taken from the international classification of diseases, which is currently managed by the World Health Organization."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/aug/31/talking-horses-sarah-harrisons-gambling-commission-levies-78m-fine","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T10:27:54Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Sarah Harrison's Gambling Commission levies £7.8m fine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/31/talking-horses-sarah-harrisons-gambling-commission-levies-78m-fine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/31/talking-horses-sarah-harrisons-gambling-commission-levies-78m-fine","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Sarah Harrison's Gambling Commission levies £7.8m fine","bodyText":"Today’s best bet, by Chris Cook This morning brings news that the Gambling Commission has biffed a gambling website with an eye-watering fine of £7.8m. It reminded me of my summer interview with Sarah Harrison, the GC chief executive, who is dealing out unprecedented punishments like the first sheriff a town ever had. “Far more willing to show her teeth than her predecessors were,” was how one betting insider described her when I asked. And today’s news is further evidence, 888 having been found to have failed in their obligations towards vulnerable gamblers and by extension to those people close to those vulnerable gamblers. The GC has definitely made progress under Harrison. Still, I wish it were more prepared to kick up a fuss in cases where your average, non-vulnerable punter is having trouble extracting his winnings from a firm. When I have asked about such cases in the past, including the very recent past, the GC has been cagey to the point of silence. My focus today is on Chelmsford, where Piedita is a predictably short favourite for the staying handicap. She’s a fairly typical Sir Mark Prescott type who got a beatable mark from maiden defeats and is now 2/2 since stepping up to this distance and moving into handicaps. She’s 2lb well in under a penalty for last week’s Lingfield win and I can easily see why people expect her winning run to continue. But I eventually decided there’s more promise in Hugo Palmer’s Dukinta (2.20), a 4-1 shot, who also earned a low mark through maiden defeats before bolting up in her first handicap, stepped up in distance and with a visor fitted. Gee, it seems this is a game that more than one can play. Sure, Dukinta has been raised 11lb for her success, which is a big number. But Piedita is 12lb higher than for her first handicap success, achieved three days before Dukinta’s. The only difference is that Piedita has managed to squeeze another run into the intervening time. Could that be an advantage for Dukinta, who has had 22 days since her last run? Both fillies have been winning on turf with some cut and now make the switch to all-weather. That might not be great news for Piedita, a daughter of Authorized, who has produced many mudlovers. But it should be fine for Dukinta, a daughter of Dubawi, whose progeny have often done well on artificial surfaces. Dukinta is also a half-sister to Grandeur, who was rated 115 when he won the Easter Classic on Lingfield’s Polytrack. All in all, I’d say the signs suggest Dukinta has at least as much chance to be ahead of her mark as Piedita or anything else in the race. I’ll cheerfully take the 4-1. There’s been some interest this morning in Master Of Heaven (3.50), who has lost his way on turf over the summer. He’s dropped back to 53, the rating from which he won at Brighton in May, and could bounce back now that he returns to Chelmsford, where he’s won twice from his last four visits. He’s 9-1 from an opening 14s. In similar vein at Wolverhampton tonight, Top Of The Bank (7.10) is 13-2 from a general 14-1 when betting started. He’s had a fruitless summer on turf but won three of his last six on all-weather surfaces, including at this track in January. He’s dropped 8lb during his losing run and is now 4lb below the mark from which he won at Lingfield in March.

While he makes a number of valid points, in particular that centrists often define their own stance by positing any opposition as extreme left or extreme right, there are some key issues where I have to disagree. One of these is that the centrism of Tony Blair and David Cameron shares any common factor other than an attempt to capture the elusive middle ground, as defined by focus groups and polls: in other words, the very pragmatism that Jones denies them. Where centrism appears to have succeeded, despite Jones’s assertion to the contrary, is with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel: this is largely a reflection of their reliance on offering an apparently softer reading of the liberal capitalist school to which they both belong. Jones is probably correct in saying that the simplistic categories of left and right no longer explain the political divide. For many observers the split resides in the evident shift in focus, particularly among the better educated and more affluent young, from short-term personal gain and endless economic growth to a more sustainable society that is willing to make sacrifices to ensure a better future for all of humanity. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Cruel treatment of refugees We need more journalists like Ben Doherty in Australia. Well done on his article, Hungry, poor, exploited: alarm over Australia’s import of farm workers (25 August). And we need more newspapers that would employ such a journalist: we have one of the most concentrated media ownership environments in the world. The Guardian is one of the media sources we depend on. The most vile abuse of human rights at the moment must be the holding hostage, on Manus Island and Nauru, of the many people who came looking for refuge and have only been subjected to more trauma. Hamed Shamshiripour is the latest casualty (World roundup, 11 August). As Noam Chomsky said in 2013: “The true measure of the moral level of a society is how it treats the most vulnerable people. Few are as vulnerable as those who have fled to Australia in terror and are locked away without charge, their terrible fate veiled in secrecy. We may not be able to do much, beyond lamenting, about North Korean prisons. But we can do a great deal about severe human rights violations right within reach.” Stephen Langford Sydney, Australia Another vote on Brexit How right Vernon Bogdanor is in saying that the UK needs a new Brexit referendum (25 August) before the final step in leaving the European Union is taken. By then the UK electorate will be far more aware of the negative effects of doing so than we were the first time round. But next time we must be given hard facts and the probable implications, rather than just emotive phrases, with each side childishly slagging off the other. As well as the bigger consequences, attention should also be drawn to the smaller, everyday effects: will internet orders from Europe be subject to customs delays, taxes and form-filling? Will we have to get new passports? New vehicle number plates? Some things will run less smoothly if the UK goes it alone. Finally, that annoying phrase “the will of the people”. Are the 48% of the electorate who voted to remain in the EU not people? And shouldn’t there be a clear majority – say 25% – opting to leave before such a significant decision is made? Cynthia Reavell Hastings, UK Mass tourism is a menace I agree with much of what Martin Kettle writes in Tourism is a danger. We are all to blame (18 August). I visited Angkor Wat in 2009 and again in 2014. The number of tourists more than doubled: the difference was Chinese package tours. I would like to see a hefty carbon tax on jet fuel but I see no stopping mass tourism until the global economy falters. I see this phenomenon as part of a transformation of humanity away from nationalism towards global citizenship. Even people on air-conditioned tour buses may have life-transforming encounters in exotic places or see how civilisations rise and fall. Too bad they don’t see how their comfort and security separates them from really living life. Edward Butterworth Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Briefly • In the excellent article Bannon is out – but he may have more influence there (25 August), I find one disturbing point: the author labels everyone protesting against neo-Nazis and white supremacists as being “on the left”. I bet and hope there were people protesting against the neo-Nazis who were politically on the right. Do we have to be divided into left and right even when we are protesting for basic human decency? Eva Major-Marothy Sutton, Quebec, Canada • Your editorial homage to Jane Austen (18 August) notes that none other than Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan “turned to her in moments of darkness”; they are not alone, of course.

The England midfielder joined Liverpool on deadline day in a deal worth up to £40m having rejected a new contract at Arsenal and the chance to join Chelsea, the champions, for a similar fee. He has signed a five-year contract worth £120,000 a week – significantly less than the 24-year-old would have earned by extending his six‑year spell at Arsenal – and confirmed he chose to work with Klopp because it favoured his development. Oxlade-Chamberlain followed Mohamed Salah, Dominic Solanke and Andy Robertson as Liverpool’s summer recruits – RB Leipzig’s Naby Keïta has also been signed for next summer – but the club’s interest in the Monaco midfielder Thomas Lemar and the Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk did not produce further deadline-day signings. Monaco, despite entering into late talks with Arsenal over Lemar, resisted all Liverpool enquiries for the 21-year-old and Southampton never entertained the idea of selling Van Dijk to Anfield. Oxlade-Chamberlain faces fierce competition for a place in Liverpool’s team. But Klopp, who said he was first alerted to the player’s talents during a Champions League tie against his Borussia Dortmund side in 2014, believes the midfielder’s mentality and experience make him a valuable addition. Klopp said: “I hear a lot of talk about positions but let’s talk about the player; he is someone with really good abilities who always gives everything for his team. A player that is positive and willing to take risks to try and make positive things happen. He may still be young but he has a lot of experience in the Premier League, Champions League and for his country. Already he is a very, very good player and I think he has the mentality and desire to get even better – and that excites me. “ This is someone making a tough decision to leave one great club and come to another great club and I think he had many options, so to get him means I am delighted. He didn’t make an easy decision but I think he made a great one to go on this journey with this squad of talented boys and our great supporters.” Oxlade-Chamberlain said he would elaborate more on his Liverpool move after England’s World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia. In a farewell message to Arsenal via Instagram, he explained he opted to leave to improve as a player. “After six years, three FA Cup wins and countless incredible memories, the time has come for me to move on from Arsenal,” he wrote. “I want to publicly thank Arsène, the coaching and club staff and my amazing team mates for all of the incredible opportunities I have been given. “Thank you so much to you, the fans, who have always had my back – I honestly couldn’t be more grateful. The club, and my time here, will always mean a massive amount to me. I know my choice might come as a surprise to many, and the decision to leave was tough after being a part of the club for so many years, but I feel this move is right for the next stage in my development.” Aaron Ramsey expressed sadness at Oxlade-Chamberlain’s departure. “Another of our British boys heading on to new things,” he wrote on Instagram. “Not only have we lost a great player we’ve lost a great guy in the changing room and It is sad to see you go mate.” Liverpool’s position on Philippe Coutinho did not change – namely he will not be sold to Barcelona – but there were several departures from Anfield on deadline day. Divock Origi joined Wolfsburg on a season-long loan that will cost the Bundesliga club a £6m arrangement fee. Wolfsburg will also pay the Belgium striker’s wages while he gets the first-team opportunities that Klopp had admitted may not have been available to him at Liverpool this season. The manager insists Origi does have a long-term future at Anfield, however, and the club refused to consider selling the 22-year-old to a Premier League rival. The defender Mamadou Sakho looked set to complete a permanent move to Crystal Palace for £26m. Liverpool also allowed 20-year-old Brazilian midfielder Allan Rodrigues de Souza to join Apollon Limassol, academy forward Tony Gomes to sign for League Two Forest Green Rovers and the winger Ryan Kent to go to Freiburg, all on season’s loans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/05/mitchell-and-webb-back-peep-show-we-mustnt-destroy-all-of-our-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T14:46:10Z","webTitle":"Mitchell and Webb: 'We mustn't destroy all of our comedy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/05/mitchell-and-webb-back-peep-show-we-mustnt-destroy-all-of-our-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/05/mitchell-and-webb-back-peep-show-we-mustnt-destroy-all-of-our-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Mitchell and Webb: 'We mustn't destroy all of our comedy'","bodyText":"Peep Show, with its agonising social encounters and undercurrent of despair, painted a bleak portrait of modern life. But according to stars David Mitchell and Robert Webb, it’s got nothing on what they’re working on now. The duo’s brand new sitcom Back, which starts tomorrow, is literally run through with “themes of death and meaninglessness”. Mitchell, bearded and distinguished when I meet the pair for lunch, explains: “A dead man haunts the whole series.” Part sitcom, part ghost story, Back follows grieving son Stephen (Mitchell) in the weeks after his father’s death as he deals with the suspiciously timed return of his foster brother Andrew (Webb). The ghost is Stephen’s father, Laurie (Matthew Holness with talcum powder in his hair), who Andrew remembers as a kindly man – and Stephen recalls as a miserable git. The show repeatedly flashes back to the boys’ early years, their younger selves played alternately by child actors and Mitchell and Webb themselves, a ploy that injects the adult versions with a pathos while also providing a background hum of mild childhood trauma. Back’s premise (in the first episode, nearly every joke is about death) might be grave, but Mitchell and Webb have no truck with the idea that TV comedy is getting weightier. “There’s always been a lot of darkness in British comedy, you can see it in Fawlty Towers and Dad’s Army,” says Mitchell. “Reginald Perrin is a show about a breakdown. All good sitcoms are about something serious. You can’t do a joke about funny things; you do a joke about serious things.” Set in the English countryside, Back draws on the kind of eccentric locals and claustrophobic social circles that have previously been parodied by the likes of the League of Gentlemen. It’s also the sort of place where the idea of “Britishness” constantly rears its head. Wary of making it “sound incredibly fucking dry”, Webb explains that the show uses the family business, a traditional country pub, to explore the British obsession with heritage. “As a country we ask ourselves a lot, ‘is this the real thing, am I having a real country cream tea or is this one for the tourists?’” Mitchell expands. “‘Is this a real pub or a chain pub? Is a chain pub real?’” Character-wise, Stephen is standard Mitchell fare: anal, seething, reluctantly moral. He’s prone to the sort of furiously logical diatribes that have characterised most of Mitchell’s comedy creations – and that feature heavily in the conversation of the man himself. When discussing the show, Back’s writer Simon Blackwell (whose credits include Veep, The Thick of It and Peep Show) described recreating the “David Mitchell rhythms” – the actor’s particular ranty cadence – which “cross all the things he’s done”. It’s likely the first thing you think of about Mitchell, yet, surprisingly, he claims not to know what Blackwell is talking about. “I had no idea he gave it that much thought,” he says, baffled. If Mitchell is the recognisable anchor, Webb’s Andrew is the unknown quantity. Fostered by Stephen’s parents for five months in the late 80s, he infiltrates and wins over the family with his purported business acumen and apparent geniality. But it’s unclear why he’s really come back, says Webb, explaining that sometimes he’d do two takes – as “Mr Evil and then Mr Nice Guy” – and leave it up to the creators to decide which to use. He also worked hard to distance himself from his best-known creation, “making sure that Jeremy from Peep Show’s petulance doesn’t seep through in a way I’m not in control of, because I’ve been playing this extremely aggressive and sarcastic character.” Back is the duo’s first post-Peep Show acting project, and will come as consolation to a nation still mourning the loss of the most relatably dysfunctional men in sitcom history. Judging by the amount of times Mitchell and Webb bring it up, they clearly need something to take the edge off too. And the fact that even they view Back through the prism of Peep Show is a reminder that everything they do is destined to be compared (probably unfavourably) with that beloved sitcom. But it’s also true that the prospects for new comedy in general aren’t exactly rosy. I mention Ben Elton’s recent BBC lecture on how new sitcoms are torn limb from limb by both critics and social media users in a matter of minutes. “There will be people live tweeting every joke as it happens,” says Webb in anticipation of the reaction to Back. “It’s this weird rapid response thing … at least get to the end of the first half an hour before you have a hot take.” “The reason we gun for comedy in the press and on social media is because fundamentally we care about it more than other genres,” says Mitchell. “But we mustn’t let the fact that as a culture we love comedy so much make us destroy all of our comedy.” It’s hard to tell if the decline in new comedy is a result of mean reviews, slashed budgets (“a comedy programme takes a huge amount of money to make and effort, [yet] the viewing figures are always far below what you get for a second-rate new cookery series” says Mitchell) or a wider shift in society. The duo began their comedy careers in the Cambridge Footlights and say that the added pressure students have now isn’t conducive to producing the comics of tomorrow. Huge fees, says Mitchell, mean “people think very differently about university; you don’t think of it as a place of exploration to find yourself – that seems an environment where the goodness that comes out of pissing around will be eradicated, except for people who are already wealthy.” Tellingly, it was hard to ignore the number of children of famous comedians, from Ruby Wax to Ian Hislop, who took shows to the Edinburgh fringe this year. Mitchell and Webb may be fixtures of the comedy firmament, but they still have that hypercritical public to contend with. How do they steel themselves for negativity? “I try and remind myself that to do a comedy show is a noble endeavour,” says Mitchell stoically. “And it doesn’t become ignoble if it doesn’t necessarily work.” Back starts on Channel 4 on 6 September at 10pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2017/aug/31/best-cheap-laptop-for-university","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-31T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"What’s the best cheap laptop for university?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/aug/31/best-cheap-laptop-for-university","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2017/aug/31/best-cheap-laptop-for-university","fields":{"headline":"What’s the best cheap laptop for university?","bodyText":"I read your article regarding which laptop to get for university this year: I’m one of those on my way there this September.

Portability, power and price Your choice will depend on whether you plan to carry your laptop to lectures. If you plan to leave it in your room, you can buy a mainstream laptop with a 15.6in screen. It won’t be light or have good battery life, but neither will matter. If you plan to tote it around, those things matter a lot. The problem with ultraportables is that they’re generally either cheap and slow or fast and expensive. Fast processors cost more, use more power, and generate more heat. If you need a laptop that is both portable and powerful then you may have to spend around £750 to £1,500. If you want to spend less, then you will either have to sacrifice power or portability, or find a compromise that provides a bit of both. Either way, try to visit a store where you can look at the machines mentioned below, and shop around for prices. Target specs Students on history and general arts courses don’t usually need powerful laptops, unless they edit videos, so you have a number of cheap and cheerful options. However, I strongly recommend against buying an entry-level laptop with only 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage. These are fine for casual use, but modern browsers can easily consume 2GB. It’s also going to become increasingly difficult to update Windows 10 on a 32GB drive. Your minimum target specification should therefore include 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage; more is better. Cheap laptops use 32GB and 64GB eMMC chips as drives. These chips are similar to SD cards. They’re not as fast as solid-state disk drives (SSDs), which nowadays usually store 128GB to 512GB. Laptop processors range from cheap but slow Intel Atom and AMD chips to fast but pricey Intel Core i7 processors. You can compare their performance using Passmark benchmark scores or Notebookcheck’s Comparison of Mobile Processors. You don’t have to swot up on the tests, just get something as high up the table as you can afford. For speed on a budget, you’d usually choose the latest Core i3-7100U or the very similar i3-6100U. However, cheaper laptops usually have Intel Atom processors, or Celeron- or Pentium-branded chips that are usually, but not always, Atom designs. The Pentium 4415U, released earlier this year, seems to offer good performance for less money than the i3-7100U. The 4415U has a Passmark score of 3192, which is much closer to the i3-7100U (3882) than to the Atom x5-Z8350 (1063). Otherwise, pick a Pentium over a Celeron, and avoid the very slow Celeron N3060 (Passmark 987). The N3160 (Passmark 1702) is OK. Cheap detachables For your purposes, today’s bargain basement portable is the 10.1in Linx 10V64. It has a quad-core Atom x5-Z8350 processor with 4GB of memory and 64GB of eMMC storage. Like the original Microsoft Surface, it’s basically a Windows 10 tablet with a thin, detachable keyboard that doubles as a screen cover. It’s great value at £229.99 from Argos. The keyboard isn’t as good as a Microsoft Type cover but at least it’s better than the one Microsoft shipped originally. The Linx also has a full-size USB port so you can use an accessory keyboard while keeping it plugged into the mains via a phone/tablet-style micro-USB charging cable. I have one on loan and it feels quite durable – the back is metal, and the front is glass – and it’s hard to grumble at the price. At 974g, it’s certainly portable. The Linx 10V64’s main limitations are the 1280 x 800-pixel touchscreen and the relatively slow Atom processor, but these are shared by rivals such as the Asus Transformer Mini T102 and the HP x2 210. The Asus T102 is somewhat nicer and lighter, but it’s much more expensive at £329.99. The 4GB/64GB version of the HP x2 210 is even more overpriced at £385.60. However, I think the best value of this class of machine is the Lenovo Miix 310, which is available with a three-year guarantee from John Lewis for £269.99. It has a much better keyboard than the Linx or even the Asus T102. Convertibles Many laptops now have 360-degree hinges so they work in a variety of modes: as conventional laptops, as tablets, and in a “tent mode”. I think this is your best choice in providing touch in a laptop that is light enough to carry around. The 11.6in Lenovo Yoga 310 (80U2003AUK) is a good choice in this class of machine. It has a quad-core Intel Pentium N4200 processor (Passmark 2022), 4GB of memory and a 128GB SSD for £429.95. There’s also a better version, the Lenovo Yoga 710 (80V6001PUK), which has a Core M3-7Y30 (Passmark 3641) for £499.95. This is pretty much what I use myself, except my old Yoga 700 is orange, has 8GB of RAM and weighs 1.2kg not 1.35kg. The HP Pavilion x360 11 is an alternative. You can get one with an 11.6in touch screen, quad-core Intel Pentium N3710 processor (Passmark 1890), 4GB of memory and a 1TB hard drive for £449.95 from John Lewis, or for £379 from Tesco Direct. However, the Yogas have better keyboards and screens, and an SSD is more responsive than an HD. Moving up to 14in screens Laptops with 14in screens are heavier and not as portable as machines with 11.6in screens, but they are also easier to cool. If you compromise on portability you can get a fast laptop for a very reasonable price. For example, the Lenovo Ideapad 320S is a step up in quality from the popular but slow Ideapad 110S (£249.99), and you can get a Pentium 4415U (Passmark 3192), 4GB of memory and a 128GB SSD for £349. The drawbacks are that it doesn’t have a touch screen, and it’s relatively heavy at 1.7kg (3.75lbs). For comparison, the 13.3in MacBook Air weighs 1.35kg (2.96lbs). You can also get a get a Pentium 4415U in a 14in touch-screen HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba094sa) for £479.99, or in a Lenovo Yoga 520 for £499.99, among others. The HP weighs 1.63kg while the Lenovo weighs 1.7kg. There are also 14in laptops with faster Core i3-7100U processors (Passmark 3885) within your price range. Examples include the 1.7kg Lenovo Ideapad 320S for £399, the 1.6kg Asus VivoBook X405 for £429.99, and the 1.7kg Lenovo Yoga 520. All three have 4GB of memory and 128GB SSDs. From the 14in laptops mentioned, the £349 Lenovo 320S is good value and should do everything you need. However, I still like the 2016 Acer Swift 3, which I mentioned in my previous answer. Argos is currently offering the 1.5kg aluminium Swift 3 with a 14in 1920 x 1080-pixel screen, Core i5-7200U processor (Passmark 4723), 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD for £539.99. It’s overkill for a student historian, but it’s still a bargain. Have you got a question?

When agreeing future deals, he said, train companies would be told they “can’t start segregating”, and some reduction in first-class provision may be required of whoever wins the Southeastern franchise next year. Grayling’s remark bothered me – it seemed I was being outflanked in egalitarianism by a Tory. But then, I have always had a neurosis about railway class, owing to my father having been a fairly senior British Rail employee. As long as I was a dependent of his, I had a privilege ticket permitting free first-class travel – and by contriving to remain in full-time education, I’m proud to say I managed to remain a dependent until I was 26. Through much of the 1970s and 80s, I savoured first class in various reprehensible ways. Sometimes I wore a tie and a tweed jacket, affecting to be as prosperous as my travelling companions. At other times, I would go for iconoclasm: sprawling on a first-class seat in jeans and trainers, reading the NME and eating crisps, I would try to provoke pin-striped business types into saying: “Excuse me, young man. Are you aware this is a first-class carriage?” “Yep,” I’d say, cracking open a can of beer. These days, I am usually to be found skulking in second – exiled, as it were, from my inheritance – and feeling resentful. Unless, of course, no second class is available – as on the Underground, say, or when using Chiltern Trains, a company that has voluntarily adopted a one-class system. They have no word for this class: “It’s just who we are,” the press officer blithely told me. Apparently their customers are forever tweeting about how they thought they’d blundered into first, only to realise with delight that one size fits all. My own Chiltern experiences have been pleasant, and I don’t hanker after a first-class seat on their trains – nor, for that matter, when flying with classless Easyjet. In fact, I positively disapprove of those who try to be fractionally one-up by paying extra for “speedy boarding”. Once, my wife purchased this for us – not out of snobbery, but because we really were in a hurry. Even so, I was mortified when, as I returned to the departure gate from the gents, she called out from the front of the queue: “Andrew, we’ve got speedy boarding! It’s fine to push in!” The resentment of those who pay for privileged travel is greatest, as minister Grayling knows, on Britain’s railway commuter lines. The vaunted doubling of passenger numbers in the past 20 years is down to an increase in big city commuting, undertaken on crowded trains in circumstances of the utmost misery. The sight of people lounging in first is enough to bring out the Marxist in any passenger enduring the scrimmage of standard. At less crowded times, the sight of first-class passengers might be even more provoking, because there is usually very little difference between first and second on short-hop trains, beyond the antimacassars and the colour scheme. First class usually has warmer colours compared to the default washed-out blue of standard, raising the suspicion that standard class has been deliberately uglified. (In France, the designer Christian Lacroix challenged this convention – and reputedly irritated SNCF – when his 2005 design for the refurbishment of some TGV trains involved a greyish blue for first, and warm purples and oranges for standard.) So is Grayling, for once, striking a genuinely progressive note? In fact, it would be more accurate to say he has fallen in line with conventional wisdom about railway class. For 150 years, the trend has been towards a railway egalitarianism – which represents a long, slow correction of an early dash in the opposite direction. Originally, Britain’s trains were the class system on wheels. There were basically three classes, and third was usually open air, which some people who could afford second or first favoured in pleasant weather, like drivers of open-topped sports cars. In 1872, the canny Midland Railway – always looking for a customer service angle, since it had come late to the Anglo-Scottish market – abolished second, offering a more luxurious, but still cheap, third. Other companies followed suit, with the three classes tending to linger in the snobbish south, but second was mainly gone by 1930. In 1940, when we were all supposed to be pulling together for the war effort, class distinctions were removed on trains operating within the old London Passenger Transport Area, and this enlightened, single-class regime still applies to some short London commuter lines. In the mid-1950s, first and third became first and second to make the gulf seem smaller. In 1987, second became “standard” for the same reason. Yet despite this gradual attempt to eradicate class snobbery from British trains, it would be hypocritical of me to suggest the logical and right outcome is completely classless rolling stock. Despite that Victoria ticket clerk’s protestation, I went ahead with my first-class purchase to Brighton, and found myself separated from some raucous women on a hen party by nothing more than a Perspex screen. It didn’t keep out the noise, but it did keep them out. At Clapham Junction, however, another hen party got on and some of them sprawled into first, not realising. I was agonising about whether to speak up when they clocked the antimacassars and decamped into standard. I was reminded of the time I’d been in first class travelling from York to London, when the train in front broke down. At Doncaster, a few hundred new people boarded our train, with carte blanche to take any available seat, including those in first. The man who’d been sitting next to me since York called the guard over and said, “I assume I’ll be entitled to a full refund?” The guard asked why, and he said, “Because I’ve paid to be with first-class passengers, and all these people are standard-class ticket holders.” The guard pointed out that he was still entitled to unlimited free coffee, which the new arrivals would not be – although this was an academic point since the water boiler had packed up. I can’t remember the upshot, but I think the complainant was onto a loser, possibly because of a legal case of 1918: Jones vs Great Northern Railway, in which the plaintiff was denied compensation for a “second class irruption”. I suppose my neighbour at Doncaster might have paid top price for his first-class ticket, and the difference between a “walk on” first-class fare and an equivalent standard-class fare is higher in Britain than in most of Europe (it can be twice as much). But one benefit of our over-complicated ticketing system is that first class can be accessed by the back door: by the purchase of advance and off-peak tickets, or “weekend first” upgrades. All these tickets are growing increasingly popular. Barry Doe, who writes a column about train fares for Rail magazine, says he quite often takes first class from Bournemouth to London: “And some of my fellow travellers are students. They’ve seen they can get a standard-class advance fare for £15, and first class for just a pound more.” You might call this Tory paternalism: offering people a chance to enter the privileged fold on a conditional basis. Doe believes the solution to our over-crowding problem is longer trains, not the abolition of first. “First-class tickets are unregulated,” he says, “so if first is under-used, the company should just reduce the prices.” To his mind, first class helps trains compete with cars: “Today, even the most bog-standard car has comfortable seats and air conditioning as standard, whereas modern trains are not much more than boxes on wheels.” The open design of modern train carriages is another factor: whereas in the days of compartments, only six or eight people had to behave considerately for the journey to be enjoyable, now 80 people have to behave considerately – and they usually don’t. Today, everybody on a train is trying to pretend they’re not on a train by doing their own thing, and this is usually noisy – be it sending or receiving pinging text messages, shouting into a phone, watching a film, or listening to music through leaky earphones. It is undeniably the case, however, that there is less cacophony in first class. Yes, one may have to contend with triumphalist executives showing off about how busy they are – but the sounds of work are still, on the whole, less irritating than the sounds of leisure. Above all, there’s a drastic shortage of glamour on British trains, which are cheaply made and – compared to those in Europe – narrow and low-bodied. And there is still a hunger for railway glamour, as suggested by the recent excitement over the announcement that the sleeping berths on the new Caledonian Sleeper carriages will have double beds and en suite bathrooms. Dining cars used to provide a touch of romance. In 1997 there were 250 of them on British trains, and they were open to all passengers. I once heard a donnish radio discussion, hosted by Robert Robinson, about whether it was unethical to buy a second-class ticket and then spend the whole journey in the dining car, which was effectively first-class accommodation. As I recall, the conclusion was typically Robinsonian in its refinement: he absolved himself of the need to buy a first-class ticket for the dining car, the guilt caused by not having done so being sufficient penance. The only surviving proper diners are on Great Western. The last time I was on one of their trains, the steward speaking over the tannoy offered the inducement that this was a “first-class experience”. Well, the truth is, I do need first-class experiences – ideally in first class – every so often. Because without them, I might easily forget why I ever liked trains in the first place.

I had spent the morning visiting gardens in search of grass snakes, nosing around compost heaps and scanning the edges of ponds without luck. Reptiles known to inhabit one glorious wildlife-friendly property on the edge of Buckfastleigh had kept out of sight, while nearby locations offered up handsome slow worms, but not the secretive species I was after. The Little Bradley Ponds reserve is a haven for dragonflies and damselflies, and in the midday sunshine the air above the lily-fringed stretches of open water was stitched with needles of colour. I spotted roach basking in the shallows, and regular splashes from a shady corner alerted me to a kingfisher. This Devon Wildlife Trust site provides perfect habitat for grass snakes, which live along woodland edges and in rough grassland, hunting pond-dwelling amphibians and laying their eggs in heaps of rotting vegetation. Our grass snakes have recently made news headlines after detailed DNA research concluded that those in Britain and western Europe differ sufficiently from related subspecies living east of the Rhine to warrant full species status. The study findings do not mean we gain a species, however, experts insist. They are simply proposing a new classification for our naturally occurring grass snake: a promotion from the subspecies Natrix natrix helvetica to Natrix helvetica. Other varieties of grass snake found in Britain are non-native introductions. Taxonomy tussles aside, spotting any grass snake can be far from easy, and I circled the ponds several times, scanning path-side undergrowth, before cutting up through an area of grass and heather, where a shape caught my eye. A small coil, like a polished tree root, motionless amid tangled foliage in a sheltered patch of sunlight. The spiral unwound at my footfall, head rising to reveal the distinctive black-and-yellow collar of a grass snake and eyes that were smoky-blue, a sign that it would soon shed its skin. In an instant it darted away, tapering length disappearing between grass stems. A brief glimpse, but enough to tempt me back another day.

The decision to nullify the result, a first in Kenya, sets up a new race for the presidency between Kenyatta and the veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga. Analysts said it marked a watershed in the east African nation and set a unique precedent for the continent. Kenyatta accepted the court decision on Friday afternoon, calling for “peace, peace, peace” in a televised address. The six-judge bench ruled 4-2 in favour of a petition filed by Odinga, who claimed the electronic voting results were hacked and manipulated in favour of the incumbent. Kenyatta was declared the election winner with 54% of the vote. The judges said: “[The election commission] failed, neglected or refused to conduct the presidential election in a manner consistent with the dictates of the constitution.” They did not place blame on Kenyatta or his party. Kenyatta said he regretted that “six people have decided they will go against the will of the people” but he would not dispute the judgment. “The court has made its decision. We respect it. We don’t agree with it. And again, I say peace … peace, peace, peace. That is the nature of democracy.” The judgment prompted scenes of jubilation among opposition supporters across Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. In the narrow streets of Kibera, an overcrowded shantytown that has long been a stronghold of Odinga and his National Super Alliance (Nasa) coalition, crowds of people blew whistles, shouted, wept and sang. The decision surprised many in Kenya, where courts have long been subservient to the president. “In the whole world, all eyes were on this supreme court and the judge did the right thing,” said 36-year-old Frederick Oyieng, a nightwatchman. Donna Abongo, 39, an accountancy student, said: “It was a surprise because the trend in justice in Kenya is not good, but this time justice has been done.” Residents in the western city of Kisumu, where Odinga has strong backing, cheered and motorcycle drivers hooted their horns. Odinga said the court had set an “exceptional example for all of Africa”. “Our judiciary now knows they have the power,” he said. “We thank the supreme court for standing up for the truth.” Some observers worried that the decision could lead to political chaos. Kenya, east Africa’s biggest economy, has a history of disputed elections and political violence. But others welcomed a demonstration of the strength of local institutions. “It is a watershed judgment by a court. There is no precedent anywhere in Africa. There is nothing like it,” said Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, in London. “It’s good news for Kenya. Where you have strengthening institutions you get a better result.” The Kenyan heads of mission from two dozen countries, including the UK and US, issued a joint statement saying the court’s decision “demonstrated Kenya’s resilient democracy and commitment to rule of law”. The hearing followed a petition filed by Odinga after his defeat last month. Opposition officials repeatedly described the results as a fraud and claimed that Odinga was the legitimate winner. Odinga has contested, and lost, the last three elections. His claims of vote rigging in the 2007 elections prompted rioting and retaliation by security forces, tipping the country into its worst crisis for decades. About 1,200 people were killed in the ethnic violence that followed. In 2013, Odinga said the election was rigged and took his case to the supreme court, but lost. This time his team focused on proving that the process for tallying and transmitting results was flawed, rather than proving how much of the vote was rigged. Only days after the election on 8 August, Odinga, 72, vowed to remove the government of Kenyatta. Election observers and western officials had called on Odinga to accept defeat, and said they had found no evidence of “centralised manipulation”. The court said the electoral commission committed “illegalities and irregularities” in the election. The commission chairman urged the court to quickly release its full ruling with the details. That ruling is expected within 21 days. Odinga was fiercely critical of the electoral commission. “There are more fundamental decisions to made in the days ahead, including who will conduct the next elections,” he said. “It is now clear that the entire IEBC [electoral commission] is rotten. “It is clear that the real election results were never shared with Kenyans. Someone must take responsibility.” Human rights groups have said police killed at least 28 people in unrest that followed the original vote, and Kenya is braced for further protests over the weekend. Police were deployed to sensitive areas of Nairobi. Concerns were raised before the election when the official who oversaw the electronic voting system was found tortured and killed days before the vote. The electoral commission has said there was a failed attempt to hack the system as votes were being counted and compiled. Observers saw last month’s election as the final act of a dynastic rivalry between the families of Kenyatta, 55, and Odinga that has lasted more than half a century. The candidates’ fathers, Jomo Kenyatta and Jaramogi Odinga, had been allies in the struggle for independence from Britain but later became bitter rivals. Kenyatta is from the Kikuyu, Kenya’s largest ethnic community, and Odinga from the Luo, which has long felt marginalised. Both men built coalitions with other influential communities in a country where voting still takes place largely along ethnic lines. Many voters in the west of Kenya, Odinga’s stronghold, and along the coast, where there is also traditionally large support for the opposition, feel neglected by the central government and shut out of power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/01/mumbai-residents-count-cost-rain-floods","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T11:24:47Z","webTitle":"'Not a single thing was dry': Mumbai's residents count the cost of floods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/mumbai-residents-count-cost-rain-floods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/01/mumbai-residents-count-cost-rain-floods","fields":{"headline":"'Not a single thing was dry': Mumbai's residents count the cost of floods","bodyText":"As torrential rain pounded Mumbai this week, Radha Rajput was where she always is: on the pavement between railway tracks and a main road. The streets of India’s financial capital are her home and have been for the past 50 years. She and her son, his wife and their one-year-old twins have endured the challenges of seasonal rain and scorching summer heat for decades, but this downpour was a fresh nightmare. “We have been sitting and sleeping on these steps, because they are a bit higher up, for days now,” said Rajput, as her daughter sat behind her picking lice out of her hair. “We can’t cook, there is no clean drinking water. The water was up to our waist. Not a single thing was dry. The rich are OK, but we’re out here with nothing.” Devastating rainfall across South Asia has led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and directly affected more than 40 million people in northern India, southern Nepal, northern Bangladesh and southern Pakistan. About 60% of Mumbai’s 20 million residents live in slums, which gives the city its nickname “Slumbai”. The 2011 Indian census put the number of homeless people in Mumbai at just over 57,000, but local activists say it is more like 150,000-300,000. As the flood waters began to ebb on Friday, the impact of the disaster on rich and poor people alike was beginning to emerge. Rescuers worked overnight to pull 12 survivors from the rubble of a building that collapsed on Thursday in the densely populated area of Bhendi Bazaar, killing 34 people. The 117-year-old, six-storey building had been declared unsafe by the housing regulator in 2011, but many people continued living there. A 20-day-old baby was reported to be among the dead. Dr Deepak Amarapurkar, 59, a senior gastroenterologist at Bombay hospital, was also among the victims of the extreme weather. He had decided to walk the 10-minute journey through the flooded roads on Tuesday to his home, despite his colleagues advising him to wait until the waters had receded. On the way, he fell into an open manhole. Onlookers tried to pull him out, but were only able to retrieve his umbrella. Locals said they had removed the manhole lid to help the water level go down. His body later washed up on the shore at Worli, nearly 2.5 miles (4km) away. With little government help available, some stranded Mumbaiites turned to social media to connect with people willing to put them up for the night. Mehul Ved, a software professional, created a spreadsheet listing those offering assistance. By Thursday, it contained the names of 6,500 people prepared to help strangers with food, shelter and a change of clothes. But for those living on the streets, there were no offers of shelter, said Brijesh Arya, the founder of Pehchan, an organisation that supports Mumbai’s homeless families. He said the community kitchens, government help, and shelter provided by churches, temples and some shopkeepers, were reserved for better-off residents. “The homeless got nothing,” said Arya. “They stayed in the same wet clothes for days. The rains have devastated this vulnerable community. I can’t forget the words of one woman who said to me ‘Just bring me poison will you, I want to die,’ because she couldn’t cope.” That woman was Savita Kharve, 45, who was born on the streets of Mumbai and lives with her family on the pavement near Mumbai Central railway station. When Arya visited her, he found “horrible” conditions. “No one was eating. The kids are now all sick with runny noses and coughs,” he said. The Kharves were huddled together under plastic tarpaulin sheets, strengthened with sticks of bamboo, as makeshift protection from the monsoon rain. Gathered around them were survival essentials: a cooking stove, old clothes, second-hand toys and piles of flowers they continued to prepare to sell as soon as the rain subsided. In a video recorded on Wednesday in the middle of a storm, Kharve told Arya that she and her children had not eaten since the flooding began. With knee-high water, there was nowhere for them to squat and chop vegetables or put down a cooking stove. Most of the homeless families are daily-wage workers who buy food each day, a task that became impossible during the storm. “The children went hungry,” said Kharve. “Look around you, there is nothing but water, but who cares about us?

The closely watched Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed activity jumped to 56.9 last month from 55.3 in July, the second-highest level in more than three years, helped by the weak value of the pound. That confounded forecasts for a modest slowdown to 55.0 in a Reuters poll of economists and was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The weak pound, having plunged after the Brexit vote, was reported to have increased competitiveness for British products. The domestic market, however, was the prime source of contract wins for the manufacturing sector, despite robust demand from mainland Europe, the US, China and Australia. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers’ organisation EEF, said: “UK manufacturers are looking beyond the Brexit negotiations to strengthening market opportunities in Europe and beyond, with the acceleration in manufacturing activity in August helping to provide some welcome offset to sluggish consumer demand at home.” The jump in production was underpinned by faster intakes of new work, which filtered through to the labour market as the number of jobs grew for the 13th straight month. However, almost 31% of companies said they experienced an increase in the price of materials required for their operations, generally linked to the rising cost of commodities. Despite the strong performance in August, there may be trouble brewing. The survey of more than 600 industrial companies found higher raw materials and staff shortages could lie ahead, which would hit the pace of production in future and lead to higher costs. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: “At the moment, the survey data suggests the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support ongoing growth in the economy in the third quarter.” The survey provides a snapshot of the UK economy before official figures are released later in the year, meaning the expectations for faster growth may fail to materialise. Manufacturing contracted by 0.6% in the three months to June, despite the PMI data pointing to an expansion of about 0.5%, according to Andrew Wishart, an assistant economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The survey results “add weight to our view that the sector will put a disappointing first half to the year behind it”, he said. “We expect the manufacturing sector to help overall GDP growth to accelerate in the second half of 2017.” The upbeat survey could give credence to policymakers calling for the Bank of England to raise interest rates to offset higher inflation, arguing the economy is now strong enough to handle tighter monetary conditions. Michael Saunders, one of the two dissenting Bank of England rate-setters to vote for a rise last month, made another call for an increase in a speech in Cardiff on Thursday. The manufacturing figures reflect activity in a sector that contributes about 10% to GDP, although uncertainties remain in other areas. Consumer spending is under pressure as higher prices and weaker wage growth squeeze their purchasing power. Caution has been recorded among businesses considering investments in the British economy amid political and Brexit uncertainties. The improved picture for manufacturers was also mirrored in Europe, even though a steep climb for the euro has eroded competitiveness on the continent. Production in the eurozone accelerated in August, as manufacturers recorded the fastest rise in export orders since February 2011, according to separate figures on Friday. IHS Markit’s manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to 57.4 in August, up from 56.6 in July. Those levels of productivity should indicate “solid support” for the eurozone in the third quarter, according to Claus Vistesen at research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. The stronger picture on the continent could encourage the European Central Bank to begin cutting its €2.3tn (£2.11tn) bond buying programme. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, could take such steps at a key meeting later this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/02/comedy-playhouse-tim-vine-travels-in-time-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-02T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Comedy Playhouse: Tim Vine Travels in Time review – pun pandemic has us choking on gags","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/02/comedy-playhouse-tim-vine-travels-in-time-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/02/comedy-playhouse-tim-vine-travels-in-time-review","fields":{"headline":"Comedy Playhouse: Tim Vine Travels in Time review – pun pandemic has us choking on gags","bodyText":"Tim Vine – comic, singer, actor, punster – is in his antiques shop. “Oh look, a small blue garden bird made of mahogany,” he says, picking up just such an object. “Be great if I had a related joke … wouldn’t it?” Wooden tit, see? Quite good. And so Comedy Playhouse: Tim Vine Travels in Time (BBC1) continues. An unusual hanging timepiece shaped like a footballer is a Theo Wallclock. A joke about a door has a lot hinging on it. There are meandering maltesers, which are a bit like wandering minstrels. He doesn’t see his friend Lance a lot any more … Tim has his double-barrel pun gun out and he’s on a spree, spraying them about at will. Now I enjoy a good groan as much as anyone else, but the sheer scale of the punnery here is overwhelming. Shoot me Tim; it would be a relief.

Gavage, I believe it’s called, and I’m gagging on gags … and now it’s catching. At least the programme is self-aware, seemingly expecting groans as often as laughs. There’s an element of self-deprecation, too. “Honestly, who wrote this?” Tim says. And “I hope I’m doing the right thing: it was either this or The Jump.” (“What was wrong with The Jump?” yells the world.) There is a kind of Bill and Ted premise – Tim’s excellent adventure.

The image showed the Hinckley Cycle Racing Club from Leicestershire, which was showcased in Cycling Weekly magazine’s regular “We ride with …” feature, in which a writer goes on a club ride. The caption was noticed by one of the club’s members, who posted on Twitter: “So my cycling club made it into @cyclingweekly and this happened. I hope @cyclingweekly apologise. Still a lot of equality work to do it.” Within a few hours, the magazine’s editor had issued a full apology, blaming a subeditor for adding the draft caption, which was not spotted by colleagues before the publication went to press. Simon Richardson said: “This appalling lack of judgment by an individual is just that, and not a reflection of the culture in the CW office.” He said the caption was “neither funny nor representative of the way we feel or approach our work”. Sarah Connolly, who commentates on women’s cycle racing, welcomed the apology but questioned Richardson’s claim that it did not indicate a culture of sexism at the magazine. “It’s good he describes it as ‘idiotic’, still bad about what it says re CW culture,” she wrote on Twitter. Sexism in cycling is a long-standing issue. In 2015, the Italian bikemaker Colnago apologised after tweeting a picture of a woman on one of its bikes, her bottom to the camera, with the caption: “Ready for the weekend ride?” In 2013, the future world champion Peter Sagan had to apologise after pinching the bottom of one of the “podium girls” when he was at the Tour of Flanders. Maja Leye, 25, who was planting the traditional kiss on the cheek of the winner, Fabian Cancellara, when Sagan touched her, told Het Nieuwsblad: “Suddenly, I felt this hand. I hadn’t seen it coming because I had my back to him. I understood quickly what had happened. I was frozen to the spot.” Podium girls are as divisive in cycling as the introduction of disc brakes. Some consider the sight of women in tight dresses kissing the cheeks of the winner as an anachronism, while others see them as a harmless tradition. This year, the organisers of the Vuelta a España decided to replace them with “elegantly dressed men and women”, following the lead of the Tour Down Under in Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/01/harvey-aid-white-house-congress-emergency-package","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T07:44:51Z","webTitle":"Harvey aid: White House to ask Congress for initial $5.9bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/01/harvey-aid-white-house-congress-emergency-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/01/harvey-aid-white-house-congress-emergency-package","fields":{"headline":"Harvey aid: White House to ask Congress for initial $5.9bn","bodyText":"The White House has prepared a request to Congress for an emergency $5.9bn (£4.6bn) package in Harvey recovery aid, as flood waters receded in Houston to reveal swaths of devastation wrought by the former hurricane. It is expected to be followed by further requests that could exceed the $110bn to victims of 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. Rescuers continued plucking people from flood waters across Texas as the death toll rose to 44 almost a week after the storm slammed into the Gulf of Mexico coast. Emergency crews and volunteers in boats, trucks and aircraft scoured inundated suburbs around Houston and cities to the east for people still in need of evacuation. Police rescued 18 people from flood waters overnight, said Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner. “Crisis ebbing but far from over.” In dryer areas recovery crews started to assess damage and remove debris. They braced for the discovery of bodies. Harvey, once a category 4 hurricane, was downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over north-eastern Louisiana and into Mississippi. The emergency aid plan will be sent to Congress on Friday with House and Senate votes likely next week. The White House homeland security adviser said the initial aid money would be a down payment for immediate recovery efforts, to be followed by larger packages later. “We’ll go up to Congress and give them a sound supplemental request number. We’ll add to it,” Tom Bossert said. “And when we can get a better handle on the damage we can come back with a responsible last, so to speak, supplemental request.” Donald Trump has also pledged to donate $1m in personal funds to the relief effort. Fires and two explosions early on Thursday at a chemical plant in Crosby, north-east of Houston, have jolted residents to the presence of new dangers as waters recede. The plant, which makes organic peroxides used in plastic resins and paint, lost refrigeration due to the storm. An executive warned that eight more tanks could burn and explode. Contradictory messages from officials left people unsure if emissions were toxic. The Texas department of public safety said 48,700 homes had sustained flood damage, including 17,000 with heavy damage and 1,000 that were destroyed. The storm has forced 32,000 people into shelters and was the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in half a century. Officials ordered mandatory evacuation of some communities near the Barker and Addicks reservoirs, which continued to discharge water. But much of Houston was dry and baked under a blazing sun. The heat aggravated the stench from stagnant waters and flood-damaged properties. “Man, oh-ooh, that is foul,” said a shirtless man on Discovery Green, a park beside a convention centre which is sheltering 8,000 people. The city’s health department urged residents to take precautions to minimise the risk of contamination and diseases such as cholera and typhoid. “Practice good hygiene such as hand washing after any contact with #Harvey floodwaters,” it tweeted. “Do not eat any food that came in contact with #Harvey floodwaters. When in doubt, throw it out.” Regular trash collection was due to resume on Thursday. Airports have resumed a limited service. Despite the havoc of recent days, Houston remained calm. “No city curfew citations or arrests for a second night in a row. Thank you Houston for your understanding and cooperation,” tweeted the mayor. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said she was uncertain whether Trump’s donation would come from the president directly or his private foundation, which has been a source of controversy. She called on the media to help decide which specific group or organisation he should give to. “He’d love some suggestions from the folks here and I’d be happy to take those if any of you have them,” she told reporters in the briefing room. “But as I said, he’ll pledge proudly a million dollars of his own personal money to help the people of both Texas and Louisiana.” Trump and his wife, Melania, will travel back to Texas and to Louisiana on Saturday, Sanders added. The tentative plan includes the Houston area in Texas and possibly Lake Charles, Louisiana, but this may change depending on conditions. The president visited Corpus Christi and Austin on Tuesday. Bossert claimed “coordination is happening better than any storm we’ve seen before” and noted that 28 search and rescue teams and taskforces from 16 states had been sent to Texas. “In fact, I believe that that’s the first time we’ve activated all the taskforces since 9/11, so this is an all-hands-on-deck operation.” The adviser said undocumented immigrants seeking government help should not be worried about their immigration status “unless they’ve committed a crime on top of coming here illegally”. No one would be denied help based on their legal status and shelters would not be subjected to inspections. Asked about explosions at the Arkema chemical plant near Crosby, he said the situation was not a public health hazard in the sense that people around the facility had already been evacuated. “If they were there, it would be dangerous and they have to keep an eye on it and take it seriously, but for right now the people don’t seem to be there, so a tree falling in the woods, if you will.” But further deaths in Texas were likely in the coming days, Bossert warned. “In the immediate response and recovery phase, people will use chainsaws, people will remove debris, people will be stressed … so unfortunately, we will see additional losses of life, if history is any precedent here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/sep/01/investors-await-key-us-jobs-report-for-clues-on-next-rate-move-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T13:55:54Z","webTitle":"US jobs report disappoints as UK manufacturing hits four-month high - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/01/investors-await-key-us-jobs-report-for-clues-on-next-rate-move-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/sep/01/investors-await-key-us-jobs-report-for-clues-on-next-rate-move-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US jobs report disappoints as UK manufacturing hits four-month high - as it happened","bodyText":"Production at US factories in August grew at the weakest rate since June 2016 according to the latest manufacturing PMI report from IHS Markit. The headline index slipped to 52.8 in August, from 53.3 in July (where anything above 50 signals growth). Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: Although still above the 50 ‘no change’ level, the decline in the PMI shows signs of a renewed stuttering of the manufacturing economy during August. The latest reading indicates one of the weakest improvements in the overall health of the sector seen over the past year, and translates into disappointing signals for comparable official data. The survey brings more encouraging signs of improved domestic demand, however, with orders for both consumer goods and investment goods such as plant and machinery on the rise, boding well for the wider economy to continue to expand as we move through the second half of 2017. And on that note, we’ll close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM The opening bell has been rung on Wall Street and here is how it looks: Dow Jones: +0.2% at 21,984 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,476 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 6,444 European markets have also stayed in positive territory, although the FTSE 100 is now up just 7 points or 0.1% at 7,437. The dollar has broadly recovered after a sharp fall immediately after the weak non-farm payrolls report was published. The dollar index is down just 0.1% now, but the pound has held on to its gains against the US currency at $1.2987. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital: The US dollar was driven down and then snapped back to trade almost flat after a weaker-than-expected jobs report left traders searching for direction. Although a miss it looks like this print isn’t doing anything to alter projections for what the Federal Reserve will do later this month or for the rest of the year. The labour market remains in fine health, wage growth is AWOL and inflation lacklustre – nothing has changed today. One swallow doesn’t make a summer and one August jobs miss doesn’t make for a weakening labour market. Markets have already decided the Fed probably won’t hike again this year. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, takes the view that the weak jobs report will make the Fed more reluctant to raise interest rates again before the end of the year. If Federal Reserve policy makers were already starting to question the need for another rate hike this year – and the pace thereafter – then this week’s data won’t have made them feel any more comfortable. Anyone hoping for a signal this month that the Fed is on track for another rate hike this year may well be disappointed. The downward revision to July’s non-farm payrolls number was the icing on the cake. It’s worth noting that while the numbers are disappointing, the labor market is still performing very well, but when inflation data is lacking, the Fed is relying on the employment data to justify more rate hikes. The jobs report will be seen as a blow to Fed chances of another rate hike this year, as well as to Donald Trump who I’m sure would have loved nothing more than a reason to post something positive on Twitter. I feel this month’s report may not make the Twitter cut. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says that while the non-farm payrolls report was gloomy, it wasn’t bad enough to have an impact on the Fed’s rate decisions. August’s employment report was disappointing across the board but, given the potential seasonal problems – with weak initial readings in August subsequently revised higher in previous years – it isn’t going to have any meaningful impact on the Fed. With the survey evidence still strong and third-quarter economic growth on course for another decent gain after the second, there is no reason to believe that the modest drop-off in employment growth is the start of a more serious downturn. Nevertheless, since the September figures could be affected by Hurricane Harvey, the Fed might be waiting until the October data are released in early November before confirming that the labour market remains in good health. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of other major currencies, is down 0.5% following the weak payrolls report from the Labor Department. The dollar’s loss is the pound’s gain, with sterling now up 0.4% at $1.2986. The detail of the non-farm payrolls report showed a surprise uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in August, from 4.3% in July. Earnings growth was unchanged at 2.5%, disappointing expectations of a pick-up to 2.6%. Breaking: US non-farm payrolls have come in well below expectations, with 156,000 jobs added in August. The consensus among economists was 180,000 jobs. The number for July was also revised down to 189,000 from 209,000 previously. More soon... Over in Greece, the government said the economy is finally moving on from the crisis, after a second consecutive quarter of growth between April and June. A statement released by the office of prime minister Alexis Tsipras said: Without any doubt the Greek economy has turned a page. We are continuing our efforts for just growth, one in which workers ate protected, and building a new productive model. The leftist-led coalition added that even at the height of tortuous negotiations to unlock emergency funding from creditors and keep debt-stricken Greece afloat, the economy exhibited signs of “dynamic recovery.” Opposition parties contend that because of bungled negotiations under former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, the punishing €86bn bailout package Athens was forced to sign up to - in the form of a third rescue - was much harsher than necessary. Time for a look again at European markets, which have extended gains this afternoon ahead of the US non-farm payrolls at 13.30. FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,456 Germany’s DAX: +0.9% at 12,165 France’s CAC: +1% at 5,134 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 21,841 Spain’s IBEX: +0.6% at 10,356 Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 376 Some positive news on Greece’s economy, which grew for a second successive quarter between April and June. GDP grew by 0.5% in the second quarter, maintaining the pace of first-quarter growth. Annual growth picked up to 0.8% from 0.4%. The main driver of growth in the second quarter was exports, which increased by 3.8%. The pound is roughly stable today against both the dollar and the euro, at $1.2926 and €1.0847 respectively. But Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says the pound is in for a tough time as uncertainty grows: Sterling has had a rough month, particularly against the euro. A big part of that has been driven by euro strength ... There’s also the fact that recent data suggests the Brexit chickens may finally be coming home to roost for the economy, with lukewarm consumer spending and flat business investment. It all adds up to a lot of uncertainty, which of course translates to rich pickings for sterling bears. Politics and growth remain the two key considerations for the rest of the year. How quickly Brexit negotiations move from divorce terms to the future relationship between the EU and UK stands out as a key issue, as delays risk further dents to business investment. High frequency data, especially retail sales, will also be worth picking apart with a fine-tooth comb as the last couple of months have shown some recovery, but real wages remain in contraction and it’s unclear how consumers will respond. Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, says the US non-farm payrolls number would have to come in a lot higher than expected to give the dollar a major boost. (Economists are forecasting a headline figure of 180,000 jobs.) It will require a big beat on the headline jobs number today for the dollar to get another leg up from these levels. With EURUSD holding below 1.19 and USJPY above 110 there does not much scope to the upside unless the non-farm payrolls (NFP) over deliver in a big way. The dollar was looking a touch oversold but has found its feet – it just needs some more direction but the NFP will only provide that if it’s significantly stronger than expected or undershoots. On hopes for the NFP, it’s all about whether this print is strong enough to get the market talking up another hike this year, which is currently a 1-in-3 chance right now. Shares in drugs group Indivior are down almost 40% after it lost a US patent ruling that could pave the way for the launch of rivals to its Suboxone Film heroin substitute.

Read our full story here: Italy’s economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, the national statistics bureau ISTAT confirmed. It matched first-quarter growth and left the annual growth rate for Q2 unchanged at 1.5%. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturing trade body, EEF, says that the UK PMI suggests the sector is in store for a better second half of the year. Today’s data confirm that UK manufacturers are looking beyond the Brexit negotiations to strengthening market opportunities in Europe and beyond, with the acceleration in manufacturing activity in August helping to provide some welcome offset to sluggish consumer demand at home. The raft of decent survey data from the sector suggest manufacturing output growth should look better in the second half of this year than it did in the first, but longer term the continued robustness of demand in the rest of the world and the right investment decisions at home to capitalise on it will be key to sustaining this picture. The UK manufacturing PMI hit a four-month high in August. Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says that while the survey signals strong growth, manufacturers remain cautious about the outlook. The pickup in the PMI brings tentative hope that the recent decline in the official manufacturing output data will be reversed swiftly. The manufacturing sector, however, should be doing even better, given sterling’s huge depreciation and the emergence of a strong recovery in the eurozone. Indeed, the U.K.’s PMI remained below the eurozone’s for the fourth consecutive month. In addition, manufacturers’ optimism regarding future production growth only edged up in August to its five-year average, suggesting that they will invest only cautiously in extra capacity. Britain’s factories were going full steam ahead in August according to the IHS Markit UK manufacturing PMI. The headline index combining factory output, orders and employment, rose to a four-month high of 56.9, from 55.3 in July. It comfortably beat economists’ expectations of 55. Demand was chiefly driven by domestic customers, but customers also reported new export orders from mainland Europe, the US, China and Australia. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said Britain’s manufacturing sector was performing well despite Brexit uncertainty: The key question is whether this positive start to the second half of the year can be sustained. This is looking increasingly likely during the near-term, given the breadth of the expansion. At the moment, the survey data suggest that the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support on-going growth in the economy in the third quarter, which will add fuel to hawkish policymakers’ calls for higher interest rates. Eurozone factories enjoyed strong demand in August, with output growing at a faster pace than in July. The headline index on the IHS Markit manufacturing PMI rose to 57.4, from 56.6 in July (any number above 50 indicates growth). Domestic and export orders were both strong, and expansion was led by Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. Here is how individual countries performed: Austria: 61.1 (78-month high) Netherlands: 59.7 (78-month high) Germany: 59.3 (2-month high) Italy: 56.3 (78-month high) Ireland: 56.1 (25-month high) France: 55.8 (76-month high) Spain: 52.4 (11-month low) Greece: 52.2 (108-month high) Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the August survey suggested a positive start to the third quarter for the eurozone economy. The eurozone’s impressive manufacturing upturn regained momentum in August, with a summer surge in factory activity suggesting rising goods production will support another strong GDP reading in the third quarter. The survey indicates that euro area manufacturing output is growing at an annual rate of approximately 4%. Producers across the region are benefitting from rising domestic demand as economic recoveries gain momentum, as well as surging export sales. The FTSE 100 is up 15 points this morning, as major markets across Europe rise for a third day. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,446 Germany’s DAX: +0.3% at 12,090 France’s CAC: +0.6% at 5,118 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 21,750 Spain’s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,336 Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 375 China’s August Caixin manufacturing PMI has come in ahead of expectations, picking up to 51.6 from 51.1 in July (where anything above 50 signals growth). It supports the official PMI survey published on Thursday, which also signalled stronger-than-expected growth in China’s factories. However Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, says it’s not all good news for the world’s second largest economy: Stronger manufacturing PMI readings for August suggest that industrial output remains resilient. However, momentum elsewhere in the economy has weakened. We suspect that it is speculation over future capacity cuts that has pushed up metal prices and industrial production, rather than stronger underlying demand. Indeed, investment growth has cooled recently and we anticipate a further slowdown as the impact of tighter monetary conditions continue to feed through. If we are right, then the current strength of industrial activity can’t be sustained for long. Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC, says that it would be wrong to place too much emphasis on the strong ADP jobs report from earlier in the week. US August payrolls dominate the day ahead. Expectations are probably for a firmer reading than the published consensus of a 180K increase after the ADP survey, though we would note that the ADP survey has a very patchy track record and does not consistently improve the accuracy of consensus forecasts. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It’s that time again: non-farm payrolls day. At 13.30 BST we will get the August report on employment and wages, giving the latest snapshot of how well the US jobs market and wider economy are doing. The official consensus among economists is for a 180,000 increase in jobs, following a 209,000 rise in July. Wage growth is expected to edge up to 2.6% from 2.5% previously. However, a stronger-than-expected ADP jobs report earlier in the week is raising speculation the payrolls report could surprise on the upside. If that was the case, investors would be more willing to bet that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again before the end of the year. CMC Markets’ Michael Hewson: A decent payrolls number today would be the icing on the cake in a week that has seen some positive signs that the US economy may be in better shape that was previously thought prior to Jackson Hole. Today’s US employment report is expected to see 180k jobs added in August, down from July’s 209k, however this week’s bumper ADP report has seen some estimates for today revised higher. Of more importance will be how strong the wages numbers come in, given an unemployment rate of 4.3%. Annual hourly wage growth is currently 2.5%, a little on the weak side for an economy supposedly at full employment so a strong number here could increase the odds of another rate rise this year, most likely in December. Of course a stronger report is not a foregone conclusion: The other major focus of the day will be manufacturing PMIs from the eurozone and UK, providing the latest clues on the health of those economies: 09.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing PMI (August) 09.00 BST Italian GDP, final estimate (Q2) 09.30 BST UK manufacturing PMI (August)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/03/from-gravity-to-transparent-the-best-of-film-and-tv-streaming-in-australia-in-september","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T02:35:55Z","webTitle":"From Gravity to Transparent: the best of film and TV streaming in Australia in September","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/03/from-gravity-to-transparent-the-best-of-film-and-tv-streaming-in-australia-in-september","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/03/from-gravity-to-transparent-the-best-of-film-and-tv-streaming-in-australia-in-september","fields":{"headline":"From Gravity to Transparent: the best of film and TV streaming in Australia in September","bodyText":"Netflix Film: The Manchurian Candidate (US, 2004) by Jonathan Demme – out now What better time for a paranoid political thriller about conspiracy, imperialist war and governmental dishonesty? Jonathan Demme’s remake of the 1962 Cold War-era original makes as much creepy sense today as it did in 2004, having relocated the action to the Middle East. A Gulf War veteran (Denzel Washington) is brainwashed in a long-term scheme to aid the election of another vet (Liev Schrieber) whose mother (Meryl Streep) is a hawk-eyed, plutocrat Republican eager to continue her nepotistic empire. From today’s vantage point, with POTUS recommitting to war in Afghanistan, the thriller vibrates like a thrilling, hallucinatory, almost-documentary: its perception seems less anxious and more accurate than ever. If only popular cinema were always this clever and sharp. Film: O Brother, Where Art Thou? (US, 2000) by Joen and Ethan Cohen – out now Or is this 2017’s most relevant not-exactly-new film? This Coen brothers’ comedy manages to inhabit both its own wondrous, imaginative world, and our own. Set in the Depression-era south, the film features George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as dopey convicts on the run from their chain gang. Their performances are wonderfully endearing, but it’s cinematographer Roger Deakins’s dry, dusty, wide-shot sepia-soaked palette and the accompanying soundtrack of modern recordings of classic folk, bluegrass, country, gospel and blues that really bring the loopy drama to life. What especially makes this worth a rewatch is its sharp-eyed view of the Ku Klux Klan’s domination of mainstream Southern politics (John Goodman stars as a Klansman who is disposed of in typical Coen brothers satirical fashion); its resonance with recent events make O Brother seem less farcical and fantastical and more analytical. Impossible not to like, easy to watch and evermore germane. Film: Gravity (US, 2013) by Alfonso Cuarón – out 28 September Once Alfonso Cuarón made sexy Mexican roadtrip dramas and disillusioned dystopian thrillers that took us to the end of the world. But his absorption into the Hollywood vortex has yielded its own pleasures. Schmaltzy, wonderful and stripped of political allegory, Gravity is a pure work of science-fiction simply about two astronauts floating in space and stretching toward survival after disaster hits their ship. Guardian reviewer Peter Bradshaw summed it up perfectly: the “title refers to the one big thing almost entirely absent from the film: it’s like The Seventh Seal being called Levity or Last Tango in Paris Chastity ... The movie’s final sequence hints at some massive cosmic rebirth; a sense that these people are the first or last human beings in the universe, like something by Kubrick.” TV: Gyspy ( US, 2017) by Lisa Rubin – out now This psychosexual melodrama got a dodgy rap from most critics upon its recent release. But its weird neurotic power has grown on me: it’s worth returning to now if you at first overlooked it. Naomi Watts plays a New York City psychiatrist, Jean Holloway, who is happily married but living a double life: prescribing herself sedatives and voyeuristically meddling in the lives of her patients. She forms a dangerous romantic bond with Sidney, the charismatic ex-girlfriend of her client Sam, but when Sam spots them, Jean’s cover is almost blown. The genius of Watts’s performance is that she plays it straight – like a keyed-down version of her wonderful soap opera audition scene in David Lynch’s Mullholland Drive – getting us to invest in an everyday woman’s shadowy obsessions rather than amping up to the very soapie script and storytelling conventions. Artist-turned-director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s melodramatic sensibilities are ideally suited to television (she intelligently directed the first, beautifully overblown, Fifty Shades of Grey film), and the show is actually best when it embraces its most over-the-top moments. For lovers of the everyday perverse. Honourable mentions: The Ex-PM (TV, out now), Unforgiven (film, out now), Paper Planes (film, out now), Mad Max: Fury Road (film, out now), Marc Maron: Too Real (comedy special, 5 September), Jerry Before Seinfeld (comedy special, 19 September). Stan TV: Transparent (US, 2017) by Jill Solloway – out 23 September No episodes of the fourth season of Transparent were available for review, but, beyond more than mere hope and mind-reading, my recommendation is based on creator Jill Solloway’s astonishing creative record – her ability to burst open what TV storytelling can achieve. With Transparent and Amazon Prime’s I Love Dick, Solloway has become one of the biggest risk-takers in an often mediocre landscape of prestige TV. The last season of Transparent concluded with Maura confronting the fact that her physical transition toward womanhood had come to an end, and that her unconventionally feminine body – tall, broad-shouldered, narrow-hipped – would remain hers forever. With that plot point, Solloway brought home the idea that the trans journey is about so much more than feminising or masculinising operations that align with stereotypical gender norms. As ever, this radical vision of melting gender is delivered within a bittersweet comedic drama of a dysfunctional yet loving family unit, whose members’ lives unfurl in moments of grace and error rather than thunderbolts of epiphany. Honourable mentions: Parks &amp; Recreation seasons 1–7 (TV, 14 September), E.T. The Extraterrestrial (film, 22 September), Will &amp; Grace season 9 (TV, 28 September). Dendy Direct Film: Personal Shopper (France, 2016) by Olivier Assayas – out now Some saw this, Olivier Assayas’s latest film with Kristen Stewart, as an arthouse horror: a ghost story embedded in digital culture rather than Gothic tradition; a trip to a world where phantoms spook text messages rather than haunted houses. Stewart plays Maureen, a part-time medium and full-time fashion shopper for a Parisian celebrity. Obsessed with reaching her dead twin brother, Maureen comes to believe her text messages are being intercepted by his – or some other being’s – spirit. But Personal Shopper isn’t designed to thrill for kicks like most horrors. Rather, it’s a small, strange, barely-scripted story of minutely shifting psychological dynamics, that speaks to grief and how the absence of a loved one can haunt your waking moments long after they’ve left your life. In an anxious, preoccupied performance, Stewart is terribly affecting, and the real eeriness comes from the way she guides us through her character’s corrosive descent into unanchored self-doubt, forging a new chapter where she must fold her grief into her life and somehow carry on. By using the metaphor of a ghost for any kind of loss, the film made me realise that most ghost stories aren’t especially sad – and don’t you think that’s rather odd? Film: Rules Don’t Apply (US, 2016) by Warren Beatty – out now This romantic drama is likely to be Hollywood director/actor/icon Warren Beatty’s final film. So it’s fitting that it coalesces many of his cinematic obsessions: fated love, Hollywood in its golden age, a return to a moment in real history, and the myths and lies of America. Marla (Lily Collins) and Frank (Alden Ehrenreich) are would-be lovers in 1958 (the year Beatty himself arrived in Hollywood); she’s a Baptist-raised starlet busting for fame and patronised by little-seen but all-powerful Howard Hughes, who forbids his employees from dating one another (played by Beatty as a muddled, distant misanthrope), while Frank is one of Hughes’s drivers. As the pair is drawn into Hughes’s inner circle of madness, they’re also crushed by the religious and moral hypocrisy of the US’s post-war haze. It’s a sweet film that manages to be mythical and slight, conventional and thoughtful at the same time, and it’s what I crave from big-screen Hollywood fare. If all mainstream romantic dramas were made with this much care and love and artistry, the multiplex would be a very different place. Honourable mentions: John Wick Chapter Two (film, out now), Get Out (film, out now). Foxtel Now Film: Cafe Society (US, 2016) by Woody Allen – out 16 September Cafe Society has the tenuous honour of being the least misanthropic late Woody Allen film. It’s a hastily staged, first draft script – the actors often seem as if they’re rolling through their line readings at a first and last rehearsal – so Cafe Society’s sweetness is a surprise. The plot is a trifle: a romance of two lovers working in the burgeoning film industry, Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, blooms and sours in three tidy acts, before being drawn toward an (unusually, for Allen) emotionally mature conclusion that speaks to the bittersweet nostalgia of lost love. Allen is as lazy and ethically cooked a filmmaker as ever, but this small romantic comedy suggests the famous cynic might be mellowing. Watch critically, and with curiosity. Three Days of the Condor (US, 1975) by Sidney Pollack — out now until 13 September In one of his many of collaborations with Sidney Pollack (Havana, Out Of Africa etc), sexy intellectual truthteller Robert Redford is a history researcher racing to uncover the rogue CIA faction that assassinated his colleagues, at the same time as he’s hunted by a super-sociopathic hitman (a glacial Max von Sydow). The Guardian called it “edgy, convoluted and clever, [and] there’s also room for a credible affair with Faye Dunaway, with whom Redford seeks refuge”. Along with such classics as The Conversation and All the President’s Men, this film changed the arc of superb, Watergate-era conspiracy thrillers of 1970s America cinema. Honourable mentions: Broad City season 4 (TV, 14 September), Kardashian Ten Year Anniversary Special (TV, 25 September). SBS On Demand Film: Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (US, 2015) by Alex Gibney – out now The attention to detail and sheer bulk of avalanching evidence in US documentary-maker Alex Gibney’s expose of Scientology is a lot to take in at once. It’s all much worse than you might think – the portrait of founder L Ron Hubbard as “quite mad”; the scope of the Church’s current alleged abuses. But Going Clear builds to something much more than your usual “isn’t that kooky”, muck-raking cult expose. In clean, talking heads style, the documentary sets out an analysis of the Church of Scientology as a business institution that has built a global empire by drawing the financial contributions of its wealthy, mainly Hollywood membership and invests it into extremely valuable property portfolios. In that respect, Going Clear offers a new and staggering contribution to the conversation about an easily mocked but disturbingly powerful organisation. Film: Jedda (Australia, 1955) by Charles Chauvel – out now The first colour film made in Australia and the first to feature Indigenous actors in the lead. Perhaps its most historic feat, however, is as Paul Byrne notes, that Jedda was the “first Australian film to take the emotional lives of Aboriginal people seriously”. Raised by a white couple on an isolated property, 16-year-old Jedda has never known her Arrernte culture or mother. Her journey toward her tribal lands begins when Marbuck, an Aboriginal man, arrives on the property, and the two forge a formidable bond. The racial politics of the plot and the film at large are fascinating to pull apart: Australian cinema has changed a lot and has much further to go, and Jedda was an important step on that path. Honourable mentions: Ex Machina (film, out now), Contact (TV, 4 September). ABC iView TV: Glitch season two (Australia, 2017) – out 14 September with weekly episodes on Thursday nights Glitch’s first season in 2015 took the zombie genre into new territory by seriously considering the inner turmoil of the undead: how terribly confusing and frightening it would be to find yourself resurrected in a new time. Set in an Australian country town, Glitch follows Sergeant James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) as he investigates the rise of a cemetery of corpses, one of which is his dead wife. The conceit allowed for some good old female competition for male commitment (James had since married his wife’s now-pregnant best friend), as well as some more serious subtext (some of the zombies are convicts and settlers who married the ancestors of the town’s Indigenous citizens). The new season carries forward these soapie concoctions and political subthemes, using James’ newborn child and the revelation of new variations on the undead as a way to ask the central question: why have they these supernatural spectres been raised? With its lost spirits entrapped in the land, Glitch leans heavily into Picnic at Hanging Rock’s white dreaming theme. There’s a lot going on in season two: colonial critique, zombies as a metaphor for long-buried personal bereavement, and now, a new corporate medical conspiracy. With its emphasis on plot over audiovisual creativity, the series works best as a really satisfying genre piece, mixing twisted horror conventions with compelling ideas about Australian political history and national identity. An authentic, grief-drenched mystery. Rev on Demand Film: Alvin’s World of Harmonious Opposites (Australia/Indonesia, 2015) by Platon Theodoris – out now Rev on Demand comprises a small but potent selection of unusual films, not available elsewhere, that have featured in the indie-focused Revelation Perth International Film festival over the years. In this film from the festival’s 2015 program, Alvin (Teik-Kim Pok) has designed a small life of solitude. He hasn’t left his studio apartment in 18 months. Internet commerce provides him with delivered groceries, Skype chats with friendship and work connections, a spy-hole to the downstairs apartment with a substitute for intimacy. But a storm of disasters conspire to evict him from his tiny universe, not the least of which is a possibly imaginary cola-coloured substance leaking from the ceiling: he must investigate. Debut director Platon Theodoris’ 73-minute feature is the kind of ultra-low-budget project where character and design trump story (it will surely invite Wes Anderson parallels for its symmetrical, bright-coloured mise en scène, while fantastical, plot-bending sequences bring us directly into Alvin’s inner world). Beneath the quirky characters and vintage set design elements, the film warns of constructing a digital life that evades closeness with humans. Alvin is certainly a lonely, odd man, but he’s not calcified, and the prospect of escaping his self-constructed prison comes to form both the narrative arc and the strange theme. One of the most memorable independent Australian films of recent years, it refuses to bend its artistic vision toward strictly commercial concerns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/01/fears-mount-of-myanmar-atrocities-as-fleeing-rohingya-families-drown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T06:03:54Z","webTitle":"Fears mount of Myanmar atrocities as fleeing Rohingya families drown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/fears-mount-of-myanmar-atrocities-as-fleeing-rohingya-families-drown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/01/fears-mount-of-myanmar-atrocities-as-fleeing-rohingya-families-drown","fields":{"headline":"Fears mount of Myanmar atrocities as fleeing Rohingya families drown","bodyText":"Two dozen corpses believed to be the bodies of Rohingya women and children have washed up on a Bangladesh riverbank as fears grow of atrocities committed by Myanmar forces against the Muslim minority across the border. In the deadliest violence in decades, nearly 400 people have been killed in a week of fighting in Myanmar’s north-west Rakhine state after Rohingya insurgents attacked security forces and the military responded with a huge counter-offensive. Close to 38,000 Rohingya have fled their villages and attempted to cross into Bangladesh, according to United Nations estimates. World powers have warned Aung San Suu Kyi’s government to avoid killing innocent civilians. The latest outpouring of refugees comes amid reports of ethnic violence from an activist group with a presence in the conflict area, accusing Myanmar security forces and Buddhist vigilantes of killing 130 Rohingya in the village of Chut Pyin. “We were told that the army encircled the village and attacked people when they fled,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, an advocacy group set up to work with the Rohingya. “According to our information from the ground, at least 130 were killed, most of them died from gunshot wounds,” she said of the incident which occurred on Sunday. “The figure is collected from a list of people who have been buried.” Myanmar has blocked access to the region for journalists, and the Guardian was unable to immediately confirm the report. Video footage passed to the Guardian showed villages on fire and Rohingya with injuries that resembled gunshot wounds. A government spokesperson was unreachable on Friday. Authorities said Rohingya were burning their own villages and the armed forces were protecting civilians against “terrorist extremists”. Lewa said security forces had “burned village after village. It is systematic”. However, she added that some Rohingya arsonists had set fire to the Buddhist village of Pyu Ma. New York-based Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday that satellite images showed burning across at least ten areas of the northern parts of Rakhine state, the region that borders Bangladesh. From the Bangladesh side, plumes of smoke rose from a forest in Myanmar, and UN sources said around 20,000 Rohingya were stranded in no man’s land between the two countries. The military said on Thursday that about 370 “terrorists”, 13 security forces, two government officials and 14 civilians had been killed in a week of clashes. The latest bout of violence began after Rohingya militants called the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked police last Friday, resulting in fierce fighting that killed at least 104 people, including 12 members of the security forces. Security forces have responded this week with clearance operations which they say are to weed out the militants but that members of the Rohingya diaspora allege amount to ethnic cleansing. The office of the de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has blamed civilian killings and village burnings on Arsa. Myanmar has evacuated thousands of Buddhists from Rakhine, an area that has seen episodes of bloody sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims for years. The bodies of 11 Rohingya children and 9 women washed up on the Bangladesh side of the Naf river after their boat overturned, according to Bangladesh border guard commander Ariful Islam. He said the bodies of two women and two children were also recovered after Myanmar’s border guard police fired on their boat. At the United Nations, the US ambassador Nikki Haley condemned Arsa but added: “As Burmese security forces act to prevent further violence, they have a responsibility to adhere to international humanitarian law, which includes refraining from attacking innocent civilians and humanitarian workers.” Aung San Suu Kyi’s office has accused foreign aid workers of helping “terrorists”, a claim that has prompted fears for their safety and was condemned as dangerously irresponsible. Yanghee Lee, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said the humanitarian situation was deteriorating rapidly. “Many thousands of people are increasingly at risk of grave violations of their human rights,” she said in a statement. “The worsening cycle of violence ... must be broken urgently.” In the Bangladeshi border district of Cox’s Bazar, makeshift camps for the tens of thousands of displaced were set up last October when another insurgent attack on border guards resulted in a huge counteroffensive that was internationally condemned as disproportionate. One arrival, Mohammed Rashid, 45, wore a surgical dressing under his eye, saying bullet splinters injured him after the Myanmar army opened fire on a group of Rohingya. He said about 100 people made their way to the border together, and he saw explosions and people dying. “We hid in the forest for two days and then we were stopped at the border, but we got through. We heard that the houses in our village have burned down,” Rashid said. Communal hatred has simmered in the region for years, with an estimated 1.1 million Rohingya suffering persecution in a country that refuses to grant them citizenship. In 2012, clashes with Buddhists in Rakhine caused 140,000 Rohingya to flee their homes. Thousands more have died at the hands of people smugglers and traffickers. The continuing violence against Rohingya has been the most high profile issue for Aung San Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner whose landslide election in 2015 was celebrated internationally as a victory against oppressive military rule. Bangladesh, where more than 400,000 Rohingya who fled Myanmar since the early 1990s still live, is also growing increasingly hostile to refugees and has turned some back. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, said while he condemned the violent attacks by militants, “decades of persistent and systematic human rights violations” against Rohingya “have almost certainly contributed to the nurturing of violent extremism, with everyone ultimately losing.” He added: “This turn of events is deplorable. It was predicted and could have been prevented.” Reuters contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
