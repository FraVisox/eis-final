The running-ground was on the Manchester side of the Rainhill Bridge, at a place called Kenrick's Cross, about ten miles from Liverpool. At this place, the rail-road runs on a dead level, and formed, of course, a fine spot for trying the comparitive speed of the carriages. The directors had made suitable preparations for this important, as well as interesting experiment of the powers of locomotive carriages. For the accommodation of the ladies, who might visit the course (to use the language of the turf,) a booth was erected on the south side of the rail-road, equidistant from the extremities of the trial-ground. Here a band of music was stationed, and amused the company, during the day, by playing pleasing and favourite airs. The directors, each of whom wore a white ribbon in his button-hole, arrived on the course shortly after ten o-clock in the forenoon, having come from Hayton in cars drawn by Mr. Stephenson's locomotive steam-carriage, which moved up the inclined plane from thence with considerable velocity. Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, in great numbers, arrived from Liverpool and Warrington, St. Helen's and Manchester, as well as from the surrounding country, in vehicles of every description. Indeed, all the roads presented, on this occasion, scenes similar to those, which roads leading to race courses usually present during the days of sport. The pedestrians were extremely numerous and crowded all the roads which conducted to the race-ground. The spectators line both sides of the road, for the distance of a mile and a-half; and, although the men employed on the line, amounting to nearly 200, acted as special constables, with orders to keep the crowd off the course, all their efforts to carry their orders into effect were rendered nugatory, by the people persisting in walking on the ground. It is difficult to form an estimate of the number of individuals who had congregated to behold the experiment; but there could not, at a moderate calculation, be less than 10,000. Some gentlemen even went so far as to compute them at 15,000. Never, perhaps, on any previous occasion, were so many scientific gentlemen and practical engineers collected together on one spot as there were on the rail-road to witness this trial. The interesting and important nature of the experiments had drawn them from all parts of the kingdom to be present at this context of locomotive carriages, as well as to witness an exhibition, whose results may alter the whole system of our existing internal communications, many and important as they are, substituting an agency, whose ultimate effects can scarcely be anticipated; for, although the extraordinary change in our river and coast navigation by steam-boat may afford some rule of comparison, still the effect of wind and waves and a resisting medium, combine in vessels to present obstructions to the full exercise of the gigantic power which will act on a rail-way, unaffected by the seasons and unlimited but by the demand for its application. There were only one or two public-houses or taverns in the vicinity of the trial-ground. These were, of course, crowded with company as the day advanced, particularly the Rail-road Tavern, which was literally crammed with company. The landlady had very prudently and providently reserved one room for the accommodation of the better class of visitors. The good lady will, it is imagined, have substantial reasons for remembering the trial of locomotive carriages. But there is nothing like making hay while the sun shines. The locomotive carriages which appeared on the ground on Tuesday were: No. 1 - Messrs. Braithwaite and Erickson, of London; \"The Novelty;\" weight 2 tons, 15 cwt. 2. - Mr Ackworth, of Darlington; \"The Sans Pareil;\" weight 4 tons, 8 cwt. 2 qrs. 3. - Mr. Robert Stephenson, Newcastle-upon-Tyne; \"The Rocket;\" weight 4 tons, 3 cwt. 4. - Mr. Brandreth, of Liverpool; \"The Cycloped;\" weight 3 tons; worked by two horses. Mr. Burstall, of Edinburgh, did not bring his carriage out, in consequence of its having met with an accident on its road from Liverpool to the course. The locomotive carriages attracted, of course, the attention of every individual on the ground. They ran up and down the road, during the forenoon, more for amusement than experiment, surprising and even startling the scientific beholders by the amazing velocity with which they moved along the rails. Mr. Robert Stephenson's carriage attracted the most attention during the early part of the afternoon. It ran, without any weight being attached to it, at the rate of twenty-four miles in the hour, shooting past the spectators with amazing velocity, emitting very little smoke, but dropping red-hot cinders as it proceeded. Cars containing stones were then attached to it, weighing, together with its own weight, upwards of 17 tons, prepatory to the trial of its speed being made. The precise distance between the point of starting, at or near the weighing shed, to the point of returning, was 1¾ mile; but in the adjudication of distances, it is understood the judge allowed a furlong at each end for the acquirement and abatement of speed. The observations recorded apply, however, to the whole distance. With a load of 12½ tons gross, the Rocket travelled the above space of 1¾ mile. Four times forward and backward, equal to 1½ miles, in the space of 75 minutes, exclusive of stoppages; but including the stoppages; but excluding the stoppages, the average rate was 10½ miles per hour. But in the fifth course the rate of speed, with a load, augmented by passengers until equal to 13 tons, was full 15 miles an hour. The engine of Messrs. Braithwaite and Erickson, of London, was universally allowed to exhibit. in appearance and compactness, the beau-ideal of a locomotive engine. Its performance, whilst exercising without a load, was most astonishing, passing over a space of 2¾ miles in seven minutes and a quarter, including a stoppage. With this delay its rate of speed was about 23 miles an hour. While running, the progress was upwards of 28 miles an hour. Owing to a variety of circumstances, this engine was prevented from being ready to start with a load until a late hour, when, at the request of the directors, its exhibition was postponed until Wednesday. The velocity at which it is moved surprised and amazed every beholder. It seemed, indeed, to fly, presenting one of the most sublime spectacles of human ingenuity and human daring the world ever beheld. It actually made one giddy to look at it, and filled thousands with lively fears for the safety of the individuals who were on it, and who seemed not to run along the earth, but to fly, as it were, on \"the wings of the wind.\" It was a most sublime sight, - a sight, indeed, which the individuals who beheld it will not soon forget. EXPERIMENTS ON WEDNESDAY.- It is stated, that there was an experiment made on Wednesday, with the carriage of Messrs. Braithwaite and Erickson, prepatory to the grand trial which is to be made on Saturday. The carriage is said to have travelled at the rate of 25 miles an hour, with three times its own weight. In consequence of the bursting of the bellows of one of the engines, the commencement of the contest was postponed to the following day. THURSDAY.- The powers of Mr. Stephenson's carriage, the Rocket, were this day put to the test in the performance of a journey of seventy miles, with loaded waggons attached to it. This, we are informed, was done at the average rate of eleven miles in the hour, including stoppages, and the time lost after stopping to return, before the recovery of the general speed. On one occasion the distance of thirteen miles was performed within the hour. After this trial, in consequence of the promulgation of a new set of conditions by the judges, the further trial was postponed until Saturday (this day), at eleven o'clock. As public attention is much engrossed with these rail-road experiments, we may be rendering an acceptable service to our readers by giving the regulations published by the judges, which are as follows. The weight of the loco-motive engine, with its full complement of water in the boiler, shall be ascertained at the weighing machine, by eight o'clock in the morning, and the load assigned to it shall be three times the weight thereof. The water in the boiler shall be cold, and there shall be no fuel in the fire-place. As much fuel shall be weighed, and as much water shall be measured and delivered into the tender carriage, as the owner of the engine for a journey of thirty-two miles and one half. The fire in the boiler shall then be lighted, and the quantity of fuel consumed for getting up the stream shall be determined, and the time noted. The tender carriage, with the fuel and water, shall be considered to be, and taken as a part of, the load assigned to the engine. Those engines that carry their own fuel and water, shall be allowed a proportionate deduction from their load, according to the weight of the engine. The engine, with the carriages attached to it, shall be run by hand up to the starting post, and as soon as the steam is got up to fifty pounds per square inch, the engine shall set out upon its journey. The distance the engine shall perform each trip, shall be one mile and three quarters each way, including one-eighth of a mile at each end for getting up the speed, and for stopping the train, by this means the engine will be equal to a journey of thirty-two miles and one half, thirty miles whereof shall be performed at full speed, and the average rate of travelling shall not be less than ten miles per hour. As soon as the engine has performed this task (which will be equal to the travelling from Liverpool to Manchester), there shall be a fresh supply of water and fuel delivered to her: and, as soon as she can be got ready to set out again, she shall go up to the starting-post, and make ten trips more, which will be equal to the journey from Manchester back again to Liverpool. The time of performing every trip shall be accurately noted, as well as the time occupied in getting ready to set out on the second journey. Should the engine not be enabled to take along with it sufficient fuel and water for the journey of ten trips, the time occupied in taking in a fresh supply of fuel and water, shall be considered and taken as part of the time in performing the journey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1837/jun/24/monarchy.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1837-06-24T11:18:15Z","webTitle":"The accession of Queen Victoria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1837/jun/24/monarchy.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1837/jun/24/monarchy.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"The accession of Queen Victoria","bodyText":"QUEEN VICTORIA - The accession of our young queen is a circumstance full of hope and promise. Humanly speaking, it is perhaps desirable that the event should have been postponed a few years, that her character might have become more fixed, and her acquaintance with the world and with those branches of knowledge which are peculiarly appropriate to her situation and her duties, more enlarged. But it has been ordained otherwise, and, we have no doubt, ordained for the best. From all that we have read and heard, her majesty's conduct hitherto seems to have been marked by great propriety both of feeling and demeanour. Her address to the privy council, on the day of her accession, which will be found in a subsequent column, was every thing that could be wished; and there is not a true Englishman who will not warmly respond to her prayer, that \"Providence may give her strength for the performance of the work to which she has been thus early called.\" The declaration, beautiful in its composition, and constitutional in its spirit as it is, has been savagely criticised and misrepresented by the Times. We trust, however, and believe, that very many even of the tories recoil with unmingled disgust from the hateful spirit which that journal so perseveringly evinces. It cannot excite surprise, that, though surrounded by her illustrious mother and other friends, her majesty, during the ceremony of her proclamation on Wednesday, at St. James's Palace, should have been affected, even to tears, by a sense of the novelty and responsibility of her situation. Those tears, however - to adopt with a little variation the language of a noble poet with respect to another young and accomplished princess, - - \"were virtue's tears auspicious to those much-loved isles.\" And we add the wish, \"Oh! be each drop in future years Repaid her by a nation's smiles!\" DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT - The terms of her majesty's message, conveyed on Thursday to the two houses of parliament, by Lord MELBOURNE, and Lord JOHN RUSSELL respectively, render evident (what, indeed, was previously pretty well known from private correspondence), that the session will be curtailed as much as possible; and that, so soon as the money bills and the most pressing business before the house of commons have been disposed of, a dissolution will take place. We shall at once state our opinion, that no appeal to the people, more pregnant with future good or evil consequences to the nation, has ever been made. The question which the electors of this kingdom have to decide is, whether we shall continue in that peaceful and well-considered course of progressive reform which it is the peculiar, and will be the lasting, glory of the late king to have sanctioned and encouraged; or whether, by a dogged resistance to further measures of improvement - by a standing and pertinacious effort to cheat the people out of the legitimate consequences of the reform act, the future tranquillity of the nation is to be placed in imminent hazard. That we shall have reforms; that the great principles of political and religious liberty will finally be established in this kingdom; that government will be compelled to be more economical; that a higher standard of civilization will ultimately be adopted amongst us; that legislation will be made more sound in its principles, and more comprehensively beneficient in its operation - these are all articles of faith which we hold with a firm and undoubting trust. But it depends much upon ourselves - it is now to be decided by the constituency of the kingdom - how soon or how easily these wished-for changes shall be effected. The sovereign and the parliament of Great Britain have a glorious course before them, if the electors do their duty. We are, it may be said, at the commencement of a new era. We gave a queen whose age and whose education alike secure her being unversed in the old maxims and the corrupt practices of courts and cabinets. As the first sovereign who has acceded to the throne since the time of our great political regeneration, her feelings, it seems to us, must be much identified with that important measure, and her principles inclined to the furtherance of those objects which were looked to as its natural results. It depends upon the people how far those feelings shall take root. Let us give the queen a reforming house of commons; and she will give us, and support for us, a reforming ministry. We know it may be said, that this will not cure the hostility of the house of peers, and that good measures will be obstructed and strangled there again, as they have been heretofore. We are not, however, of this opinion. With a decidely liberal parliament, and a liberal ministry, \"the queen's name will be a tower of strength.\" And we do not believe that, under such circumstances, the majority of the house of peers will long venture to continue their resistance to measures known to be in accordance alike with the wishes of the people, and of the two other branches of the legislature. We believe that they must, and will, yield to the force of public opinion. If we should turn out to be mistaken - if their former resistance should still be maintained - the tories well know, that means perfectly in unison with the spirit of the constitution may be found to overcome it. Of their sensibility to this fact their journals have already given note. We call, therfore, upon every friend to improvement in the institutions of his country, upon every true reformer, to be up and doing. There is no time for hestation and delay. Our opponents will be united, active, zealous, and many of them, unscrupulous. In union, zeal, and activity, let us be at least their equals; and, whilst we use no waepons but such as we can employ with a good conscience, let us wield these with a decision, vigour, and effort proportioned to the goodness of our cause, and the importance of the objects we have in view. We repeat - there is no time to lose. In Manchester we hope to announce in our very next number, that the committees of Mr. THOMSON and Mr. PHILIPS are organized, and prepared for action. In Salford, we believe, the friends of Mr. BROTHERTON are already in motion, and an address from him to the electors appears in our first page. We trust that not a single week will elapse before we shall be enabled to state, that effectual steps are being taken in all the neighbouring boroughs to secure the return of sound liberal representatives, and to rescue South Lancashire from the reproach of being represented by two conspicuous anti-reformers. THE LATE KING - In subsequent columns will be found a variety of details connected with the death of his late majesty, WILLIAM the FOURTH, and an abridgement of an impartial and well-written memoir of his life, which we have taken from the Morning Chronicle. Though not as we have always understood, a prince of brilliant and commanding talents, we have the authority of all of all the leading ministers who have enjoyed his confidence for saying, that WILLIAM the FOURTH was well acquainted with the duties of his high station; that he was methodical and industrious in the performance of his functions; that he entered with spirit, interest and intelligence, into the consideration of the business which came before him, freely expressing and defending his own opinions, but ultimately acquiescing on all occasions in the only proper and constitutional method of terminating such discussions, viz. the adoption of those views which his responsible advisers had recommended and enforced. There are some circumstances which impart to the period of his government a peculiar interest. He is the only British monarch (for virutally the PRINCE REGENT was a monarch), during whose whole reign the nation has been preserved from suffering by the crimes and calamities of war. And this period of foreign and internal peace has been distinguished by domestic changes of so vast and fundamental a kind, that there is probably not another country in the world where they could have been carried into effect without exhibiting the characteristics of a revolution. There can be no occasion, and indeed our time and space forbid that we should at present enumerate these: they will be sufficiently in the recollection of those of our readers who feel a material interest in political affairs. We have always deemed it a fortunate circumstance, that the sovereign under whose reign these mighty changes were introduced was one who had been educated and passed through a good portion of his life, without any near prospect of acceding to the throne. He had a knowledge of the world, formed not exclusively at home but also in various foreign countries, which no prince standing in the relation of an immediate heir to the throne could have had the means of obtaining; and being engaged in the (in many respects) equalizing service of the navy, and not standing so decisively above or apart from his associates as he might have done in the land service, he acquired a frankness and affability of demeanour which have accompanied him through life, and which, if they detracted something from the ordinary prestige of royalty, more than compensated for the want of it by the personal regard which they inspired. His habits, at any rate, for many years past, were (keeping in mind his exalted station) simple, regular, and domestic. And we believe there is abundant evidence of the reciprocal and affectionate regard which existed between himself and his queen, during the whole period of their union. It is often said that the public has no concern with the private lives of princes. We are not of that opinion. For whilst we would neither seek to create nor to gratify a prurient appetite for scandal, in relation to a subject with respect to which that appetite is so easily excited as the vices or follies of the great, we do feel that it is a circumstance which strongly conduces to the welfare and interest of a nation, when the monarch, instead of being an insulated and selfish voluptuary, is known to be constant and unostentatious in the fulfilment of domestic duties, and the natural displayof tender and virtuous affections. It is still, however, in his public relations, that the character of the late king deserves to be chiefly considered; and, viewed in reference to these, it is deserving of great applause. He has been mainly the friend of civil and religious liberty; and the memory of WILLIAM the Reformer will long be cherished by the British public with a feeling, of affectionate respect and veneration, which it has been the lot of very few, if any, of his royal predecessors to inspire in an equal degree."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1865/jan/11/mainsection.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1865-01-11T00:04:09Z","webTitle":"From the archive: Masters and servants down the pit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1865/jan/11/mainsection.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1865/jan/11/mainsection.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"Masters and servants down the pit","bodyText":"On Monday evening, a public meeting was held at the Commercial Hall, Wigan, in connection with the meeting of the Council of the Miners' National Association. Mr Normansell, of Leeds, occupied the chair. Mr Pickard, of Wigan, referred to the position of the engine winders in his district, who, he stated, were forming an association, but who had received 14 days' notice to leave the society or their work. Mr Stevenson, of Rothwell, reviewed the laws relating to inspection of collieries, advocating an alteration in the system of holding coroners' inquiries into the causes of colliery accidents, and reviving the plan for preventing their occurrence by compelling employers to pay the wages of those killed to their widows and orphans. Mr Brown, of Hunslet, spoke in favour of an eight hours bill, and Mr McDonald, of Scotland, the president, said the Association purposed an endeavour to alter the law relating to masters and servants, so as to render it impossible for the workman to be sent to prison for a breach of contract, so long as the master for a similar offence could only be dealt with in a civil court. Mr Cobbett had a bill prepared to introduce, and the movement was supported by sixty trades' societies. Other reforms were the alteration of the truck system, the removal of women from the pit banks, and the education of boys till they were twelve years of age, instead of allowing them to descend the pit when they were but ten. It was resolved that the sum of £15 be voted (to campaign on the master and servant law). It was next moved by Mr Normansell, \"That the deputation, while in London, shall endeavour to obtain the education of the young; restriction of the hours of labour of the young to eight hours per day; changes in the present Inspection Act, to make that act more efficient; the appointment of sub-inspectors in sufficient numbers, so as to examine all mines to prevent accidents; the training of a better class of managers; the removing of all females from the pit banks; a change in the coroners' inquests in the country, so far as relates to mining accidents; that the miners' material be only weighed by imperial standard weights; that the miners shall have full power to appoint and retain on the pit bank, to see their material weighed, anyone of their own class they may think fit to appoint and pay.\" A resolution was also passed to the effect that the Council strongly recommend that all the trades of the United Kingdom take up the question of courts of conciliation and councils of arbitration immediately."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1868/apr/25/mainsection.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1868-04-25T00:06:50Z","webTitle":"From the archive: John Harland, the shorthand king of Britain, dies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1868/apr/25/mainsection.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1868/apr/25/mainsection.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"John Harland, the shorthand king of Britain","bodyText":"It is with the greatest regret we have to announce the death of Mr. John Harland, which occurred at his residence, Brideoak-street, Cheatham Hill, about midnight on Thursday. Mr. Harland was in the enjoyment of his usual health, except that he was becoming somewhat wearied with his heavy literary labours, until the end of March. Mr. Harland was a native of Hull, where he was born in the year 1806. He learned the trade of a letter-press printer, but, being of a literary turn, he prepared himself for more important labours. By the aid of one of the best systems of shorthand then known, which he greatly improved, he became the most expert shorthand writer in the kingdom, and was repeatedly so acknowledged by the reporters of the London press. A favourable impression was communicated to the late Mr. Taylor, the proprietor and editor of this journal. This led to Mr. Harland's removal to Manchester; and his labours upon the Manchester Guardian continued until 1860, when he retired. Mr. Harland's industry was very great, and his powers of endurance were equal to his enthusiasm for work. For the first time in the provinces, accurate reports of all occurrences of interest were given to the public. These reports were often written by night, while travelling in a stage coach. The difficulties in the way of journalism in those days were overcome by Mr. Harland's disregard of fatigue. Often the details of a trial at Lancaster assizes appeared in these columns before Judge and Jury had recovered from the labours of the Court. Until the introduction of the latest and best system of shorthand, Mr. Harland had no equal. He was, in short, the father of provincial reporting. With the rapidity with which this manufacturing capital of the North advanced, Mr. Harland responded to those demands, and created, for the first time, an appetite for newspaper reading of local matters. His love of verbal accuracy amounted almost to a passion. This, and the severe discipline which he considered necessary, created an admiration for Mr. Harland 's character which deepened into affection; while upon those less soldierly in disposition, it produced the impression of an austere and iron rule. Mr. Harland possessed a keen sense of humour, and withal had a poetical gift which was appreciated wherever it was known. · Harland was the Guardian's chief - and, in its first years, only - reporter.

We have no wish to be hard upon the constable. Speaking generally, he is not, and cannot be expected to be, a man of discriminating mind, and he usually has a good deal of work on hand - work of a kind which, without any fault of character in himself, must tend to develop the cynical faculty. It is his daily and nightly business to lift the helpless drunkard from the pavement and remove him to a place of safety, where he may sleep off his debauch, and whence he may be conveniently carried before the representative of outraged public decency. Even a policeman, however, ought to know, or, if he does not know, ought to be taught, that men and women may fall powerless to the ground from other causes than excessive drinking. Every large town in England has on its records one or more cases in which a perfectly sober person struck down by sudden illness has been carried away to the police station, there entered as drunk, and left in a cell to die without the medical assistance which might have explained and even saved all. This is a subject on which every family must feel deeply; for it is a notorious and melancholy fact that these sudden collapses, owing to the increasing wear and tear of life, are every year coming less and less rare. These remarks are suggested by the sad fate of a constable whose death has excited much attention in Liverpool. The man bore a high character for sobriety and steadiness. The other night he was found prostrate in the street, and his comrades, assuming in their usual fashion that he was drunk, removed him to the bridewell, where he was left for hours, as it was thought, to right himself. It was at length suspected that this was no ordinary case and the poor fellow was taken to one of the infirmaries, where he soon afterwards died. The medical and other evidence at the inquest seems to prove with the greatest clearness that he had not been drinking, and that his death was due to injury to the brain \"by a fall or otherwise\". It is doubtful whether the man's life could have been saved if he had properly attended to in the first instance; but the lesson is the same, and may be commended to the attention of every Watch Committee in the kingdom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1889/jul/25/mainsection.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1889-07-25T00:09:10Z","webTitle":"From the archive: Mr Gladstone's untiringly youthful mind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1889/jul/25/mainsection.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1889/jul/25/mainsection.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"Mr Gladstone's untiringly youthful mind","bodyText":"We all know what we owe to Mr. Gladstone, or some of us at least know, but perhaps no one but Mr. Gladstone himself knows what we owe to his wife. We shall best express our sense of what we owe to the lady who completes her fiftieth year of married life today by declining to regard her as apart from her husband, and rather uniting them in our thought as they have been united in purpose, in labour, and in sympathy. And what a fifty years it has been! In the marriage register Mr. Gladstone is described as member of Parliament for Newark, where he had sat for half-a-dozen years as the friend of Sir Robert Peel and the nominee of the Duke of Newcastle. Already he had held office as an Under-Secretary of State, and men pointed to him as destined to do great things and as the rising hope of the Tory party. One half of that forecast has been fulfilled in ample measure, but the other has been strangely falsified. Nothing is more wonderful than the unceasing growth and expansion of Mr. Gladstone's mind. Lord Palmerston lived to a greater age than Mr. Gladstone has just attained and held power to the last, but long before then he had reached the limits of his political tether, and the world waited to move on till he should have passed away. But to Mr. Gladstone it would seem to have been given to carry forward to the limits of his age the privilege of youth - its elasticity, its hopefulness, its readiness to embark on new and great undertakings. Had Mr. Gladstone retired from political life even ten years ago he would already have accomplished more things and greater than any other statesman of the century. To have borne a great part in the battle of Free Trade, to have reformed the tariff, to have compelled the enfranchisement of the householders in the boroughs and to have carried their enfranchisement in the counties, to have given protection to the voter by ballot, to have laid broad and deep the foundations of a system of national education, this surely would have been praise enough and labour enough for any single man. Yet to all this Mr. Gladstone has added the greatest by far of the tasks of his life - the reconstruction of the political relations of Ireland to the remainder of the United Kingdom. Of all living men he is best able to carry it to a happy and a fruitful issue. · Attributed to GWE Russell.

In cases where no birth certificate or other certain evidence is forthcoming this is often not an easy matter, and it is only by the exercise of a good deal of ingenuity that proof of the applicant's bona-fides can be obtained. For example, one of the applications came from a Jewish resident in Cheetham, who claimed to be 70 years of age and a naturalised Englishman. But no naturalisation papers could be found. The applicant was asked if he had ever exercised the franchise, and he said he remembered voting for John Harwood in 1865. This was before the Ballot Act came into force. The papers for that year were turned up, and there it was found that the applicant had the right to vote. After verification, in so far as that is possible, the applications are submitted to the Old-age Pensions Committee. This is split up into 15 sub-committees. At present three of these committees are sitting every day, considering cases and interviewing personally applicants. Only yesterday afternoon one of the committees had before them a Darby and Joan, very tidy-looking in their black clothes and respectable, who must both have been getting on for 80. It took them several minutes to get up the Town Hall steps. It seems that they had lived for some years in America - and absence from the country is in some cases ground enough to disqualify an applicant. It is fairly safe to assume that if authorities administer the law in as broadly liberal a spirit as they can under the Act, but there is no doubt that a number of deserving old people have forfeited their claim unknowingly perhaps, through only slight failure to comply with the conditions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1918/nov/12/fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1918-11-12T12:01:23Z","webTitle":"The end of the war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1918/nov/12/fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1918/nov/12/fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"The end of the war","bodyText":"The war is over, and in a million households fathers and mothers, wives and sisters, will breathe freely, relieved at length of all dread of that curt message which has shattered the hope and joy of so many. The war is over. The drama is played out. After years of tedium there opened on March 21 a short and sharp fifth act of swift and surprising changes. Our language misses that single word applied by the Greeks to those suddenly and complete changes of fortune which they regarded as appropriate to the final act of a tragic drama. No historic change of fortune so swift, so pulverising to the loser has occurred since Napoleon's retreat from Moscow as the reversal that began on July 18. And since July 18 blow has followed blow with a rapidity which, if it has almost bewildered the victors, must have stupefied the enemy. But it is not of the drama that we would think mainly for the moment, nor even of the problem that the war has opened. For, if peace between the nations has returned, within each nation there is open or suppressed ferment. The old order in Europe has perished. The new is hardly born, and no one knows what its lineaments will be. To-morrow we shall be brought up against the hard immediate problems of re-establishment. Before we grapple with these, let us give a moment to the review of the position gained and try our best to sum up the result of four tremendous years as it may be measured by the historian. From Waterloo to Mons there elapsed almost 100 years. The first part of this period was one of peace and progress, industry and optimism. Below the surface were seething forces of democracy and nationalism, and soon these began to break forth to disturb the complacency of statesmen. But for the thinker these forces were full of hope, and the men of the mid-nineteenth century foresaw a better order, a civilised humanity, a race dedicated to the works of peace and the cultivation of a race dedicated to the works of peace and the cultivation of a gentler and yet a nobler life. Towards the end of the century their optimism gave way to a gloomier view. Unrest and anxiety took hold of the more thoughtful minds. Democracy had everywhere progressed but had not brought healing. The burden of armaments lay heavy on the nations, and the war cloud lowered dark on the horizon. The main cause of this change was the success of the Prussian system under Bismarck. The year 1870 divides the period of which we have spoken into two nearly equal halves, of progress and hope on the one side, and reaction and apprehension on the other. The union of Germany was, indeed, accepted, even welcomed, by liberally-minded men as the overdue consummation of a long and unhappy political travail, but the mode in which it was accomplished turned out to be more fateful to Germany and the world than the achievement itself. From 1870 men began to accept the doctrine of blood and iron. Ideas, arguments, appeals to right and justice took a lower place. Force and fraud seemed to make their way, if only men would be thorough in the use of them. The Prussian idea enjoyed all the prestige of immense success, and the pre-eminence of Germany in many fields of learning, backed with this prestige, won its way in the regions of the mind. The idea of humanity receded in favour of the State, freedom gave way to disciplined and organisation, right to the strong hand, reason to passion, and self-restraint to ambition. Meanwhile in one country after another there arose the sense of instability. It began to be felt that things could not last as they were. The piled-up armaments were like vast electric accumulators awaiting their discharge. In England these influences penetrated more slowly, but from the time when Germany set out seriously to become a great naval Power we felt that we, too, were being drawn in. For long years, even to the last, many of us hoped that ours might be the balancing power, so exerted as to deter either side in the great Continental combinations from a fatal plunge. But it was not to be. The Prussian idea swept Germany out of itself and gave to the world the final demonstration of naked deformity. The circumstances of the war were such that, a very few individuals apart, it united all the humanitarian enthusiasm, all the political love of liberty, which nowadays go to the support of peace, in favour of a stern resistance, carried through, at whatever cost, to indubitable victory. The defeat of Prussianism was rightly stated by Mr. Asquith at the outset as the object which included all others. Prussianism - an idea, a system, not a nation or an army - is hopelessly defeated to-day. It is defeated more completely by internal disruption than by any blow in the field. Its hold on the world's future is gone, and the human mind is empty, swept and garnished, of its worst idol. That is the real and decisive victory in the war. Into the mind that is swept and garnished the parable tells us that other devils might enter. In fact anarchy - which is disorganised in place of organised force - seems waiting at the door. But anarchy is never more than a transitory evil. When all is cleared up we believe it will be seen that by the final test as between the doctrines of might and right the foundations of a new world-order have been laid. The old sovereign nation State has destroyed itself, as the feudal nobility destroyed itself in the Wars of the Roses. As that spectacle of prolonged and senseless anarchy made men turn with relief to the order secured by the absolute monarchy, so the anarchy of the international world has forced upon people for the first time as a serious practical proposal the political organisation of civilised mankind. It is felt to be a choice between the continued risk of mutual destruction in wars which must grow ever more deadly, on the one side, and some organised form of international co-operation on the other. The world has once sacrificed its soul in hecatombs, in masses the mere figures of which will appal future eyes. It is a thing not to be done again without sapping the very vitals of human feeling. As it is, the loss of capacity in the extinction of the most promising men of a generation is a catastrophe only to be compared with some of the great historic pestilences. We were caught up in the vortex and could not escape. We had to go through it, whatever the sacrifice of life. But if, after this experience, we allow such a thing to recur, we ill repay those who have died for us in the hope of a better order. If, on the other hand, we buckle to our task we can found a nobler State than any that have gained glory in former wars, a kingdom or, say rather, a commonwealth of man, in which all the great nations that have played their part in this tragedy will have their share. In this we are achieving, not anything out of keeping with human nature, but rather the natural culmination of historic development which is, stage by stage, a movement towards more complete political organisation, of larger scope and powers, on the whole founded more broadly upon right and leaning less upon force. The nineteenth century had already built up a higher order than any that its predecessors achieved. The democratic State on the national scale, with its deepened sense of public responsibility, still conserving regard for personal freedom, was the highest political organisation yet known to the world, and the war has proved it tougher and firmer than its autocratic rival. But the States, considered together, were an arch without a keystone, and they fell to pieces. We have now to rebuild them into a world-order, and in doing so, in dispelling fear and hostility between nations, we shall remove the main obstacles to the growth of equal freedom and brotherly comradeship within. By the hundred thousand young men have died for the hope of a better world They have opened for us the way. If, as a people, we can be wise and tolerant and just in peace as we have been resolute in war, we shall build them the memorial that they have earned in the form of a world set free from military force, national tyrannies, and class oppressions, for the pursuit of a wider justice in the spirit of a deeper and more human religion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1934/jun/26/classics","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1934-06-26T15:58:07Z","webTitle":"Books of the day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1934/jun/26/classics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1934/jun/26/classics","fields":{"headline":"Books of the day","bodyText":"A STUDY OF HISTORY. By Arnold J. Toynbee. Oxford: The University Press. Three vols. 52s. 6d. net (or 21s. net each) Most people who have reached middle age can recall two or three books that have guided and illuminated their study and observation of life and history ever since they read them. Such books are not often produced today, because, as Mr. Toynbee shows in his witty comparison of historical and industrial production, they are discouraged by the turn that the writing of history has taken. He cites as an illustration of the modern fashion the fate of Mommsen, who wrote his great \"History of the Roman Republic\" as a young man and spent the rest of his long life organising the exhaustive publication of Latin inscriptions and the encyclopaedic presentation of Roman Constitutional Law. It is safe to say that there can be few people for whom the reading of Mr. Toynbee's work will not be a deeply significant event. It would have struck the imagination of any age by its originality, its range, its learning, and its power, but it has a special interest for a time like ours, when the discomfort men feel on finding their world upside down drives them to one superficial and restless interpretation after another. For here the reader is offered not some clever and arresting adaptation of the latest novelty in psychology or biology to politics but a large, measured, tranquil, and philosophical examination of history by a writer who adds to the rare intellectual equipment needed for so Herculean a task the advantage of experience of public life and contact with foreign scholars and politicians. It is impossible, of course, in the limits of a review to describe the scope and significance of such a work as this. These three volumes are the beginning of a vast undertaking to be completed in thirteen. All that a reviewer can hope to do is to indicate and illustrate its plan and method. This can best be done by showing how a reader who begins by reflecting on English history is drawn on to this huge field of study. You cannot set out the bare facts of our history without seeing that that history runs constantly into outside history. The feudal system, the Reformation, the Renaissance, the contact with the New World, the growth of industrialism - all of these suggest at once experiences that are not peculiar to England. England, then, is a member of a society, not a society apart. To understand her development you must know how other members of the same society have behaved and developed, what they in their turn have made of the feudal system, the Reformation, and the rest. Why has one member of this society behaved in one way and another in another? Why do we find that one member develops, another stands still, another collapses, and so on? And what are the limits in time and space of the society to which England belongs? Where and how do you distinguish that society from other societies? In what sense are they comparable? How many such societies does the student find in his study of history? Any why have such civilisations come to birth at all? Why has part of mankind been shaken out of \"man's long pause on the level of primitive humanity\" into an activity that we can call the \"Differentiation of Civilisation\"? These are the questions to which Mr. Toynbee seeks to find the answer, and in discussing them he gives such play to his fancy and his humour that his immense learning never becomes a burden to his pages. A passage in the first book will give the reader of this review some idea of the description and analysis of forces that is the main task of this work: A society, we should say, is confronted in the course of its life by a succession of problems, which every member has to solve for himself as best he may. The presentation of each problem is a challenge to undergo an ordeal, and through this series of ordeals the members of the society progressively differentiate themselves from one another. On each occasion some fall, while others succeed in finding a solution; and again, some of the solutions found are imperfect or commonplace or inimical to success in solving subsequent problems, while others are exact or original or fertile in possibilities of further progress. As ordeal follows ordeal, some members of the society at some moment fail altogether to adjust themselves and fall by the way; others struggle on, strained or warped or stunted; others grow in wisdom and stature, and in making their own way discover new avenues for a general advance of the society to which they belong. The second volume is taken up with a discussion of these challenges and stimuli: the stimulus of hard countries, of new ground, of blows, of pressures, and of penalisations. One of the examples that Mr. Toynbee uses may be given in order to enable the reader to follow this bare summary. In the eighth century B.C. all Hellenic communities were faced with a common problem or challenge, the problem of maintaining on diminishing resources a rapidly growing population. Corinth and other States solved it by overseas colonisation, especially in Italy and Sicily. The Spartans, instead of founding colonies, seized the land of their neighbours the Messenians. But this diverted and arrested their development, for the task of holding down the Messenians occupied and absorbed all their energy, compelling them to militarise all their institutions. As a result they have no share in the great triumphs of Greek culture in the fifth century. As Mr. Toynbee puts it: \"Thus Sparta paid the penalty for having taken her own headstrong and hazardous course at the parting of the ways in the eighth century B.C. by condemning herself in the sixth century to standing still - with arms presented like a soldier on parade - at a moment when other Hellenes were just moving forward once again on one of the most signal moves in the whole course of Hellenic history.\" Athens neglected colonisation but averted the social revolution that was provoked by extreme distress by specialising agricultural production for export, introducing manufactures for export, and adapting her political institutions. In this way she opened up a new avenue of advance for the whole of the Hellenic society and inspired and directed the life of what we call the Hellenistic Age, the age in which Greek ideas spread over the conquests, first of Alexander, then of Rome. Thus the common problem set to the different members of this society found three different solutions, and the subsequent history of each member was decided by the response to this challenge. Mr Toynbee's work is an attempt to interpret civilisation in its origins, its growth, and its varieties by the light of such a knowledge of history as few of his contemporaries possess. Its value for our own bewildered age is obvious. For it puts to flight all those exclusive and separatist ideas that have flourished on the worship of the nation and the still worse idolatry of race. Nothing could be happier or more characteristic of the spirit and method of his work than his account of the Nordic theory. In the French Revolution the pedants delighted in the thought that the Gauls, after fourteen centuries of subjection, were driving out the French nobility, their Frankish conquerors. The nobility took up the challenge in the person of De Gobineau, who replied that it was the Nordic blood which flowed in the veins of the Franks that had given Rome and Greece their strength and virtue. The \"heavy-footed German philologists\" took over the idea from the vivacious Frenchman, and found the original home of this invigorating race in that portion of the North European plain which happened to be occupied by the kingdom of Prussia. Houston Chamberlain pressed the theory farther, finding a Nordic ancestry for Dante and for Christ. Then it crossed the Atlantic, first to encourage the self-esteem of the defeated South, and then to encourage a new and exclusive arrogance in the North. So Mr. Toynbee chases round the world the egocentric manias that make men dangerous to each other and ridiculous to the Muse of History. His work can only be tested in detail by those who can rival his knowledge, but nobody can doubt its immense importance to an age that is in disorder because men's habits of mind keep them in a small world while their economic life puts them in a large."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1939/sep/04/secondworldwar.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1939-09-04T10:41:57Z","webTitle":"The ultimatum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1939/sep/04/secondworldwar.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1939/sep/04/secondworldwar.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"The ultimatum","bodyText":"We were in consultation all day yesterday with the French Government, and we felt that the intensified action which the Germans were taking against Poland allowed no delay in making our position clear. Accordingly we decided to send to our Ambassador in Berlin instructions which he was to hand at nine o'clock this morning to the German Foreign Secretary, which read as follows: - Sir:-In the communication which I had the honour to make to you on September 1, I informed you on the instructions of his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that unless the German Government were prepared to give his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom satisfactory assurances that the German Government had suspended all aggressive action Poland and were prepared promptly to withdraw their forces from Polish territory his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom would without hesitation fulfil their obligations to Poland. Although it is now more than twenty-four hours ago no reply has been received, and German attacks on Poland have continued and intensified. I have therefore to inform you that unless not later than 11 a.m. British Summer Time to-day, September 3, satisfactory assurances to the above effect have been given by the German Government and have reached his Majesty's Government in London: a state of war would exist between the two countries as from that hour. Sir that was a final Note. No such undertaking was received by the time stipulated and consequently this country is now at war with Germany. I am in a position to inform this House that according to arrangements made between the British and French Governments, the French Ambassador in Berlin is at this moment making a similar demarche, also accompanied by a definite time-limit. The House has already been made aware of our plans and, as I said the other day, we are ready. It is a sad day for all of us. For none is it sadder than for me. (Subdued cheers.) Everything that I worked for, everything that I had hoped for, everything that I believed in during my public life has crashed into ruins this morning. There is only one thing left for me, and that is to devote what strength and powers I have to forwarding the victory of the cause for which we have to sacrifice so much.

I learn authoritatively that Ribbentrop, taking advantage of the wide powers granted by the rules of the Court in calling witnesses for the defence, has applied through his counsel, Dr. Fritz Sauter, for a number of prominent British witnesses to testify on his behalf, including Lord Vansittart, who was Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office during Ribbentrop's tenure as Ambassador to London; Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Rothermere, and Lord Kemsley. Ribbentrop also included Lord Dawson of Penn, apparently in ignorance of his death. Only three in uniform The prisoners appeared in the order of their names in the indictment and are seated in two rows, with Goering occupying the right-hand corner of the dock facing the raised judges' bench. Behind him, beginning the second row of ten, is Admiral Doenitz, an almost insignificant figure in civilian clothes. Only three of the prisoners, indeed, are in uniform, stripped of insignia and badges - Goering in an elegant pale grey Luftwaffe uniform, presumably his own creation, and the soldiers Keitel and Jodl, in the familiar grey green of the Wehrmacht. Looking at the men in the dock, there was little in their bearing or appearance to suggest that they were on trial for their lives. The enormity of the charges against them, involving the deaths of millions of people, somehow eluded reality in this unemotional, analytical atmosphere. The whole day's sitting was taken up with the reading of the 24,000-word indictment and as counsel of the United States, Great Britain, France, and Russia took up the sections on which they are leading the accused barely followed the proceedings. They had the German text in their hands 30 days ago and in the solitude of their cells have had time to assimilate its resonant words. Goering's smile Goering, far less gross than in the old days and looking remarkably fit save for the heavy sadness of his eyes, permitted himself a discreet smile at the mention of the million bottles of champagne looted from France and it was Hess at his side who for the general tenseness of his bearing was constantly to be remarked among the defendants - Hess and the insolent laugh of Hans Frank, seated in the middle of the front row. Hess was strained and taut. His dark, burning eyes were continually roving about the court when they were not absorbed in a novel he had brought into the dock with him and he smiled cynically when at the outset the batteries of floodlights were switched on overhead for the cameramen operating from apertures constructed for the purpose high in the walls. Sometimes he engaged Ribbentrop on his left in animated conversation, once he made a remark to Goering, but Goering, chin in hand and gazing thoughtfully at nothing, ignored him. As for the others, they might almost have been attending some business convention. Dr. Schacht has never looked more benign or the chief of the German Army and Navy more Prussian and stolid.

His assailant, who was shot dead by the bodyguard, was an Arab who had been a member of a military force associated with the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem. Assassin a follower of the ex-Mufti King Abdullah of Jordan was assassinated by an Arab yesterday at the entrance to the El Aqsa Mosque, in the Old City of Jerusalem. The assassin, who had hidden behind the main gate of the mosque, shot at close range and was himself immediately shot dead by the King's bodyguard. The King, who was 69, died instantly. His elder son, the Emir Talal, is undergoing medical treatment abroad, and in his absence the younger son, Prince Naif, took the oath of allegiance as Regent at a meeting of the Council of Ministers. The King's body was flown to the capital, Amman, and will be buried in the Royal Cemetery on Monday. A state of emergency has been proclaimed throughout the country. The assassin is reported to have been identified as Mustafa Shukri Ashshu, a 21-year-old tailor in the Old City. During the Arab-Jewish war he was a member of the \"dynamite squad\" attached to the Arab irregular forces which were associated with the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and became bitter enemies of Abdullah. Information was received at the Jordan Legation in London last night that several men were concerned in the crime. Search for accomplices Jordan guards stopped all traffic between the Jordan and Israel sectors of Jerusalem and closed the frontier at noon, fifteen minutes after the assassination. A search was made in the Old City for accomplices. The Aqsa Mosque, where the King was murdered as he was about to attend noon prayers, is within half a mile of the Israeli border. Azzam Pasha, Secretary-General of the Arab League, said in Alexandria yesterday that he was going to Amman immediately to express the regret of the Arab world. \"King Abdullah served the Arab States all his life and the assassination is a crime condemned by every religion.\" The Regent of Iraq and the Jordan Minister in London will fly to Amman to-day. Messages of condolence have been sent from the Middle Eastern capitals to the Jordan Royal Family. At the United Nations headquarters in New York, Dr. Ralph Bunche, the former Acting Mediator in Palestine, said: \"King Abdullah was a unique personality in the modern world. He was a philosopher and poet, but he was also a realist and politically very astute. He was one of the most c harming men I have ever known. In all my dealings with him in connection with the Palestine dispute, I found him always friendly and reasonable and one whose word could be fully trusted.\" General William Riley, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Commission in Palestine, said: \"I regret exceedingly the loss of a very fine individual with whom I have been associated with both personally and officially, on matters pertaining the Palestine problems over the past three years. I have lost a good friend.\" A French Foreign Office spokesman said the assassination was seen as an alarming sign of increasing tension and instability in the Middle East. This was more especially so as it followed the killing of Riad Bey es Sohl, the former Premier of the Lebanon, who was assassinated at Amman four days ago. Four assassinations King Abdullah is the fourth Moslem leader to be assassinated in four months. General Razmara, the Persian Prime Minister, like King Abdullah, was shot while entering a mosque by a member of the Fidiyan Islam sect on March 7. Twelve days later his close friend Dr Abdul Hamid Zanganeh, a Minister of Education, was shot on the steps of Tehran University, also by a member of Fidiyan Islam. The third murder was that of Riad es Sohl, in Jordan. He had visited King Abdullah and was on his way to the airport to return to Beirut. His murderers were said to be members of the Syrian Nationalist party. The Crown Prince Talal, who is 40, is now undergoing medical treatment following a \"general health deterioration which has produced nerve weakness.\" Prince Naif, the new Regent, went to Sandhurst after spending some time in the desert with a nomad tribe. Prince Talal's son, the 14-year-old Prince Hussein, is now studying at Victoria College, Alexandria. The young King Feisal of Iraq, who is now at school in Britain, is Abdullah's great-nephew. Abdullah's father, King Hussein, was deposed as ruler of the Hejaz by King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, beginning a feud between the two families which ended after 25 years when Abdullah paid a state visit to Saudi Arabia in 1948. Abdullah's part in stabilising Middle East The news of the assassination of King Abdullah of Jordan has been received with profound distress and horror in London. A message of sympathy has been sent by the King to the family of King Abdullah. The kingdom of Jordan was one of the stabilising elements in the Middle East. For this Abdullah was himself primarily responsible. He leaves behind him, however, a strong Government headed by an energetic and competent Prime Minister. It may be hoped, therefore, that the immediate effects on law and order in Jordan may not prove as disastrous as they would probably be in other Arab countries. The assassin is stated to be an Arab tailor, formerly a member of forces associated with the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem. This might give some indication of the purpose which lay behind the act. The ex-Mufti, who spent part of the war in Berlin giving such assistance as he could to the Germans, has long been a bitter political enemy of King Abdullah. After Britain surrendered the mandate over Palestine the ex-Mufti put himself at the head of a movement to create an Arab State in Palestine. In 1950, after the fighting between the Arab States and Israel had been brought to an end, King Abdullah formally incorporated within his kingdom that part of Palestine which bordered on Jordan and which was still occupied by his troops. This step was subsequently recognised by the British and American Governments. It naturally provoked the bitter enmity of the ex-Mufti, whose movement for an Arab Palestine State has steadily been losing support ever since. No information has, however, yet reached London connecting the assassination of King Abdullah directly with the ex-Mufti's movement. The ex-Mufti is believed to be in Syria at present. Mr Churchill said to-day, after learning of the assassination: \"I deeply regret the murder of this wise and faithful Arab ruler, who never deserted the cause of Britain and held out the hand of reconciliation to Israel.\" The Israeli Minister in London commented: \"The assassination of King Abdullah has not only deprived the people of Jordan of their monarch but constitutes a serious blow to peace and stability in the Middle East. King Abdullah was a man who worked hard for understanding and peace between Israel and Jordan and whose efforts, if successful, would have contributed much to the welfare and progress of the entire area.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1952/feb/09/fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1952-02-09T11:43:06Z","webTitle":"The Proclamation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1952/feb/09/fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1952/feb/09/fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"The Proclamation","bodyText":"Manchester, Saturday All those who heard the Accession of Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed yesterday will have been struck by the splendour and dignity of its wording. The Proclamation is a significant document and one that is any many ways symbolic of that constant yet constantly changing compact the British Constitution. Its language and the procedure by which it is drawn up go back substantially to 1603, when the Proclamation was issued in James I's absence in Scotland. But the slight modifications which its stately sentences have undergone from one reign to the next speak of deep changes in the standing and possessions of the Crown. Thus Elizabeth II had been proclaimed \" Queen of this Realm and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth,\" whereas her grandfather George V was hailed \"of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King .... Emperor of India\": India has not dropped out of the roll of the Sovereign's attributes, but stays in it among the nations which acknowledge her as head of their society. Still earlier changes may be seen reflected in the proclamation of Victoria as \"Queen of the United Kingdom, and Ireland,\" and in that of George III as \"King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.\" As for the proclamation of the Sovereign as \"Defender of the Faith,\" this was, up to and including the accession of William IV, followed by the words \"and so forth.\" The three words were significant for they were descended from the \"&amp;c.\" with which, after a period of Roman Catholic domination, Elizabeth at once implicitly claimed and forbore to name the title of: \"Head of the Church\" that had been her father's and her brother's. The most interesting feature of the Accession Proclamation is that it is issued in the name of \"the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of this Realm\" assisted by the Privy Council, \"other Principal Gentlemen of Quality,\" the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of London and (again a new touch) \"representatives of other Members of the Commonwealth.\" This assemblage does not have its task assigned to it by statute. It goes back to Anglo-Saxon and medieval times when the new King, even when he took the Crown of hereditary right and when his title was neither disputed nor threatened - which it often was - needed to be elected and confirmed by the highest dignitaries of the land. There is thus a thread connecting those who signed yesterday's Proclamation with the Witan and Common Council of the early Middle Ages and with Parliaments which, when the doctrine of hereditary succession had taken stronger root, still confirmed the right of Henry VII and James I to the Throne. The Accession Declaration by the new Sovereign is no mere formality either: at least one past Declaration, that of James II, was of historical importance since it contained an undertaking to defend and support the Church of England and to respect the laws - an undertaking which, after the Revolution, could be used to show that the King had broken a compact between himself and his people. However much these forms may seem to reflect changes and contentions long past, they do serve to show that the accession to the new Queen is in truth greeted \"with one Voice and Consent of Tongue and Heart.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/1957/nov/04/spaceexploration.archive","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"1957-11-04T15:38:49Z","webTitle":"Space travel comes true – archive, 1957","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1957/nov/04/spaceexploration.archive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/1957/nov/04/spaceexploration.archive","fields":{"headline":"Space travel comes true – archive, 1957","bodyText":"The second Russian satellite has demonstrated not only that space travel is practicable but that it has come true. Tass said early yesterday that the latest satellite contains a dog, later described to be a female of the Russian breed which is smaller than but similar to the husky. At the same time the weight of the instruments, batteries, food, and dog kennel which the satellite carries was said to be half a ton. The Tass statement makes it clear that this weight is in addition to the weight of the last stage of the carrier rocket, to which, however, the satellite appears still to be attached. The orbit of the new satellite is a much more ambitious one than that of the first. According to a report form Moscow last night, the greatest height of the satellite so far to be measured is 1,700km. The same report says that the period of the satellite's rotation is 103.7 minutes. This implies that the average height of the satellite round its orbit is nearly 1,100km. This is more than twice the average height of the first satellite, which still circles the earth. It follows that the new Russian venture will stay in the sky for several years unless it is brought down by some mechanism which it may carry. Confirmed Last night Moscow radio followed the announcement of the satellite's successful launching with a familiar time-table of its expected progress over the major cities of the world. The information about the inclination of the orbit of the satellite given in the original Tass statement appears to have been confirmed during the day . In this respect the orbit is much like that of the first satellite - inclined at something like 65 degrees to the Equator of the earth. One notable difference, however, which will prove a mixed blessing for the observers in this country, is that Great Britain will pass under the new orbit during daylight hours. As a result radio reception will be more difficult, but night work will not be necessary. The dog is reported by Moscow to have been trained for her journey by previous laboratory experiments and by flights in actual rockets. So that she would not eat all her food at once, she has been conditioned in a Pavlovian experiment to eat only at the sound of a bell, which is rung inside her pressurised and air-conditioned compartment at regular intervals. Records of her respiratory activity and pulse rate are being telemetred back to earth by the radio-transmitters. They will be valuable signs of the way in which the dog is standing up to prolonged exposure to the sensation of weightlessness which future space travellers must expect. It will not be possible to tell how the dog is affected by the cosmic radiation to which she will be exposed unless she is recovered on earth. This implies that the Russians will attempt to bring her back to earth. That this is so is confirmed by reports from the East German news agency last night, based on an article in the current Soviet \"Aviation Review.\" Technically the problem should not be insuperable. Means of descent First it will be necessary for the dog and her pressurised compartment to be thrown out of the orbit in which she is now carried. This could be done by a separate rocket, as yet unburnt, by an explosive charge or even by a simple mechanical spring catapult. However, the launch back to earth would have to be carried out with some precision: the later stages of the descent would have to be slowed down by some parachute arrangement and some means would have to be provided for protecting the dog's compartment from the heat that would be generated on first entry into the dense atmosphere. This, it will be noticed, is the problem of arranging that ballistic missiles fall safely back to earth. It may well be that the weight of the arrangements needed to do this accounts for the great mass of the Russian satellite, which yesterday provided scientists with material for speculation. The instruments needed to measure cosmic rays and the sun's radiation need not weigh more than a hundred weight, even with the power supplies. Radio transmitters and batteries would not take up more than that weight, while the dog and her kennel should not weigh much more. This leave at least half the weight of the instrumentation unaccounted for. 250-ton rocket Weight is the starting point for another speculation: what kind of rocket was used to launch this satellite? If the rocket fuels available to Western engineers are taken as a starting point, it can be calculated that the initial weight of the rocket would have been between five hundred and a thousand tons for every ton put into orbit. This implies that the initial rocket structure would have weighed about 250 tons or more. The size of this vehicle is hard to imagine. Its cost would not have been less than several million pounds. In the circumstances it would appear all too probable that the Russians have developed some kind of rocket fuel which is not available in the West. Otherwise the sheer physical size of their latest project could not have allowed them to carry it off with such speed and success. It is unlikely that they have developed some means of exploiting atomic energy for rocket propulsion because the inherent problems of this task have only recently been recognised. But it may easily be that they have found some means of burning fuels like metallic boron and compounds of this which exploit the greater inherent energy of these materials. In the circumstances it would appear that the Russian ballistic missiles could be built on less gigantic lines than those which have until now been thought necessary in the West. This would also mean that Russian rockets could more easily be put into production than the vehicles being developed in the United States. More bleeps The arrangements for telemetering information back to the ground from the second satellite appear to be much the same as those from the used previously. Broadcasts are being made on frequencies of 20 and 40 mcs. The first frequency is a continuous transmission. The second is \"keyed\" into a bleeping form, and is modulated with a coded form of information being sent. Radio observations of the new satellite were carried out yesterday at several stations in the United Kingdom. At the Mullard Observatory, Cambridge, scientists from the Cavendish Laboratory heard seven transits - including the first in this country at 5.58."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1960/jul/01/congo","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1960-07-01T17:01:49Z","webTitle":"Marred","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1960/jul/01/congo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1960/jul/01/congo","fields":{"headline":"Marred","bodyText":"Marred It might have been guessed that the launching of the new Republic of Congo would prove a stormy affair after all the angry preliminaries of the last few weeks. Certainly all who guessed this were not disappointed. At the ceremony, in the Parliament Building, when the new republic was formally proclaimed today the Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba, made such a pugnacious speech attacking the colonial regime of the Belgians that King Baudouin nearly decided to end his own part in the independence ceremonies then and there and take his plane back to Belgium. The official programme was delayed for an hour while he and the Congolese leaders discussed the contretemps and tempers cooled. The king wisely decided to finish the short programme as planned and flew off again this evening. But he took with him an unpleasant memory of a speech by Lumumba, which can only be described as offensive. Royal dignity There can be few moments in history more poignant than those when a king comes to hand over the major part of his kingdom to a republican president. King Baudouin, in spite of the dreadful symbolism of the incident on the drive from the airport last night, when his sword was snatched from his car by an eccentric souvenir-hunter, behaved with great dignity. The crown around the wide square of the Palais des Nations was as small, and as unenthusiastic as an independence crowd could very well be. There were only about four thousand there, due, perhaps, to the confusion caused by hasty arrangements. But the shouts of \"Le Roi\" from loyal Belgians as the King entered the Parliament Building was the first cheering note for him. His speech contained no apologies for the colonial system, but was instead intended as a vindication of it. That was perhaps considered provocation by M. Lumumba. In a speech punctuated by ceremonial gunfire, the King declared: \"The independence of the Congo is the crowning of the work conceived by the genius of King Leopold II undertaken by him with firm courage, and continued by Belgium with perseverance. Independence marks a decisive hour in the destinies not only of the Congo herself but- I don't hesitate to say-of the whole of Africa. Slave Trade \"For eighty years Belgium has sent your land the best of her sons, first to deliver the Congo basin from the odious slave trade which was decimating its population. Later to bring together the different tribes which, though former enemies, are now preparing to form the greatest of the Independent states of Africa.\" King Baudouin went on to speak of the achievements of the pioneers \"who deserve admiration from us and acknowledgement from you\". He mentioned the achievements in building communications, founding a medical service, modernising agriculture and building cities and industries and schools. Saying that Belgium had not hesitated to recognise the great movement of independence which fills all of Africa, the King added in a frank phrase: \"It is your job, gentlemen, to show that we were right in trusting you\". He went further and warned them about their immense task and \"the principal dangers, which menace you\". These he said were the inexperience of the population at governing itself, the tribal struggles which did so much harm in the past and must never return at any price and \"the attraction which some foreign Powers exercise on certain regions, Powers which are ready to profit from the least show of weakness.\" He told the Congolese not to \"compromise the future with hasty reforms\" and assured them that Belgium was ready to help with advice, with technicians and with officials. Remarks omitted The tone of this speech was not maternalistic, but it must have sounded to the Congolese like a Dutch uncle speaking. The Head of State, Joseph Kasabuvu, at any rate cut from his speech of reply the last five paragraphs he had prepared in which he had made generous acknowledgements of the Kings; solicitude for all his peoples \"whom he has loved and protected\". He did, nevertheless pay this tribute to Belgium: \"Belgium then had the wisdom not to oppose the current of history, and-a deed without precedent in the story of peaceful decolonisation-she let our country pass directly from foreign domination to full independence.\" Another reason which has been suggested for the cutting of Kasabuvu's speech was that, though unscheduled, M. Lumumba decided to make one of his own. It was this speech which caused tempers to rise. He spoke many times of \"the struggle\" against colonisation, \"an indispensable struggle to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed on us by force.\" He added: \"Our wounds are too fresh and too smarting for us to be able to have known ironies, insults, and blows which we had to undergo morning, noon and night because we were Negroes. We have seen our lands spoiled in the name of laws which only recognised the right of the strongest. We have known laws which differed according to whether it dealt with a black man or a white. \"We have known the atrocious sufferings of those who were imprisoned for their political opinions or religious beliefs and of those exiled in their own country. Their fate was worse than death itself. Who will forget the rifle-fire from which so many of our brothers perished, or the gaols in to which were brutally thrown those who did not want to submit to a regime of justice, oppression and exploitation which were the means the colonialists employed to dominate us?\" The only words which Belgians might have thought kind, came after M. Lumumba spoke of future collaboration with foreign countries and added \"in this sphere even Belgium who, understanding in the end the sense of history, did not try any harder to oppose our independence, is prepared to give us her help and friendship.\" But at that moment it looked as if Belgian friendship was stone-dead. At the end of this speech the King left the chamber, clutching his sword tightly and the ceremonies were held up for an hour. The small crowd outside was pushed and prodded back from the roadway by platoons of police and troops with rifles and fixed bayonets. At length the King came out with M. Kasabuvu, made a quick visit to the pioneers cemetery and returned to the official luncheon thrown for some five hundred guests in open tents on a lawn overlooking Brazzaville across the river. Later tribute At the luncheon M. Lumumba made another short speech (it is said at the suggestion of M. van der Meersch, the former resident Minister) in which he smoothed tempers somewhat. In it he said: \" At the moment when the Congo reaches independence, the whole Government wishes to pay solemn homage to the King of the Belgians and to the noble people he represents for the work done here over three quarters of a century. For I would not wish my feelings to be wrongly interpreted.\" After that the celebrations went better. In the afternoon a larger crowd gathered to cheer the procession of troops, sportsmen, and youth groups, which paraded past King Baudouin and the Congolese leaders. They marched to such world-wide liberation tunes as \"Marching Through Georgia,\" so hasty has been the Congo's march to independence that there was not even a national anthem ready for the occasion, and the blue flags with one large yellow star and six smaller stars which fill the streets are likely to be scrapped later, because the design is thought to be too close to the old colonial standard. Speed of events King Baudouin left the Congo this evening while it was still formally his kingdom, for independence comes officially at midnight. Tomorrow the Congo will be for him simply a country with which Belgium has signed a treaty to \"consult on a footing of equality on all matters of common interest\" and to exchange diplomatic missions of a special though undisclosed status. One is left wondering whether the Congolese leaders will ponder the King's avuncular advice and his reminder that: \"The entire world has its eyes fixed on you.\" The speed with which Lumumba and Kasabuvu were able to reconcile their differences and form a Government was, indeed, an example to the rest of Africa, and both of them in their speeches today spoke solemnly of the problems, the responsibilities, and hard work that lies ahead. But on an occasion, when the calibre of Congolese leadership was under the microscope, from 65 visiting delegations, Lumumba's speech soured the taste of many. The Congo has need of all the unselfish friends she can attract, and equally needs to keep those she already possesses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1972/feb/12/bloodysunday.northernireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1972-02-12T15:00:13Z","webTitle":"Will Ulster fight?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/feb/12/bloodysunday.northernireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1972/feb/12/bloodysunday.northernireland","fields":{"headline":"Will Ulster fight?","bodyText":"Is there a danger of Protestant violence in Northern Ireland? And in what circumstances? Anyone who purports to give firm answers o these questions must be suspect, for any answer strengthens or weakens the negotiating position of one side or the other in the compromise which is the only alternative to civil strife in Ulster. But the questions ought to be asked and the possibilities analysed; otherwise discussion of the Ulster question is conducted in a dangerous half-light. The alienation of the Catholic community from Stormont and the British is understood, and has been savagely confirmed by the deaths in Derry. The Protestant discontent is less in the news because, since the frightening riots and burning of August 1969, the Protestants have been quieter than anyone would have dared to prophesy. It is important first to try to establish why the IRA's long campaign of killing, maiming, and destruction has not produced a reaction from the Protestants. One precedent one might have expected a parallel campaign of urban guerrilla activity directed at Catholic areas, with incendiariasm as the traditional Protestant alternative to the IRA's bombing. But since the arrival of the British army in force, and particularly since its campaign against the IRA began to achieve some success, even Protestant militants have come to believe that they have more to lose than to gain by militant action. Belief in how firm the British pledges to Ulster are varies from month to month, from person to person, and even from one of Mr Harold Wilson's speeches to the next. But only the most myopic Orangemen thinks that the British public would long tolerate its army facing both the IRA and a Protestant counterpart. There comes a balancing point in any such equation of possible gains and losses, however. To put the question bluntly: When would it be to the advantage of the Protestant case to \"make facts\" which would help them in any negotiations - as the Israelis have done, as industrial militants do in the runup to wage talks, as the Catholics (or so the Protestants would argue) have done in Ulster? Many Protestants look at the events as different as the Derry deaths and the peaceful march at Newry with deep scepticism, seeing each as a contrived Republican trick for raising the stakes. In the same way many Catholics regard the very suggestion that Protestant violence is possible as a s spurious negotiating counter. How would the Protestants \"make facts\"? At the moderate end of the scale, they might organise demonstrations like that at Newry - not Orange marches, but modelled rather on the huge Unionist rallies of the Home Rule period. At these, ironically, the Protestants also would be asserting their civil right: to self-determination on the basis of one man, one vote. At the other end of the scale the probable alternatives are the kind of sectarian arson campaign in which Protestant took part in the 1920s and again in 1969, or an urban guerrilla operation on the Provisional IRA model. But the type of action to be feared can only be seriously studied by considering what might provoke it. It must be said at once that this fear need not unduly inhibit the British Government in its day-by-day dealings with Stormont, though doubtless it will be raised sometimes as a bogy. For example, if Mr Maudling decided to enforce the ban against Orange parades, while accepting the inevitable in Republican heartlands like Newry and Derry, by merely keeping illegality to the minimum, this would understandably seem to most Protestants (and probably Englishmen as well) to be unequal. But it would scarcely provoke a disaster. Orangeism is not a breaking point, and the loose description of all Ulster Protestants as Orangemen, which is sometimes adopted in Britain, badly clouds the discussion. The Orange Order no longer represents the main body of Protestant opinion, if it ever did. The events of the past three years will have confirmed the belief of many unionists with a small \"u\" - and they are the real silent majority - that such ephemera as the Twelfth of July are not he epitome of their liberties or their British citizenship. As the argument has developed the link with Britain and the restoration of peace have become all that matter to the main body of Protestant opinion. Protestants are angry with the Catholic community for failing to resist the IRA; there is an imaginative block, created by their own misfortunes, which prevents their understanding the deep Catholic alienation since August 1969 and since internment. But a deal with the Catholics is unlikely to cause widespread Protestant violence. It seems unlikely, for example, that the Unionist Government would get a massive Protestant support if it appeared intransigent when the British Government revealed its intention to bring Republican MPs into the Stormont administration. For many Protestants think that the most damning indictment of the Unionist Party is that its intransigence has put the Union with Britain at risk for the first time in 60 years. The Unionists' continued sole occupancy of power is not a fighting issue. Any serious breach of the Protestant ascendancy would, of course, anger Orange extremists. But just as the IRA could be dealt with while it enjoyed little support among ordinary Catholics (that is, before 1969 and in earlier campaigns), so could those Protestants who probably have organisations and access to weapons. Without active sympathy in the Protestant community they would be in a worse position than was the IRA, for they would not even have sanctuary across the Border or the Irish Sea. Direct rule or transfer of responsibility for security represent a more definite risk and will probably only be attempted when all else has failed. But even these might divide rather than unite Protestant opinion. Many moderate people take the phrase \"full British citizenship\" literally. Nothing would please them better than to live under the West Riding or Ayrshire County Council without having to leave homes and jobs. Weary of the mud which has been thrown at them in the past three years, such people might peacefully accept the removal of Stormont on two conditions: that it would bring peace and government by consent and that it was not a half -way house to losing their British link against their will and in breach of repeated promises by Labour and Conservative Governments. It is important to understand that for such people British citizenship is a positive rather than a negative matter. The motives, like all motives to do with nationality, are mixed - sentiment, economics, social attitudes. To discuss Irish unity only in terms of amendments to the Republic's constitution which would make Ireland as much like England as possible, in order to be palatable to the Northern Protestants, is another clouding of the issue. If the only way to persuade Catholics that they were to have fair administration was by direct rule, and if the Protestants believed that the Catholics would accept that without further strings, a surprising number of Protestants, perhaps a majority, might now agree to the abolition of Stormont, or at least to its suspension until a new pattern of government by consent could be created. But if they saw this as part of a slide towards an eventual sellout and a reneging on the guarantees of self-determination, they almost certainly would not accept. For it is on the issue of exclusion from the United Kingdom and forcible inclusion in the Republic that Protestants remain cohesive. It is the only issue which is likely to provide Protestant guerrillas with the solid base in their community which the IRA now has among Catholics. And just as the IRA gained its base first after the Catholics realised in 1969 that they had no effective protection against Protestant violence, so the trigger for the Protestants would be the threat of withdrawal of the British army and the danger that they would have no protection against the IRA. Mr Heath and Mr Maudling can probably proceed, with caution, up to that point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1972/mar/25/northernireland.past","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1972-03-25T14:35:54Z","webTitle":"Fresh start - Heath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/mar/25/northernireland.past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1972/mar/25/northernireland.past","fields":{"headline":"Fresh start - Heath","bodyText":"Mr Heath last night presented his Government's decision to impose direct rule in Northern Ireland as an opportunity for a fresh start in the intractable problem of John Bull's other island, and appealed on television to the people of Ulster to put the past behind them and devote themselves to building a peaceful and prosperous future. It was perhaps the most momentous broadcast to the British people by any British Prime Minister since Mr Churchill's wartime radio addresses. Behind it lies a complex series of disputes and disagreements within Mr Heath's Cabinet resolved only early this week when the Prime Minister finally obtained the unanimous consent of his colleagues for the course he proposed to take. The decision to suspend the Stormont Parliament for at least a year, and to impose direct Westminster rule through the appointment of Mr William Whitelaw as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, staggered Ulster Unionist MPs and many of their Right wing Conservative colleagues. It was immediately clear that this watershed in Westminster's relations with Northern Ireland had created a critical new situation for the Government in the Commons, with the balance of power in doubt over the whole field of Government legislation, from the Common Market downwards. Mr Whitelaw, who does not formally assume the office of Secretary of State until the Bill becomes law, will make his first official visit to his new and turbulent parish today. He will meet the Governor, Lord Grey, who now ceases to have any powers whatever, and also the Stormont civil servants whose allegiance is to be transferred to him. He will have talks also with the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland, General Tuzo, and senior officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who now come under Mr Whitelaw's direction. No one, least of all Mr Whitelaw, is in any doubt about the hazards, political and physical, which face him. But in spite of the dangers, there was some hope at Westminster last night that the impact of Mr Heath's announcement would bring about at the very least a pause in the violence in Northern Ireland, with both sides taking time out to consider the new situation. Mr Whitelaw, it is felt, has both the charm and the stature to make the best of even a brief honeymoon. Many Conservative and Unionist backbenchers were unable to believe that the Cabinet was ready to take such radical action until they heard yesterday's statement by Mr Heath in the Commons. The small group of Ulster Unionist MPs immediately decided that they would oppose the second reading next Tuesday of the Government's short but sweeping Bill to transfer the powers of Stormont to the new Secretary of State, and there is every sign that a number of Conservatives may back them in this revolt. There is no danger that this move, by a relatively modest minority on the Tory benches, will threaten the Government's majority for the Bill, since Mr Wilson made it clear in the Commons yesterday that the Opposition would give its full support to the Government in carrying through its Northern Ireland proposals. But the creation of a new group of deeply disaffected MPs in the Conservative Party clearly poses new and highly unwelcome problems for a Government whose overall majority in the Commons is only 27. For Mr Heath, the decision represents a calculated risk, in the belief that the transfer of responsibility for law and order and the phasing out of internment by measured stages will provide the opportunity for the non-violent representatives of the vast majority of Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland to come forward at last, and take part in the all-party talks on the future of Ulster which Ministers have been vainly offering to them since last summer. The immediate response was a solemn promise from Mr Gerry Fitt, Social Democratic and Labour Party MP for West Belfast, that his party would examine the proposals \"not with the aim of any political gain but in the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland.\" Mr Fitt is now in a position to tell his SDLP colleagues at home in Northern Ireland that the Government's new proposals meet almost all of their demands, and represent virtually total victory for their stand. The signs are that they will indeed respond to the appeal to join in talks, or face the inevitable accusation of total irresponsibility. The package which Mr Heath put before the Commons yesterday covered three main points. The first two were straightforward proposals for: 1. The release of some hundreds of internees in the next few weeks, as the first step in phasing out internment altogether; and, 2. The creation of new procedures to conduct regular plebiscites in Northern Ireland as the ultimate test of opinion on Ulster's continued status as part of the United Kingdom. Mr Heath was emphatic that there could be no change in this status without the consent of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland, or without the eventual consent of a revived Northern Ireland Parliament. But the key passage in Mr Heath's package was: 3. The proposal to transfer the entire responsibility for security, and law and order, from Stormont to Westminster. It was this which was flatly rejected by Mr Faulkner earlier in the week, backed by the unanimous decision of his Cabinet to resign en bloc if Mr Heath persisted in his demand. In his broadcast last night, the Prime Minister held out the prospect of a fourth - and potentially even more important - item in his package, once the violence has come to an end: the offer of massive economic aid to put Northern Ireland on its feet again. \"This Government,\" he said, \"is ready to give the help that will be needed to repair the destruction of recent months, to attract new industries, and to provide more jobs. I say to the people of Northern Ireland: now is your chance - a chance for fairness, a chance for prosperity, and above all a chance for peace.\" Mr Heath told the Commons yesterday that he and his colleagues in the Westminster Cabinet held to the view that the transfer of responsibility for security was \"an indispensable condition for progress in finding a political solution in Northern Ireland.\" It was this determination which led to the submission of the Stormont Government's mass resignation, which in turn determined Mr Heath's decision to go ahead with the appointment of a new Secretary of State for the province, charged with the responsibility for all the governmental functions formerly carried out by Stormont. There is no doubt that Mr Heath has taken fully into account the possibility of dissent on the Conservative back benches. The Prime Minister has already heard most of the arguments around the table in his own Cabinet room, and succeeded in defeating his ministerial opponents with the aid of Mr Faulkner's intransigence. If the initiative was a calculated risk, one of the risks which had been carefully calculated and discounted was a Tory revolt. However, at least one Conservative MP came out against the Government's initiative last night. Mr Tom Trafford told his constituents at The Wrekin, Shropshire: \"I believe the initiative taken by the Government is wrong. We have surrendered to terrorism.\" He said he now found it impossible to vote for the legislation bringing it into effect on Tuesday. Labour anti-Marketeers were last night estimating a steady decline in the Government's already narrow majorities on the European Communities Bill if the Unionists and their friends choose to use their votes as a weapon against the Government. Labour pro-Marketeers, on the other hand, were gloomily considering the possibility that more of them may have to defy the party whip in order to assure a Government majority for entry into the EEC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1972/mar/25/past.ianaitken","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1972-03-25T18:31:38Z","webTitle":"Stormont suspended - Heath: fresh start","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1972/mar/25/past.ianaitken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1972/mar/25/past.ianaitken","fields":{"headline":"Stormont suspended - Heath: fresh start","bodyText":"Mr Heath last night presented his Government's decision to impose direct rule in Northern Ireland as an opportunity for a fresh start in the intractable problem of John Bull's other island, and appealed on television to the people of Ulster to put the past behind them and devote themselves to building a peaceful and prosperous future. It was perhaps the most momentous broadcast to the British people by any British Prime Minister since Mr Churchill's wartime radio address. Behind it lies a complex series of disputes and disagreements within Mr Heath's Cabinet resolved only earlier this week when the Prime Minister finally obtained the unanimous consent of his colleagues for the course he proposed to take. The decision to suspend the Stormont Parliament for at least a year, and to impose direct Westminster rule through the appointment of Mr William Whitelaw as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, staggered Ulster Unionist MPs and many of their right-wing Conservative colleagues. It was immediately clear that this watershed in Westminster's relations with Northern Ireland had created a critical new situation for the Government in the Commons, with the balance of power in doubt over the whole field of Government legislation, from the Common Market downwards. Mr Whitelaw, who does not formally assume the office of Secretary of State until the Bill becomes law, will make his first official visit to his new and turbulent parish today. He will meet the Governor, Lord Grey, who now ceases to have any powers whatever, and also the Stormont civil servants whose allegiance is to be transferred to him. He will have talks also with the General Officer commanding Northern Ireland, General Tuzo, and senior officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who now come under Mr Whitelaw's direction. No one, least of all Mr Whitelaw, is in any doubt about the hazards, political and physical, which face him. But in spite of the dangers, there was some hope at Westminster last night that the impact of Mr Heath's announcement would bring about at the very least a pause in the violence in Northern Ireland, with both sides taking time out to consider the new situation. Mr Whitelaw, it is felt, has both the charm and the stature to make the best of even a brief honeymoon. Many Conservative and Unionist backbenchers were unable to believe that the Cabinet was ready to take such radical action until they heard yesterday's statement by Mr Heath in the Commons. The small group of Ulster Unionist MPs immediately decided that they would oppose the second reading next Tuesday of the Government's short but sweeping Bill to transfer the powers of Stormont to the new Secretary of State, and there is every sign that a number of Conservatives may back them in this revolt. There is no danger that this move, by a relatively modest minority of the Tory benches, will threaten the Government's majority for the Bill, since Mr Wilson made it clear in the Commons yesterday that the Opposition would give its full support to the Government in carrying through its Northern Ireland proposals. But the creation of a new group of deeply disaffected MPs in the Conservative Party clearly poses new and highly unwelcome problems for a Government whose overall majority in the Commons is only 27. For Mr Heath, the decision represents a calculated risk, in the belief that the transfer of responsibility for law and order and the phasing out of internment by measured stages will provide the opportunity for the non-violent representatives of the vast majority of Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland to come forward at last, and take part in the all-party talks on the future of Ulster which Ministers have been vainly offering to them since last summer. The immediate response was a solemn promise from Mr Gerry Fitt, Social Democratic and Labour Party MP for West Belfast, that his party would examine the proposals \"not with the aim of any political gain but in the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland\". Mr Fitt is now in a position to tell his SDLP colleagues at home in Northern Ireland that the Government's new proposals meet almost all of their demands, and represent virtually total victory for their stand. The signs are that they will indeed respond to the appeal to join in talks, or face the inevitable accusation of total irresponsibility. The package which Mr Heath put before the Commons yesterday covered three main points. The first two were straightforward proposals for: 1. The release of some hundreds of internees in the next few weeks, as the first step in phasing out internment altogether; and, 2. The creation of new procedures to conduct regular plebiscites in Northern Ireland as the ultimate test of opinion on Ulster's continued status as part of the United Kingdom. Mr Heath was empathic that there could be no change in this status without the consent of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland, or without the eventual consent of a revived Northern Ireland Parliament. But the key passage in Mr Heath's package was: 3.The proposal to transfer the entire responsibility for security, and law and order, from Stormont to Westminster. It was this which was flatly rejected by Mr Faulkner earlier in the week, backed by the unanimous decision of his Cabinet to resign en bloc if Mr Heath persisted in his demand.

It raised the immediate prospect of negotiations at ministerial level to avoid any massive new \"shuttlecock\" situation. President Amin's announcement also seems to have come at an awkward moment for his own Foreign Minister, Mr Kibedi, who was passing through London yesterday en route for a conference in the Caribbean and a visit to President Nixon in Washington. There seems little doubt that Sir Alec Douglas-Home will now suggest that Mr Kibedi should break his homeward journey for talks at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office before returning to Kampala. The President's unexpected announcement was made during a visit to an army barracks at Tororo in Eastern Uganda. It was in the course of addressing the troops that General Amin took up the topic of Asian non-citizens. It is not clear whether this was a premeditated statement or whether, as with many of this public pronouncements in the past, it was said on impulse. The key words which he used yesterday were: \"I am going to ask Britain to take over responsibility for all Asians in Uganda who are holding British passports, because they are sabotaging the economy of the country.\" He also said there was \"no room in Uganda\" for these people who had decided not to take up local citizenship, and accused them of \"encouraging corruption.\" He said the emphasis must now be on jobs for Ugandans, especially those of African race. This would be a tactful reference to the fact that a great many key posts in the public are still held by able people of Asiatic race. This causes resentment, even when these Asians have opted for Uganda citizenship since independence in 1962. The feeling among the Africans is that in colonial times, the Asians gained a flying start by virtue of their better education and better command of English. By the time Britain handed over, the middle and upper echelons in commerce, the Civil Service and the professions were dominated by Asians. Some of the latter took local citizenship, while the majority opted for the British passports which were offered to them. The pressure to give these jobs to Ugandans, and preferably Africans at that, was already building up under the previous, civilian regime of President Milton Obote, before the coup d'etat of January 1971. As in Kenya, the country's African rulers have come under intensive lobbying from their own supporters to use such devices as work permits and trade licences to squeeze out the Asians. This produces an inevitable outward flow of British Asians, whose only travel document is the restricted type of British passport, which does not give automatic entry into Britain. When these travellers, having been refused entry into Britain, are then prevented from re-entering their country of origin, the frustrating and diplomatically embarrassing \"shuttle-cock\" situation develops. Already the Ugandan Government has refused to readmit an Asian girl coming back to rejoin her parents after a short holiday in Tanzania. Miss Maria Melba Paes, aged 28, was flown to London and has been admitted to Britain for three months. Deeply depressed and still recovering from injuries caused in a car accident, she is being cared for by nuns at Hillingdon. The Home Office has passed her case to the United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service, who said on Thursday: \"She wants to get to India, where she has friends and relations, but she has no money. She can't get a job.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1973/mar/10/northernireland.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1973-03-10T11:59:14Z","webTitle":"Not Protestants alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1973/mar/10/northernireland.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1973/mar/10/northernireland.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"Not Protestants alone","bodyText":"It has become fashionable to deride the Ulster border poll. As originally conceived, it was an attempt to take the divisive issue of nationality out of day-to-day politics and so - it was hoped- allow non-sectarian parties to develop in Northern Ireland. One of those non-sectarian parties, Alliance, which has a strong Catholic element in its still limited membership, said last night that the result of the poll showed that the people were overwhelmingly happy to stay with Britain, and added, somewhat optimistically, that the border should now be removed from party politics and the task of bringing the two sides together in Northern Ireland should be begun. This is a lot to hope, but it is proper to note that the massive vote in favour of the union with Britain is not a simple mobilisation of the Unionist Party's traditional supporters. Both Alliance and Northern Ireland Labour Party - which had a large but inconveniently spread-out support in the last general election - were in favour of a pro-union vote. Nor is it clear that this is a wholly Protestant vote. The campaign in favour of abstention by the SDLP and other nationalist parties has made the figures difficult to interpret. With a register of a little over a million voters, and no accurate breakdown on religious lines, some assumptions must be made. A very rough analysis of the electorate, based only on a projection of the general population figures, and allowing for the larger proportion of Catholic children, suggests 67 per cent Protestant and 33 per cent Catholic voters. So if every Protestant had voted, and voted for the union with Britain, the total might have been of the order of 670,000. The actual figure was 591,820. This represents more than 88 per cent of the estimated possible Protestant vote. A large turnout was expected, but with some politicians on the Unionist Right arguing that the plebiscite gave too much of a carte blanche to Whitehall, it would be surprising if some of the abstainers and spoiled votes were not Protestant. That would mean that some of the 160,000 postal votes were used by Catholics wishing to vote for continuation of the union with Britain, but unwilling to face the hostility of those supporting boycott, and perhaps particularly of the Provisional Sinn Fein, which has been organising postal ballot paper burning in some places. The figure is unlikely to have been large, however. Northern Ireland remains a deeply divided community, with the mass of Catholics unwilling to cast their vote in favour of the union, and nearly all the Protestants opposed to a united Ireland. The Catholic abstention does not represent unanimous hostility to Britain. In a recent Opinion Research Centre poll, published in the Belfast Telegraph, only 39 per cent of Catholics asked favoured a united Ireland, while 23 per cent more wanted the SDLP proposal of joint control by London and Dublin. A sizeable minority of Catholics appeared prepared to continue the British connection: 21 per cent wanted either total integration of the continuation of direct rule, and another 12 per cent a coalition government at Stormont. Whether these findings would have been confirmed if there had been no boycott yesterday cannot be known. It is a great pity that, because of Mr Heath's sensitivity about European referenda, this poll was not conducted while the honeymoon after direct rule continued and boycott was less likely. But at least the ballot boxes have opened again in Northern Ireland. The sooner new public representatives are elected the better. Compromise remains the only hope, and men and women with a fresh and unchallengeable mandate are needed to make that compromise. Mr Whitelaw's White Paper should call for a general election before the summer. That election should give every voter in Northern Ireland the feeling that he has a say in his country's affairs again. One of the damaging effects of direct rule has been the inevitable potential emasculation of the community. The other principal cause of this, of course, is that democratic politicians never look so important while people using guns, bombs, and intimidation rule the areas the politicians are supposed to represent. In such circumstances any opportunity for people to vote, however unsatisfactory it may appear to some of them, is not to be sneezed at. Those who favour the union took their chance to vote on Thursday, in very large numbers. But it is a general election which should persuade nearly everyone in the community to take part in democratic politics. Anyone who boycotts such an election, for whatever reason, should think seriously whether he is going anywhere, or nowhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1973/nov/15/mainsection.nancybankssmith","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1973-11-15T00:01:02Z","webTitle":"From the archive: A right royal display of burbling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1973/nov/15/mainsection.nancybankssmith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1973/nov/15/mainsection.nancybankssmith","fields":{"headline":"A right royal display of burbling","bodyText":"\"It was difficult to get the Princess going,\" as Angus Ogilvy once memorably remarked. About his car, as it happens. When I surfaced sufficiently to switch on television, Pete Murray was burbling about \"the fair city of Glasgow\" and Valerie Singleton was taking us over to \"the home of Princess Anne's horses\". They both sounded completely out of their minds. On second thoughts, though, a degree of burbling has to be done on an occasion like a Royal wedding. It is the equivalent of warming her up, turning her over and getting her going. ITV, which kept its cool and began its commentary only 10 minutes before Princess Anne left the palace, had a whole lot of unburbled burbles to get out of its system. If you keep too cool, you start cold. After a little initial burble \"the day the world has been talking and writing about for, er, weeks\", the BBC's Tom Fleming struck a happy note by admitting nerves without actually showing them. As Mark Phillips arrived: \"There goes the only man more nervous than I am this morning.\" And it took the audience into his confidence. \"There,\" he droned, \"is the Marquis of Cholmondeley ... the Lady MacLean and\" - as Harold Wilson arrived - \"ah, a commentator's dream, a familiar face.\" The BBC's fashion commentator Janey Ironside had a nice line of her own in awful-child candour. \"Jeremy Thorpe, I'm afraid, looking a little bit sombre. Oh, he's just kissed a lady with an extraordinarily ordinary hat.\" In spite of Vaughan Thomas's euphoria and Gardner's calm, ITV's commentary did run to burbles. They had panoramic views of scenes in ancient buildings. They had heart- stirring views over glittering statues. And it was an ITV commentator who cried: \"What a lovely sight!\" at a retreating horse. A really pretty sight, I think, is the way the Household Cavalry, shot head-on, seemed to get no nearer but appeared to bob up and down on the spot as if with delight. A job lot of questions. How can Grace Kelly stay so smooth when Lord Hailsham gets so rumpled? Would it be lese-majesty to hire a lip reader to interpret those tantalising royal conversations, coming down aisles? You do realise that that's one down and three more to go? Did you notice that the Queen doesn't sing God Save the Queen but just looks sort of saved? Can you estimate what this programme cost the country in woman hours? Who said \"in a gun turret all men are equal\"? Shouldn't he by rights have had half the kingdom and which half should he have?

The bomb went off at 8:28 a.m. when very few people were in the Palace of Westminster. Five minutes earlier, a warning was telephoned by a caller with an Irish accent to the Press Association. The caller used the code word which identifies IRA calls and said that a bomb would go off in five minutes. The man would not give a more specific location and rang off. The police received the warning at 8:26 a.m. and seconds before the bomb went off, workmen on the site of an underground car park being built for MPs and overlooked by the canteen were given notice by the police of an imminent explosion. According to eyewitnesses, the explosion was followed by intense heat and blinding smoke inside the building. Glass was blown out of several windows. Clouds of black smoke could be seen miles away. Mr Albert Quigley, a workman on the car park site was standing outside the canteen when the foreman told him to go and warn the men underground that a bomb might be about to go off. \"I was just walking away when the blast came and blew glass from the canteen windows all around. Three of my mates were working on the tip of a corner tower and could not get down for dust and smoke when the blast went off.\" The works foreman, Mr Alex Maxwell, aged 35, said that when the bomb went off everyone was in a state of panic \"We heard a woman crying 'get me out' from a first floor window. There were flames on the ground floor but a couple of the lads got a ladder and climbed up to get her, but the heat and smoke were so intense that they could not reach her.\" One of the men who went up the ladder, Mr Pat Arundel, a scaffolder, said: \"We smashed a window but we could not have gone in more than three steps because of the dust and smoke. We never saw the woman but we said to her to come to the window. She cried that she could not, her leg was broken.\" Firemen later brought the woman, Mrs Patricia Gaskin, a cleaner, down by ladder. She was taken to St Thomas's Hospital. Mr Maxwell said the Keirs, the contracting firm building the car park employed about 140 men on the site. Many of them were Irish, Mr Maxwell said, but he added: \"All the men carry passes to get into the site but there is no differentiation between the Irish and non-Irish. They are first class lads all of them.\" Four of the people rescued from a first floor office in Westminster Hall annexe were almost asphyxiated by the time ambulance men reached them, Mr Ernest Jacob, an ambulance crew leader, said: \"When we arrived a group of people were shouting at a first floor window. They were engulfed in black smoke and I do not know how we got them out alive. There were four people, two dressed in overalls and two in suits, and below them the fire was an inferno. \"If they had not been rescued they would have been asphyxiated in another two minutes. They were all in a very shocked condition and we gave them oxygen in the ambulance on the way to hospital. MPs and Ministers arriving at the scene expressed anger at what had happened. Mr Edward Short, the Leader of the House, said that such intimidation would not affect the workings of Parliament. Mr Bob Mellish, the Government Chief Whip, said: \"It is a tragedy that these awful people should destroy part of a great heritage. I suppose we ought to be grateful they did not throw a bomb in the Chamber, and if it had been later in the day there might have been a few lives lost.\" Mr David Steel, the Liberal Chief Whip, was one of four MPs at their desks when the bomb went off. \"I heard the blast, I waited until the noise subsided and then went out to look at the damage, but there was so much dust and smoke it was impossible to see anything at all. The building was then ordered to be cleared.\" Assistant Fire Officer Trevor Watkins said that the greatest danger had been that the timbered Great Hall would catch fire. MPs' desks and secretaries' rooms in the annexe were badly damaged when the burning roof caved in on them, and firemen had to hack at the lead and tiles on the hall's roof in order to check that the flames were not spreading through the beams inside. Some MPs lost all their files and correspondence. Seven of the injured, six men and one woman, were treated at St Thomas's Hospital after the blast. Mrs Patricia Gaskin, aged 43 of Westbridge Drive, Battersea was found to have her leg broken in three places. The others were less seriously injured. They were; Mr Leonard Lee, aged 62, of Whitestile Road, Brentford, Middlesex: Mr John Thomas, aged 34, Pendennis Close, Basingstoke; Mr John Byrne, aged 35, Portland Avenue, Sittingbourne, Kent; Fireman G L Hill of Greake Road, Gillingham; Mr Wigginton, aged 57, Canton Street, Poplar; and Mr William Fairweather of Blondel Street, Battersea. Four people were treated for shock. Mr Lee and Mr Thomas are resident Post Office engineers in the Commons and they were in the north-western Turret on the second floor when the bomb went off. They and two other Commons staff were rescued by Mr Jacob's ambulance team. After the blast, security warnings went out from Scotland Yard to all Government and public offices, and patrols around Whitehall were increased. A number of men, including, it is believed, Irish workmen from the Parliament car park, were interviewed at Cannon Row police station. Commander Wilford Gibson of A Division, who is responsible for security outside the Commons and for some security arrangements inside the building said that it was impossible to make Westminster totally secure unless policemen were placed shoulder to shoulder around the buildings. Talks on security were held almost continuously. There were renewed requests from some MPs for measures to prevent more violence. Mr Patrick Cormack, Conservative MP for south-west Staffordshire said: \"Although I have not been one of those who have advocated it in the past, Parliament should bring in the death penalty immediately for all crimes of terrorism committed in the United Kingdom.\" Mr Alex Fletcher, Conservative MP for Edinburgh North, agreed and said that \"this is not a dispute between two people - they are at war with us.\" In the House of Lords, Lord Vernon said that security was little better than a joke at Westminster. He suggested that everyone who worked in the building, including MPs and Lords, should be given a pass. Security at Westminster was tightened in 1970 after two CS gas canisters were hurled from the gallery on to the floor of the House by a man shouting: \"Belfast, see how you like it.\" In 1885 a bomb planted by Irish nationalists damaged the windows and roof of Westminster Hall when it exploded on the pavement after being snatched out of the crypt by a policeman. Two policemen were seriously injured in the blast. The hall was built in 1097 and its famous hammer-beam roof was built by Richard II 200 years later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1974/sep/12/fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1974-09-12T11:39:41Z","webTitle":"St George and Ethiopia's dragon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1974/sep/12/fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1974/sep/12/fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"St George and Ethiopia's dragon","bodyText":"It began with a mutiny over conditions at an isolated army post in Southern Ethiopia and has ended eight months later with the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie. Foreigners have called it a \"creeping coup\" and Ethiopians are calling it the \"February revolution.\" Western diplomats draw parallels with the 1952 Egyptian revolution of free officers led by Colonel Nasser and to the revolution of Kemal Ataturk in Turkey after the First World War. But it appears more and more that the young officers who have overthrown the 2,0000 year old Ethiopian monarchy are right. \"The culture and history of Ethiopia are unique and so is the nature and course of this military movement.\" It's course has been extraordinary indeed. The movement was set off by soldiers disgruntled primarily over pay and barrack condition propelled forward by a taxi drivers' strike in the capital, temporarily set back by an aristocratic counter-plot and finally brought into the open in late June by a seemingly innocuous appeal by a group of deputies for the release of some imprisoned Ministers. Their verbose and often rambling communiqu¿s have stressed primarily the need for national unity and accelerated economic development and have manifested a kind of homespun populism attacking the big money and corruption of the monarchical establishment. Increasingly, however there are overtones of class conflict in their statements. A recent cartoon in the government newspaper, the Ethiopian Herald, perhaps caught the spirit and aims of the military reform movement better than any of the almost daily communiqu¿s issued by the co-ordinating committee so far. It showed an Ethiopian Saint George standing at the ocean's edge and throwing spears at a five-headed dragon rearing up from the water. Above the five heads were the words \"corruption, bribery, nepotism, inefficiency and embezzlement.\" The tail of the monster was shown looping round behind the heroic Saint George with the words \"reactionary forces\" written on it. And the caption read \"The coordinating Committee is facing a Herculean task.\" It is still too early to tell where Ethiopia's strange revolution is heading. The Emperor's vast wealth is being nationalised but labels like \"Socialist\" do not seem to fit the military reform movement here. Indeed, the military has denounced as \"enemies of the revolution\" those spreading rumours about nationalisation of private foreign interests. Nor is there any perceptive shift in Ethiopia's foreign policy away from its traditional dependence on the United States. Perhaps the single most important cause for the eruption of the simmering volcano of discontent upon which emperor Haile Selassie has indifferently sat for the past few decades is the devastating six year old drought afflicting half or more of the mountain kingdom's territory. It is estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people. In many ways the disaster personified the traditional indifference of the Crown and Central Government toward the appalling poverty and backwardness of this East African feudal kingdom of 26 million people. One of the most remarkable features of the military reform movement has been the near absence of violence and fighting in a kingdom with a renowned warrior tradition and where virtually every male person has a gun. \"This military movement will achieve lasting changes without any bloodshed.\" Said the military informers in one of their early July communiqu¿s. And so far at least they have largely kept their word. The mightiest aristocrats of the kingdom have surrendered peacefully and the Emperor has been stripped of his powers without putting up any serious resistance. The official list of about 170 persons taken into military custody includes almost the entire registry of Ethiopia's leading aristocrats whose families have ruled and plundered the wealth of the nation without afterthought for centuries. Remarkably little is known about the collective body behind the reform movement thought it is now the effective ruling body in the country .Its leaders hide behind anonymous communiqu¿s and a map of Ethiopia with a big brother eye peering out from the centre. Its official motto is \"Ethiopia first\" and in a strange touch of the ultra modern in a still feudal setting the committee has issued bumper stickers and T-shirts with its motto printed on them. The official title of the group is the Coordinating Committee of the Ethiopian Armed Forces, Police and Territorial Army (better know to the Ethiopians as derk) which is perhaps revealing of the key role it plays in trying to bring and keep together the disparate branches of the military. \"They are struggling against a tradition in which each branch of the armed forces developed individually and was responsible to the Emperor directly\" said one Western diplomat. \"The various divisions all have different missions and interests and are geographically separated.\" The very fact that they are acting in the name of something called the \"armed forces\" is something of a revolution in itself, according to this diplomat. \"They are a bunch of officers making history because they are cooperating and cutting across all the traditional political and ethnic divisions of Ethiopian society.\" The committee has expanded and contracted in size since it surfaced in the last days of June and is now estimated to have around 88 members (it has been as high as 120). The highest-ranking officers are majors and the lowest privates. Many are American trained but most of the key members are believed to be graduates of Ethiopia's own military academies. A suprisingly large number of the members of the committee are lawyers. There is a kind of higher committee of seven to 12 officers and a chairman who has been identified as Major Mengistu Woldemariam, a graduate of Holeta military academy outside Addis and head of the Ordinance Company of the Third Division based in llarar in Eastern Ethiopia. Major Mengistu, whose position as chairman is said to be still uncertain may eventually become the Colonel Nasser of the Ethiopian revolution but it is still too early to tell. If he does become the strongman, he will have to topple the Defence Minister, General Aman Michael Andom, the nation's most popular soldier whom the Military Committee itself picked to act as its front man. He is being compared to General Neguib, whom the Egyptian free officers called in to popularise their reform movement before Nasser became jealous and suspicious and ousted him. Like Neguib, Aman is something of an outside to the main group of military reformers and much older (he is 50, while the captains and majors in the committee are in their late 20s and 30s). And like Neguib, he has been touring the country and explaining the committee's \"Ethiopia first\" philosophy of national unity and regeneration to the Army and civilian population. Aman is immensely popular among the soldiers and still widely remembered as the \"Desert Lion\" who asked Emperor Haile Selassie for just 24 hours to march to Mogadicio, the capital of Somalia, during the 1964 Somali-Ethiopian border war (Somalia lays claim to the eastern third of Ethiopia). The Emperor said \"no\" then. But there is no Emperor now to oppose him and Aman has already begun playing up the Somali threat at his appearance before military and civilian crowds across the country. The threat seems to be serving as a rallying point for national unity at a time when Ethiopia is menace itself by political turmoil that could tear it apart. The functioning of the military committee standing in the shadows behind Aman is still wrapped in mystery. It is known however that each of the army's four divisions and all other branches of the armed forces plus the police, Territorial Army and the military academies all have their own delegations on the committee (the bodyguard is the First Division.) There is also a concern for regional and ethnic representation to give as broad a base as possible to the movement. The members of these delegations are said to change from time to time and in some cases the units they represent reportedly have disagreed with the decisions taken by the Coordinating Committee and thrown out their own delegates. Thus one of the main problems for the Committee is reaching agreement about anything among the dozen or more delegations. The National Coordinating Committee is locate dint he Fourth Division's headquarters in the capital and is thought to be more radical and generally far ahead of the local coordinating committees, This may explain the creeping one-step-forward-and-halt pace of the reform movement: the National Committee must give time to the local ones to digest its decisions and actions. It must also five time to Ethiopia's extremely conservative peasants to absorb the radically new idea that the monarch is not only no a demigod as then have been told since childhood but little more than a common crook who has misruled and plundered the nation for half a century. - Washington Post."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1979/may/05/electionspast.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1979-05-05T13:56:21Z","webTitle":"How Mrs Thatcher swung her way to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1979/may/05/electionspast.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1979/may/05/electionspast.comment","fields":{"headline":"How Mrs Thatcher swung her way to power","bodyText":"The swing which put Mrs Thatcher into Downing Street yesterday was the biggest in a general election since 1945, just beating the 4.7 per cent which gave Mr Heath victory in 1970 - though the number of seats which changes hands was slightly fewer than in that election. The swing varied a lot between region and region, between town and country and between seats of different kinds - though there was only one part of the United Kingdom - Scotland - where Labour consistently gained ground. This was also an election which reversed the trend towards the fragmentation of British party politics, with the liberals and Nationalists - especially the Nationalists - shedding seats to the two big parties. With the Conservatives having shown that they are capable of turning of turning Labour out on their own it can be said with certainty that the cause of proportional representation, so much swollen by the two grossly inequitable election results of 1974, is now destined to dwindle again into relative oblivion. The trend of the early results as they accumulated yesterday morning seemed to be a tail of two nations, with the South voting solidly for Mrs Thatcher and for change and the North and Scotland reluctant to reluctant to let go of Mr Callaghan. But as more results came in yesterday the picture began to look more complex. The North-west and North-east, especially outside the big towns, had produced some big swings to Mrs Thatcher, too. And yesterday results also produced new evidence of an astonishing resurgence of Tory support in rural Wales. It was Wales which gave them two of the most spectacular gains of the whole election - Anglesey, on a swing of 12 per cent from Labour, and Mr Emlyn Hooson's Montgomery, on a swing of 10.1 form the Liberals. This was the first time this century that these two seats had come their way. In Cardigan, which stayed Liberal, and Carmatthen, which was wrestled from the Nationalist leader, Gwynfor Evans, by Labour, the Tory vote was up by about 20 per cent. They also took Brecon and Radnor, Labour's last remaining predominantly agricultural constituency, on a swing of 6.5 per cent. The Nationalists kept two seats but failed to make inroads elsewhere and took third place in once promising seats like Caerphilly. The South-east produced a consistent story with swings of 7 and 9 per cent for Mrs Thatcher with some seats swinging harder still. A band of constituencies to the north and east of London produced some of the biggest Tory advances from the election and some of the most unexpected Labour casualties - not just Mrs Shirley Williams, the most-mburned, at Hereford and Stevenage where the swing was 8.1 per cent, but Mr Eric Moonmans as Basildon (11 per cent), Mr Brian Sedgemore (7.6 per cent) at Luton East and Mr Ivor Clemitson (5.7 per cent) at Luton West were swept aside in its path. More obviously vulnerable marginals, like Welwyn and Hatfield (3.4 per cent) and Hemel Hempsted (3.6) were other losses here, Rochester and Chatham, Gravesend and Dartford, yet again switched sides on the south-east of London, as did Portsmouth North and Southampton Test on the coast. Seats on the north and east side of London also produced huge pro-Tory swings: 13.9 per cent at Barking, 13.4 per cent at Dagenham and double-figure swings in Hackney and Islington. Hornchurch went Tory on a swing of 8.5 per cent; a 4.3 per cent swing was enough to shift Ilford South to the Tories alongside Ilford North, where the high seats were accompanied by big increases in turnout. Most of the West Midlands was good Tory territory; with 11 Conservative gains from Labour - though Labour recouped its byelection losses at Stenchford and Walsall. Again seats of high immigration like Birmingham Sparkbrook (0.3) alone broke the pattern. There was a 10.2 per cent swing at Birmingham Northfield and an 8.5 per cent swing in Dudley West to give the party gains which few had expected. The picture was patchier in the East Midlands, where in Leicester South there was a swing of just under 1 per cent to Labour and Leicester East and West hardly swung at all (again, the immigrant vote would have had something to do with it) and the swings were well down in the two derby seats, thus saving Mr Philip Whitehead in Derby North from the fate of many of his comrades. Across much of the countryside, however, the swing was running at around 6 per cent. Peterborough fell on a 6.3 per cent and Belper on a swing of 5.6 per cent. East Anglia, with its reputation for going against the trend, again achieved the unexpected with a 2.5 per cent swing to Labour rescuing the ultra-marginal Mr Weetch at Ipswich. Farther North, Labour again did best in the cities - Manchester, Liverpool, Bradford and Leeds (but not Sheffield) all produced some favourable results. Labour lost Rossendale and Nelson and Colne on very modest swings (1.4 and 2.4 per cent) and saved Bury and Radcliffe (0.4 per cent). In place, though, Lancashire swung almost on the southern model with the Conservatives achieving 8.4 per cent in Sir Harold Wilson's Huyton, 9.4 per cent in Ince, 7.8 per cent in Westhoughton and 7.5 per cent in Wigan. There was a swing towards Labour in Manchester Moss Side - against an area with a big immigrant community. Bradford North swung only 1.6 per cent to the Right and Bradford South showed a 2.9 per cent swing to Labour. There was a swing of 0.8 per cent to Labour in Sir Keith Joseph's constituency of Leeds North-east. In the North, Newcastle and Sunderland produced very small swings to the Right - the second successive election in which these towns have been good to Labour - though Sir William Elliott consolidated his hold on Newcastle North. Workington, which went Tory in the by-election, came back to Labour. In Scotland Labour got the best of the swing: But the Conservatives won more seats with the Liberal tide receding almost everywhere. Labour took Glasgow Cathcart off the Conservatives on a swing of 4.4 per cent - the best Labour result of this election - but the Conservatives saved the ultra-marginal Aberdeen South and won seven seats off the SNP. The Nationalists might well have kept Argyll but for the intervention of a Liberal and their vote held up notably better in seats like Banff and Aberdeenshire East where the Liberals dropped out. The SNP saved Western Isles and Dundee East, but elsewhere they were back to around their strength of 1970 and they got their biggest humiliation of all at the hands of the arch anti-devolutionist, Mr Tam Dalyell in West Lothian, where there was a swing from Nationalist to Labour of 12.8 per cent. The Liberals come out of the election a little less bruised than the Nationalists, but still in a sorry state, especially in the light of Mr Steele's forecasts of a Liberal representation of 20 to 50. Different candidates met very different fates. Mr Thorpe lost North Devon on a swing to the Tories of 12.5 per cent and Mr Pardoe lost North Cornwall on a swing of 8.5. But Mr David Penhaligon (Truro) and Mr Alan Beith (Berwick) the most marginal men in the party, both increased their majorities, Mr Penhaligon on a swing to himself of 6.5 per cent, and Mr Beith on a swing of 7.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the target seats - Skipton, Newbury, Hereford, Chelmsford. Chippenham and the others where they were runners-up to the Tories last time - produced a string of disappointments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1981/feb/17/mainsection.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1981-02-17T13:52:39Z","webTitle":"From the archive: Mrs Thatcher's modern England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1981/feb/17/mainsection.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1981/feb/17/mainsection.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"Mrs Thatcher's modern England","bodyText":"[Extracts from a diary of a journey] Coventry I wake up to the news of the monthly unemployment figures. The familiar voice of Jim Prior tells us it's going to get worse before it gets better. For the United Kingdom the average is now 10%. In the West Midlands it is 11.3%, in Birmingham 12% and in Coventry 13%. Coventry, the proverbial Klondike of the post-war affluent society - the idea of 13% unemployment takes some getting used to. I've heard several people say already, \"we're not used to recessions like this round here\" or, \"unemployment is a new experience for us\". Rolls Royce had to be nationalised in the 1971-72 downturn, in 1975 British Leyland was taken over and Chrysler baled out, but this time it's far worse. Birmingham I switch stations. The local commercial station is running a feature called Lucky Breaks. The lucky break is a job vacancy for a teenager. Today's lucky lad can be an apprentice joiner. Our highest hopes for equality were vested in education. For teachers and children the process of reorganisation has been almost as disruptive as the collectivisation of the farms. Nor is the aggravation at an end; in Birmingham, like many other cities, the school rolls are failing. Birmingham is a city of metals and nostalgia. The buildings here are worthy and solid; the statues recall the golden age of enterprise. It is that vanished entrepreneurial world which Thatcher would like to restore. Birkenhead Opposite the gates of Cammell Laird's is the Royal Castle Hotel. In a back room a dozen or so shop stewards are waiting for Frank Field, the local MP. Because I'm going to be there - the press! - the Cammell Laird management has refused permission for the meeting to be in the yard. In the chair is a man called Gerry Reeves. He is vice-chairman of the stewards' committee. On the table before him is a pint and the latest issue of the Militant. Liverpool There is too much of past glory about Liverpool. The smell of the sea makes it worse. Economic decline is turning the place into a Carthage. The \"T\" has already fallen off the side of the St George's Hotel. The Adelphi Hotel is a deserted morgue of marble today. It was here in the early hours of October 16 1964 that some of us opened a bottle of champagne for the new prime minister [Harold Wilson], who was going to build the New Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1981/oct/05/fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1981-10-05T11:45:23Z","webTitle":"The deaths that gave new life to an IRA legend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/oct/05/fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1981/oct/05/fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"The deaths that gave new life to an IRA legend","bodyText":"The cemetery itself is easy to find. Coming in to Belfast on the main Dublin road it sprawls across a slight rise to the left, overlooked by an ugly charcoal tip in the back of an adjoining scrapyard. But the grave is more difficult to locate among the long grass, the weeds and forest of Celtic crosses and marble Marys. The scaffolding from which the television networks so meticulously recorded the ceremony and grief, has gone. The floral wreaths have rotted away and their plastic counterparts in perspex cases are looking weather-beaten, the messages of tribute and farewell fading on the ivory cards. The black headstone carries the inscription: \"Volunteers - Terence O'Neill, Bobby Sands, Joe McDonnell.\" Perversely, for an organisation which makes such effective use of legends and martyrs, the IRA has, since 1977 been almost dismissive in the treatment of its dead, burying them three and four to a grave in the new Republican plot, recording only names and \"volunteer\" status. But that egalitarian policy is restricted to the cemetery. Outside, a Sands memorabilia industry is thriving: leatherwork bearing his name is being poured out by the amateur craftsmen a the Maze gaol and the Republic's top security prison Portlaoise. Booklets of his gaol diary and other writings have been published for sale world-wide. The Ballad of Bobby Sands is on sale as a record, and £1.50 will buy his likeness - together with those of Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh and Patsy O'Hara - emblazoned across a tea towel. The nascent legend of Bobby Sands is difficult to square, even with hindsight with the man I met in Belfast's Maze gaol on March 3, the third day of his hunger strike. He recorded the meeting with the comment in his diary \"Couldn't quite get my flow of thoughts together. I could have said more in a better fashion.\" It would not have helped. The Northern Ireland Office prohibited publication of the interview as well as impressions of the visit. The second time I saw Sands, it was with some embarrassment and much bewilderment that I snatched a glance at his rouged face inside the pine coffin at his home in Belfast's Twinbrook Estate. The embarrassment was in the face of the blank gaze of the theatrically attired IRA guard of honour in dark glasses and the presence of grieving relatives. The bewilderment was over why a pleasant, seemingly well-balanced man of 27 should starve himself to death for the ill-defined concept of \"political statue\" which vaguely boiled down to such abstruse issues as whether he or the taxpayer should pay for his garments. The temptation at this time was to attribute his self-destruction to a personal fanaticism born of teenage grievance (his family were forced out of his childhood home by Protestant intimidation) fostered by youthful romanticism (he joined the IRA at 18), compounded by personal failure (he was separated from his wife, losing a son) and honed by personal experience (he had enjoyed freedom for only six months since his first conviction in 1973). But the implacable pursuit of this example by Hughes, O'Hara, McCreesh, McDonnell, Lynch, Doherty, McIlwee and Devine militated against any explanation of personal oddity. The drama of the hunger strike has obscured the marathon prison protest which preceded it and which, even if the fasts had never taken place would have qualified the dispute for description as one of the most extraordinary confrontations between gaolers and the gaoled. Beginning on September 14,1978, the so-called blanket protest saw hundreds of young men living first of all nearly naked in almost bare cells and then - for about three years - with walls covered by their own excreta. The prison dispute has produced a sizeable literature on what life was like in the H-Blocks a the Maze during the dispute. Few, if any, of these accounts have been passed on for public consumption by the media on the principle that the claims of convicted criminals must be suspect and because they could not be checked, unpublishable. But there is a consistency in the accounts of rough treatment which, taken in conjunction with a presumption of animosity on the part of the warders (the IRA killed 18 of their number) makes it likely that hardships caused by the prisoners immediate environment were compounded by the prison administration. So far as the physical environment was concerned there is, in the August 1978 statement of the Catholic Primate, Cardinal (then Archbishop) Tomas O'Fiach, an account which was reliable both for the identity of its author and the government's response. The Northern Ireland Office did not deny the substance of his allegations, merely retorting that the conditions were self-imposed. The Cardinal, who had spent a Sunday in the gaol said of the H-blocks; \"One would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions let alone a human being...The stench and filth in some of the cells, with the remains of rotten food and human excreta scattered around the walls, was almost unbearable. In two I could not speak for fear of vomiting. The cardinal, added: \"It seems they would prefer to face death rather than submit to being classed as criminals.\" Nearly three years later, Sands confirmed that judgement, marking the first day of his death fast with the diary entry: \"I have considered all the arguments and tried every means to avoid what has become the unavoidable: it has been forced upon me and my comrades by 41 years of stark inhumanity.\" Despite this assertion that the hunger strike had been forced on the prisoners by \"41 years of stark inhumanity,\" there is, in a later entry the recognition that the fight for changes in the prison regime was part of a wider canvas. \"I am dying not just to attempt to end the barbarity of H-blocks, or to gain the rightful recognition of political prisoners, but primarily because what is lost here is lost for the Republic. So far as the ideal Irish Republicanism is concerned, the hunger strike - as shown by the new Labour Party policy on Northern Ireland, recent statements by leaders of the Liberals and the Social Democrats - may have started Irish and British politicians down a path towards some form of reunification by bringing about a re-examination of the unionists veto on constitutional change. The IRA will be counting as gains: The increased flow of funds and sympathy overseas and in Ireland; The sense of alienation form the rest of the United Kingdom of many Ulstermen and women as a result of the Government's disparate handling of violence in the province and that in Liverpool and Brixton; The polarisation of political attitudes in the North and its inhibitory effect on future political initiatives in a purely UK context; The break in bipartisanship on Northern Ireland at Westminster and of course the graves of new martyrs in County Armagh, County Derry, County Tyrone and Belfast's Milltown cemetery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1985/may/21/immigrationpolicy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1985-05-21T16:10:40Z","webTitle":"Detention centre at Heathrow 'better than the police cells'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1985/may/21/immigrationpolicy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1985/may/21/immigrationpolicy","fields":{"headline":"Detention centre at Heathrow 'better than the police cells'","bodyText":"Conditions in the Queen's Building immigration detention centre at Heathrow airport are not very good, a senior immigration official admitted yesterday. But the centre \"fulfils a useful operational need for us.\" It was therefore justified. The official, Mr Bob Lloyd, who oversees arrivals at terminal two, was speaking at the end of a tour of the centre he arranged for the Guardian with Mr Tony Raven, who is in charge of terminal one. Reacting to mounting crticism of the centre, voiced most recently by the United Kingdom Immigrants' Advisory Service, Mr Raven said that he was sure that conditions there were better than in most police cells. \"There are no bars, and as you can see there is completely free association. The accommodation is pretty basic, but it's clean,\" he said. Mr Raven confirmed a Guardian disclosure last week that the immigration service allows airline personnel to visit detainees at Queen's Building, sometimes so that they can try to extract money from them to pay for tickets and for the cost of detention - £4.54 an hour plus meals - for which the airline is liable. Mr Raven said: \"Generally it's just for ticketing purposes. I suppose it's because of the free and easy atmosphere we have here. Airline personnel are allowed to sit down and chat, and there is no scrutiny.\" The 'useful operational needs' met by Queen's Building are a greater degree of security than that afforded elsewhere, and the provision of short-term detention, according to Mr Lloyd. Detainees are supposed to spend no more than five days at the centre, with no more than 15 there at a time. Last year 4,800 people were admitted to Queen's Building, and there were 3,695 overnight stays. Securicor, which runs Queen's Building, charged the Home Office £180,000. Three of the security firm's staff are on duty at all times. In the cramped day room, less than 20ft square, there were five detainees yesterday morning. As in the rest of the centre, there is no natural light or ventilation. Would-be entrants to Britain were spending their time pacing up and down, trying to ignore the test-card music from an aged black and white television set. The paintwork is in fading green and cream, and a bench at the back of the room, which serves as a sofa, was covered by a stained blanket. No reading matter was provided, but there were a few terse instructions in numerous Asian and European langauges. The inmates, a Tamil seeking political asylum from Sri Lanka, a Turkish tourist picked up in London with the wrong papers, a Columbian student trying to join his family, and two Pakistanis had been there for at least 24 hours. One of the Pakistanis had been there for the maximum five days, the Columbian - \"I don't like the meat, and I don't sleep at all\" - had been there for three. One of the Securicor staff was about to take orders for lunch, prepared in a dingy kitchen in which everything is reheated in microwave ovens. Yesterday's choice ranged from beefburgers to vegitarian curry. Mr Raven said: \"We can do anything. Halal, kosher, you name it. The only thing that gave us a headache was a request for goat.\" Each of the bedrooms about 8ft by 15ft is furnished with three cots and small wardrobes. Besides the tiled lavatories and showers, that left only the interview room, lit by a single neon tube the dingiest room of all.

Life was good. Or was it? Was I hiding behind a false sense of security? Already on trips out of the hospital over the last few days I'd found myself sitting in a train thinking I wonder what all these people would do if I suddenly got up and shouted 'I've got Aids'? Somehow I felt different from everybody else as I moved around in public. I remembered the same sensation when first I began to acknowledge to myself, but not to others, my homosexuality. Coming out and being honest with myself and the world changed all that. But now, less than three years later, I was almost back to the same sense of differentness. I certainly didn't feel guilt or shame as I had then. But I'd also lost the sense of self-confidence that I'd felt for the last couple of years as my relationship with William has blossomed. Perhaps telling my family would restore my confidence in the irrelevance to others of my having a mild or early form of Aids. DAY 15 Discharge from hospital after three weeks as an inpatient! At my final meeting with the consultant I understood that I should regard myself as HIV positive but not as having Aids my progress had been impressive but time would be the acid test. I left in a generally optimistic frame of mind. My parents, with whom I'd arranged to recuperate, made me very welcome. Conversation was broken for EastEnders. I was embarrassed and uneasy as Dot forewarned her neighbours of the dangers of homosexuality and Aids. What a forerunner to what I had to say! DAY 16 'So what's this thing you've got? asked my father late in the evening. The moment had arrived I could avoid it no longer. 'Well, actually Dad, I've not told you everything so far. You see, the reason there's been such a problem shifting this Isospora is that I'm partially immune suppressed. ' 'What does that mean?' 'I'm HIV positive. Do you know what that means?' 'No. ' 'It means I've been exposed to the Aids Virus and have developed antibodies. ' 'You've got Aids?' 'No. It doesn't mean I've got Aids, nor that I'm going to get Aids. However, it does mean that my resistance to infection has been lowered. And I could get Aids in the future - no-one knows. Your heart attack was a signal: change your diet and lifestyle or suffer the consequences. I've now been given a similar warning: look after my health or run the risk of developing full-blown Aids. ' 'For God's sake, don't tell Mum. It'll kill her. ' The reaction was the same as three years previously when I'd first told him I was gay, the feeling again that ignorance was less upsetting than knowledge. In the short term that might have been right certainly in the long term it could not be. Moreover, as I pointed out, it was in my own and Williams's interests that everybody should know, since we had to avoid contact with unnecessary infections in the family. The conversation dribbled on. When had I caught it did William have it how had he caught it? I lied there a little. William and I had decided from the start that nothing could be gained by trying to calculate who'd infected the other. But now, to protect William, I claimed that I had contracted the infection before meeting him and had subsequently infected him. It was over. I'd started the process of honesty. It hadn't been easy but then I hadn't expected it to be. My father reiterated that he didn't approve of my lifestyle but that that didn't mean he rejected me. And I reassured him that if what I had in any way put him at risk, I wouldn't be asking to stay. DAY 17 Whilst Dad was out with the dog Mum came and asked how I felt. I started the conversation as I had with my father, but as soon as the word 'Aids' came up, she walked away saying 'I don't want to know any more I don't want to talk about it. ' Later the same day, she came to me in the kitchen and brought the subject up. This time I reassured her that I don't have Aids and more importantly, that I could not pass on to others what I did have. As the consultant had surmised, coming to terms with difficult news is the easier for taking place slowly. My feeling that I should wait until I could tell them in person had also been vindicated. Putting the telephone down on a conversation is so much more of a final gesture than simply walking away for a while returning to ask more questions is so much easier than making a telephone call with that specific intention. And both my parents, once they had accepted the situation, felt that honesty had been the best recourse and were gratified that I had told them first. DAY 19 I was troubled by a new pain. Was this indigestion or an early sign of pneumo-cystic pneumonia, the infection responsible for 70 per cent of the deaths from Aids, which occurs only in immune-suppressed patients? The registrar had forewarned me how difficult it would be to remain rational now that I knew I was HIV positive. How was I to recognise symptoms which might signal an opportunistic infection? DAY 20 Several times over the past weeks, my sister Teresa's comments had shown that she was sympathetic to people with Aids. When I visited this afternoon and explained everything (in her husband Ken's presence), she became upset at the uncertainly of my future, and the tears welled up. I took her in my arms and for two or three minutes we said nothing, until she regained her composure. We talked a little more and I pointed out that this was the first time in 40 years we had embraced thus. She smiled weakly, and got up to continue preparing the dinner. I left her for a short while, then joined her in the kitchen, by which time she had thought of a few more questions. As with my parents, it has been these subsequent conversations that have offered the most useful opportunities for reassurance. I was relieved to have told Teresa. Of all my family I am closest to her. DAY 21 I returned to hospital for further tests. Although Septrin had quickly stopped the diarrhoea, I had developed an allergic rash before completing the course, so the doctors decided to withhold any further treatment against the Isospora to see whether my body could defend itself against a recurrence of the disease. They quickly discovered that the pain in my chest was caused by Candida Albicans, a fungal infection, which had started in my mouth as a side effect of Septrin and spread down my oesophagus. What a relief to know that it wasn't pneumonia! I was given a mouthwash to treat the fungus. DAY 22 Do I have Aids or not? According to the registrar, I was the first person in the United Kingdom to have developed Isospora whilst being HIV positive. According to criteria developed in the US, someone with Isospora for more than a month, with signs of immune suppression, should be thought of as having contracted Aids. The likelihood and timing of these could not be assessed. I was obviously immuno-compromised but to what degree no-one could say since there is no measure for immuno-suppression. If I had Aids I had to accept that without treatment I was going to die. The registrar warned me of the possibility of a psychological block against my own mortality. The conversation left me a little drained and depressed. I found it difficult to accept that I had had my first Aids opportunistic infection. I had contracted Isospora in Ghana when I was very run down and so felt that my chances of re-infection were slight. I accepted that I could contract any of the opportunistic infections at any time. But I chose to believe that my chances of developing them were no greater now than the have been before my admission for Isospora. Silly or not? I had to resort to my motto 'Time will tell. ' DAY 28 Back home, and in the afternoon my sister Barbara and her husband Paul popped in. I seized the opportunity to tell them the exact nature of my problem and asked them to discuss it carefully between themselves, and particularly how they wanted me to relate to their 2-year-old daughter. However, both quickly told me that the information made no difference to them or to the welcome I would receive in their house. Barbara repeated her previous invitation that as soon as William returned to England we must spend a weekend with them. I was so happy and gratified with their reaction, as was Teresa when I told her the story. I feel a little ashamed that I ever feared telling them - their reaction was so matter-of-fact, sympathetic, and even understanding. I now have only two members of the family to tell - one more sister and my brother. DAY 29 Diarrhoea told me that Isospora had recurred and I telephoned the hospital to ask to be readmitted - my third admission in less than six weeks. I was immediately given Flagyl as an alternative to Septrin and another drug to cope with the Candida in my oesophagus, which the mouthwash had not cured. Would these two drugs restore my health? If so, for how long? And did the reappearance of diarrhoea indicate that now I had all the symptoms necessary to classify me as having Aids? Accepting death, or even long-term ill-health, was difficult for an optimist like me, who had always believed that 'something would turn up. ' I quickly picked myself up with thoughts of my family's acceptance and willingness to help, and the presence in my life of William, who reassures me of the future and gives me more reason for living a long time than any other. And if I had contracted this infection earlier, there would have been no chance of benefiting from the wealth of medical research. I had a lot to be thankful for. DAY 30 Diarrhoea continued through the day and, almost worse, I began to feel very giddy when I stood up - a frequent side effect of Flagyl in large doses. Was this what chronic ill-health meant permanently feeling like sleeping, never wanting to do anything, having no interest in people and things around you? If so, could I survive it without becoming grumpy and short-tempered? And what effect would that have on William and my family? I found myself fearing for the first time a life of chronic sickness. DAY 32 I was still suffering from diarrhoea and giddiness. The doctors prescribed an alternative drug and by the end of the day the diarrhoea has stopped. But hepatitis from the drug given to treat the Candida led to continued lethargy. DAY 38 I was back at my parents' when at lunchtime my brother David looked in, as is his custom about once a week. I succeeded in telling him all the important points, but there was little chance for questions. However, he did not seem unduly worried it was almost as if he expected it. Like me, he's not given to demonstrative emotion and he left apparently unconcerned. DAY 40 In the evening I telephoned a friend who, as an immunologist, is well aware of the problems of the Aids virus. On hearing that Isospora had recurred she said 'That's it that means you've got it. ' At that moment I accepted that I had Aids. Still, no one could know how depressed my immune system had become, nor what prognosis would follow, because of the rarity of the Isospora infection. DAY 44 For over a week I had felt guilty that I had told all the family except my sister Mary. So I contrived to 'bump into' her and got invited to tea. When I explained, still maintaining the line that it was unclear whether or not I had Aids, Mary seemed to want to ask few questions in some ways, she said, she was neither surprised nor shocked. I returned to my parent's house after about an hour, with very little conversation. I hadn't been back more than half an hour when Mary telephoned. She felt that she had not been sufficiently concerned or reassuring and wanted to say that 'family was family' and nothing could ever change that. As far as she was concerned, I would be welcome in her house whenever I wanted to visit. She also reassured me that she did not expect her husband Peter to react any differently. During the evening Teresa telephoned and was delighted to learn of this reaction. Family unity is very important to her and anything that threatens it causes her a lot of pain. I think she would have been more upset than me if any member of the family had reacted adversely. Now that I have told everyone I feel relieved. Everybody has been marvellous to me, with no sense of 'it serves you right. ' I feel immensely grateful to my family, whose help and assistance I might very well need over the next few years. DAY 45 I asked the senior registrar whether it was certain that I had Aids. Without mincing words, he said it was undeniable. Allocation to an Aids category depends on whether Isospora is considered a major or a minor infection. If minor, I have Aids Related Complex if major, I have Aids. The registrar believes it is a major infection and that without some form of anti-viral therapy, I would inevitably develop a major opportunistic infection. I had to accept it: I had Aids and without treatment I was on an inevitable path to death. The difference between what I'd previously believed (that I had Aids Related Complex) and what I now accepted (that I had Aids) lay in the probability of further opportunistic infections. I had hoped to avoid them now they were inevitable. The only question remained when. What could I do to postpone that day? Would they occur before medical research found a cure? Would I be dead within three years or not? · Chris Dale (a pseudonym) will be reporting for Society Tomorrow from time to time"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/1990/apr/11/guardiansocietysupplement","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"1990-04-11T01:07:37Z","webTitle":"Yours sincerely, FG Pink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1990/apr/11/guardiansocietysupplement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/1990/apr/11/guardiansocietysupplement","fields":{"headline":"Yours sincerely, FG Pink","bodyText":"At the age of 60, when other men would be winding down or already retired, he is not only working 11 1/2-hour night shifts, but is taking an MA with the Open University. He is also a magistrate. Mr Pink entered nursing inadvertently. He had been planning to become a teacher, but picked up his nurse's skills on national service in the Royal Navy. He qualified as a registered nurse after leaving the forces and worked in hospitals in Britain and Canada. In 1955, he left nursing to fulfil his ambition to teach, qualifying as a teacher two years later and staying in the profession until the early 1980s. He took a first degree with the OU and an MEd at Manchester university. By 1984, however, Mr Pink was a full-time nurse once again and he has been a charge nurse, the male equivalent of sister, at Stepping Hill hospital since 1987. Some would see his approach as over-emotional his style as precious. Others, reading his words, would say it must be hard to remain detached in such stressful circumstances. 'If the relatives of these elderly people could see how their loved ones are at times treated, they would be up in arms.' So began a remarkable correspondence by a nurse so outraged at the low staffing levels on the geriatric wards of Stepping Hill hospital, Stockport, that he was to take his case to the top of the National Health Service and to Downing Street. Extracts from his six-month campaign, casting a rare and revealing spotlight on the dark side of the NHS, are presented below FAR removed from the high-profile work of children's hospitals and elective surgery, tens of thousands of health service staff care for elderly patients under the most taxing conditions. Many may be as committed as Mr Pink few are as articulate: 'The very members of our community who are the most vulnerable, yet deserve the greatest respect, care, and love are being ignored, humiliated and ill-used', his correspondence began . . . AUGUST 24 1989 F. Richards Chairman, Stockport health authority Dear Mr Richards, For the past two years I have been employed as a charge nurse on night duty at Stepping Hill hospital. Together with another charge nurse, I have responsibility for the acute geriatric area comprising 72 beds on wards C5 (20 beds), A14 and A15 (each with 26 beds). We work on a seven-on/seven-off duty rota from 8.30 pm to 8 am. Ever since appointment I have been unhappy at the low staff-to-patient ratio on our wards. We accept only patients of 75 years and over who are acutely ill. Unlike most other areas of the hospital, many of our patients come in with a multiple pathology: for example, a lady might be a diabetic, suffer from arthritis, be hard of hearing and partially-sighted and be brought in following a 'heart attack'. Additionally, patients frequently have social and psychological problems and are severely stressed to leave home (so crucial a factor for elderly people) and loved ones. Thus the degree of dependency and amount of care each patient needs is especialy high. Such is the quite appalling state of cover at night that three people (only one of whom, usually, is a trained nurse) is the accepted complement for wards A14 and A15, with two people (one trained) for ward C5. On average, the ladies on C5 need to be put on the commode four times a night this means 80 toiletings between, say, 11.30pm and 4.30am about eight ladies in an hour. On Monday of last week, 10 out of the 24 patients were incontinent a not unusual situation. One gentleman, in his 100th year, was changed nine times and when we departed at 8am was lying in a wet bed once more. Another had a massive bowel movement then, in his derangement, proceeded to wipe the faeces over his head, face, body, down his excessively long finger nails (nail care went out years ago, I'm told), the locker and cot sides. It took two of us 20 minutes to make him warm and comfortable. During this time, we were out of sight and earshot of half the ward and we were the only two on duty at the time . . . There is so much more that you ought to know of: avoidable injuries to patients (including a death) important observations for people on blood transfusions, for example, not carried out patients offered a wash once a day! (would you, Mr Richards, I wonder, eat your breakfast not having washed your hands for 22 hours?) patients having to be harshly shaken at 11pm, or later, to be given medication lights on as early as 5.25am so that the morning round can be started a very feeble and ill lady being pushed into the dayroom on admission and left there for an hour because a corpse was in the bed she was to occupy (while I had to lie to the relatives). It amounts to a catalogue of shame and neglect which must now be brought into the open for our whole community to know of if need be. Assuming wards continue to be maximally utilised, we shall need: A14 and A15 five auxiliary staff for the night and at least two nurses C5 three staff and two nurses. Yours faithfully, FG Pink OCTOBER 3 Dear Mr Richards, Your visit to us two weeks ago was much appreciated, as was that by Mr Milnes. Mr Geraghty has been in and I enclose a copy of my letter to him. Yours sincerely , FG Pink OCTOBER 3 J. Geraghty Director of Nursing, Stepping Hill hospital Dear Mr Geraghty, Thank you for coming in last Monday night. I would not have phoned you had the situation not become alarmingly dangerous. Two weeks ago, one of our staff nurses, a most diligent and skilled nurse, had a quite harrowing and arduous night during which three patients died in as many hours. Such was the pressure on the staff that we could not prevent one group of relatives, whose mother was still breathing, from having to move aside while the mortuary trolley was brought past them. Another gentleman, distraught at his mother's death, could not be consoled, nor would he leave the body. It took staff nurse all her considerable tact, patience and resourcefulness to gently ease him out. Her bearing and shining fortitude that night were magnificent, but by 5am she was close to breaking point, barely able to stem her tears. As I briefly said to you on Monday, there are two approaches to the equation: either more nurses are provided, or fewer patients catered for (or some combination of both). Clearly, there is a very dangerous situation no doubt about that which, I suggest, will not yield to tinkering. Rather is needed a bold, radical decision to produce relief WITHIN DAYS . . . Yours sincerely , FG Pink OCTOBER 17 Duncan Nicholl Chief Executive of the National Health Service Dear Mr Nicholl, The enclosed copies of correspondence relate to my profound concern at the level of nursing cover provided at night on the geriatric wards in the hospital where I am employed as a charge nurse. Seven weeks after my letter to the health authority was received, no written response has arrived. Could you please clarify the legal position regarding the number of nurses (registered or enrolled) required to the number of patients? . . . Yours faithfully, FG Pink OCTOBER 23 Notes of a meeting with Mr PG (sic) Pink, I informed Mr Pink that the nurse managers on night duty had utilised 42 extra nights of manpower during the month of September this year, by employing bank (relief) nurses, and that the staffing levels on the geriatric wards were being subsidised by other departments within the hospital. I discussed at length with Mr Pink the overall consideration of patient care and the welfare of staff and that it was my opinion that while staffing levels may not be ideal, they did not endanger patients. J Geraghty OCTOBER 31 Dear Mr Geraghty, May I confirm our meeting held last Monday. I emphasised the clear and acute danger which staff and patients are so often perfunctorily exposed to, especially on C5 ward. Recently, a patient unexpectedly collapsed on C5 while no nurse was present. All the lady helper could do was to phone me on ward A14 but, as the only nurse on that ward, I was unable to leave. Phone calls were made and a sister diverted to C5. By the time she arrived, the patient was dead. I find such an episode quite dreadful and totally unacceptable. Your difficulty in providing more staff you explained, and your problems are fully appreciated. The basic cover which I have requested was, you implied, out of the question. Nor could any decrease in patient numbers be expected. It would appear that, despite the crisis situation which we believe exists, you find the position not unreasonable, not unacceptable. Yours sincerely , FG Pink OCTOBER 31 Dear Mr Pink, I am in receipt of copies of the correspondence you have addressed to officers of the authority about the staffing situation on the wards for which you have responsibility, and I also note from the correspondence you addressed to Mr Favell, MP for Stockport, that you complain you have received no written response from the authority to your letter. May I remind you I spent some time with you during the late evening of September 16 to discuss the subject with you and to see for myself the position on the wards. I would have thought this was adequate acknowledgement of your complaint and I made plain to you that I would speak to Mr Milnes (district general manager) in order to have the matter fully investigated. Yours sincerely , F. Richards, Chairman NOVEMBER 13 Dear Mr Geraghty, What else must I do? What more can I say to convince you? Relate another alarming experience, perhaps, to drive home that which seems as palpably plain as the proverbial pikestaff. The experience occurred whilst I was alone on the ward alone, that is, with 20 stricken and vulnerable patients. Two ladies were on commodes and a third had called me. As I jerked and heaved Mrs Gowen (a dense stroke patient) towards the edge of the bed, I heard receding footsteps unsteadily shuffling along the ward, followed by the opening of the main ward door. Someone was leaving and it could only be a patient. Pulling back the curtains, I saw one of our confused ladies on the corridor. Immediately outside the door is a steep flight of stairs . . . Realising that for Mrs Gowen to fall to the floor was potentially less life-threatening than what could happen at any moment on the stairs, I left her precariously perched and rushed out of the ward to grab, quite literally, Mrs Neal. I could not reason with her or persuade her back. Meanwhile the ward door had swung to, leaving the patients, two on commodes calling out, one likely to fall, alone and unattended. And you, Mr Geraghty, believe that our staffing levels do not put patients in danger. Can we be using the same language, I wonder? Yours sincerely , FG Pink NOVEMBER 28 Tom Arnold MP (Hazel Grove) Dear Mr Arnold, You can appreciate my mounting alarm and dismay at the present situation when I tell you that in September 1987, when I took up my post, we had 15 nurses (working 31 nights a week). Today, we are down to 12 nurses (working 25 nights). And my projection is for 26 nurses! Perhaps one way forward would be for some sort of (truly independent) inquiry which could urgently look into the situation. Yours sincerely , FG Pink JANUARY 4 Mr Colin Ralph Chief Executive, United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting Dear Mr Ralph, May I seek your advice upon a very difficult situation regarding my professional conduct. The enclosed copy of our duty sheet for the week of January 15 starkly reveals our desperate plight. We are not even able to staff the wards to the standard which nursing managers regard as appropriate. As you can see, on five nights no trained staff nurse/enrolled nurse is available on one of the wards. The attached summary of our handover report for December 14 (reproduced below) can only hint at the distress, suffering and illness the three of us had to contend with. For example, Mr Knowles died at 10.27 pm and within six minutes we were informed that another patient for the bed was on her way in. I now write to you for your advice and support. Yours faithfully, FG Pink JANUARY 11 Dear Mr Geraghty, As from February 1, I am prepared to be employed without salary. The money could then be utilised to employ trained nurses for, I estimate, up to six nights every week. If the health authority can match, or slightly improve upon, my offer, we could raise enough money to employ two trained nurses for the whole week and every week. Yours sincerely , FG Pink JANUARY 25 Dear Mr Pink, I have discussed your offer of being employed without salary with Mr Caldwell, the unit general manager. We considered this to be an extremely generous offer. However, I must inform you that regretfully we are unable to accept. Difficulties regarding conditions of employment, contractual arrangements and insurance make it impracticable. Yours sincerely , J. Geraghty MARCH 21 The Prime Minister 10 Downing Street Dear Prime Minister, May I tell you that on December 11 I wrote to your Secretary of State for Health to seek his advice. On January 8 and February 15 I wrote to him again. Not only has Mr Clarke not replied but, after 14 weeks, I have not even had the courtesy of an acknowledgement. Please read what I have sent you and be the one person to show some genuine concern for nobody else has. Yours faithfully, FG Pink MARCH 23 Peter Milnes General Manager, Stockport health authority Dear Mr Milnes, Thank you for your letters of February 12 and 26. Your continuing concern regarding our staffing levels is noted. Just how different our situation could be was most vividly brought home to me a week or so ago. The lack of opportunity to sit quietly and talk to, or just listen to, a patient is particularly distasteful and sad as, in the hours of darkness particularly, a worrying, disturbed or frightened person may long to unburden himself to a caring listener. We had at least one such gentleman on the ward that night, Mr Haviland, who had been informed by doctor the previous day that he had cancer. I could sense that he wanted to talk to someone that first night, but had no time to spare . . . At about 9.30 pm, with very little progress made on the drug round, the phone rang for the seventh or eighth time. It was Mrs Haviland. She was clearly in some considerable distress, knowing that, after 52 years of marriage, she was soon to become a widow. She was alone at home and needed, I think, someone to talk to. We spoke for close on 10 minutes. Their sole child had died, after a lifetime of handicap, only last year and and now she had no other relative but her husband. I said all the right things and she appeared to gain some comfort from my reassurance that Mr Haviland was settled and pain-free and would be carefully and constantly watched through the night a justifiable untruth in the circumstances. As our conversation ended, a staff nurse, unknown to me, walked on to the ward. She had come, she said, to help out from the intensive care unit. I was able to proceed with the medications while she attended to the other care which only a nurse is able to undertake. By 10.40 pm, all observations, testing, charting, treatment and nursing care was completed and the lights were out an almost unheard of position to be in. Once the patients had settled down, I took the opportunity provided by our second nurse to go to Mr Haviland and sit by his bed. I told him of his wife's call and this, when he realised I had plenty of time to stay with him, encouraged him to speak of his fears and concerns not for himself, but for his beloved wife. I doubt that I have ever spent a more intensely poignant yet worthwhile 49 minutes and was thankful that the lights were out. As we clasped hands, he drifted into sleep. Had I been in any doubt these recent months about the justice or morality of my stand for more nurses, that one night dispelled it. I am now convinced, beyond peradventure, how compellingly valid is the claim. Would that I could persuade others. Yours sincerely , FG Pink.

The health authority replies THE general manager of Stockport health authority, Peter Milnes, says he has ordered a report on Graham Pink's complaints. The issue, says Mr Milnes, is not the crude numbers of staff deployed, but the quality of care they are able to offer in relation to varying patient needs. 'There is no doubt in my mind that geriatric wards are among the most demanding and the busiest. Mr Pink has registered his view very firmly and we are taking that very seriously. The matter is still under review. I am not yet, however, convinced that the level of concern he plainly has is justified.' Mr Milnes says he has asked his chief nursing officer to prepare a definitive report on appropriate staffing levels on the acute elderly care wards. He says this was decided after Mr Pink asked him and the district chairman to visit the wards, not as a consequence of the nursewriting to London.

Saddam Hussein, said our prime minister, far from showing signs of withdrawing from Kuwait, continued even this week to reinforce there. The current figure for Iraqi troops in the '19th province' was now an estimated 600,000. Mr Major did not dwell on that fact. But, if he had, he might have added that conventional military wisdom the text book solution is that an offensive force needs, in prudence, a 3-1 numerical majority over a settled defensive force in order to give fair guarantee of success. The text books, of course, aren't always right. They did not hold in the Falklands. But any soldier advising any politician today would not be blithe. The soldier might be confident, cheered by his equipment and his men. But he would not be blithe. John Major, to be fair, was not blithe yesterday. But he was a trifle underpowered. There were few cheers, even from his own backbenches, as he sat down. The prime minister, at the close, had merely rehearsed the familiar wisdom garnered, at second hand, from Washington. There was little sense of an independent country taking its own decisions. Rather, there was some pursed-lip disdain for countries, like France, seeking to exercise such a measure of independence. It may be, for the moment, that distance isn't necessary. As the deadline passes, public opinion in the various countries of the alliance has merely hardened a little in line with earlier judgments. In America, George Bush commands somewhat greater support. In Britain, there is further endorsement of what most voters perceive will happen in any case (by contrast, the pendulum swings the other way in Germany and France). That is entirely predictable: but not in all respects heartening. In the United Kingdom, particularly, there is a real question of whether public opinion has been wholly prepared for the strains it may have to endure. American public opinion has, at least, had the benefit of weeks of Congressional hearings and three days of solemn, exhaustive debate. Britain even yesterday had to rely on the fringes, the diligent Heath, the exploring Ashdown, for a full sense of the options. Neil Kinnock was pretty impressive: a weightier performer, on this occasion, than the prime minister. But, in a parliamentary democracy, an opposition stuck with the role of not opposing always has problems. Labour is not to be glibly criticised for that. The difficulties have been enormous and the emerging emphasis on negotiation too cheaply derided by political enemies. But the Government, over five months, has not had to work hard enough at making its case: and the omission shows, because that case falls too swiftly into slogans. The last hours before war deserve better than that: and so, frankly, do the French government (with their array of backers). It seems that any linkage between an Iraqi retreat and a Middle East conference is practical delusion: Saddam isn't going. But 'test us' said Tariq Aziz last week. The French tried to apply that test. They deserve some credit for that. Could Britain have made the same individual approaches? That is not the role we have cast ourselves for (though we, with the Americans, will do most of the fighting and dying for the world community). Back to those 600,000 Iraqi troops, rattled out like cost-of-living figures. Do we yet, emotionally, realise the possibilities? We may not be blithe, but have we been fully serious?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1993/nov/28/leaders.northernireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1993-11-28T01:05:29Z","webTitle":"1993 leader: an historic opportunity we cannot afford to miss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1993/nov/28/leaders.northernireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1993/nov/28/leaders.northernireland","fields":{"headline":"An historic opportunity we cannot afford to miss","bodyText":"The disclosure that the Government has been pursuing indirect contacts with the IRA through its secret network may prove to be a landmark in the history of Northern Ireland. The fact that such contacts have taken place is not amazing: no responsible Government could afford not to try to keep some channels open. That those contacts should have included formal position papers is more remarkable. That the Government should admit the contacts have taken place is even more important. There have been so many false starts in Ulster that any predictions of progress towards peace have to be treated with every caution. But, this time, it is just possible that the soothsayers are right: an historic opportunity for peace in Ireland may have arrived and the Prime Minister, for all his qualms and caution, may be prepared to grasp it. But first, the cautions. Whitehall, while accepting that there have been indirect contacts, has been quick to deny that they involved any talks as such - or that any Minister or official was directly involved. Officials have been at pains to point out that their position as relayed in the papers given to the IRA kept strictly to the Government line: no talks without a solid and public ceasefire, no move without full democratic endorsement by the population of Northern Ireland. There has been no secret deal as such. Indeed, even the contact now revealed appears to have ceased in June when John Major's need for Unionist support on Maastricht led to a downplaying of this line of communication. But communication it was; and, in politics, context is everything. The prospects for peace in Northern Ireland are better now than at any time since the disastrous bombing campaign of 1968 put paid to Sinn Fein's hopes of becoming a respectable political force. What is different now is partly the mood in the province. The population is sick of killing, desperate for a different world for its children. Such a mood has been experienced before. This time, it is prompting a response in Dublin and London. John Major and Albert Reynolds differ from their predecessors in their pragmatism and are taken by the opportunities of becoming peace-makers. Britain, as a leaked Irish position paper this month showed, is ready to concede that it has no fundamental economic or strategic interest in keeping Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom as such. The Irish Government might be willing to drop the clauses of its Constitution laying claim to the North. The uncertain ingredients in the equation are the direct players: the IRA and the Unionists. On the IRA score there is reason for hope. The contacts between the British and their intermediaries, and the talks between Gerry Adams and John Hume, have indicated that the IRA leadership recognises the diminishing rewards of violence. It would be a foolish Government that ignored these signs. The Unionists are more problematic. They represent the majority and have the deepest historical cause for fear and loathing of the Republicans. But they also have something to gain from arrangements that would see Dublin dropping its claims to the North and the introduction of more local democracy. Not for nothing has Mr Major chosen this week to announce the setting up of a Northern Ireland Commons Committee in answer to their demands. Of course, this could all be play acting, a game in which Mr Major keeps his options open and passes the parcel called 'Blame for failed peace hopes' to others. But he is wise to keep inching forward through agreement on all fronts. The Unionists cannot be ignored or underestimated. In another sense it does not matter how far Mr Major has a carefully worked-out game plan. The crucial point is the tide in the affairs of Northern Ireland. If it can be taken at the flood, the lesson of South Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East is that it can lead to fortune. The worst thing that could happen is that, in confirming that contacts have taken place, the Government should scorn them, opening the door to a new generation of terrorists. The best thing would be that, in avowing them, it should ride the tide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1995/may/16/japan.fromthearchive","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1995-05-16T12:25:41Z","webTitle":"Shoko tactics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1995/may/16/japan.fromthearchive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1995/may/16/japan.fromthearchive","fields":{"headline":"Shoko tactics","bodyText":"Some people say it began on his pilgrimage to the holy Buddhist and Hindu places in the Himalayas in the 1980s. Others say that his real self-discovery came earlier, when the partially-sighted Chizuo Matsumoto attended a school for blind children and realised the truth of Erasmus's assertion that in the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king. Matsumoto wanted to be more than a king or mere emperor. He aspired to be ruler of the world, if not God. Matsumoto is better known as Shoko Asahara, the 40-year-old self styled guru of the doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo (Way of Divine Truth). His impending arrest on murder charges, including masterminding the March terror nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system which killed 12 people and sent 5,500 to hospital, now makes the task of the police more, not less, difficult. They have to make their charges stick without triggering violent attacks by Asahara's aggrieved disciples, though the arrest yesterday of the cult's 'intelligence minister', 25-year-old Yoshihiro Inoue, who is alleged to have commanded the subway attack, reduces that risk. 'It was as if Asahara wanted to create Armageddon all on his own,' said an appalled Japanese official as he saw what was discovered at Aum's sprawling commune in the foothills of the very symbol of Japan, Mount Fuji. Week after week, a fascinated Japan watched as television cameras showed thousands of police mobilised in the country's biggest-ever criminal investigation, many wearing protective anti-chemical and gas warfare suits and carrying caged canaries to warn them of possible dangers round the corner. Fascination turned to horror at what came out of the Kamikuishiki compound: tons of chemicals that can be used for making the deadly sarin nerve gas used in the Tokyo attack, as well as for nitroglycerine and dynamite: enough chemicals to kill tens of millions. Then came gun parts and precision lathes for making weapons, a Russian military helicopter and recipes for germ and viral warfare cash and gold worth millions of pounds, and disturbing notes suggesting that Asahara was intent on buying heavy weapons from Russia and seeking access to its nuclear and laser weapons technology. Early on, police realised that this was a dangerous game of smoke and mirrors. Aum's 'sacred chapel', containing a five metre high image of the Hindu god Shiva, god of destruction, was off limits to all but the cult's chosen followers. No wonder: behind the religious images was a big chemical gas plant. This was a relatively easy discovery, and helped expose the cult's protests that its factories were for making fertilisers, plastic products and toothpaste. It took weeks of hunting before police found seven members of Aum's chemicals ministry hiding in a secret room underneath the office. Only after arresting them did the police discover yet another secret room, beneath the first. It contained a stainless steel tank, possibly to hold chemicals or acid. One policeman speculated that this might be how the sect disposed of the bodies of people it was thought to have kidnapped. Aum's Russian connections, where Asahara claims 30,000 disciples (three times as many as in Japan), added another dimension of fear. He visited Moscow many times sponsored by a leading university, had a regular radio programme beamed to Japan and was negotiating to buy an arsenal of weaponry, from tanks to nuclear arms. Aum had also infiltrated the Japanese self-defence forces (equivalent to armed forces, which Japan is not allowed to have under its 'peace' constitution) and was plugged into its intelligence. Two active members of the forces (out of about 60 SDF members of Aum) leaked vital information to the cult about police raids. Individually, any of these pieces of information would have rung warning bells. Put together, they suggest no mere crackpot cult but a threat to Japan's established civil authority which no one would have guessed from looking at the pictures or video of the tubby, bearded Asahara. Born the fourth of seven sons of the owner of a tatami mat shop, his poor eyesight led to him being sent to a school for the blind where he used his limited vision to establish dominance - for example, by taking classmates to a restaurant in return for having his own meal paid for. When he left school he became an acupuncturist and made a fortune selling Chinese medicines before he was fined for selling quack products. He then went to the Himalayas, studied Buddhism and Hinduism, claimed to have had a religious conversion and set up Aum, with Shiva as commanding deity of a cult that mixed Buddhist, Hindu and Tibetan tantric practices. He claimed to be a god on the same level as Shiva or Gautama Buddha. Asahara has none of the obvious attractions, say, of the Indian guru Bhagwan Rajneesh, who had hypnotic eyes and mellifluent speech. For all this, he clearly speaks to a yearning inside many Japanese for something beyond the regimented quest for material assets. His recruits were not riff-raff or outcasts, but included potential leaders, graduates from the best universities. His lawyer, Yoshinobu Aoyama, is a graduate of the elite Kyoto University, and passed the immensely difficult legal examination while an undergraduate. More to the point, Asahara recruited talented scientists, from astro-physicists to chemists and engineers who became his chosen 'priests'. One of the most attractive recruiting features among young Japanese disillusioned with materialism was Asahara's claim to have achieved enlightenment and the ability to levitate - though cynics say the video make it look more like a bounce brought by an almighty fart. Asahara 'proved very good at canvassing the young,' says Taro Takimoto, a lawyer advising some of the people who have fled the cult's embrace. 'For example, Aum approaches the young using friendly names such as 'Meditation club', 'Indian curry and astrology' and so on. It also fascinates the young by saying that it is a source stream of Tibetan esoteric Buddhism. It appeals to those who have been well fed, don't know hunger and cannot find the purpose of their life. It is as if Aum can give them ultimate values.' Stress on yoga also helps to smooth relations with nosy parents who might be alarmed by the cult. Once inside, Asahara steeled his recruits with a fierce discipline, according to Takimoto, 'to promote the idea that Asahara is supreme guru, superior to God.' An older recruit recounted how he had to drink 'several gallons of warm water and vomit them as part of my training.' He was given a portable toilet and told to drink water until his excrement turned transparent. Young children, some three years old, were made to wear a sort of rugby scrumcap bristling with electrodes and connected to batteries strapped to their stomachs. This was part of the 'Perfect Salvation' system designed to transmit Asahara's brain waves to the wearers. The really privileged drank Asahara's blood and semen in transference of the guru's powers, though they had to pay 10 million yen (£74,000). Lifestyles for followers were spartan, but the price was high. Asahara became practised at getting money from his disciples. One middle-aged woman said she 'had to provide a list of my assets and promise that Aum could handle them if I died. I was told to bring bank books, cash and jewellery to contribute to the sect.' With such contributions, Aum was able to buy the land at Kamikuishiki. Indeed, the first time that Aum came to police notice was over mysterious kidnaps of relatives of its members, believed to be protesting over its seizing of their assets. Lawyer Takimoto notes that when unsavoury revelations began to emerge about Aum, even before the Tokyo subway terror, disciples had been brainwashed to defend the cult. 'The reason why some followers run away from Aum is not because they are disillusioned with Asahara but because they cannot bear the hard work or confinement, or they still love their parents,' he says. 'But many retain their respect for Asahara and others fear that they will go to eternal hell if they break with Aum. They have been taught it and they believe it.' Far from denying brainwashing, Asahara boasted that 'Aum's system of brainwashing is the best', according to documents at the commune. He added: 'Rather than helping human society, which has become like hell, I have started to think that my role is to help the new believers of high spirituality survive.' Asahara taught that Armageddon would happen in 1997 and only Aum disciples would be guaranteed salvation. Glimpses of his prophecies emerged in the diary of Masami Tsuchiya, head of Aum's chemical arms unit and one of the seven captured in the secret hiding place, who admitted making sarin gas. 'Asahara will be imprisoned in the 1990s, but his trial will prove the existence of supernatural power and all 100 million Japanese will become followers of Aum,' Tsuchiya wrote in 1991. Aum would become more powerful than the state in 1995 and it would advance into Jerusalem and be tortured by 'heretics' in 1998-99, but the growing military might of Aum would rescue its disciples. After a 'final' world war, Tsuchiya would help rebuild Japan into a kingdom that would last 1,000 years. Perhaps this explains the plodding police progress, the arrests of almost 200 Aum leaders on minor charges such as giving a false name in a hotel, trespassing in a carpark, failing to register a bicycle, and then their relentless questioning about the subway nerve gas and a spate of terror attacks. These have transformed the mood of Tokyo from complacency that this is the world's safest city to fear of the next atrocity: after the subway gas attack, Japan's police chief was shot and gravely wounded in an assassination attempt the centre of Yokohama, Japan's biggest port and part of greater Tokyo, was twice hit by a milder gas deadly chemicals were found in a lavatory at Shinjuku station in booming western Tokyo and on Saturday a lavatory at Narita airport was bombed. In spite of the prospect of Asahara's arrest, Aum still poses threats. In a bizarre twist which demonstrates the failure of Japan's politicians, Aum spokesman Fumihiro Joyu has acquired a cult-like following of his own with a profusion of magazine articles about him and a fan club whose members say he is the image of a handsome comic book hero. Police had to move on fans who gathered to moon over Joyu outside Aum's Tokyo office. More worryingly, some leading lawyers say the police techniques of arresting Aum leaders on minor charges and grilling them offer unhappy reminders of the road to the militarism and police state of the 1930s. And even when Asahara is arrested, the police will still have to secure a conviction against the angry protests of Aum followers. Tokyo is particularly nervous about new terrors. No wonder a leading company sees big business in a pounds 70 portable gasmask it is about to market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1995/oct/10/obituaries","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1995-10-10T13:57:43Z","webTitle":"Lord Home of the Hirsel obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/oct/10/obituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1995/oct/10/obituaries","fields":{"headline":"Lord Home of the Hirsel obituary","bodyText":"Lord Home who has died at the age of 92, was in manner unobtrusive and undemanding yet reached the height of his political career, first as foreign secretary and next as prime minister, in melodramatic circumstances. He was the first foreign secretary for 20 years to be a member of the House of Lords he was the first (and surely last) man ever to disclaim six peerages to become prime minister and he was responsible for arranging that his successor should be chosen by secret ballot held among Conservative members of the House of Commons, with equally melodramatic consequences. His period of supreme power was short. He became prime minister on October 19 1963, and resigned on October 16 1964, when Labour won the general election. He remained leader of the opposition and of the Conservative party from that date only until July 28, 1965, when he resigned, and was succeeded by Edward Heath. In turn, his leader appointed him foreign secretary when the party returned to power in June 1970. The explanation of his brief tenure of power lies in a combination of circumstances. The events leading to his appointment as prime minister in succession to Harold Macmillan enveloped the Conservative party in a cloud of Tory recriminations that challenged his authority as party leader. Hence Sir Alec's decision that the next leader should not be left to 'emerge' by a series of private manoeuvres. He did not foresee the constitutional turmoil this apparently straightforward arrangement would cause when a party election was forced when the Conservatives were in power, so that Conservative MPs would be electing not merely a party leader but a prime minister as well. The succession to Macmillan was contested by Rab (later Lord) Butler, Lord Hailsham (later Quintin Hogg and later still Lord Hailsham), and Reginald Maudling. Sir Alec did not appear to be a candidate at all, but he emerged because he disunited the party less than any of the others. The delicacy of his position was shown by the fact that he did not inform the Queen that he could form a government, on October 19 1963, until he had first secured, earlier that day, the agreement of Butler and Maudling to serve in the cabinet. Even so, Iain Macleod and Enoch Powell refused invitations to join the new government and Macleod published in the Spectator a caustic account of all the skullduggery. After this inauspicious start, the Conservatives lost the general election a year later. Although the number of Conservative MPs fell from 350 at Parliament's dissolution to 303, Tories loyal to Sir Alec - and several independent observers - held that no other leader could have held as much ground as he did, keeping Labour down to a majority of four over Conservatives and Liberals combined. Yet the campaign fed doubts among party managers about Sir Alec's ability to personify enterprise, yout hfulness, and relevance to contemporary circumstances. Conservative Central Office became obsessed with the effect of Sir Alec's television 'image', then a new ingredient in electoral politics. These doubts grew when he became leader of the opposition. In the end, none of his political virtues protected him from an atmosphere of doubt within the party hierarchy which he chose to regard as a notice to quit. So he went, but retained his membership of the House of Commons. His support was indispensable when his successor, Edward Heath, within a few weeks of his election as leader, had to manage a Conservative party that was made extremely restless by the Labour government's action following Rhodesia's illegal declaration of independence. Seldom, before or since, has a defeated leader behaved so magnanimously to his successor. Sir Alec's virtues, by Conservative party tests, were his political 'soundness' (he was an instinctive Conservative of the centre, or perhaps a little to the right), his detachment from normal party rivalries which his birth and training secured for him, his seriousness and integrity as a public figure, and the impression he gave of being 'all of a piece.' He had no gifts of imagination or of oratory, and he knew it. In a broadcast he made on the day he became prime minister he said: \"No one need expect any stunts from me - merely plain, simple talking.\" Nor was he flamboyant in private. A great Scottish landowner, taken with the gentlemanly pursuits of hunting, shooting and fishing, he had a lifelong interest in cricket, and carried about with him a form-book for the Turf. Racing, observed his playwright brother William, was always Sir Alec's main interest. Sir Alec was the eldest son of the 13th Earl of Home and Lilian, daughter of the 4th Earl of Durham. Until he succeeded his father in 1951 he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Dunglass. He went to Eton where he was known as a cricketer and as President of 'Pop,' that exclusive society over which Jo Grimond, his Liberal rival, was later to preside. A weirdly prescient vignette in Cyril Connolly's Enemies Of Promise (1938) called Dunglass \"a votary of the esoteric Eton religion, the kind of graceful, tolerant, sleepy boy who is showered with favours and crowned with all the laurels, who is liked by the masters and admired by the boys without any apparent exertion on his part, without experiencing the ill-effects of success himself or arousing the pangs of envy in others. In the 18th century he would have become Prime Minister before he was 30 as it was, he appeared honourably ineligible for the struggle of life.\" From Eton he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he failed to get a cricket Blue. But the 18th century eventually caught up with the 20th. The Homes were an old-established Scottish family, and Sir Alec decided to contest a Scottish seat for parliament. In 1929 - a superb year for claret but a bad year for the Conservatives - he stood for Coatbridge, a Labour seat, and came second in a three-cornered fight. Two years later - a stunning year for his party - he was elected as member for South Lanark and sat until Labour's 1945 landslide. He lost his seat (the family butler's tearful concern at the cataclysm stimulated William's imagination to produce his famous comedy, The Chiltern Hundreds.) He did not re-enter the Commons until the general election of 1950 when he was returned for Lanark: a year later, on the death of his father, he had to go to the House of Lords as the 14th Earl of Home. In this phase of his career, Sir Alec did not become in any way eminent. As a young member, during the period of mass unemployment, he had few economic remedies to offer. Labour MP Emrys Hughes recalled in a critical biography (1964) that the young member for South Lanark had suggested in the Commons that unemployed coal miners and their families might be brought down from Scotland to the London area to work as domestic servants. The one event of the pre-1939 period for which he was remembered was his service as parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, from 1937 to 1939 and his identification with Chamberlain's appeasement policy. His political role at that time was modest enough for him to be forgiven. After Churchill became prime minister in 1940 Sir Alec faded into the background. He was an officer in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry, but an injury to his back limited his activity during the war. When Churchill formed his 'caretaker' government (May-July, 1945), Sir Alec was given his first ministerial appointment, as under-secretary for foreign affairs, under Anthony Eden. But Labour's term of office from 1945 to 1951 dismissed him once more to the shadows. The return of the Conservatives to office in 1951 was the true start of Sir Alec's rise to power. When Churchill formed his government in 1951, Sir Alec, now Lord Home, was appointed minister of state at the Scottish Office and held this post until 1955. He was then promoted commonwealth relations secretary which he remained until 1960. In this office, he was given other duties, first as deputy leader of the House of Lords (1956-57) and later as leader (1957-60). From 1960 Sir Alec's career became positively dazzling. In that year, prime minister Harold Macmillan appointed Sir Alec as foreign secretary. No member of the House of Lords had held that office since the late Lord Halifax, who was foreign secretary from 1938 to 1940. (Members of the House of Commons prefer to have the principal ministers in their sights.) But the direction of foreign policy was essentially in the control of the prime ministers of the day - Chamberlain and Churchill over Halifax Macmillan over Home. And from 1940 onwards there had been a growing tendency for prime ministers to make the great policy decisions in personal contact with the heads of other states - wisely or not. Sir Alec had one outstanding quality for his work as foreign secretary: to some foreigners he was the very embodiment of a moderate, British, Conservative tradition - although Americans missed a democratic touch in him. The foreign policy was Macmillan's, but Sir Alec made one personal contribution that provoked hot controversy in parliament. On December 28, 1961, he made a speech strongly attacking the United Nations. He spoke of \"a crisis of confidence\" at the UN arising, as he put it, from the double standards that were being applied - one for the democracies, and another for the Communist and Afro-Asian countries. He criticised in particular the Security Council's vote in favour of India's attack on Goa - the first time, he said, that the UN had \"voted publicly and without shame in favour of the use of force to achieve national ends\" - and also the tendency of newer members of the UN to concentrate on \"ending colonialism\" without regard \"to the primary Charter obligations to maintain international peace and security.\" For Labour, with the taste of Suez still in their mouths, Hugh Gaitskell described this as \"the worst humbug and hypocrisy.\" One other notable event occurred while Sir Alec was foreign secretary. On August 5, 1963, he signed for Britain the nuclear test ban treaty which had been arranged with the US and the USSR. By 1963 a succession of crises and scandals, culminating in the resignation of war minister John Profumo in the Christine Keeler affair, led to Macmillan's retirement. That October Sir Alec succeeded to the premiership. Constitutionally, the means by which he qualified himself to be prime minister were novel at the time and remain relevant. No member of the House of Lords had been prime minister since the time of Lord Salisbury's last administration (1895-1902), and Sir Alec's career must have fixed the convention that the prime minister must always be a member of the House of Commons. The Peerage Act 1963 permitted members of the House of Lords, in certain circumstances, to disclaim their peerages for life and thus to be free to stand for election to the Commons. The first politician who announced his intention to disclaim his peerage, in order to compete for the succession to Macmillan, was Lord Hailsham. But Lord Home used the machinery of the Act to disclaim his own peerages after he had been appointed prime minister. He was then the first beneficiary of Anthony Wedgwood Benn's successful constitutional campaign to disclaim his own peerage, somewhat to the discomfiture of Benn and other Labour MPs. On October 23, 1963, Sir Alec signed an instrument of disclaimer of four titles of Scotland - the earldom of Home, the lordship of Dunglass, the lordship of Home and the lordship of Hume of Berwick, one United Kingdom peerage - the barony of Douglas and one British peerage - the barony of Hume of Berwick. He remained 'Sir' Alec because he had been created a Knight of the Thistle in 1962. Having disclaimed his peerages, he was elected a member of the House of Commons for Kinross and West Perthshire. To allow the byelection the opening of a new session of parliament was postponed from October 29 until November 12. There is little to tell of Sir Alec's year as prime minister. The statutory life of the parliament elected in 1959 was running out, and the most awkward problem his government had to face was the usual increasingly adverse balance of payments and a growing threat to sterling. Sir Alec had no gift for handling such a problem, and the Conservatives were naturally not anxious to enter a general election with a programme of economic austerity. Sir Alec's attitude towards the up-and-coming Margaret Thatcher was admiration tinged with awe. When they were cabinet colleagues under Edward Heath he is on record as remarking that \"she's got the brains of all of us put together, and so we'd better look out.\" In personality and political style the two were a world apart, yet the turbulent and confused political scene revealed, as it unfolded, strange similarities. Both found themselves leading their party from the right of centre, against what most people took to be the tide of the time. Thatcher, when she came to assume power, had no hesitation in following the Macmillan-Home precedent by making another peer, Lord Carrington, her foreign secretary. Yet Eden, decades earlier, had wanted Lord Salisbury for the post but had decided that his appointment would be unacceptable to the Commons. In practice Home's occupation, as of right, of the two Houses had proved a convenience and at times even a benefit to parliament. Yet he seemed more truly at home in the better-behaved Lords, where his modest style was less likely to be misinterpreted. He enjoyed quiet jokes and liked telling an interviewer that he could never be prime minister because he did his sums with matchsticks. A year later he was in Number 10. A year after that, from the opposition front bench, he was able to make the mild claim that his matchsticks seemed to work at least as well as Labour's economic devices and advisers. Then there was the joke about the 14th Mr Wilson, in retaliation for Harold Wilson's repeated jibes about the 14th Earl. He could be the target of more punishing wit, as when Michael Foot, noting a tendency to be tougher abroad than at home, called him \"a belligerent Bertie Wooster without even a Jeeves to restrain him.\" But these occasions were uncommon. Home on the home front made a frustrating opponent because his habitual courtesy, rare in the modern Commons, acted as an independent deterrent - an armour which was so defensively effective that he hardly needed weapons of attack. His second spell as foreign secretary carried us relentlessly into modern times: Europe and the cold war, the American relationship, conflict and arms sales in the Middle East. Aware always of what he called \"the desperately thin ice\" we walked on, he surveyed the world and our place in it with a pensive realism, striking no heroic postures. It was with complete if ever-quiet authority that he was able to assure James Callaghan, handing over the foreign secretaryship when Labour assumed office in the mid-seventies, that \"we have both been the shadow but the substance is very different.\" That had to be true on the home front, too. Any idea of Lord Home moving into history as an agent of change, forward change at least, must seem bizarre. Yet the 14th earl could hardly have made his final return as plain Lord Home of the Hirsel, a humble life peer, without reflecting that after the constitutional disturbance which had enabled him to shed his earldom, and become prime minister, the House of Lords could never be the same again. In 1991-92 Margaret Thatcher's acceptance of a life peerage may have been eased by the Home example of moving House in the necessary direction at his country's call. The delights and perils of the British constitution are that you never quite know. His wife Elizabeth predeceased him. They had a son, now the 15th Earl, and three daughters.

I had just arrived from America where it had been warm. I think he was trying to do to me what he imagines I do to others, which is to point out their shortcomings in order to needle them.\" Theroux is a prolific and varied author. He has written nearly 30 novels - including the acclaimed My Secret History and The Mosquito Coast - but it is the travel books, starting with The Great Railway Bazaar in 1975, which have made his name. He writes beautifully, about the \"flutter-blast of someone snoring\" in a hotel room, or Tibet's snowy mountains, looking as if \"made out of starched and crushed bedsheets\". But it is his ill-humour that people remember. His travel books are hugely popular but none of his readers would sensibly want to share a journey with him. Not that he is asking. His new book, The Pillars Of Hercules, is a tour of the Mediterranean coast, covering the 2,000-mile shore from Gibraltar to Tel Aviv, by bus, train and ferry. It is vintage, pungent Theroux. He dismisses bullfighting (\"Elaborate cultural explanations are made on behalf of bullfighting. I found them all laughable\") and Spanish cooking (\"undistinguished, unmemorable, regional\"). Barcelona gets a thumbs-up but for dubious reasons: \"People in Barcelona were apparently buying and reading my books. . .\" He is very funny and sometimes just lets the bizarre wash over him - being tutored in Australian slang by a Syrian in Aleppo, for example - but the overall impression is of someone spoiling for a fight. He gets lippy with a tour guide at Pompeii, who points out a large phallus drawn on a wall. \"In America,\" Theroux tells him, \"we would call that a small dick.\" And on a Spanish bus, he quarrels with an American tourist who has boasted that his wife had once been a Las Vegas showgirl. Theroux stops on his way off the bus: \"Laughing a little, I said, 'Your husband tells me you were a Las Vegas showgirl. I would never have known.' The last sound I heard,\" he writes, \"was this woman's howl ringing through the bus . . .\" We meet at an hotel in Knightsbridge. Theroux in the flesh is much milder than in print. He is 54, but with his glossy hair and preppy tortoiseshell glasses, he looks younger and reminds you of an American professor of English: a job he did in the sixties, teaching in Singapore and Malawi, where he went with the Peace Corps to avoid the Vietnam War draft. He was born in Boston but his accent has been softened by living for 17 years in England until 1991, when his marriage to a BBC journalist ended after 20 years and he moved to Hawaii. Theroux is civil, but not warm except about his own interests in bee-keeping and collecting erotic Japanese prints. (Pornography features heavily in his books.) He is very guarded about his private life. He has two grown-up sons, both working over here in television. He now lives with someone he grudgingly admits is called Sheila, who works in public relations. Public relations are not his strength. His books, he once said, are not up for debate. \"Yeah, these people who buy your books,\" he says; \". . . it's their licence to bore, to bore you rigid. The worst don't even buy the book but buttonhole you because they are planning to go to Abu Dhabi and want to know whether they can drink the water.\" He is dismissive of bad reviews, too. \"Bad reviews are usually a hate letter from an envious, often talentless hack.\" He originally wanted to be a doctor but was diverted by writing. He grew up in a big Catholic family, the third of seven children. Two others also became writers but he does not think there was anything in the genes. \"People do not become writers out of healthy literary impulse, but out of a deep loneliness, a deficiency, a kind of dysfunction . . . and on the positive side, they turn to books for solace. It's all sorts of things. It's conceit. It's signalling for attention. People who are normal don't become writers.\" Theroux's father, whose own family were French Canadians, ran a leather business until it folded, when he became a shoe salesman. Theroux's mother is Italian which makes his reserve seem surprising but he explains she is northern Italian. \"Not hysterical and demonstrative. Northern Italians tend to look down on southern Italians as ice-cream sellers, operatic, faintly annoying . . .\" Perhaps it was this early lesson that encouraged his style of describing whole races in a few glib lines, calling Tongans, \"lazy, mocking, quarrelsome\" or claiming that all American Samoans are fat. \"All I said,\" he replies, \"was that all the Samoans I have met are fat. It is the nature of writing to find texture, differences. But if you find differences in people's cultures, you're labelled as grumpy. It's welcome to the world of political correctness.\" Theroux plays on his grumpy reputation throughout his book, but he says he is still surprised by reactions to his style. \"I think of my writing as good-tempered, humorous, forgiving on the whole. I have always been on pretty good terms with the human race. But you can't be on such good terms with it that you don't see it. When it's all forgiveness, there's no writing.\" He appears to put Eric Newby in the category of over-forgiving travel writers, sending him up in his new book for having written enthusiastically about a restaurant in Nice. \"Never catch me doing a thing like that, I was thinking, as I had my fish soup (quite pleasant), in a restaurant (fairly empty), all the while chatting to the proprietor (a big bore).\" It is unfair of Theroux: Newby's enthusiasm manages to convey the foreignness of what he sees (and eats) and anyway how could Theroux know what Newby's meal was like? \"Just a joke, just a joke,\" he says, with an airy wave. \"And there is this kind of travel writing in which everything is about enthusiasm, particularly in magazines. In a sense, everything I write is a reaction against that kind of writing. My first book was certainly a reaction to that. I thought, I don't want to see the sights in India. I don't want to see the Taj Mahal. I simply want to write about a trip, and about myself.\" Theroux never takes a camera on his travels - \"a camera robs me of my concentration\". Nor does he actually enjoy discomfort or risk. On his Mediterranean trip, he avoids Algiers - \"I didn't want to die\" - and instead devotes a large and very funny section to a luxury two-week cruise. He always travels with a Swiss army knife, a torch, a shortwave radio and little leather notebooks. He fishes one out of his breastpocket and reads from his most recent jottings: a piece of graffiti he saw in Ecuador, protesting about the nuclear tests (\"Better to have a Polynesian embrace than a French kiss\") and a note about a notice he had seen in London: Keep The Royal Borough of Kensington Tidy - drink Coca-Cola. \"That's Thatcher's Britain,\" he says. \"Everything turned over to the advertisers.\" Unlike America? \"Surely you can afford to put up a little sign saying keep the country clean without having to get Coca-Cola to pay for it? It's much more subtle in America.\" It is a perverse remark, typical of Theroux who is noticeably pro-American in his books. In The Kingdom By The Sea, he wrote: 'The sun on Skye warmed the pines and the flowers and gave it the fragrance of Nantucket.\" Why has Theroux never turned his merciless eye on America? \"If I could think of a way of doing it, I'd do it. But I have to have an itinerary, an idea for a route, rather than just going from place to place, sniping away.\" He has considered a hitchhike through the States, \"but I am cautioned by the example of Jack Kerouac who when he was about 50 or so, left New York and went to New Jersey, stuck his thumb out and couldn't get a ride all day. He was a grizzled looking man. He had to take the bus home.\" Theroux, with his deceptively mild looks, would probably have better luck and you hope that he does, because of his shafts of wit and observation in between the sour words. And also because his perverse style only encourages you to visit whatever place he has just carpeted, to prove him wrong. In this sense he follows in the tradition of Evelyn Waugh, whom Theroux quotes approvingly, from his 1930 travel book, Labels. \"I do not think I shall ever forget the sight of Etna at sunset,\" Waugh wrote, \"the mountain almost invisible in a blur of pastel grey . . . with the whole horizon behind radiant with pink light fading gently into a grey pastel sky. Nothing I have ever seen in Art or Nature was quite so revolting.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1996/jun/27/alqaida.terrorism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1996-06-27T11:03:51Z","webTitle":"Gulf states search for Dhahran bombers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1996/jun/27/alqaida.terrorism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1996/jun/27/alqaida.terrorism","fields":{"headline":"Gulf states search for Dhahran bombers","bodyText":"The United States and its Gulf allies began casting around the region yesterday for the groups, or states, to blame for the Dhahran bombing, which claimed 19 American lives and 264 casualties. A small but unknown group claimed responsibility for the attack yesterday, but this did not stop fingers being pointed at the Gulf's public enemy number one, Iran. Iranian officials dismissed the speculation as 'another attempt by undemocratic and corrupt states' to blame internal unrest on external forces. Last month, the neighbouring Gulf state of Bahrain accused Iran of attempting to overthrow its government. More likely, several Arab analysts said, the truth was that the bombing was carried out by one of the myriad clandestine Islamic opposition groups operating in the kingdom. In the last two years, Saudi Arabia has seen a growth of Islamic groups using fax machines, and now bombs, to put their message across. Saudi opposition politics began with Mohammed al-Mas'ari of the Committee of the Defence for Legitimate Rights, now based in London. There are much more radical groups operating underground at home. Culled largely from the lower ranks of society, their numbers have been supplemented by Saudi veterans of the Afghan war, whose cause was once supported by the West. Today, Afghan veterans form the backbone of militant groups threatening the governments of Algeria, Egypt, Jordan and other Arab states. This loose network of groups, known as the jihadis, are committed to the removal of US and other Western forces from the holy land of Islam, Saudi Arabia. All are critical of the pro-Western policies of the ruling al Saud family, and view the economic and social policies of the conservative regime as un-Islamic. 'The jihadi groups are the lunatic fringe of Islamic fundamentalism. They reject modernism, democracy as kaffir (heathen). They are very dangerous,' a Saudi expert on Islamic groups said. One of the acknowledged leaders of the jihadi trend is Abu Mohammed al-Maqdisi, an Islamic scholar currently in jail in Jordan. He was visited several times by one of the bombers who confessed to last November's explosion at a US military mission in Riyadh. That bombing, like the Dhahran attack, was preceded by several warnings to the US and British embassies, threatening attacks on Western forces in the kingdom. The November bombing was claimed by two previously unknown groups, the Tigers of the Gulf and the Movement for Islamic Change. Tuesday's attack in Dhahran appeared to be a carbon copy of the Riyadh bombing, several analysts said yesterday. Large-scale arrests followed the Riyadh bombing, with around 1,000 people detained, including 500 Saudi veterans of the Afghan war. Soon after, four men were publicly beheaded for the crime. Saudi opposition sources said yesterday they had had reports that two of the Riyadh bombers were still at large and probably still in Saudi Arabia. Official circles were pinpointing another leader of the jihadi trend, Osama bin Ladin, the former Saudi national known for the logistics and financial support he gave to Arabs who went to fight in Afghanistan. Last month Bin Ladin was forced to leave Sudan, and has since been reported in Afghanistan, Somalia, or still in Sudan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/1996/oct/29/20yearsoftheturnerprize.turnerprize","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"1996-10-29T17:01:01Z","webTitle":"News: 1996 shortlist and show criticised as anodyne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/1996/oct/29/20yearsoftheturnerprize.turnerprize","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/1996/oct/29/20yearsoftheturnerprize.turnerprize","fields":{"headline":"Turner show will turn no heads","bodyText":"Spinning heads, green vomit, bean bags - none of these things will be seen in the Turner prize exhibition which opens today at the Tate Gallery in London. Instead, visitors to the annual showcase of contemporary British art, which features the four shortlisted artists for this year's prize, will see a room of paintings, another filled with black and white photographs, and a third dominated by a depiction of the solar system. The room that should have featured a slowed down version of the 1974 horror film The Exorcist - spinning heads and all - instead houses two large screens showing a clip from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, starring Frederic March, made in 1932. The Tate is understood to have dismissed Douglas Gordon's proposal to screen The Exorcist because of worries about its 18 certificate. His less threatening suggestion that bean bags be placed on the floor to allow art lovers to watch the film in comfort was rejected on safety grounds. Mr Gordon gained recognition with a slowed down version of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho which lasted for 24 hours. The Turner Prize, worth £40,000, has in the past thrived on controversy. But this year's shortlist - and now the exhibition - have been criticised as anodyne. \"I'm almost tempted to say 'Come back Damien Hirst, all is forgiven'. It was pitiful,\" said David Lee, editor of Art Review magazine, yesterday. \"The Turner Prize very rarely has any good art in it but it's great for getting people talking about art. What alarms me is the way that this sort of unexceptional art can be taken seriously.\" Gary Hume, one of the shortlisted artists, said he tried to put the thought that he was exhibiting in the Tate out of his mind when preparing the exhibition. \"I just went in to my studio and painted every day,\" he said. \"Showing in the Tate is one of your dreams when you're a little boy.\" Virginia Button, curator of the Turner Prize exhibition since 1993, said: \"More than any other year, it's difficult to pick a winner. This year shows there is no formula.\" The bookmakers had other views, with William Hill making Gary Hume favourite at 6/4. Mr Hume revealed that he had already placed a bet. \"I put money on myself,\" he said. The four artists were selected by a jury following nominations from the public. Previous winners include Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, Anthony Gormley, Howard Hodgkin, and Gilbert &amp; George. This year's winner, who will receive £20,000, will be announced on November 28. The shortlisted artists · Simon Patterson, born 1967, Leatherhead, Surrey. Odds 7/4. Based in east London. After studying at Goldsmith's College, London, he came to attention with a series of signs, including Richard Burton Elizabeth Taylor which consisted of four words printed and mounted in a frame. His signature work is The Great Bear, included at the Tate, a redrawing of the London Underground map which replaces the names of stations with the names of well-known figures. The Tate also includes First Circle, a renaming of the solar system. · Gary Hume, born 1962. Odds 6/4. Based in east London. After studying at Goldsmith's College, Hume made his name with a series of paintings of hospital doors, aiming to make them as realistic as possible. Since then he has moved on to a series of highly-finished paintings. Some are described as intensely personal, while others deal with celebrity. His Turner Prize show includes a portrait of Kate Moss in which the model's face has been polished to a blank, and Innocence and Stupidity, which borrows the image of a rabbit from a medieval French tapestry. · Douglas Gordon, born 1966. Odds 14/1. Based in Glasgow. The only shortlisted artist based outside London, Gordon is also the outsider. He studied at the Slade in London and returned to his native Glasgow, where he produced his 24-hour Psycho. Other notable work includes List of Names, a list of 1,440 names of people he had met who came into his mind while he was making the work. He shaved one arm for a video piece included in the Turner show, and future plans include a slowed-down version of John Ford's 1956 film The Searchers to last five years, the same time as the film's plot. · Craigie Horsfield, born 1949. Odds 7/2. Based in east London. The oldest of the shortlisted artists, Horsfield came to art comparatively late in life. His intentions are grand: to chart \"the history of our century ... the seething extent of the human condition\". During the 1970s, while living in Poland, he taught design and worked as a part-time disc jockey. He returned to the United Kingdom but only came to attention in 1988 with an exhibition of his Polish work at the ICA. He often leaves time between shooting his photographs and printing them, although his Turner show of photographs of Barcelona is an exception."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/1997/feb/10/emu.theeuro","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1997-02-10T03:39:50Z","webTitle":"Forewarned, forearmed: the waiting game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1997/feb/10/emu.theeuro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1997/feb/10/emu.theeuro","fields":{"headline":"Forewarned, forearmed: the waiting game","bodyText":"One vital point that hardly anyone takes on board is that once, as seems likely, France, Germany and their satellites adopt a single currency, Britain will become an accessory after the fact, whether we like it or not. If we do not go into the single currency, it will nevertheless come to us. Once a 'strong' currency in the form of the euro starts circulating in Europe, and is perceived to hold its value more successfully than the money of non-participating countries, then the whole currency game changes. Big corporations in the United Kingdom will immediately adopt the euro as the main medium for their loans. Farmers and European civil servants will be paid in it, and millions of people going abroad will want to use it for its sheer convenience (and the removal of high transaction costs). Euro-denominated charge cards will be in demand, especially from people travelling or holidaying in Europe. Banks, building societies and insurance companies are already planning to meet an unexpected demand from punters wanting to have their savings put into a 'safe' currency to preserve its value, especially against the devaluation-prone pound if Britain stays out of currency union. Once people have a plastic card denominated in euros, it is only a small step to the likes of Tesco accepting it as payment at supermarket checkouts. It is worth remembering that less than five per cent of the money supply is in circulation as physical notes and coins in the economy. It will not be long before the demand for euros converges with improvements in electronic currency, to make it possible for people to use the euro freely in shops in Britain whether or not we enter monetary union. Over time, people may also want their mortgages denominated in the hard euro to preserve value. Then they might want to be paid in euros, so that they do not fall into the trap of having to repay a mortgage in a strengthening currency out of depreciating pounds. How long then before the first wage negotiations are conducted in euros? The emergence of the euro as a kind of Trojan-horse currency would be greatly accelerated if, instead of joining immediately, the government were actively to encourage the euro as a second, or parallel, currency. In this way, instead of the decision to join a common currency being taken by the government from above, it would be taken individually by the people below. The existence of a parallel currency, moreover, would be a strong discipline on the government's monetary policy, because too much monetary laxity would make the Euro more popular as an insurance against inflation and would thus pressurise the government towards a policy that maintained the value of the pound. All this underlines the merits of a 'wait and see' policy as a constructive strategy, rather than a cop-out. It is a good way to minimise the risks attached to irrevocable commitment to both the 'in' and the 'out' positions. Make no mistake: both positions carry enormous risks. Either side may be right. Frankly, we do not yet know. Too much of the running at the moment is being made by economists with an almost religious belief in the certainty of their own presumptions. This argument will never be settled by economic equations, because the outcome will be determined by millions of people exercising their own will. Britain's brush with fixed exchange rates (in the ERM) was even more bruising than the French experience until we extricated ourselves after Black Wednesday in September 1992. Since then, the economy has enjoyed several years of growth which, although modest, has been greater than that of France and Germany and, in contrast to those countries, has ushered in a period of steadily falling unemployment. If Britain had entered an irreversible monetary union rather than the exchange rate mechanism, then we would have been condemned to much higher unemployment (at least in the short term), resulting from British industry's inability to sell exports and compete at home with imports at an overvalued exchange rate. Euro-enthusiasts would argue that, even in this extreme case, the disadvantage to Britain would have been only temporary. This is because if we were locked into monetary union and deprived of the ability to adjust the 'nominal' exchange rate of the pound, Britain would be forced to change our 'real' exchange rate by improving competitiveness in other ways, including reducing labour costs through higher unemployment. This would be very messy and politically unpopular in the short term, but (it is argued) would not make much, or even any, difference in the long term. Or would it? It is this difference between the short- and long-term effects of devaluation (and monetary policy) that lies - and certainly should lie - at the very heart of the debate. If devaluation merely makes good a short-term loss of competitiveness, which would be solved anyway inside monetary union (albeit at the cost of higher short-term unemployment), then the consequences of locking a currency into a permanent union would not be so great. But suppose Britain kept on paying higher wages inside a monetary union, even though companies were forced to lay off workers? Is there not then a danger that monetary union would become a permanent unemployment machine for the United Kingdom?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1997/feb/10/emu.theeuro1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1997-02-10T03:39:50Z","webTitle":"Why we must not be tempted into the single currency maze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1997/feb/10/emu.theeuro1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1997/feb/10/emu.theeuro1","fields":{"headline":"Why we must not be tempted into the single currency maze","bodyText":"Enthusiasts for monetary union say that a single currency will be good for jobs and prosperity and that it is needed to make the single market work properly. They are wrong. Moving to irrevocably fixed exchange rates will intensify the deflationary bias in European economic politics witnessed during the past 20 years, adding to unemployment and ultimately threatening to tear the EU asunder. This is because political calculations, not hard economic imperatives, lie at the heart of the single-currency project. As Lord Lawson put it, when giving evidence to the parliamentary Treasury select committee in 1996, monetary union is being driven by Germany's fear of its past and by the French desire to \"corral Germany and abolish the Bundesbank\". Explaining his objections to monetary union, the former Chancellor added: \"I don't want us to join because it's, at best, premature and, at worst, extremely damaging. It is likely to be damaging while the peoples of Europe are not in favour of submerging their autonomy, sovereignty and loyalty into a wider European loyalty. To do it prematurely would be to strain the political fabric and give full rein to xenophobes and demagogues in every country in Europe.\" He went on to state that the two main advantages claimed for a single currency - no transaction costs for changing currencies within Europe and the elimination of exchange-rate uncertainty - were far outweighed by the economic drawbacks: \"The main disadvantage of a single monetary policy is that the larger, more varied and disparate the union, the less likely it is that the monetary policy will be appropriate for all parts of the union at all times.\" Wise words. The lessons of 1992 and 1993 - when the exchange rate mechanism first creaked and was then blown apart - have not been learnt in the capitals of Europe. Or, if they were, they have been swiftly forgotten. Britain's departure from the ERM on 'Black Wednesday' was not the result of a dastardly plot hatched by some spivs in the City and by George Soros, but occurred because the economy was being crippled by an economic policy that simply did not add up. Britain needed lower interest rates and a cheaper pound, and once the decision was made to suspend ERM membership, it got both. Under a single currency, neither policy tool would be available, because interest rates would be set by the 15 central bankers running the European Central Bank and exchange rates would be fixed for all time. It is not sufficient, in response to these queries, to say that all countries will have their say in a collective decision. One vote out of 15 does not equate with the Chancellor of the Exchequer deciding the monetary policy that he deems right for the United Kingdom's circumstances at any one time. It is said, of course, that economic sovereignty is a red herring, because Britain signed away large chunks of her sovereignty when she joined the European Community in 1973, and a lot more when Mrs Thatcher signed the Single European Act in 1986. But those who make this point need then to explain how it was that in the months leading up to Black Wednesday, the need to keep interest rates at a level to defend sterling's ERM parity resulted in unemployment touching three million and record levels of bankruptcies and home repossessions, while the months immediately afterwards, when base rates were cut by four percentage points and the pound was devalued by 15 per cent, resulted in immediate economic recovery. The 15 nations that make up the EU do not constitute the right raw material for a single currency. Germany, Austria and perhaps the Benelux countries could form what, in the jargon of economists, is known as an 'optimal currency area'. But for the EU as a whole, fundamental differences in language, geography, history, culture, labour regulations and tax systems prevent the component parts of the union achieving the sort of harmonisation envisaged from European monetary union. Parts of Europe are highly productive; others are not. As a country becomes relatively less competitive, it has a number of choices. It can put a squeeze on its economy in a bid to reduce its costs to the level of its more favoured neighbours, or it can let its currency take the strain. Under monetary union, the second option would be outlawed. Malcolm Sawyer and Phillip Arestis, two sceptical economists, wrote in the Guardian in 1996: 'The declining competitiveness which cannot be offset by devaluation will lead to declining output, income and employment. There is then a danger of a vicious circle setting in, as declining income leads to falling investment, a reduction in employment and outward labour migration.' The importance of the exchange rate for managing the economy can be fully appreciated only when the alternative courses of action for coping with a loss of competitiveness are investigated. For example, how realistic is it to expect mass migrations of workers from one part of Europe to another in search of jobs? Given linguistic and cultural differences, what chance would Italian receptionists have of finding jobs in Danish offices, or British local government officers have of working in Portuguese town halls? The increasing service-sector domination of Europe's economy means that it will be harder - not easier - for workers to become assimilated, even assuming that they are welcomed with open arms by the host populations and their political masters (which assuredly they will not be). There is yet one more problem. In America a single currency is workable not only because the US has a single language and a shared cultural identity (the famed melting pot), but because it has a system of fiscal transfers that shifts resources to poor parts of the union from rich states. But to do this adequately, the US has a federal tax base that amounts to around 25 per cent of the GDP, 10 times the current level of the EU's budget. The conclusion is that unless the EU is fully harmonised and totally economically convergent before monetary union, it will be able to accommodate the resulting variations in economic performance only by deflation, migration or a single fiscal policy. The options are unacceptable, unworkable - or both. The United Kingdom is likely to be at odds with the rest of Europe because our economy does not move in step with those of other European countries and is structurally different. An oil-price shock, for example, would have different effects in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, because the UK is a significant oil producer and our economy is more service-orientated than that of most other European countries. Increases in European interest rates would be more damaging in the UK, where households and companies tend to have variable-rate debt. Mortgage debt accounts for two-thirds of household income in the UK, compared with less than a quarter in Germany. Monetary union could actually increase the policy shocks here, rather than be a factor for stability. So what does Britain have to lose by not clambering aboard the Euro-juggernaut? There are, of course, the famed gains to be made from abolishing transaction costs, but this amounts to a tiny proportion of GDP and is in any case decreasing all the time, as businesses learn how to hedge on the currency markets and individuals make use of credit cards. Then there is the claim that the markets will force Britain to pay a premium on its interest rates for the pleasure of remaining on the outside, looking in. This was an easier argument to make before Britain left the ERM, and depends in any case on the policies followed at any one time. If, for example, the lack of European competitiveness led to a depreciation of the Euro against the dollar and the yen - a quite plausible scenario - Britain could easily enjoy lower interest rates than the rest of the continent. There is, in any case, no iron law in these matters. When the Swiss decided not to join the European Economic Area, their franc rose on the foreign exchanges. It was a similar story when Norway decided not to join the EU. Finally, there is the canard that the City of London would lose out if Britain gave monetary union the cold shoulder. Privately, nobody at the Bank of England believes this is true, for the simple reason that the City's primacy in the European time zone is based on its light regulatory regime and on its record of financial innovation. Making London part of a generalised European framework would be good news for the markets: in this case the markets of Paris and Frankfurt. The clincher for the single-currency enthusiasts is that Britain has suffered for being a 'Johnny-come-lately' in the past and should not risk bringing up the rear again. This is ludicrous. Just because Britain made the wrong decision at Messina nearly 40 years ago does not mean that it would be a mistake to stay out of a single currency in 1999. It is as if, out there on the Tarmac, is a jet destined for an unknown location. The danger of not getting on board is that all the best seats in club class will be taken and that, when Britain does decide to take the plunge, there will only be seats in steerage left. On the other hand, the plane has been on the Tarmac for some time now and, for all the attention of an army of engineers, the suspicion is that one of the engines is a bit dodgy. The question is: would you get on board? Well, would you?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1997/apr/24/past.electionspast1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1997-04-24T17:35:12Z","webTitle":"Major plea for Scots to stand by Union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/apr/24/past.electionspast1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1997/apr/24/past.electionspast1","fields":{"headline":"Major plea for Scots to stand by Union","bodyText":"John Major last night appealed to Scottish voters to stand by the Union, warning that Scotland would become weaker and poorer if Labour's plans for a devolved parliament went ahead. In a speech to party supporters in Aberdeen, he said: \"Look in my eyes and know this. I will always deal fair and true by this great nation.\" He attacked Tony Blair and the \"whiff of arrogance\" that surrounded him. In a reference to Labour's policy reversal over staging a devolution referendum, Mr Major described the shadow Scottish secretary George Robertson as \"the most humiliated man in British politics\". He warned of the \"disaster\" of a Labour government posing three great threats to Britain from the unions, a federal Europe and devolution. 'Labour would be a soft touch on all three.' The election would decide Britain's future for far longer than the next five years because of the vital constitutional issues involved. He said a devolved Scottish Parliament would \"lead speedily to friction with the Westminster Parliament and later to fracture from the Westminster Parliament\". And he asked: \"Would Scotland be weaker or stronger then? Weaker. Would Scotland attract more or less investment? Less. Would Scotland have a stronger or weaker voice in the European Union? Weaker. And so would the rest of the UK. \"I appeal to you. Don't let whatever doubts you may have had about the Conservative Party in the past weigh with you, when the future of the United Kingdom may be at stake. Think about it. Think seriously. Think again.\" Mr Major ended his two-day visit north of the border - where Tories are defending 10 seats - insisting that Labour's plans were full of holes. \"Would there be a cut in the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster? Why give the parliament the power to raise tax and frighten foreign business if you never want to use it? The hour is late. The list goes on. I'll spare you the rest.\" The real problem with the Labour leader was that in all his inexperience he might not realise that questions unanswered might eventually \"do our Union to death\". He also sought to drive home the Conservatives' apparent poll revival on the issue of Europe, claiming that Mr Blair would hold a 'Dutch auction' of British sovereignty at the forth-coming summit in Amsterdam. He caricatured his opponent's views on the forthcoming European summit as those of someone 'walking into a garage to buy a used car and (saying) \"I'll give you pounds 5,000' whatever the make and condition. \"Incredible isn't it? Can we risk such a man as our prime minister? He's given away some of Britain's best cards before the game has even begun.\" Mr Blair , the man who boasts he would \"never\" allow Britain to be isolated in Europe, Mr Blair would sit there and surrender. He would ensure our United Kingdom would be reduced to a country of regions. Our national Parliament, the buttress of our democracy, would be sidelined. Divided, separated, weakened, we would become a pawn in a federal Europe,' he said. Labour was celebrating the success of attempts to woo big business following reports that two of Scotland's largest insurance companies had given their tacit support to home rule. Mr Robertson welcomed the news that Standard Life and Scottish Widows had said they were relaxed about the prospect of Labour's plans for a Scottish Assembly. \"It's a bombshell which blows apart John Major's campaign efforts in Scotland since it shows that Scottish business is not taken in by Treasury scaremongering.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1997/may/03/election2001.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1997-05-03T02:19:48Z","webTitle":"Andrew Rawnsley - A nation reborn?

Some champagne has been spilt by the victors. Parliament Square does not, however, run red. It has been a bloodless revolution, an electoral coup executed in the solitude of the polling booth. That is the British way. Two men switch limousines and power flows from one to the other, the transition effortlessly, peaceably and almost invisibly lubricated by the Civil Service. Quiet this revolution may be but it is nevertheless emphatic. Many of those opting for change may have done so not because they thrill to New Labour but because they were sick to the gut of the Conservatives. The aggrieved and insecure middle classes, having punished the Tories, will soon put Labour on the most testing probation. The Blair Government may last 15 years or it may survive just five. Some of the allies it won in opposition and some of the promises it made from there may not last five months on the hot anvil of government. The brave new world that was born in the early hours of Friday morning will eventually end in grief. One way or another, all governments do. Yet, dilute the excitement with whatever doses of scepticism you feel appropriate and there is still no question that on Friday morning Britain woke up a different country. It may be a trick of the light, but it feels like a younger country. The first person to notice this will have been the Queen. For the first time she has a Prime Minister who was born after the beginning of her reign. When Tony Blair's party last won an election he was still the lead singer in a college rock group; when it last had a working majority he was still in short trousers; when it last had a landslide he was not even a twinkle in his father's eye. The average age of the Cabinet has dropped by about 10 years. In spirit they are 20 years fresher than the faces they replace. The dying years of the ancien Tory regime saw a weary trudge through disillusion, impoverished expectations and increasing paranoia about Britain's place in the world. Simply by being fresh to government, Labour offers at least the illusion of marking a new beginning, and is offered the opportunity to make it a reality. A knackered generation of politicians gives way to an untested generation. The twenty and thirtysomething party workers and policy wonks who celebrated the triumph at the Royal Festival Hall were inebriated with liquids more potent than alcohol: optimism and enthusiasm. Tomorrow belonged to them. To every problem they believe there is a solution - even if they haven't yet found it. The pendulum does not just swing; the torch passes from one generation to another, a fact that will be most apparent in the Prime Minister's residence itself. The sound of young children will echo around the house of power for the first time since Asquith was in power. On Thursday evening we had a Prime Minister who bought his casual wear at Dunn &amp; Co; since Friday morning we have had a Prime Minister who buys his leisure shirts from Gap. Macaroni cheese is no longer the dish of choice in Downing Street. It is more likely to be tortellini pesto. Happy Eater will receive no more free publicity as the Greasy Spoon by Appointment to the Prime Minister. When the Blairs dine out, they and their security detail are more likely to be found at Pizza Express. The majority of MPs will no longer be doing their shopping at Harrods. Saturday morning finds the typical Blairista in the aisles of Waitrose. Gone is the Prime Minister who used the honours list to remember old cricketers. In his place is a Prime Minister who prefers to spend his time with young footballers. After six and a half years under a leader whose vision was of a Britain wearing a cardigan and slumbering over a warm beer - following more than a decade under a leader whose world view was rooted in Victorian values - we now have a Prime Minister who styles himself a 'modern man'. His definition of modernity - that he grew up on the Beatles and didn't smoke marijuana - may still seem rather middle-aged to quite a chunk of the population. But to many - especially those tasting the bitter-sweet sensation of being ruled by a man younger than themselves - the country feels a little more spritely. Deprived of office, the Tories look even more aged than they did before they were ejected from it. Overnight the history-makers are ancient history. For 18 years the only politics that have really mattered have been the politics of the Conservative Party. If I asked you to name the leading Ministers of the Thatcher and Major governments, I expect you would do quite well. Now try to name their shadow counterparts. Yes, it's hard. Everything the opposition parties have done for nearly two decades has essentially been a footnote to Conservative governments. That Tory bottoms should be glued to the rear seats of limos, that Tory voices should give permanent secretaries their marching orders, had seemed to be the natural order of things. Not just to them but to us. Tory assumptions and attitudes have been implanted deep in the national mind. Their language - the language of 'market testing', 'profit centres' and 'throughputs' - has been the lingua franca of Whitehall and far beyond. Their wisdom - in which private was always to be preferred to public, the demands of the have-lots superior to the needs of the have-nots - became the received wisdom. On the long march to electability, Labour has acquiesced to many of those Tory nostrums and adopted much of their language. But Labour Ministers will bring an alternative set of values to office. At its most essential, it is the difference between Margaret Thatcher when she said that 'there was no such thing as society' and Tony Blair when he says 'we achieve more together than we do alone'. Labour in office will be governed by different priorities, prejudices and blind spots. It will have different pressure points. It will make different enemies. It will have a different circle of friends. Even before the purge of Tory placemen and women from the quangos has begun, the Establishment has been reshuffled. The dinner tables of power have been relocated from Belgravia to Islington. The Adam Smith Institute will no longer find an automatic audience for its pamphlets in the inner circles of power. The Institute for Public Policy Research will have every Minister on its mailing list. Lord Stevens is out; Lord Hollick is in. The Spectator, which has wielded an influence far in excess of its circulation over the Tory years, now speaks to and for an impotent Opposition. The New Statesman and the London Review of Books are the magazines you will be more likely to find on Ministerial coffee tables. Modesty should prevent me from saying this, but - heck, why not? - the Guardian and the Observer are in. The Telegraph titles are out. The views of the Tory press and their proprietors will still matter to those struggling for control of what remains of the Conservative Party but their editorial hotlines to Number 10 have been disconnected. The opinions of Tory backbenchers, upon whom so much airtime and print was lavished when they held a government's vulnerable bits in their fists, will matter less than a damn to the big picture. Bill Cash? Teresa Gorman? Teddy Taylor? Who? Who? Who? As we adjust our sense of news values to the reordered political landscape, the jockeying for the leadership of the Tory Party will be given its proper priority, which is in a distant second place to the sharing of the spoils within the Labour Government. Slowly but surely we will become acquainted with a whole new cast of political players, many of whom are spending this weekend still breaking it to their families that they have unexpectedly found themselves as MPs. With them will come new plots and new controversies and inevitably new disappointments and new scandals. The most influential pressures upon the Labour Government will come from the other side of the political spectrum. This is not a way of saying that the unions will be racing down Pall Mall to park their tanks on Prime Minister Blair's front lawn. If they were so minded, they would find Gordon Brown standing there with a bazooka. It is to say that ministerial doors will be closing to the Country Landowners' Association and opening to Shelter. Most of all, it is a commentary on the types of people who will have the ear of MPs and Ministers. Though there is some overlap, Labour people swim in different social pools to Tories. The influence of bankers and brokers begins to wane; that of teachers and doctors starts to wax. Some of the changes implied by that will take time to manifest themselves. Mr Blair is leery of grandiose rhetoric about a dynamic first 100 days - not least because that was how Harold Wilson used to talk, and look what happened to him. Yet the emphasis of government will change quite dramatically in three big areas. The first is education. Though the Conservatives were interested in it as a subject, their interest was only ever academic when not one Cabinet Minister sent his own children to the same schools as the majority of the population. Eton is out; church schools are in. Tony Blair will be the first Prime Minister to send his children to state schools. That is a large fact, rather larger than the precise nature of the school which they attend. I am not entirely convinced that energy and purpose, even in the abundance which he promises to apply, will be sufficient to make all the difference he pledges without additional resources. And that money is going to be very hard to find within the public-spending straitjacket which Labour has put on to prove its fiscal rectitude. But having a Prime Minister obsessed with raising standards and opportunities is the sine qua non of doing anything about them. Then there is the distribution of power within the United Kingdom - a concern to the Conservatives only once they were threatened with losing their monopoly control over it. Scotland will suddenly start throwing its political weight around, possibly so much so that England will not feel entirely comfortable. It would do so even if Labour were not committed to its ambitious programme of constitutional reform. This will be a very Scottish government. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a Scot. The Foreign Secretary is a Scot. The Lord Chancellor is a Scot. The leader's birth certificate makes him a Scot. The accent of the Cabinet has changed from Middle English to Lowland Scottish. Third, there is Europe. Here, I think, Mr Blair faces his hardest choices. Crudely summarised, at the Amsterdam Summit or if not then at some point soon afterwards he will have to choose between staying friends with Roy Jenkins and remaining pals with Rupert Murdoch. My hunch is that, buttressed by that huge majority, he will seek to educate the public mood away from Euro-paranoia and allow the natural pro-European majority in the House of Commons to start expressing itself. It is a long, long time since we had a Prime Minister who could not only speak French, but speak it with sufficient fluency not to embarrass us or himself in front of the French. Where and how it will end no one can safely predict. That a revolution has begun no one can surely doubt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1997/may/04/election2001.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1997-05-04T02:19:49Z","webTitle":"The two-year strategy should now be for ten","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/may/04/election2001.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1997/may/04/election2001.uk","fields":{"headline":"The two-year strategy should now be for ten","bodyText":"So there he is, the youngest Prime Minister in 150 years, at the apex of the biggest parliamentary majority for one party since the introduction of universal suffrage, still asking Cherie to pinch him to make sure that this is not some strange dream. How does it feel this Sunday morning to be Tony Blair? Pretty terrific, I would think. And pretty terrifying. Now comes the hard part. Opposition he could do, and has done more triumphantly than anyone anticipated. About government, this man who had not seen the inside of a red box before Friday is on a hair-raisingly steep-learning curve. As part of his preparation for the loneliest job in politics, Blair spent a lot of the leisure time he will no longer enjoy reading histories and memoirs. I wonder if he came across a reflection on the disappointments of politics by Lord Hailsham. Asked whether he regretted not occupying the top job, Hailsham replied that he did not: 'I've known every Prime Minister since Balfour, and most of them have died unhappy.' John Major, for one, and Margaret Thatcher for another, could testify to that. The cheers that greet incoming Prime Ministers are rarely as loud as the jeers that accompany their exits. How can Blair make himself an exception to this rule of failure? The first requirement is to govern competently. This may seem like an unexacting test, but it is one that most Prime Ministers fail. It will be a particularly high hurdle for such an inexperienced Government. The civil service will hold their hands, but cannot protect these tiro Ministers from Harold Macmillan's 'events', the bolts from the blue that make or break administrations, and the reputations of Prime Mininsters. Blair will lift himself above the average run of occupants of Number 10 if he can avoid an equivalent of Edward Heath's three-day week, Harold Wilson's devaluation crisis, Thatcher's poll tax or Major's ERM debacle. He will be an exceptionally lucky - or especially brilliant - Prime Minister if he can finish his reign without associating his rule with a black day. The gob-smacking scale of his parliamentary majority is both a help and a handicap in this respect. He is unlikely to have the party management problems that dogged his immediate predecessor. Major may ruefully reflect on the quirks of an electoral system which served the Conservatives so well until this election. He was given a majority of 21 in 1992 with half a million votes more than have delivered a majority of 179 to Blair. Many in this avalanche of New Labour MPs seem, on the evidence so far, to be Tone clones. A Blair Government is insulated from parliamentary revolt in the conceivable future. Its biggest headache is finding something meaningful for all those backbenchers to do. The downside is that this is fertile ground for breeding arrogance, and could encourage other forms of power play among his top colleagues. There are big and prickly egos around the Cabinet table. John Prescott, Gordon Brown and Robin Cook are not exactly soul brothers. They are not even soul distant cousins. Jealousies and rivalries at the court of King Blair will become destructive if they lead to Whitehall turf wars or worse, sapping his administration of its energy and purpose. Managing them will put a real premium on leadership. Blair has always had ambitions to transcend mere competence. He wants to lift himself into the league of Prime Ministers who make a difference that outlives them. The scale of his parliamentary majority makes what was thought to be the hardest task for a Labour Government now one of the easiest. By voting in such numbers for his party - and for the Liberal Democrats - the people have delivered a thumping mandate for constitutional reform. Without a single Scottish or Welsh MP, the Conservatives have no viable means of obstructing devolution. There will be little excuse for the Blair Government to drag its feet over decapitating the hereditaries in the Lords. An early commitment to a Freedom of Information Act will help make good his pledge to govern openly and accountably. If all that was promised has been accomplished by 2002, then he will have presided over the most radical redistribution of power within the United Kingdom since the Great Reform Act. And then the biggest test still awaits Prime Minister Blair, a test which, if passed, would lift him out of the ranks of post-war Prime Ministers into a category all by himself. During the campaign, he harvested the discontent with Britain's decline in world league tables, whether they be measures of competitiveness, compassion, investment, health or education. No Government since 1945 has arrested that relative decline. The hard truth is - as his officials are presently instructing Gordon Brown - that a Labour Government will do well just to stand still. It is here that Blair's project is most modestly and most vaguely sketched out. The economic and social agenda in his manifesto is only a programme for two years. The size of his majority should have him thinking about a strategy for 10. He has been given a huge majority to be a very special Prime Minister. Now he - and we - will see whether he has the talent, the ambition and the vision to match it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1997/may/12/indonesia.ethicalforeignpolicy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1997-05-12T02:43:25Z","webTitle":"Robin Cook's speech on the government's ethical foreign policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1997/may/12/indonesia.ethicalforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1997/may/12/indonesia.ethicalforeignpolicy","fields":{"headline":"Robin Cook's speech on the government's ethical foreign policy","bodyText":"Every modern business starts from a Mission Statement that sets clear objectives. New Labour is determined to bring a businesslike approach to Government and today, only ten days in to our term of office, I am launching a New Mission Statement for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This is an age of internationalism. The global economy is stimulating growth in trade between nations at double the rate of growth in output within their economies. The information revolution has produced satellites and fibre-optic cables that enable us to communicate with other continents as rapidly as with the next room. We are instant witness in our sitting rooms through the medium of television to human tragedy in distant lands, and are therefore obliged to accept moral responsibility for our response. Even our weather is changing as a result of changes to the rain forests in a different hemisphere. We live in a world in which nation states are interdependent. In that modern world foreign policy is not divorced from domestic policy but a central part of any political programme. In order to achieve our goals for the people of Britain we need a foreign strategy that supports the same goals. Our Mission Statement sets out four goals of foreign policy. They provide the Labour Government's contract with the British people on foreign policy. The first goal of foreign policy is security for nations. Our security will remain based on the North Atlantic Alliance. We must manage the enlargement of NATO to ensure that a wider alliance is also a stronger alliance and that the process reduces rather than increases tensions between East and West. The global reach of modern weapons creates a clear national interest in preventing proliferation and promoting international control of conventional weapons. The Labour Government will give a new momentum to arms control and disarmament. We have already made a start with our joint statement with France and Germany to work for a total ban on landmines. The prosperity of Britain is the next goal of our foreign policy. More people than ever before in Britain's long history as a trading nation depend on our exports to other countries or on investment from them into our own country. The Labour Government will make it a top priority for our network of overseas posts to promote British exports and boost British jobs. In the debate on the Queen's speech I shall be announcing a package of specific measures to inject business experience into this effort. The quality of life in Britain must also be an objective of our foreign policy. The quality of our environment in the future depends on our success in reaching international agreement on specific measures to protect the environment. The Labour Government is determined to push the environment up the international agenda. The Foreign Office will be working with the Department of the Environment to provide a lead for agreement on firm, tough targets at the forthcoming UN Conferences. Security, prosperity and quality of life are all clear national interests. Britain also has a national interest in the promotion of our values and confidence in our identity. That is why the fourth goal of our foreign policy is to secure the respect of other nations for Britain's contribution to keeping the peace of the world and promoting democracy around the world. The Labour Government does not accept that political values can be left behind when we check in our passports to travel on diplomatic business. Our foreign policy must have an ethical dimension and must support the demands of other peoples for the democratic rights on which we insist for ourselves. The Labour Government will put human rights at the heart of our foreign policy and will publish an annual report on our work in promoting human rights abroad. The next twelve months provide the greatest opportunities in a generation for Britain to take a leading part on the world stage. At next month's IGC we will work for agreement while resolutely defending British interests. In January, Britain takes over the Presidency of the European Union. Unlike the previous Conservative administration, Labour can offer a Government with a secure majority at Westminster and a strong leader in Downing Street, able to seize the opportunity to shape the direction of Europe. Our two main objectives for the British Presidency will be to remove the remaining barriers to trade within the single market and to get talks on enlargement off to a flying start. In October, Britain hosts the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Last time in New Zealand the Conservative Government was isolated over its support for the French nuclear tests. This time a Labour Government will be in the driving seat, steering towards increased global trade and investment between Commonwealth members and good government on the basis of the Harare Declaration. In April Britain will host the Europe/Asia Summit. The Labour Government will work for enhanced dialogue and specific measures of cooperation, including on trade, investment and technology transfer. This cluster of opportunities for Britain to provide leadership will make the next year a uniquely exciting and rewarding period in foreign affairs. I am determined that our response to these immediate priorities will contribute to meeting our long-term strategy. Every modern business also needs benchmarks by which to measure progress on its Mission Statement. Today, I set out the strategic aims of our foreign strategy by which we can measure its success over a full, five-year parliament. We aim: - to make the United Kingdom a leading player in Europe; - to strengthen the Commonwealth; - to secure reform for a more effective UN. Foreign relations must not be limited to contact between politicians. The Labour Government also sets as one of its benchmarks a commitment to foster a people's diplomacy to increase respect, understanding and goodwill for Britain among nations as well as governments. To achieve this aim we will draw on the British Council and the BBC World Service, and will build on the unique advantage for our country of the growing use of English as the language of international communication. Today's Mission Statement sets out new directions in foreign policy. It makes the business of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office delivery of a long-term strategy, not just managing crisis intervention. It supplies an ethical content to foreign policy and recognises that the national interest cannot be defined only by narrow realpolitik. It aims to make Britain a leading partner in a world community of nations, and reverses the Tory trend towards not so splendid isolation. We are setting a new direction for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office under the new team of Ministers with me here today. But this is not just a Mission Statement for Ministers. It is a work programme for every diplomat abroad and all staff in this building. As part of a more open, inclusive approach to management, I personally will be communicating our Mission Statement to staff. On Friday, I will meet in this room with representatives of all departments and all grades to explain our Mission Statement to them. Within the next two weeks we will be sending to each of more than two hundred foreign posts a video prepared with the help of David Puttnam in which I will speak directly to them of our new goals and our new direction. My message to all staff is that Ministers need their professionalism, expertise and dedication if we are to achieve our aims and measure up to our benchmarks. I invite them today to work together with us in a joint project to make Britain once again a force for good in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1997/jul/17/wales.devolution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1997-07-17T17:15:39Z","webTitle":"Just 24 hours of convincing to go","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/jul/17/wales.devolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1997/jul/17/wales.devolution","fields":{"headline":"Just 24 hours of convincing to go","bodyText":"It is morning in Pontypool. At 10.15, the time given by the Labour Party for the start of their campaign event, a group of elderly people have gathered outside Woolworth's, as though waiting for something that may or may not ever happen. Two minutes later it happens. The 19 bus turns up, and they clamber on arthritically. It is another half-hour before the sounds of politics can be heard in the distance, and a man in a grey suit moves quickly down the road handing out leaflets: 'Can I say hello?' he says. 'I used to be Colin in EastEnders.' Michael Cashman, whose only connection with Wales is a few weeks spent at Theatr Clwyd, has come up from London to encourage the Welsh to take control of their own affairs. He is surrounded by the traditional band of local councillors and activists. One of them is on the megaphone, addressing the new crowd that has gathered at the bus stop: 'Vote Yes on Thursday. Vote Yes for Wales .' As he drones on, an elderly passer-by comes up to me and whispers conspiratorially: 'It's only to make jobs for people like him.' All over Wales the story is the same. On a windy hillside above the Ebbw Valley, three Labour MPs are canvassing the old pit village of Trinant. There may not be a more Labour community in the kingdom, rock-solid even in the bad years, never mind in May 1997. They are welcomed with genuine warmth, even affection. Then they mention the referendum . Voters aren't sure. They think it's a waste of money. It'll do nothing for them. And, over and over again, the same phrase: 'It's jobs for the boys.' In Trinant, it feels like a byelection might feel in three years time, when people are starting to hate the Government. But people like the Government. They like used-to-be-Colin from EastEnders. It is just that vast numbers of them hate the Government's idea of a Welsh assembly. What is it with the Welsh? Everywhere else, from Chechenia to Catalonia, from Glasgow to Gaza, people seem desperate - in many places violently so - to govern themselves and stop being bossed about from afar. Wales is different. 'Shout yes in a street in Wales ,' goes a local saying that long pre-dates referendums , 'and a dozen people will shout back no.' The latest poll suggests 37 per cent will shout back yes, 29 per cent no and 34 per cent don't know. The odds are still narrowly in favour of the assembly. The Yes side - backed by the three parties, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Plaid Cymru, which hold every parliamentary seat - will have a huge organisational advantage. The No campaigners contain a pretty rum bunch of Europhobes and eccentrics, and there is still a fair chance that one of them will make a major prat of himself in the final 24 hours. But this is not going well for the Government. And everyone knows it. 'The English have raped this country,' said a man I met in Pontypool. So that's one vote for the assembly, isn't it? Certainly not. 'If you have an assembly, you've got to have resources, and we haven't got any left, except water. I wish we'd won our war with the English but we didn't' Anyone who subscribes to all that overheated guff about there being a new spirit in Britain has not been to Wales . 'The problem is confidence,' says one devolutionist. 'The Welsh haven't got it.' Some of the trouble has been Labour-made. Ron Davies, the Welsh Secretary, is nowhere near as popular as Donald Dewar in Scotland. The bullying of Labour dissidents was a whacking error. The Tory spokesman, Nigel Evans, has regularly hit the 'waste of money' button without being rebutted. Many now feel there should have been a much broader debate. But while it is easy to have an argument in Wales , it is near-impossible to hold a national debate. There is nowhere to hold it. In Scotland, more than 90 per cent of morning paper readers read Scottish papers or Scottish editions in Wales the figure is less than 10 per cent. Almost a third of television viewers don't even get Welsh TV: they get regional news from Bristol or Manchester. The road and rail systems all run east-west getting from North Wales to Cardiff is not much faster than it was a century ago. Wales is not centred on its capital, because until 40 years ago there was no capital. Indeed, the whole concept of Wales as a nation is a modern interpretation of some fairly murky history. 'There are unifying factors - language, religion, music - that separated the Welsh from the Anglo-Saxons,' says Kenneth Morgan, former vice-chancellor of the University of Wales , 'but the idea of Welsh nationhood is more a matter of legend and fable than history.' The Scottish parliament voted to merge with Westminster in 1707. Wales has not had a parliament since Owain Glyndwr's supporters met somewhere near Machynlleth in 1406. But no one even knows where they met. For most of the six centuries since then, Wales had no standing as a nation whatever. The Encyclopaedia Britannica used to say simply: ' Wales - see England'. Even the matters supposed to unite the Welsh actually divided them, and still do. Gwynfor Evans, the former Plaid Cymru leader, threatened to starve himself to death until he was given a Welsh language TV channel. He got it, and now the non-Welsh-speaking majority has the hump because they are given S4C and not Channel Four. The first specifically Welsh piece of legislation ever passed by Westminster was the Sunday Closing Act of 1881, a victory for the chapel lobby over the drinkers which caused argument until last year, when the last redoubt, on the Lleyn Peninsula, finally caved in. On radio phone-ins they keep moaning about each other: chapel against pub Welsh-speakers v English-speakers East Walians v West Walians North Walians v South Walians one valley against the next. Wales used to be united by its rugby team. Now that's no good, they seem to be united only by their sense of grievance, and their unwillingness to do anything about it. This is not my observation many Welsh people say the same. It may date back to Glyndwr's defeat it may be due to the old roles of the coal and steel industries, and the secure, if grim, jobs they provided. Choices were for other people. One Labour MP tells the story of a constituent who marched into his surgery and banged his fist on the table. 'The council are putting my family at risk,' he said fiercely. 'They haven't changed the battery on my smoke alarm.' The only logical conclusion is that if the Welsh do not want control, they should not be forced to take it. The Welsh Office dates back only to 1964. Since then it has taken over nearly all the subjects dealt with by individual Whitehall ministries: agriculture, education, environment etc. Why? Economy and efficiency would argue that these can be dealt with better by specialists. If the Welsh vote No, why not end the pretence, and integrate the place back into the old concept of 'England and Wales '? Why have a Welsh Office at all? It only needs a civil servant or two to supervise the language lessons in schools and the painting of bilingual road signs. The justification for devolution is the opinion of the Welsh themselves, and their belief in their own nationhood. Historically, there is no more reason for it than there is to disinter the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia. Politically, it might make more sense to offer an assembly to somewhere that might appreciate it - Yorkshire, maybe. Kent. Rutland. All is not lost yet. The Welsh broadcaster Patrick Hannan once said he had never met anyone who said: 'I want an assembly'. He was standing in the Gents at the Angel Hotel in Cardiff when the man at the next urinal turned to him and said: 'I do'. Eventually, Hannan worked out what he was talking about. Only another million-odd people left to be convinced. And 24 hours to do the convincing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1997/jul/25/scotland.devolution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1997-07-25T17:13:47Z","webTitle":"Scots given blueprint for self-rule","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/jul/25/scotland.devolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1997/jul/25/scotland.devolution","fields":{"headline":"Scots given blueprint for self-rule","bodyText":"The white paper on Scottish devolution published yesterday sets out in detail the proposal for a 129-member Scottish Parliament, elected by PR for a fixed four-year term. Unlike the much more limited version proposed for Wales, the Scottish parliament will have tax raising and legislative powers. The proposal will be put to the Scots in a referendum on September 11. If Scots vote Yes, a bill will follow in the autumn. Elections to the parliament are scheduled for 1999 and the parliament will become fully operational in 2000. Powers The Scottish Parliament will have responsibility for: health education and training local government, social work and housing economic development and transport law and home affairs environment agriculture, fisheries and forestry sport and the arts research and statistics. The powers and responsibilities to be retained by the Westminster Parliament will be: the constitution of the UK: foreign policy, including relations with Europe UK defence and national security stability of the UK's fiscal, economic and monetary system employment legislation social security and most aspects of transport safety and regulation. Other responsibilities to be retained by Westminster include: nuclear safety control and safety of medicines the regulatory framework for broadcasting and film classification the licensing of theatres and cinemas. There are social and moral issues too: Westminster will retain control over abortion, human fertilisation and equality legislation. Westminster The white paper stresses that creation of a Scottish Parliament is about devolution, not independence: 'Scotland will remain an integral part of the United Kingdom and the Queen will continue to be Head of State of the United Kingdom. The UK Parliament is and will remain sovereign.' There is a grey area over whether a Scottish parliament could debate and then opt for independence, though the white paper implies such a decision could only be taken by Westminster as the sovereign body. The role of the Scottish Secretary, sitting in the Cabinet, is to be retained, at least in the short-term. In cases of disagreement between Westminster and the Scottish parliament, an elaborate bureaucratic machine will be set up to adjudicate. If the issue becomes serious, it will go to Law Lords in London to act as final arbiters. Scottish MPs The white paper signals a reduction in the number of Scottish MPs: 'The distribution of seats in the House of Commons will be reviewed by the Parliamentary Boundary Commission. At present, special statutory provisions stipulate a minimum number of Scottish seats. The Government have decided that in the next review this requirement will not longer apply.' Funding The Scottish parliament will be given the power to increase or decrease the basic rate of income tax by up to 3p. Income from savings and dividends willnot be affected. Scotland will continue for the time being to receive a bloc grant that gives Scotland higher spending per head of population than the rest of the UK. Theparliament's pounds 30 million a year - about pounds 5 per head of Scottish population. Elections The Scottish parliament's 129 members will be elected by the additional membership list system, a kind of PR: 73 of the members will be directly elected on a constituency basis plus 56 additional members (seven from each of the current European Parliament constituencies) allocated to ensure the overall result more directly reflects the share of the vote. Europe Ministers from the Scottish Parliament will participate in meetings of Council of Ministers and in some cases could speak for the United Kingdom. There will be a Scottish representative office in Brussels to further Scottish interests. Site of Parliament Not yet decided. It could be Calton Hill, designated for the Scottish Parliament at the time of the last referendum , though the renovation costs are considerable. Whatever the site, it will be in Edinburgh, not Glasgow or other towns and cities with a claim. Main points: • Scottish Parliament to be set up in January 2000 in Edinburgh • Parliament will have wide legislative powers, but Westminster will retain control over areas such as foreign affairs and defence • Scottish Parliament will be able to raise income tax by up to 3p, but main funding will continue to come from bloc grant from Whitehall, which gives Scots more per head of population than English • Parliament's 129 MPs will be elected by a form of PR over fixed four- year terms • Scottish Westminster representation is almost certain to be cut from its present 72 MPs • European Union and Scottish Parliament will scrutinise EU legislation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1997/sep/01/guardianobituaries.monarchy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1997-09-01T16:09:06Z","webTitle":"Diana, Princess of Wales obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1997/sep/01/guardianobituaries.monarchy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1997/sep/01/guardianobituaries.monarchy","fields":{"headline":"Diana, Princess of Wales obituary","bodyText":"Her life, it was often said, although not so much of late, was like a fairytale. She was, it was often said, though not so much of late, a fairytale princess. And although this was one of those typically lazy Fleet Street labels, you could see the truth in it when the young Diana Spencer first emerged blushing and blinking into this lens and that lens, and all those lights and clicks and whirrs and shouts. For the young prince had been seeking a bride but, as with princes, a pure bride of noble breeding. And these were in such short supply in the kingdom that some despaired of his ever finding one. Until, suddenly, she was there. Our first proper view was the one of the nursery assistant, shyly pretty, caught in the playground, innocent of the sunlight and the lenses and clicks and whirrs and friendly shouts and guile that would make her skirt entirely diaphanous. It was a fairytale moment but a 20th century fairy tale moment, with a knowingness among the smiles. And, as we all ought to know by now, 20th century fairy tales do not end happily. No, they spin faster and faster, whirligigs powered by the pursuit of fame and profit and every last detail, a conspiracy of interests heavy with the inevitability of tragedy, large or small, but never underplayed or undersold, and always with the lights and the headlines. None other has come close to matching the life and death of Diana Spencer. And not only in its twists, turns, heroes, speculations, confirmations, villains, stark reliefs and immense, unrelenting profile in which every quality, every event was endlessly exaggerated and simplified for the century's easier digestion. Here, also, the century met the monarchy in a collision that may in time prove as fatal as the desperate event in Paris a collision between the light and the magic that royalists had long warned against but in the end proved powerless to prevent, and even helped to fix. But, despite all our cynicism and countless hindsights, it still did not seem quite like that as Lady Diana Spencer stood in the nursery playground on that day in 1980, posing for that photograph. Then, in royal terms, it seemed a happy, clever, almost perfect match. A public tiring of an endlessly energetic bachelor prince who nevertheless seemed to be achieving little, publicly or privately, was delighted with Lady Diana , as were the photographers and their editors. She was fresh, unknown, beguilingly shy, already with the appealing and trademark upward glance. And, most importantly for the photographers and their editors, and unlike many another royal or would-be royal, she was genuinely pretty and in possession of that most vital of 20th century qualities: she was very, very photogenic. Good news, then, for Fleet Street, especially at the lower end, where Rupert Murdoch and his Sun newspaper in particular were increasingly alive to the attractions for readers of royalty, of a young and fresh royalty. Buckingham Palace's more traditional concerns were equally satisfied. This might be the first English woman to marry an heir to the throne for over 300 years. But this was no common English woman. Lady Diana 's father, the eighth Earl Spencer, had been an equerry to both George VI and the Queen. Her maternal grandmother, Ruth, Lady Fermoy, was a close friend and lady in waiting to the Queen Mother. Diana was born on July 1, 1961, at Park House, on the Sandringham estate, in the same room in which her mother, Frances, had been born. In her childhood, she had played regularly with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. This was a girl who knew the form. But also a girl unaffected by the hauteur and distance that usually go with the form. Journalists who spent a lot of time in the early days of her courtship with the Prince of Wales on the doorstep of the ungrand flat she shared in Coleherne Court in Kensington were surprised to find how approachable, how friendly she was. If it is easy to see the seeds of future troubles in this now, it would have been much easier then to see other seeds in other parts of her background. But such was the enthusiasm, high and low, for Diana and such was the shortage of other supposedly suitable mothers for a future monarch that little attention was paid to a childhood that had been anything but stable or happy. She had been only six when her mother left to take up with the lively and witty Peter Shand Kydd, a businessman and something of a contrast to her father, whose friends and pursuits she found dull. By accounts, Lady Fermoy was determined that custody would remain with Diana 's father, the then Viscount Althorp, and not with her daughter, irrevocably deemed, even in the 'swinging sixties', a 'bolter'. Diana 's fall from a horse while in her mother's care formed part of the custody proceedings. She was later to recall rows and violence between her parents. When her mother left, she would later recollect, she and her young brother, Charles, now Lord Spencer, cried themselves to sleep together she could remember, she said, the crunch of the gravel under her mother's shoes as she left. Thus, classically, and beneath that appealing freshness, was to emerge the bulimia that was, by her own frank admission, to so plague her. She was sent to Riddlesworth Hall, a boarding school near Diss, Norfolk, at the age of nine. She did not shine academically, either there, or when she moved on to her mother's old school, West Heath, near Sevenoaks, although her former teachers did speak loyally of sporting prowess, particularly at swimming. She failed all her O levels, twice, leaving school at 16. She spent a brief time at the Institut Alpin Videmanette, a Swiss finishing school, before moving to the London flat, bought for her by her father. Initially, before becoming an assistant at the Young England nursery in Pimlico, she had had various temporary jobs cleaning, acting as waitress at cocktail parties and nannying. Not the form thing, either. Her elder sister, Jane, had followed a rather more conventional route by marrying Robert Fellowes, an assistant private secretary to the Queen later to become principal private secretary. Her eldest sister, Sarah, had been an earlier girlfriend of the Prince of Wales. These connections, and Lady Fermoy's close interest, combined to bring Diana to the attention of the Prince and the Palace. In the summer of 1980, one of the early royal watchers discovered her through his binoculars, poised attractively on the banks of the Dee at Balmoral, looking up admiringly at a fishing Prince of Wales. And so to the Coleherne Court doorstep, the nursery playground, and, in February, 1981, the announcement of the engagement. The couple were haltingly, stiltingly, interviewed on television, Diana doing much upward looking, displaying her engagement ring, hiding chewed nails and much else, if probably not as much as her fiance. In a segment endlessly replayed throughout the tortuous doings that were to follow, they were asked if they were in love. 'Of course,' replies Diana , in an embarrassed rush. 'Whatever love is,' replies the Prince, in an embarrassed rumination. Much has been made of the contrast, particularly in the light of the revelation that the Prince of Wales was conducting at the time, and continues to conduct, a relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, an old girl friend who had, for the usual complicated reasons, married someone else. Not so much has been made of other subsequent revelations about Diana 's worries about the match, even up to the eleventh hour, when she had to be persuaded to go ahead by her sisters, with their only half-joking warning that the souvenir teatowels were already on sale. Duty did not play its part only on the Prince's side. Even less has been made of how significant it was that an interviewer should have dared in the first place to ask the question of whether they were in love. It is hard, for example, to imagine it being asked of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten. It was also a question that prepared the way for the even more intrusive questioning of the couple years later by Jonathan Dimbleby and Martin Bashir. But the nation, buoyed up by the earlier celebration of the royal jubilee, remained in the mood for pageantry, and the wedding, on July 29, 1981, was carried off with style amid genuine public interest and happiness. Their long kiss on the balcony at Buckingham Palace was judged a great success, although observant lip readers had seen the Prince asking for permission. The differences between the couple in ages and interests did not excite much comment. Royal marriages had never dwelt overmuch on compatability. Duty remained the watchword. But so absolute a concept was becoming increasingly isolated in a Court that had taken a conscious and determined decision to modernise itself. Only by revealing more of itself, argued the modernisers, led by the Duke of Edinburgh, could the monarchy be made more easily understood, its use more easily recognised. The Victorian constitutional theorist, Walter Bagehot had warned that letting light on to the monarchy would destroy its mystique. The modernisers were more confident. But they reckoned without a society which, influenced by an ever more irreverent media, was rapidly discarding deference. More particularly, and, to the point, they neglected to note how attractive newspapers and their readers were finding royalty as soap opera. The threat was both within and without. Diana , with her beauty, her youth, her genuinely winning manner, her seeming unstuffiness, her artlessness, her clear and unforced compassion, was prime fascination. Any amount of pop psychology has been devoted to the effect of this on a young woman from an unhappy and insecure background, but, in truth, she was facing new pressures that no amount of royal training could have prepared anyone for. But, clearly, too, Diana enjoyed the attention, whether or not, as the pop psychologists argue, this was to compensate for the lack of attention she sufffered as a child. Clearly, too, what she saw as a lack of private attention from her husband contrasted cruelly with the unending public attention. Outwardly, at first, all seemed well with the royal marriage. Prince William was born in 1982 Prince Harry in 1984. A spare and heir achieved popularity across the world, a leader of fashion, a patron of charities, another week, another magazine cover, another month, another triumphant foreign tour. Later, though, the Princess was to declare that her marriage was dead in three years, effectively ending after the birth of Prince Harry. The Prince, unhappy in his marriage, took refuge in his old round of holidays and country pursuits, and in his old mistress. The Princess, as with any princess, took refuge in her children and her charities. But, this being modern times, there was also her Walkman and an extensive range of advisers and consultants, including a psychotherapist, an aromatherapist, a reflexologist and an astrologer. Rumours about the state of the marriage continued to emerge, usually in the Sunday newspapers, and usually dismissed as 'downstairs gossip'. They were further fuelled by a number of public incidents, endlessly speculated on, first starting with the Prince's early return on his own from a summer holiday in Majorca in 1986, through various foreign tours where she asked for separate rooms, turned her head away just as he was about to kiss her, and posed alone and forlorn in front of the Taj Mahal. Then, in 1992, came publication of Andrew Morton's Diana : Her True Story, much of which seemed, even given the previous years of whisper and rumour, incredible. Morton alleged that the Princess suffered from bulimia nervosa that she had thrown herself down the stairs at Sandringham while pregnant with Prince William that she had slashed at her wrists with a razor blade, a penknife and a lemon slicer, and that she had once thrown herself against a glass cabinet. It also disclosed that the Prince kept in touch with Camilla Parker Bowles even while on honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia, a disclosure allied to the one that Diana had found an inscribed gold bracelet intended as a gift from the Prince to Parker Bowles only days before the marriage. A fairy tale romance, indeed. Once again, Buckingham Palace threw doubt on the allegations. But Morton claimed that the information had all come from close friends. And three days after the first extract from the book had been published in the Sunday Times, Diana made a public and tipped-off visit to one of them, her former flatmate and bridesmaid, Carolyn Bartholomew. In its way, this use of the media to put her case was as startling as the more sensational allegations. It followed earlier private briefings by the Prince and Princess to newspapers and marked a significant step beyond any previous contact between the press and royalty but also a determination by Diana not to be crushed by the Court. The modernisers suddenly discovered that they were being rather outplayed at their own game by someone for whose intellect they had not previously shown an immense amount of respect. But the gift for public relations displayed by the incident, and particularly its timing, is one of the more compelling aspects of a much misunderstood and complex personality. Certainly, the Prince and the Palace were perpetually on the back foot thereafter, which is where, after yesterday, they will perpetually remain. In December of that year, the Prince and Princess announced their formal separation. This brought no respite from the line of allegation and disclosure, growing ever more public and ever more tawdry as the opposing sides, authorised or not, attempted to create two hard, clear, and opposing images. The Prince was portrayed as a weak, heartless, hidebound figure, bullied by his father, overwhelmed by his responsibility, dominated by his selfishness. For her part, the Princess was to be seen as neurotic, unbalanced, frivolous, flighty, in sway to fame and frocks. There was something in both characterisations. But there was rather more to the Princess. A surprisingly steely resolve, a gift for friendship, certainly but also something more elusive. That early artlessness, openness, and friendliness, that which in more formal days had been usually described as the 'common touch' had become translated into a quality of compassion, a gift of ease, and had been put to apt work, with children, with Aids victims, and in areas where, like with her recent land mines campaign, a high-profile example or a large amount of publicity could be more use than any amount of earnest cajoling and lecturing. Thus, despite the sneers, Saint Diana . But, also, uncomfortably for times where the simplicity of the message is the most prized, it went hand-in-hand, and fed off all those sessions with consultants, all those meetings with celebrities, all those frocks and smiles. It was also, sadly, inextricable from the accompanying and tawdriness of the commonplaces of a broken marriage made extraordinary by the married. In 1994, the Prince told Jonathan Dimbleby in a television interview that he had been unfaithful. In DimbL leby's biography, published the same year, the Prince conceded he had been bullied into the marriage by his father he had, he said, never loved his wife. The Princess responded by arriving for a dinner in Hyde Park on the night of the Prince's adultery confession in an outfit so black and daring as to capture a good proportion of the front pages and raise more doubts in the public mind about the tastes and good sense of its future monarch. In the same year, Diana was linked with the England rugby captain, Will Carling. They had met at one of the public gyms used by Diana , whither and whence she was to be seen most days when she was in London, and whither and whence she was, most days, photographed. It was a curious relationship, that between Diana and her photographers. She could be at turns friendly or distant. That distance was frequently misjudged, vividly this year in the case of a long-time freelance pursuer of her who found himself being attacked by a member of the public at her behest. The sneerers claimed it was all part of a need for publicity which had become unbalancing, and claimed to see much piquant irony in the affair in 1993 when the Daily Mirror published photographs of her exercising taken clandestinely by a gym owner. Similar doubts were raised in 1993, when the Princess announced that she intended to reduce her official engagements and become more of a private figure. Four months later, she was back. But, once again uncomfortably for the stereotype of a fame junkie, it was to a role, as Red Cross roving ambassador, where she would be able to point out real achievement in the face of a sceptical and lukewarm government. Her supporters claimed that the very public gym trips and the lunches were vital to maintaining some sort of normal life, and that the relationship she cultivated with the press and the paparazzi was also vital to maintaining that normality, even if it did have its explosions and inconsistencies. Whatever the faults on whichever side, it was a relationship that was eventually to kill her. Her part, in the public eye, as the innocent party in the marriage break-up was felt to be a crucial part of the Princess's popularity. When, before the separation, the 'Squidgygate' tape recording had surfaced, allegedly detailing a telephone conversation between Diana and a lover, the story was widely disbelieved as a malicious invention, much more so than the so-called 'Camillagate' tape, in which the Prince of Wales, inter alia, appeared to be favouring re-incarnation as a tampon. The most clear response to Squidgygate was that the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment began proudly, if unofficially, to refer to itself as 'Squidgy's Own'. In 1994, too, the publication of Anna Pasternak's book, Princess in Love, supposedly detailing her five-year affair with a former army officer, James Hewitt, was similarly derided. But, in another extremely shrewd piece of PR timed for its influence on the couple's possible divorce and its custody implications, Diana gave an interview the next year, 1995, to the BBC Panorama programme that held the nation gripped with its combination of intensity and artlessness assisted by an artifice that by now seemed second nature. It had a candour clearly influenced by the pyschotherapeutic treatment the Princess had been receiving. Asked by Martin Bashir 'were you unfaithful' with Hewitt, the Princess replied 'Yes'. She agreed that the Squidgygate tape was genuine, and that she had made a series of phone calls to a married friend, Oliver Hoare. The interview, which attracted 15 million viewers, was as clear an example as exists of the contrasts in the Princess's personality. For as well as these concessions, there were references to her husband's staff as 'the enemy', the questioning of his suitability to become king, and the clear declaration that she had no intention of seeking a divorce. There was the winning, telling soundbite: 'We had three of us in this marriage, it was a bit crowded. And there was the typically overblown soundbite, that she would never be Queen of the country, but she would like 'to be a Queen of people's hearts, in people's hearts'. She continued, tellingly: 'I don't think many people will want me to be Queen. Actually, when I say many people I mean the Establishment that I married into because they have decided that I'm a non-starter . . . because I do things differently, because I don't go by a rule book, because I lead from the heart, not the head. That's got me into trouble in my work, I understand that. But someone's got to go out there and love people and show it.' Any member of the Prince's party listening to it all would have concluded, as did Nicholas Soames, that Diana was in the 'advance stages of paranoia'. This, though, was a complete misjudgement of the public's mood. For it was perhaps the greatest mark of the Princess's many and curious gifts that she continued to remain personally immune from the republican mood in the country that she had done almost as much as anyone to foster. This again, in contrast, to all the other troublesome young members of the royal family, in particular the exuberant and ultimately very silly Sarah Ferguson. After the Panorama appearance, the divorce could not be long delayed and was, indeed, urged by the Queen, at last, but far too late, disturbed by all this media manipulation. In February, 1996, three years after the separation, the princess, after a a private meeting with her husband at St James's Palace, once again wrongfooted the Court by releasing a statement to PA News (the Press Association) that she had agreed to a divorce shortly after breaking the news to the Queen by telephone. Negotiations began between respective solicitors, with the Princess's lawyer, Anthony Julius, of Mishcon de Reya, himself being touched by media celebrity as discussions continued until July on the size of the settlement, access and custody, the Princess's role and future title, much royal magic being considered invested in the dignity of Her Royal Highness, the title withheld from the Duchess of Windsor at the behest of the Queen Mother. On July 12, 1996, the terms were announced: a settlement believed to be around pounds 15m ( the Princess had been reported to be asking for nearer pounds 50m), equal responsibility for the upbringing of their children, and the demotion in title to Diana , Princess of Wales. It is almost impossible to resist the temptation to see the period since then as one of acceleration towards the horror of yesterday. The Princess's behaviour, in the way it was highlighted, at least, seemed to be at once a little more erratic, and its reception a little less respectful. The narrowness of the public role she had agreed and chosen was another danger. The number of the charities she actively supported was drastically cut at the time of her divorce settlement. The controversy that had first greeted her entry into the land mine debate earlier in the year had only last week been resurrected in an interview with a French journalist in Le Monde where she was alleged to have described the Tory Government's policy on landmines as 'hopeless'. There had also been more sideswipes at the press. A feeling that Diana 's PR, formerly so successful, if famously erratic, needed more control was fuelled by the row that followed when her office denied that she had so described the Tories, thus extending and exaggerating a row which would have quietly deflated on its own. But there could be no doubt about the sincerity and the worth of her work for charity in areas normally carefully skirted by royalty and the establishment. Turning Point, the national drink, drugs, mental health and learning disabilities agency, an unfashionable charity with which she was involved for ten years, is a good example of this. But her habit of doing good by stealth, the clandestine hospital visits, the charity auction of her wardrobe: such things were treated increasingly as eccentric rather than saintly, while such events as the charity auction of her old outfits was seen, unfairly, as having more to do with her fascination with the world of Hello! magazine celebrity, a feeling strongly reinforced by one of the year's strongest images, her red-eyed appearance earlier in the summer at the funeral of Gianni Versace, con soling a weeping Elton John. And strongly reinforced, too, by the long summer of Dodi Fayed, the posing and the confrontations, the promises of a 'big surprise', retracted but soon fulfilled in the shape of the Egyptian. We will know never know whether this decline in the immunity of her public popularity was temporarary, and, indeed, whether it would have survived a lengthy liaison with Dodi Fayed, and more particularly, his controversial father, certain to become only more controversial. As Jackie Kennedy discovered, immense private wealth and privilege has a way of corroding the affection and admiration gained in the attractive exercise of public wealth and privilege. But the consolation of such a horrible, twentieth century, twisted metal, senseless kind of death, if there is any consolation, is that the reputation of Diana , Princess of Wales, as a beautiful, winning, intriguing woman unfairly treated by fate but touched with a rare compassion and influence for good will remain forever frozen in time, inviolate. Diana , Princess of Wales, Lady Diana Frances Spencer, born July 1, 1961 died August 31, 1997"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1997/sep/07/monarchy.peterbeaumont","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1997-09-07T16:05:28Z","webTitle":"'Spare the princes from Diana's fate'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1997/sep/07/monarchy.peterbeaumont","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1997/sep/07/monarchy.peterbeaumont","fields":{"headline":"'Spare the princes from Diana's fate'","bodyText":"The most terrible moment of this most terrible day was written on the faces of the two young princes. It came after Earl Spencer's electrifying tribute to his dead sister, Diana , Princess of Wales, which damned the House of Windsor for its failure to love the most 'hunted person of the modern age' and, in a single act, has changed British history. That moment came when the red-jacketed pall bearers moved to take her coffin from just below the altar in Westminster Abbey. Prince Harry's eyes followed the coffin as it was slowly moved on to the shoulders of the Welsh Guardsmen. His father, Prince Charles, faced foward, his eyes closed in prayer. And Prince William looked up with tender shyness from beneath his blond fringe - just like his mother used to do - as the cortege slowly made its way towards the Abbey's Great West Door. And then he bowed his head. The two sons said goodbye to their mother yesterday morning, and then came the minute's silence at 12.02pm. A nation froze in silence, in grief, in loss. Just minutes before, Earl Spencer had delivered an unutterably moving address which damned the press who tortured her and, obliquely but unquestionably, doomed the House of Windsor for stripping Diana of her royal title. Speaking with extraordinary intensity, staring directly at the Royal Family across Princess Diana 's coffin, he appeared to be addressing his remarks to her former in-laws. His voice was clear and his words precise until he reached the climax of his address. Then, his face reddened and his voice tightened. By the end he was close to tears. When applause for his address started, the Royal Family remained still. The Earl's tribute was a tour de force, summing up the beauty and joy his sister gave to millions across the world, but also admitting her insecurities and weaknesses. He attacked the Royal Family both for stripping her of her title and withdrawing its support from her. The passages dealing with the House of Windsor caused a stir within the congregation. Despite no longer having a royal title over the past year, he said, she did not need the trappings of royalty to win the hearts of the world. 'She needed no royal title to generate her particular brand of magic.' Addressing William and Harry directly, he said: 'And beyond that, on behalf of your mother and sisters, I pledge that we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative and loving way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition, but can sing openly as you planned. 'We fully respect the heritage into which they have both been born, and will always respect and encourage them in their royal role, but we, like you, recognise the need for them to experience as many different aspects of life as possible to arm them spiritually and emotionally for the years ahead. I know you would have expected nothing less from us.' As the force of his words came to be understood yesterday afternoon, it became apparent that the Earl had made a speech as historically important and unanswerable as Sir Geoffrey Howe's attack on Margaret Thatcher. The House of Windsor and its heir, Prince Charles, sat in stony silence as Diana 's brother articulated the public anger at their failure to love her and, even at her death, to realise how much the country loved her. The affections of the United Kingdom have clearly turned from their mother to the young princes, William and Harry, bypassing the Windsors. Whether this sea-change spells a republic in the years to come or merely the skipping of a generation, one thing is certain: the British monarchy will never be the same. The Earl's direct and righteous anger was turned against the paparazzi and the journalists who had made her life such hell. He blamed the press for hounding Diana . 'She talked endlessly of getting away from England, mainly because of the treatment that she received at the hands of the newspapers,' he said. 'Of all the ironies about Diana , perhaps the greatest was this: that a girl given the name of the ancient goddess of hunting was in the end the most hunted person of the modern age.' He promised: 'She would want us today to pledge ourselves to protecting her beloved boys, William and Harry, from a similar fate - and I do this here, Diana , on your behalf. We will not allow them to suffer the anguish that used regularly to drive you to tearful despair.' When Earl Spencer stopped speaking, the congregation sat shaking their heads at the eloquent anger of his grief. The people were, as ever this week, the first to feel, to understand what had happened. From within the Abbey it sounded like a shower of rain - a wave of applause that grew and grew. Then the congregation clapped too, even some of the journalists who had been the target of the Earl's fury. The Royal party sat in a pool of their own silence as the applause echoed around the Abbey. The other clear sign of how Diana 's death has signalled the turning of backs on tradition came as the gun carriage edged down the Mall, where a complete break with military tradition took place. A group of 500 mourners, with casual clothes and easy manners, was forming into ragged lines no sergeant major would have tolerated. Without pomp, medals, braid or bands, charity workers and their clients, artists and nurses and patients from the causes the Princess had supported were preparing to form a thoroughly modern escort for their former patron. Their modest informality and restrained grief mirrored that of the spectators. They seemed far closer to the spirit of the Princess than the expressionless guardsmen standing rigid and impersonal in their bearskins. Black and white, Christian, Muslim and Jew, the charity workers wore no uniform and had been told not to bother with a dress code. Workers from the homeless charity Centrepoint wore yellow sashes mothers bore young children a man in a wheelchair sat ready to push himself up on to his crutches. In sweatshirts, T-shirts, sunglasses, and blue velvet boots, they did not look casual but dignified and restrained. Prince William betrayed no emotion Many were terrified. 'We decided not to bring homeless people along,' said a Centrepoint worker. 'We wondered whether anybody who was vulnerable could take the pressure. I think we're going to find it hard enough ourselves.' 'I'm very scared,' said Pat Baron from Help the Aged. 'But I'm bursting with pride.' A Blimp in the crowd sized them up. 'Here comes the wheelchair brigade,' he sneered before turning to lecture his neighbours on how to spot the differences between Guards regiments. He did not seem to have grasped that, for all her Hollywood lifestyle, Diana was a fully paid-up member of the Wheelchair Brigade. It was to these people that Prince Charles brought his sons. He emerged from the back of the charity workers and his presence brought gasps and strained necks as the crowd pushed forward to see him. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and Earl Spencer, he led his children to the front of the group and several times leant down to reassure Prince Harry quietly. Prince William stood silently, hands clasped to the front, head bowed, betraying no emotion. The body of Charles's former wife moved slowly down the Mall as the princes, peers and charity workers fell in silently behind. An extraordinary mood has swept the country in the past week, forcing the monarchy to abandon its cherished, dry-as-dust protocols. The beauty, sadness, dignity and anger that found expression in the service first emerged in public view when the funeral cortege left her home at Kensington Palace for its final journey nearly three hours earlier. The crowd, 20 deep, outside Kensington Palace had been playful - exchanging jokes, bantering gently, enjoying the early morning sun. There was even good-natured grumbling that the funeral cortege was a few minutes late. And then the trot, trot, trot of the police horses and near silence. It lasted maybe five seconds, and then the coffin came into view. A little girl pointed: 'Mummy, Mummy, look, it's the box with the Princess.' Her mother was embarrassed, but those around her smiled and patted her on the head. From the front of the crowd came a shriek. It was a woman, beautifully and expensively dressed, clenching and unclenching her fists in rhythm with her wail. A few other women screamed and there were cries of 'God rest you Diana ', but in the main the cortege was greeted with silence, all the more moving because it was the silence of so many. All of this had taken less than three minutes. One moment there was funeral procession, the next it had gone. And as it disappeared the sun went in. The cortege turned into Hyde Park, embarking on the long ribbon of South Carriage Drive. The tree-shaded avenue past the Albert Hall and Albert Memorial had been lined with onlookers waiting in respectful silence since early morning. The park was the biggest open area along the route, offering a peaceful space for quiet reflection. Families sat on the grass in small groups or rested on benches overlooking the Serpentine while they waited. Children played in the sand along the horse ride. But for others, life went on, jogging, bicycling and strolling in the sun. The crowds lining the drive were strikingly silent, the peace broken only by the crackle of a police radio or the cry of a child. As the cortege approached, people leaned forward as if they wished to touch it. Some burst into tears. As the gun carriage passed, a flood of people streamed in its wake, through the broad acres of the park and along the banks of the Serpentine towards the two giant television screens set up near Park Lane. Hundreds of people sat on the grass to watch its progress on the screens. The park had been turned into a small open-air city, dotted with the small tents of those who had camped out overnight, hundreds of food tents and security staff wearing yellow-jackets every few yards. Mohamed al-Fayed appeared like a lost soul Down the Mall, the silence was punctuated only by a short snatch of 'Abide With Me' played by on bagpipes near Buckingham Palace. The piper was Billy Jenkins, 62, a former Royal Marine and police officer who runs a charity shop in Kirkby, near Liverpool. 'I had to be here. If you look at all the other people here you understand what she meant,' he said. As he played his idiosyncratic rendition, some women were crying, but the majority stood in silence. Behind the motionless crowd, five or six deep, another of equal size was walking along trying to keep up with the coffin, risking dangerous crushes. The only sounds were the thud of feet and occasional snatches of conversation. Some 20 minutes after the coffin had gone by a false rumour that Prince William had come out on to the balcony of Buckingham Palace almost set off a stampede. There were also places where the police were having difficulty controlling the crowd because of the sheer number wanting to cross the road. At 9.08 the great Abbey bell had started to ring a solemn, single muffled toll, its slow measure marking the procession's painful progress from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey. The crowd outside the Abbey fell more silent at each passing stroke, while the long crocodile of mourners passed the sunlit arch of Dean's Yard into the Abbey, and under a second crude arch of flowers and tributes. The only disturbances to break the growing mood of solemnity were ripples of applause from the crowd marking its approval of new arrivals that included a coach of Chelsea pensioners, former Prime Minister Lady Thatcher, and Richard Branson. Cheers and whistles revealed the crowd's favourites. At times it seemed more like a film premiere, with the crowds cheering a celebrity guest list that included Tom Cruise, his actress wife Nicole Kidman, wearing a black hat, Tom Hanks, Chris de Burgh, Sting, his wife Trudi Styler, Duncan Goodhew, Steven Spielberg, Luciano Pavarotti, Diana Ross, Lord Attenborough, Sir David Frost, Sir Cliff Richard and Imran Khan. Mohamed al-Fayed, whose son Dodi had brought Diana happiness and love in her last weeks before he was killed, appeared in the Abbey like a lost soul, clutching his ticket of entrance. He walked down the nave, a proud, broad-shouldered man, his face crumpled in pain. Bernadette Chirac arrived to represent France in place of her husband, President Jacques Chirac, and soon afterwards Hillary Clinton, the US representative, arrived. The body language distinguished each celebrity in its style of mourning: Branson striding and grandstanding as he waved to the crowd Esther Rantzen's walkabout to greet the crowd George Michael's loping stride. Some, like Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair, paused to examine the wall of tributes, others trotted briskly to the door. Then, as the queue of mourners shortened, the Royal Family arrived quickly, marked out by their black limousines: 10.42 Princess Michael 10.45 Prince Andrew, the Duchess of York and their children 10.50 the Queen's Daimler, flying the Royal Standard and bearing the Queen, the Queen Mother and Prince Edward. And then it came - the police mounted escort accompanying the procession - at first just visible through a screen of leaves. Then closer, and bringing with it a deeper silence from the onlookers - the black horses of the King's Troop, flanked by the Welsh Guards as sharply choreographed as a group of dancers. Then, finally draped in the Royal Standard, and bedecked with lilies, the coffin of Diana , Princess of Wales. Elton John's song: it was pure Diana As the clock struck eleven, sombre in grey suits and walking four abreast, Prince Charles, Harry and William, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, paused outside the door, Charles ramrod straight next to his youngest son Prince William, awkward, next to his grandfather. Slowly the honour party slipped the 40-stone lead-lined coffin from its carriage into their arms, rearranging the Standard as they went. Those last steps into the Abbey were painfully slow, the feet of the bearer party, in their black polished boots moving toe to toe, as if in awful slow motion. The old stones of the Abbey have seen more than their share of tragedy, but the shy agony written on the faces of the two young princes was grim beyond the saying of it. The Royal Family lined up, the loss of Diana scarred on their faces. The service, as beautiful as it was, was haunted by these images. The National Anthem, the cadenced rituals of the Church of England, the bidding, said by the Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr Wesley Carr, flowed against the tide of our misery. And then Gustav Holst's 'Jupiter', sung to the hymn 'I vow to thee my country', echoed through the Abbey casting some sense of Diana 's beauty out to the mourners. Her sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, read in a halting voice: 'If I should die and leave you here awhile, Be not like others, sore undone, who keep Long vigils by the silent dust, and weep. For my sake - turn again to life and smile . . .' Diana 's own smile flashed in the mind's eye - 'Nerving thy heart and trembling hand to do Something to comfort other hearts than thine. Complete those dear unfinished tasks of mine And I, perchance, may therein comfort you.' The poetry ebbed to a close and the Abbey rang with some of Verdi's Requiem, sung by the soprano Lynne Dawson and the BBC Singers. After the hymn 'The King of Love My Shepherd Is', the Prime Minister read I Corinthians, 13, cracking with emotion as he struggled to a close: 'And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three but the greatest of these is love.' He spoke for England, for the new England where we are not afraid to show what we feel. And then came the most daring moment of all, when Elton John sat behind his grand piano and sang 'Candle in the Wind', his old elegy to Marilyn Monroe, reworked for the death of his friend. Not tacky, not showbizzy, not out of place. It was a powerful moment. It was pure Diana , the most peculiarly appropriate and touching farewell from one friend to another. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, led the prayers: 'We pray for those most closely affected by her death: for Prince William and Prince Harry, who mourn the passing of their dearly beloved mother . . . 'We remember too her friend, Dodi Fayed and his family, Henri Paul, and all for whom today's service rekindles memories of grief untimely borne.' The rack of emotion tightened further when 'Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer' to Cwm Rhondda was sung. As the flowers hit, the driver did not flinch During the service, many of those outside the Abbey were moved to tears, listening intently in silence. But as Elton John was heard singing over loudspeakers along the route, hundreds of people, men and women, could be seen weeping. As the song finished spontaneous applause broke out all along the route from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards. During the service, Hyde Park became one of the focal points as tens of thousands watched the two screens. There was applause as the Union flag flew at half mast over Buckingham Palace. It was the biggest open-air church service for generations. The thousands stood and sat in complete silence as the solemn liturgy poured over them, some rigidly in black mourning suits, clutching flowers, others brightly dressed gazing at the ground. As the service drew to a close the hearse that was to take the Princess to Althorp Park drew out of Dean's Yard to approach the West Door, while the same bearer party of the Welsh Guards replaced the standard covered coffin in the back, as a peal of bells rang out. As the hearse left for its journey up the M1, the royal party minus the Queen and Queen Mother followed behind in five cars with three motorcycle outriders, the streets lined with more mourners. The crowd that gathered outside the central mosque in Regents Park was as ecumenical as any that Archbishop Carey could have wished for. Muslims from south Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Britain itself, but also Christians, Hindus and some very unreligious-looking north Londoners, including bizarrely a group of traffic wardens who had taken time off to watch. Shamira Nagy, 59, an Iranian Christian, had been sitting on the kerb opposite since 8am. 'What religion you are doesn't really matter in the circumstances,' she said. With her were her friends Amina Ali, a devout Muslim from Somalia, wearing full headscarf, and Jackie Fletcher 'from St Johns Wood, London'. The women rushed into the road minutes before the hearse arrived to place 36 pink roses (one for each year of Diana 's life) with candles in between. In the mosque, Muslims had been praying for Diana all morning. Mr KM Iqbal said: 'I think many Muslims would have been pleased if Diana had married Dodi Fayed. The only positive thing to have come out of this tragedy is that it has brought a greater understanding between Muslims and Christians.' The Jewish community also held a service of tribute at the Western Marble Arch Synagogue in London, addressed by Dr Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, and the Israeli ambassador. Dr Sacks said: 'The service of tribute represents an unprecedented outpouring of grief and a passionate desire on the part of the Jewish community to identify with the nation.' Many at the mosque hoped the hearse would stop outside and rumours that it would spread quickly through the crowd. But as the convoy sped past, many wept. Mrs Nagy simply repeated: 'It didn't stop, it didn't stop.' It moved on up the Finchley Road, north London, where the busy dual carriageway had been turned into a shrine. Purple ribbons bedecked the lampposts, traffic lights and railings, and tied among them were posies of sweet william, roses, carnations, lilies, and even giant sunflowers. Messages of love were attached to many. 'To Diana and family, hope you find peace in death which you were never granted in life.' Their first sight of the procession was a police motorbike in the distance, then a helicopter flew overhead. The crowds began to clap and started throwing bouquets into the road as the hearse carrying Diana 's coffin came into view. The driver did not flinch as flowers hit the windscreen. The clapping got louder, and suddenly it was all over. Penelope Buffong was stunned. 'The hearse moved so quickly. It all happened in a split second. Just like her life.' Along the M1 Thames Valley police closed the northbound entrance to Newport Pagnell after crowds packed the area in an effort to watch the hearse on its journey north. A spokeswoman said: 'Lots of people were lining the route - thousands. Crowds of people were standing four, five deep on the bridges and more people lined the banks of the route up to a half a mile either side of the bridges.' Finally, the hearse headed towards the Princess's final resting place, her island-grave, a short walk from the russet sandstone village of Great Brington in rural Northamptonshire. The lake, known as the Oval, is in the grounds of Althorp House, home of Earl Spencer. The island, within a pleasure garden - where the Princess played as a young girl - is hemmed by a collection of rare trees and will become a shrine, open to 'pilgrims' several weeks a year. The police sealed off the village from non-residential traffic until today, bringing to the villagers a relief clearly evidenced on their faces. Sorrow in Great Brington was decorously attired and silently expressed. The dying remnants of a climbing rose flopped against a graveyard wall. In dark woodland behind Earl Spencer's wall, the first autumn leaves drifted to earth. The low rolling acres around the church, partly twelfth-century, where Spencers have been buried since 1522 - and where the Princess of Wales had been expected to join them - had been put to the plough once more, browning the land. Long queues outside Harvey Nichols Down the narrow drive of Althorp House, where Diana came to live at 13, a black chain fence sags before locked entrance gates, a 60ft span of black steel tipped with gold. The only vivid splashes at the Spencer park and at Great Brington Church were Cellophane cornets of flowers deposited by streams of mourners. Anguished messages accompanied these wilting tributes, many of them grown abroad. On this crisp sunny day, most of the 150 villagers, however, were relaxed, polite, undemonstrative. To them Diana was 'the teenager who used to go to the post office on Main Street a couple of times a week', and who 'has her real roots here'. A widow shared a striking thought. 'We loved her dearly, but not in the way those who never knew here think they love her. To us, she was a real person for whom a quiet burial is entirely fitting. What's happening beyond this place is pure showbiz hysteria. Understandable, but faintly unpleasant, don't you think?' More than 1.5 million mourners had filled Hyde Park and lined the route for Diana 's last journey to Althorp Hall. Scotland Yard estimated that at least a million had gathered in central London, including those along the route from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey, and those watching the ceremony on screens in Hyde Park. Bedfordshire Police estimated that more than 8,000 people had gathered along their section of the M1. According to Northamptonshire police, up to 300,000 people had lined the roadsides between junction 15A of the M1 and the gates of Althorp House for the last stage of the journey. Elsewhere, about 1,400 had gathered outside Cardiff's Llandaff Cathedral, and 2,000 braved blustery rain at the open-air Ross Theatre in Edinburgh. Back in London, the hours dispersed and life in the capital gradually returned to normal. In Kensington Gardens, where Diana occasionally went jogging, a Lycra-clad blonde could be seen running around the park. From a distance she looked uncannily like the Princess, a likeness not lost on people lolling on the grass. 'It's unreal, isn't it,' said Sarah Fleming, an art student. 'You know it can't be her, but you have this silly feeling that it just might be.' Her friend Annie had a more prosaic explanation: 'You don't realise how much we all look like her, well those of us who are blonde. I'm not conscious of copying her but I suppose I must.' The shops were due to open at two but a few restaurants, pubs and cafes opened earlier and were soon full. Long queues formed outside Harvey Nichols, where Diana loved to shop. One, Paula Smythe, thought the most poignant part of Earl Spencer's tribute was when he pleaded that his sister not be canonised but remembered as a real person. 'That was absolutely right. She was Diana , warts and all. She wasn't Mother Teresa, she was a great woman with enormous compassion, but she wasn't a saint and she was obviously no nun. Before that meal in the Ritz last week she went shopping just like us, and she wouldn't want us to give up our little treats.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1997/sep/28/biography.charlottebronte","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1997-09-28T15:54:41Z","webTitle":"Despite a lifetime of personal tragedy, Mr Bronte remained cheerful enough to impersonate Charlotte's dog...","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1997/sep/28/biography.charlottebronte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1997/sep/28/biography.charlottebronte","fields":{"headline":"Despite a lifetime of personal tragedy, Mr Bronte remained cheerful enough to impersonate Charlotte's dog...","bodyText":"This is biography en plein air, biography with all the old coats, mufflers and fancy thrown off, stripped down to its foundations: the letters and contemporary memoirs of the Bronte family and their friends.

They have been psychoanalysed, appropriated and redefined as feminists, anorexics, victims of patriarchy and various kinds of abuse: there have also been illuminating versions of their lives, most recently Juliet Barker's own acclaimed biography, The Brontes, a work of scholarship, passion and art. But here, to coincide with the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey, Barker discards the art and gives the reader the mined ore of her profession, the gold from which formal biography is fashioned. The letters and memoirs are uninterpreted voices and they tell their own story, as distinct and present to us as if we too had joined the hermetic world of Haworth Parsonage, or strode with the family across their beloved moors. This book is alive with voices, affectionate, witty, sorrowful, fantastical, spiritual, mischievous and full of grief. Barker threads them together with an unobtrusive narrative and leaves us to meet the Brontes and those closest to them on their own terms, free to draw our own conclusions about motive and character and the mysterious source of their baroque imaginations. In this distilled form, the tragedies of their lives are brought more sharply into focus: the ravaging of family life and the truncating of literary creation through disease and death seem shockingly close. First, their mother was struck down with ovarian cancer when Anne, the youngest, was not yet two; then the deaths of the two eldest daughters from TB before they reached their teens; the same consumptive disease claimed Branwell, Emily and Anne within eight months of each other, when each had barely reached 30. And Charlotte, the sole survivor, died at 38, just as she had established her literary reputation, entering the wider world for which she had longed, and found a late-flowering happiness in her marriage and the prospect of her coming baby. In this collection Charlotte's voice is paramount, the force of her character and her gifts as a prolific and expressive letter- writer assure that place. Her long friendship with Ellen Nussey provides the central narrative of the drama of their daily life and limited social round. But it is Branwell who surprises with the vividness of his personality, so headlong and generous-hearted that his rapid decline into bitterness, alcoholism and death is mourned along with his family. 'I do not weep from a sense of bereavement,' Charlotte wrote, 'but for the wreck of talent, the ruin of promise, the untimely dreary extinction of what might have been a burning and a shining light.' And 'Papa', who had to endure the desolation of seeing his wife and all six children die before him, explained in an extraordinary letter the operation he suffered, unanaesthetised, to remove a cataract: in another, he writes to Charlotte as the amanuensis of her dog, Flossy: 'Ah! my dear Mistress, trust dogs rather than men. They are very selfish, and when they have the power, (which no wise person will readily give them) very tyrannical.' This from a father who feared his last surviving daughter might leave him to marry. Letters like these allow the reader a fleeting intimacy with another's life, another's spirit, the peculiar congregation of traits and temperament and talents which make up the individual, who necessarily shares something with the whole. Juliet Barker has laid her brilliant selection before the reader in chronological order, explaining any significant gaps in the story and introducing new friends and acquaintances. With such a wealth of material from which to choose there will be an inevitable debate about that choice; my only regret is the absence of anything much about the mother of these remarkable children. Ellen Nussey's surviving account of Charlotte reading her mother's letters for the first time could have revealed something touching about this shadowy figure, never known by her children but whose qualities of character and gifts were expressed in each one of them.

Anyone with celebrity is intruded on, dissected, written about, and treated as our own, too easily lost in the projections of others.

Mr Hague won overwhelming endorsement for his leadership and package of internal reforms - by 143,299 votes to 34,092 on a modest 45 per cent turnout - and used it to deliver a competent, confident speech which cheered a conference still shell-shocked by Labour's May 1 landslide. \"We made mistakes, not all of our policies were perfect. So we need to change our attitudes, change our organisation, change our culture. We have to listen, not lecture. We have to welcome new people and new ideas,\" Mr Hague warned before promising that \"united and reformed\" the Tories will oust New Labour. But to the dismay of shadow ministers Lord Tebbit and Alan Clark MP, Thatcherite veterans of the 1980s, made controversial interventions away from the conference centre. They were seriously at odds with the modernising message Mr Hague and his allies were promoting for the TV cameras: \"patriotism without bigotry\" in one phrase he used. Officials and senior MPs were quickly dispatched to denounce the pair as \"two Tory dinosaurs\" who were highly unrepresentative of the new Hague-ite party or the country at large. At a fringe meeting organised by the Guardian to discuss future Conservative strategy options, Mr Clark, an executive member of the backbench 1922 committee, made an unguarded comment about dealing with the IRA which coincided with the opening of all-party talks in Belfast. \"The only solution for dealing with the IRA is to kill 600 people in one night, let the UN and everyone else make a great scene, and it's over for 20 years,\" said the former defence minister. There were a few gasps in the audience but little or no sign of support. Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, went out of his way to repeat his weekend attack on multi-culturalism within hours of the party leadership presenting an articulate Asian 15-year-old to the conference as part of its drive to create a younger, more diverse image for the Tories - and double its ageing 400,000 membership. In a message he repeated for the cameras in Blackpool last night, Lord Tebbit said: \"Multi-culturalism is a divisive force. One cannot uphold two sets of ethics or be loyal to two nations, any more than a man can have two masters. \"It perpetuates ethnic divisions because nationality is in the long-term more about culture than ethnics. Youngsters of all races born here should be taught that British history is their history, or they will forever be foreigners holding British passports and this kingdom will become a Yugoslavia,\" he said. Lord Parkinson, the Tory chairman, told Mr Clark to shut up. Sir Brian Mawhinney, the shadow home secretary who is also an Ulsterman, called Mr Clark's remarks \"unhelpful\" and said they were not shared. Lord Tebbit's latest version of \"the cricket test\" was described as \"unconstructive, unhelpful and unrepresentative\" by officials. Unfortunately for Mr Hague, the \"dinosaurs\" are two of the best-known publicists in the Tory ranks. As with Labour's reconstruction in the 80s, they served as a reminder that, as Mr Hague conceded, the Tories have \"a mountain to climb.\" Most of the day had gone well for conference organisers with John Major and other former cabinet colleagues accepting some blame for defeat even as they dumped much of it on what Gillian Shephard called \"some people in the parliamentary party who let you down\" - code for splits over Europe. Mr Hague praised the achievements of the Thatcher-Major years and told the conference it must reform its structures to regain power - while \"holding fast to our principles\" - and not to be afraid either to attack or support the Government. \"People will think more of us if we are ready to say: good, that is what we would have done,\" he told them. In the day's most wounding quip, the 36-year-old leader reminded conference representatives that Harold Wilson had once owned a Labrador. \"Now for the second time we have a Labour prime minister with a faithful pet called Paddy. The Liberal Democrats may have sold out. We won't.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1997/oct/11/conservatives2003.conservatives","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1997-10-11T15:42:15Z","webTitle":"We care too, claims Hague","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/oct/11/conservatives2003.conservatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1997/oct/11/conservatives2003.conservatives","fields":{"headline":"We care too, claims Hague","bodyText":"'I said that I wanted a fresh conference. I believe that this week we have had the freshest and most constructive and exciting conference for years. The only long faces in the hall have been those of the vultures who came to pick over the carcass of the Tory party. Far from being dead, we have embarked on a process of reform and renewal that will rebuild our party, rejuvenate our membership, restore our confidence and make us fit to return to govern. As some of you may remember, I gave a speech in this very hall 20 years ago almost to the day. I told Margaret Thatcher what she had to do to be a successful prime minister. I spent three minutes telling Margaret what she needed to do. Then, to the lasting benefit of this country, she spent the next 13 years telling all of us what to do. This week we have saluted the achievements of our past and glimpsed our future. This week this party has got up off its knees. This week we've shown that we're back in business. And next May, we've got business to do. Restoring good local government across the country. Too often in the past, we gave the impression that we didn't care enough about local government. We owe it to the people who live in those areas to fight vigorous election campaigns. Labour in local government is rotten to the core. It's time for a change in Birmingham where the debt accumulated by the Labour city council exceeds that of Albania. It's time for a change in Coventry, where a children's home in the city was charged pounds 514 by the Labour council to change 17 light bulbs. Time for a change in Hackney where the legacy of Labour rule is an education system in collapse and generations of school children denied that basic schooling which ought to be their birthright. Today I'd like to tell you about an open Conservatism, that is tolerant, that believes freedom is about much more than economics, that believes freedom doesn't stop at the shop counter. I'd like to tell you about a democratic, popular Conservatism that listens, that has compassion at its core. I want to tell you about a changing Conservatism that acknowledges its mistakes. I also want to tell you about a proud Conservatism that has served this nation well and will do so again. But we won't just be a party of power: we will be a party of principle too. Listening to a Labour politician, you might well think I'm being unfair. 'A hand up, not a hand out'. 'Tough on crime.' 'Opportunity for all'. It all sounds pretty familiar. It should do. They are our words. But just because they use our language, and have swapped the donkey jacket for the Armani suit, doesn't mean they actually believe in the principles that give that language its purpose. It is their lack of principle which is the central characteristic of the new Labour government. I believe that Labour have introduced a new and deeply unattractive cynicism into British politics. A new cynicism that says it doesn't matter whether a policy is right or wrong but only whether it can be sold to the British people. I believe in enterprise. I didn't learn about enterprise from economics textbooks and the back pages of the Financial Times. I learnt about enterprise first hand, from my own family. My father ran a small business. Hague Soft Drinks. We bottled such well-known brands as Hague Cola, Hague Cherryade, Hague Orangeade and my favourite Hague Dandelion and Burdock. We were never rich. But we were comfortable. I knew from an early age what that comfort depended on: diligence, enterprise and initiative. Sound business practice, dedication, hard work and long hours. The same values that were the foundation stones of my family's business helped launch millions of similar small businesses under Conservative governments. And I believe in education. I have to believe in education. I'm only standing here today because of education. I know that good education is too important to be left to chance. I went to a good school. A comprehensive in Rotherham. I was lucky. Friends of mine whose parents were desperate to send them to the same school, but who lived in the wrong street on the wrong part of the map, were just unlucky. They were given no choice. We brought in the National Curriculum, testing, independent inspections and greater choice, all in the teeth of outright opposition from Labour. If Labour now builds on our achievements and brings forward the right policies then we will support them. This subject is too important for any politician to bear a grudge. But what have they done? They took the Assisted Places Scheme, the scheme which helps bright children from poor families to go to some of the best schools in the country and abolished it. Labour are now planning, in the face of the best independent advice, to introduce a system of student fees which will hit the poorest families hardest. Just remember that next time you see a Labour spokesman bleating on about fairness and claiming to stick up for the worst off in our society. And I believe in self-reliance. Self-reliance brings dignity and satisfaction. We all want to provide for ourselves and our families. That's not greed. It's not selfishness. It's the most ancient human instinct of all. Self-reliance does not just mean relying on oneself alone, it also means being able to rely on a family. I personally believe that it is best for children to be brought up in a traditional family. That means their mother and their father in their home. The members of this party are among the most caring and compassionate people in the land. And Conservatives know that true compassion is measured not in gestures or slogans, but in hours of personal commitment and practical action. All over the country there are voluntary groups, charities and local societies which would disappear without the work our members do. Go to your local NSPCC or Oxfam or hospital visitors, and you'll probably see most of your Conservative branch committee there. Quietly, without publicity, giving their time for free. Don't tell me the Conservative Party is not a caring party. I want everyone to understand this: compassion is not a bolt-on extra to Conservatism. It's at its very core. I believe that given the chance Britain will be the most compassionate society in the world. When Labour talk about society, they mean the state. When they talk about community, they mean politicians. When they talk about compassion, they mean a cheque drawn on someone else's account. Each one of us is proud to be Welsh, or Scottish, or Northern Irish or English. Or Yorkshire. I'm not one of those politicians who looks at the United Kingdom through a pair of binoculars from inside the M25. I don't look at the world through the wrong end of an Islington drain pipe. I know that Britain is more than the sum of its parts. I come from Yorkshire, and I love Wales but I call the United Kingdom my country. That is why I abhor the damage that this Labour Government is doing to our nation. And for what? Labour have no grand plan. No vision for our constitutional future. Just a dog's breakfast of half-baked and incoherent devices which owe everything to partisan gerrymandering and nothing to the stability and prosperity of our nation. I am proud to be British. I believe in the United Kingdom, and so do hundreds of thousands of British blacks and British Asians. I want to see men and women from our ethnic minorities playing their full part in the mainstream of our national life, accepting both their rights and responsibilities which go with that . . . I want to see black and Asian MPs sitting on the Conservative benches in the House of Commons. And I believe in a Europe of nation states . . . All Conservatives want to see a strong and prosperous Europe in which Britain plays a leading part . . . But we've got to have a flexible Europe of nation states. Europe itself is not a nation, and it should not aspire to be a nation. Remember, we believe in democracy. And a democracy that stretched from Crete to the Orkneys could not be sustained. I have to tell you, there is a limit to European integration. And I must say, in my opinion, we are near that limit now. The prospect of a single currency may present this country with one of the most momentous decisions in its history. For a lot of Conservatives, there are profound constitutional objections to a single currency. Others in our party, while not ruling out entry at some point, believe it would be a mistake for Britain to take part in such a risky economic experiment, with all its far reaching consequences at least until we've had a decent opportunity to see whether it works in practice. And that is why we say no to abolishing the pound for the foreseeable future. There will always be some differences in any serious party. We will give our backbench MPs a free vote on a single currency. But what is most important is that the British people should have a free vote and the final say in a referendum. I remember when we went into the ERM. Almost everyone supported it - the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, the Liberals, the CBI, the Fleet Street pundits. The stock market soared. We all know what happened next. And the time has come to be brutally candid about those events. Looking back, I believe that going into the ERM was a great mistake. And I'm sorry we did it. We should have the courage and the confidence to say so. It did enormous damage to the credibility of our party, and we paid the price. Black Wednesday, negative equity, sky-high interest rates: we went into something when the time was not right let's never let that happen to our country again. Let's not be caught polishing our medals from the battles we've fought and won. Just when we should be sharpening our swords for the fight that's yet to come. So don't tell me this country doesn't need a Conservative Party. Don't tell me Conservative values have no relevance for the future. Don't tell me we've got nothing to fight for. The family that works hard, saves hard, tries to be independent of the state and that believes in their country, needs a Conservative Party. We shall speak for them. We will be on their side. We leave here this week with our hopes restored, our beliefs reaffirmed, our faith renewed. We leave as a party ready to earn once more the trust of the nation we love.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1998/feb/07/bae","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1998-02-07T14:25:30Z","webTitle":"Rolls Royce in firing line on Saudi deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/feb/07/bae","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1998/feb/07/bae","fields":{"headline":"Rolls Royce in firing line on Saudi deal","bodyText":"Secret negotiations between Rolls Royce and the favourite in-laws of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia have broken down over a politically embarrassing dispute concerning millions of pounds of commission payments under the pounds 20 billion Al Yamamah defence deal. A Panamanian company controlled by members of the Al Ibrahim family yesterday reissued a writ in the High Court claiming Rolls Royce had reneged on an agreement to pay 15 per cent commission on engines for nearly 200 British Aerospace Tornado and Hawk aircraft delivered over the past 10 years. The legal move exposing enormous hidden payments comes at a time when the future of the contract - supporting 50,000 British jobs - is under threat and MPs are pressing for the details to be made more transparent. The Al Ibrahims are nine brothers their sister is the mother of the 75-year-old King Fahd's preferred son, Abdul Aziz. Through Aerospace Engineering Design Corporation of Panama , the family had expected to make up to pounds 90 million on the pounds 600 million deal but they claim Rolls Royce has only acknowledged commissions of pounds 23 million for an unspecified number of engines at a rate of 8 per cent. The company first issued its writ on December 12, causing ill-disguised panic in the boardrooms of Rolls Royce and BAe, which is the prime contractor for the deal. Successive British defence ministers have denied that commissions were paid on the government-to-government contract signed in 1985 and paid for in oil. Last month the writ was withdrawn as negotiations took place between two heavyweight London law firms, Freshfields for Rolls Royce and Davis Arnold Cooper for AEDC. Yesterday's amended writ specifically excluded the commercially sensitive price of each engine at the request of Rolls Royce . The bulk of Al Yamamah is already winding down. The final aircraft are due to be delivered by the end of this year, but important provision of ongoing ancillary services was expected. Although BAe hopes for more orders, Saudi watchers believe that the Saudi royal family, squeezed for cash because of the drop in oil prices, wants to diversify its annual Dollars 15 billion defence spending to other countries. 'There is a growing belief in Saudia Arabia that at present it makes no military, strategic, or tactical sense,' said a source with first-hand knowledge of Saudi opinion. Political pressure to address Britain's relations with Saudi Arabia is also mounting on the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. In 1994 he called for a public inquiry into Al Yamamah following allegations that Mark Thatcher had received millions in commissions. An early-day motion signed by 38 MPs, including the chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, Clive Soley, is now calling for a National Audit Office report on Al Yamamah, suppressed in 1992, to be published. Mr Cook has signally failed to include Saudi Arabia in his ethical foreign policy remarks, despite a report from the parliamentary human rights group last month which detailed allegations of abuse, including torture, in the kingdom. Since coming to power, Labour has adopted an ambiguous response in answer to MPs' questions on Al Yamamah commissions. John Spellar, the defence minister, repeated last year that the Government had not employed agents or paid commissions. He said: 'Any use of agents by companies associated with Al Yamamah is a matter for those companies, but British Aerospace has assured us that it operates in accordance with laws and regulations of Saudi Arabia.' But the Guardian has learnt that British companies seeking to do business in Saudi Arabia are advised by the Department of Trade and Industry that under a 1978 Royal Decree agents are 'not permitted in armaments contracts and related services'. Where agents are appointed - for all other public sector contracts - their fees must not exceed 5 per cent. According to a senior DTI source commissions vary between 2 per cent and 10 per cent. 'But people will get what they can,' he added. In the past two years evidence has come to light about commissions of between 15 and 26 per cent paid by a number of Al Yamamah sub-contractors, including Vosper Thorneycroft, Royal Ordnance and Thorn-EMI. Now that Rolls Royce has joined the list it is only a matter of time before BAe's own role starts tumbling out. The Al Ibrahims are part of an inner circle of princes and associates who have benefited from Al Yamamah to the tune of at least pounds 2 billion. A spokesman for Rolls Royce said yesterday: 'The writ will be defended.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1998/mar/02/uk.davidpallister","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1998-03-02T17:01:56Z","webTitle":"Aitken gets job as arms salesman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1998/mar/02/uk.davidpallister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1998/mar/02/uk.davidpallister","fields":{"headline":"Aitken gets job as arms salesman","bodyText":"Britain's largest defence contractor, GEC-Marconi, confirmed yesterday that it has hired Jonathan Aitken, the disgraced former Tory minister, to help it sell weapons to the Middle East. The company refused to expand on the terms of Mr Aitken's contract or to elaborate on which weapon systems and markets it was targeting. But it was widely assumed among defence experts that the former MP, aged 55, had been taken on for his close contacts with the Saudi royal family, which has been a source of his wealth since the late 1970s. He has had a long-standing relationship with GEC and its former managing director, Lord Weinstock, helping to secure civil engineering contracts with the usual commissions paid to senior members of the Saudi royal family. His pay is likely to be based on the success he brings GEC in the competitive Middle East defence market. Commissions of 15 per cent and more on deals worth millions of pounds are not uncommon. Mr Aitken's job will provide him with his first confirmed income since his libel case against the Guardian and Granada's World in Action collapsed spectacularly in June, after evidence was produced that he and his family and friends had lied to the court. He was then faced with a legal bill of around £2 million which has yet to be settled. Scotland Yard is shortly to present a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions on whether he should be prosecuted for perjury. Detectives have travelled to Paris and Switzerland to collect evidence about how his bill at the Paris Ritz hotel in September 1993 - the centre of the libel action - was actually paid by Prince Mohammed bin Fahd, the son of the Saudi king and Mr Aitken's benefactor for more than 20 years. Although the extent of Mr Aitken's fortune remains a mystery, it was assumed that he would have to sell his grand Westminster house. However, he and his children still live there. One of the possible items on Saudi Arabia's shopping list is the Al Hakim air-launched anti-armour missile, originally developed for the United Arab Emirates by the failed defence contractor Ferranti. Although its size and range breach the Missile Technology Control Regime - the Nato-dominated convention to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - the hugely lucrative Saudi Arabian market is invariably considered exempt from such inhibitions. Any sales from GEC to the kingdom are likely to be brought under the umbrella of the Al Yamamah defence deal for the supply of military aircraft, ships and training. First negotiated by Baroness Thatcher in 1985, this is estimated to be worth £20 billion, or £2 billion a year, to British Aerospace, which acts as the prime contractor. Successive government ministers have insisted that this is a government-to-government contract with no agents and no commissions but evidence has seeped out in recent years that Saudi princes and their associates have enriched themselves enormously in the trade. Mr Aitken is credited with helping to secure a £5 billion tranche of Al Yamamah in 1993 when as minister of defence procurement he persuaded King Fahd to buy 48 more Tornado fighter-bomber planes. His surprise appointment to that job in John Major's 1992 administration, after 18 years on the back benches, was widely believed to be because of his Saudi contacts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1998/mar/09/conservatives.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1998-03-09T18:12:24Z","webTitle":"The Monday Interview: Michael Ancram MP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1998/mar/09/conservatives.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1998/mar/09/conservatives.uk","fields":{"headline":"The Monday Interview: Michael Ancram MP","bodyText":"Michael Ancram is doing the Jimmy Young show. This, surely, is proof of how far the once arcane subject of constitutional reform has travelled. A year ago who would have expected to hear phrases such as 'authority of the House of Commons', 'an elected House of Lords' and 'recipe for gridlock' being beamed out on Radio 2? The post of constitutional affairs spokesman is one of those imaginative Tory euphemisms forced upon the party after May 1. To throw a light cloak of disguise over the total absence of Scottish and Welsh MPs, the geographically non-specific title was created. And who better to do the job than the man who will one day be the 13th Marquess of Lothian, but who now has a constituency which takes up a good chunk of Wiltshire? And a man who also did four years in the Northern Ireland Office, using his famously emollient manner and his impeccable Catholic credentials to begin the painstaking construction of something which might one day be peace. And who has served for four years as a Scottish Office minister. It had to be Michael Ancram . He is a man without enemies, although some prefer their politicians a little more salty. At a particularly fevered moment during last summer's Tory leadership contest he was even touted as a possible caretaker candidate, so universally inoffensive was he found. There are no rough edges on Ancram, either physically or politically. Well, there are a couple of blemishes. He did bring the poll tax to Scotland. (Oops). And once, a long, long time ago, he thought devolution a pretty good wheeze too. He has never, though, been an advocate of House of Lords reform. Not because he one day hopes to go there as a marquess. He doesn't. 'When I was adopted for Devizes in 1990 I made it clear that I would disclaim my title.' He loves the Commons. Friends say this is what distinguishes him from his exact contemporary, Lord Cranborne, who to the untutored eye is his political twin. Cranborne did one term in the lower chamber, and quit in disgust at the grubby trade. Now he's Tory leader in the Lords the scion of the great Cecil political dynasty is in his element, while Ancram, trained as an advocate, likes the cut and thrust of electoral politics. He may not stand on ceremony (he's actually the Earl of Ancram but he stopped using his title after his clients in court found it too confusing when the judge called him m'lord), but he is deeply conservative. 'In many ways the past and tradition is the identification of the nation . . . if you begin to undermine that, you can end up by not really understanding who you are as a people.' Although he is the one who plays jolly folk songs on his guitar at Tory party bonding sessions, he doesn't seem entirely at home in the brash world of the new managerial Conservative Party. But his approach to reform of the Lords is carefully pragmatic. So, on talks with the Government, he is cautiously welcoming. 'Constitutional reform should be based on consensus because if you can get consensus it has a much better chance of being stable thereafter.' He takes as his motto Disraeli's aphorism 'Oppose, adapt, adopt'. Years in Northern Ireland have taught him the importance of taking your people with you. 'There may be a case for reform, but we're saying you must show that reform is going to improve things.' So where could the Lords be improved? Ancram is a bit stumped by this. He is a small as well as a large C conservative. He does not really believe there is scope for improvement. The inbuilt Tory majority? Well, it defeated the last government too. And simply removing the voting rights of hereditary peers and creating a Labour majority is not a satisfactory answer. 'If the House of Lords is ultimately within the patronage of the prime minister it is most likely to reflect the views of the prime minister of the day. Even in the short term that is unhealthy.' Ancram thinks it premature to come up with a solution now. 'In very simple terms, if you are going to have a second chamber which is going to perform a useful and co-ordinated part of the constitutional whole you've got to know what the rest of the constitutional landscape is going to look like.' The weeks he has spent going through the Scottish and Welsh devolution bills line by line have confirmed his anxieties about what he feels is Labour's casual rearrangement of the way Britain is governed. It is an anxiety shared by a few ministers too. 'There is a danger of saying this is a nice thing to do on human rights, that is a nice thing to do on devolution in Scotland and Wales, and that's a nice thing for the House of Lords, but they aren't being evaluated against each other, so there's no concept of what the overall landscape is going to look like. 'Ultimately, we need to balance the various elements in a way which works, in a way which creates clear accountability between those who govern and those who are governed, which protects rights and respect for the law.' It is hard work trying to make yourself heard when you have been so comprehensively trounced after so long in office. Ancram wants a more open, serious debate about what is going on. For the past three months the bills detailing the future for Wales and Scotland - and by default for England too - have been under scrutiny with barely a soundbite out of the lot. 'The more I do this the more I am convinced that the United Kingdom is something worth preserving. Whether it's intentional or accidental, its gradual unbundling is not in the best interests of the people of the United Kingdom or any part of it.' Oh, a warning to those who might mistake Mr Ancram's amiable, consensual approach for a lack of low political cunning. In the post-Hague shake-up, he has somehow secured the old opposition leader's office for himself. This is the approximate equivalent of an Olympic gold in life skills at Westminster.

And foreign crimes","bodyText":"Last night, the Home Office published its Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Bill, which parliament has been recalled to rush through today in emergency session. At the same time, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams issued a surprise statement apparently committing the Provisional IRA to a much more definite abjuration of violence. Mr Adams said of the Omagh bombing: 'This appalling act was carried out by those opposed to the peace process. It is designed to wreck the process and everyone should work to ensure the peace process continues as is the clear wish of the people of the island. Sinn Fein has called for a complete halt to such actions and has urged all armed groups to stop immediately . . . Sinn Fein is committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means to achieve a way forward . . . We are committed to making conflict a thing of the past . . . Sinn Fein believe the violence we have seen must be for all of us now a thing of the past, over, done with, and gone.' Below, the Home Secretary explains why he believes that it is still necessary to force through the emergency Bill, with its extra powers against even non-terrorist crimes committed abroad. WHEN MPs assemble today for the recall of parliament, they will do so with a clear sense of responsibility - a responsibility to take new, tough action against terrorism following the appalling outrage of Omagh and more broadly to tackle the increasing threat from international terrorism. The Good Friday Agreement has created a new mood in Northern Ireland, witnessed by overwhelming support for the peace process. We welcome the statement made by Sinn Fein yesterday which will help to build on this process and break down barriers of mistrust. But there is a despicable readiness by small splinter groups to try to throw the peace process off course through wretched and indiscriminate violence. We will not allow them to succeed. We already have an array of legal powers to combat these terrorist activities, however we must be ready to amend those powers, where necessary, to counter any deficiencies which emerge. Our purpose this week is tight and specific: to have an immediate operational impact on terrorism now and to have a deterrent effect against terrorism in the future. These are not panic measures, but thought-through, focused and specific remedies. They are not an infringement of human rights. There are, rightly, safeguards for civil liberties. For example, wider inferences from silence may only be drawn if the accused has been permitted access to a solicitor. The draft Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Bill published yesterday provides for the opinion of a senior police officer on someone's membership of a proscribed organisation to be admissible as evidence in court. But it does not mean someone can be automatically convicted on the word of the police. It does mean such a professional judgment will be available to the courts - to be tested by the courts, considered by the courts, and accepted or rejected by the courts, and there must be corroboration of the officer's evidence, too. There are also measures in the Bill designed to deal with people who attempt to use our shores as a safe haven when they conspire to commit terrorist and other serious offences abroad. We will not let the United Kingdom be used as a base for the organisation of terrorism or other overseas crimes. Our tradition of tolerance is real, and vital to our democracy, our character and our freedom. But there will be no hiding place here for those seeking to destroy those values - here or elsewhere. And there will be safeguards - for example, the attorney-general's consent will be required to prosecute in cases relating to overseas offences. We are clear about what we are doing. The need for action is urgent. Rut we are not rushing into any of this. It is significant that today and tomorrow also the republic of Ireland is taking complementary legislative measures to our own, as well as being a graphic illustration of the importance of cross-border co-operation in tackling terrorism, wherever we find it. The recall of parliament is important in giving us the powers we need to do that. We will review those powers as part of the consultation paper on future, permanent counter-terrorism legislation which we will publish in the autumn. That is the place for looking at wide-ranging proposals - not the specifics of this week's Bill. Today's measures are tight, targeted and timely. But they are more than that: they are part of our intention to keep meeting our responsibility to the majority of people in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK who want to see peace - and to see that those who oppose it are defeated.

But when Northern Ireland's SDLP leader John Hume was trying to explain delays in counting the votes for the new assembly to an impatient television audience this summer he did so by referring to an obscure Belgian. It was certainly the first time that Victor d'Hondt has been on the BBC Nine O'Clock News. But it may not be the last: d'Hondt was the man who invented one of the most widely-used methods of counting votes, as distinct from merely voting, under proportional representation (PR) systems and there is a lot more of that to come. It is complicated but in Ireland where PR has been in operation on both sides of the Ulster border for years they understand these things. In mainland Britain we must all fasten our seat belts. Though few people seem to have grasped the revolution about to engulf our voting habits, Tony Blair's government has introduced PR voting systems into three types of election so far - and may soon try to overthrow Westminster's time-hallowed first-past-the-post method. In May 1999 members of the Welsh and Scottish assemblies will be elected by the Additional Member System (AMS) a mixture of existing constituency voting and a party list system used to top up the result. Some 56 Members of the Scottish Parliament, out of a total of 129, will come from the lists to make the outcome 'fairer.' In early 2000 two different systems will be used to elect London's mayor and assembly. Before then, next June 9, the so-called regional list will be used to elect Britain's MEPs, bringing the United Kingdom into line with PR systems used throughout the European Union 20 years after Michael Foot, then Deputy Prime Minister, half-promised the reform to David Steel's Liberal Party during the 'Lib-Lab Pact.' This week another piece of the jigsaw fell into place. Labour officials emerged from hard days' work at a Lincolnshire conference centre to announce the 'list order' for the party's candidates in the 1999 Euro-election. In effect they have picked Labour's MEPs for you. Unless next week's party conference in Blackpool refuses to ratify their choice - most unlikely - your task will simply be to tick a party box next June 9. For that is how PR list systems work in practice. Take the South-east, Britain's largest region, the only one where the Conservatives can be confident of coming top. If the Tories again poll the 1.8 million votes they got in 1997, the top five Tories on the party list go straight to Strasbourg. So do three Labour and three Lib Dem MEPs. So picking the order in which to place wannabe MEPs on the all-powerful party list decides the outcome. That is the PR model which Tony Blair's government has embraced for Europe. But there are details which are worth quibbling about. William Hague's new broom team self-consciously left the final decision - who to put in pole position at the head of the list - to rank-and-file members in a series of regional meetings this summer open to all party members (1). The South-east's was held in the cavernous 12,500-seat London Arena (it wasn't full) all day on Saturday, May 30. Another was held in Birmingham and a third in Harrogate on the same day. Contrary to expectations (and to the fury of Eurosceptics) the likes of Norman Lamont, Nick Budgen and Tony Marlow, ex-MPs with anti-Brussels credentials, didn't float to the top of any lists. Pragmatic moderates on both sides of the argument, people willing to sign the Hague-ite loyalty test and suppport party policy, won the day. For the record, the Lib Dems picked their regional list by party ballot organised within each existing Euro-constituency (made up of seven to eight Westminster ones). The results became known in June. Plaid Cymru's national council had already picked its gender-balanced team. The Scottish National Party's final 'ranking' of candidates will be made by a party conference shortly. In marked contrast, New Labour retained that power for regional panels which met at Stoke Rochford last weekend. The panels included local rank and file members - trade unionists, ethnic minorities etc - but also members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) under the watchful eye of Millbank staff who report to Labour's outgoing general secretary, the wily Tom Sawyer. True, ordinary party members got a say. Branches and constituency parties were able to nominate contenders and decide whether their local MEP deserved to join the shortlist. Regional one member one vote (OMOV) ballots were held to let members show their preference among aspiring MEPs and incumbents. But the final say has been Millbank-driven. Scotland and Wales have already seen squabbling as to who gets on the list of candidates for a ticket on the Devolution Express. However much Millbank denies influence, disappointed contenders cry foul. Of course, all parties vet all candidates nowadays, to make sure they are not illiterate, crooks or child molesters, including candidates for Westminster elections and local councils. 'If we're to avoid the chaos of the Eighties, we must have better candidates, it's as simple as that,' explains one Labour apparatchik. But in an era where the emphasis on consumer choice is matched by demand for voter choice (so focus groups and opinion polls report), the Government has opted for a Euro-model which gives party members less influence than in most EU states and ordinary voters less than in any state but France (2). But first the case for change. First past the post (FPTP) is deemed 'unfair' as well as divisive. In Wales, for instance, it gets blamed for polarising the urban-rural vote. In Scotland in May 1997 the Tories got 17.5 per cent of the general election votes but no seats. With 45.6 per cent Labour got 56 seats. Using AMS, 1997's results would give the Tories 22 MSPs, Lib Dems five (plus 11 via FPTP), the SNP 22 (plus six). On 1997's form Labour would get only seven 'additional' members, making 63 MSPs in all, just less than a 65 seat majority. That is a point worth emphasising in Tony Blair's favour: Labour is deliberately giving up its Scottish dominance in favour of eternal coalition politics. In Europe, the story is similar but also different. At Jack Straw's instigation the Government has opted for what is called the closed list system as opposed to the 'open' list, let alone AMS, the Single Transferable Vote (STV is used in Northern Ireland to weaken sectarianism) or any other exotic PR bloom (3). What are the alternatives? Several. One would allow voters two ticks of the 'open' ballot paper, one for a party, one 'preferential' vote for a favoured candidate on the list. The candidates' list would remain, names listed alphabetically, at random, or in the order chosen by the party. But an open list means the voter can have a say about the person he or she wants elected: voting (for example) Tory but also for a Euro-sceptic Tory candidate; voting Labour but also for a known supporter of (say) federalism or green taxes. The impact of 'preference' votes varies. In Denmark in the 1989 European elections seven out of 16 MEPs were elected 'out of list order' thanks to voter choice (ie not how the party machine wanted), according to new research by Ben Seyd of the Constitution Unit at University College, London's School of Public Policy (4). 'Flexible' list voting (you choose to cast your single vote for a candidate or a party) takes place in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden. The EU's big boys do things differently. 'Closed' list systems of the kind Mr Straw persuaded the Blair cabinet to back, are the norm in France, Germany, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Britain will now join them, despite protests from Charter 88, the Federal Trust, Electoral Reform Society, the Lib Dems and others. There are further wrinkles which reinforce this centralising theme. Votes will be counted in Britain using Mr d'Hondt's divisor, a mathematical formula conceived in 1882 which was the subject of much merriment when Mr Straw explained it to MPs during the European Parliamentary Elections Bill. The merit of d'Hondt, says Mr Straw (PR anoraks disagree), is that it gives a fairer average number of seats per vote per party. The demerit is that it favours larger parties over small ones, let alone over break-away factions or independents who can stand (but not win). Nothing is set in stone and Millbank says the system may be changed for future Euro-polls. But since Labour is also requiring parties to register for the first time in Britain, there is a case for requiring them to follow internal democratic procedures as well as external ones. Closed lists reinforce the case. Like it or not, we are now playing under different rules.

If no one gets 50 per cent all of the candidates, except the two who received the highest numbers of votes, are eliminated. The second preferences on the ballot papers of the eliminated candidates are examined and any that have been cast for the two remaining candidates are given to those candidates. Whoever has the most votes at the end of the process, wins. London: Assembly Additional Member System as for Scotland and Wales 14 members representing specific voting areas and 11 further London-wide members.

The United States is understood to be making behind-the-scenes overtures for the general not to be extradited to Spain to face charges of torture and genocide for fear of what might emerge about the US role in the coup that brought him to power. The Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, has made no public statement but was said to be delighted that action was being taken against Gen Pinochet. However, cabinet sources described the intervention of Peter Mandelson, who described Pinochet as a \"brutal dictator\", as unhelpful and emotional. Another dilemma for the government is Britain's relationship with Spain. Senior police officers have made it known that they are anxious that the way the extradition proceedings are handled does not damage relations with the Spanish authorities. Britain is seeking the extradition of Kenneth Noye in connection with the \"road rage\" murder of Stephen Cameron two years ago. And last night the Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, broadened his arrest warrant for the dictator to include charges of genocide, torture and terrorism involving 94 people of different nationalities. He had previously been accused of being involved in the torture and murder of 79 people. \"This widens the request for provisional, unconditional imprisonment of Augusto Pinochet Ugarte for the reasons described in this resolution,\" said the document, which was sent to British authorities. The broader warrant clarified that the victims were not only Spanish citizens but were also from Argentina, Chile, the United States and Britain. It also emerged yesterday that the issue could be taken out of government hands because Chilean exiles in Britain plan to launch their own private prosecution against Gen Pinochet today. Counsel and solicitors are already being briefed and Amnesty International said yesterday there were strong grounds for prosecution in this country under section 134 of the 1988 Criminal Justice Act. Gen Pincochet broke his silence for the first time since his arrest. In a statement through his lawyers he said that extradition proceedings would be \"resolutely opposed\". A Guardian investigation has revealed that the British authorities were aware of Gen Pinochet's visit long before it became public. The British ambassador to Chile, Gwynne Evans, had been informed in Santiago of his plans in advance. Gen Pinochet left Santiago for Britain on September 21, flying first-class and arriving in London 17 hours later. His daughter Lucia travelled later in the week, but it is thought he was accompanied on the flight by five members of the army, including a general related to Chile's military commander in chief, a major and a captain. Although the Foreign Office insists it did not approve the visit and that Gen Pinochet was not afforded special treatment when he arrived, he was given VIP status at the airport. Gen Pinochet's party was whisked to the five-star Intercontinental Hotel in Park Lane. Lucia, fearing her father was gravely ill, persuaded him to cancel several engagements. One appointment he did honour was with the journalist Jon Lee Anderson, who interviewed him for the New Yorker magazine. Mr Lee Anderson saw Pinochet on September 25, and again the following morning when Gen Pinochet expounded on his love of Britain. At all times he was flanked by the military members of his entourage. During the interview, Gen Pinochet told Mr Lee Anderson he was in London on one of his regular visits, but that he needed medical treatment and was seeing a specialist the following week. Gen Pinochet also implied that he was here on business, mentioning obliquely that he was Chile's \"armed forces purchaser\" and that he might contact Royal Ordnance, the former Ministry of Defence - and now private - arms manufacturer. \"I had the impression he was travelling incognito,\" said Mr Lee Anderson. \"His guards were dressed informally and he was being kept away from the public. I am also sure that he felt completely safe in the UK and regarded the country as a haven. If he knew about the investigation in Spain, he didn't mention it, and I have absolutely no doubt that he believed the British would protect him.\" On September 30, Gen Pinochet saw a specialist who told him he would be incapacitated unless he had an emergency operation. \"Pinochet's surgeon in Chile wouldn't operate on him because he feared he would not survive the general anaesthetic,\" said a source. \"But now Pinochet was being told that he would be incapacitated for the rest of his life unless he had an operation.\" Gen Pinochet spent the following days in the hotel before an operation at the London Clinic on October 9. Last Tuesday, Spanish judge Manuel Garcia Castellon indicated that he wished to interview Gen Pinochet in connection with the torture and disappearance of Spanish citizens in the period following the 1973 military coup led by the general. The judge, along with Baltasar Garzon, had been conducting an investigation into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina. Last Wednesday, the judges contacted the Spanish offices of Interpol in Madrid. They alerted their British counterparts, based at the headquarters of the National Criminal Intelligence Service in Vauxhall, south London, under what was understood to be a priority \"red warrant\". The request was that Gen Pinochet be located, informed of the intention to question him and prevented from leaving the country until the questions had been put. The London Interpol office contacted Scotland Yard's organised crime branch and passed on the request. Following consultations inside Scotland Yard, on Friday evening officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group contacted the Protocol Department at the Foreign Office to ask if there was any reason why Gen Pinochet could not be arrested. They were assured that there was no diplomatic hindrance. Police went to the London Clinic on Friday night where the arrest was carried out. Gen Pinochet was in a sedated condition when police entered and the events had to be explained to him later. The next stage in the legal process is for Gen Pinochet to attend an extradition hearing at Bow Street magistrates' court in central London. The Spanish authorities would then make their case for his removal. If the Spanish request for extradition is granted he would still have a right to appeal, up to the House of Lords. Following the exhaustion of the legal process, the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, could intervene. A statement issued by Michale Caplan of the legal firm Kingsley Napley yesterday said: \"General Pinochet entered the United Kingdom with the full prior knowledge of Her Majesty's Government and with the approval of the Foreign Office... Any attempt to extradite him from the UK will be resolutely opposed. Both he and his family are confident of success.\" The Chilean human rights group, Chile Democratico, indicated that they are likely to bring a private prosecution against Gen Pinochet in Britain. Co-ordinator Julia Gonzales said: \"If we allow Pinochet to go to Spain it will be very difficult to get him back here.\" A statement will be issued today. The extradition application from Spain requires delicate handling. Spain ended a 100-year-old extradition agreement with Britain for seven years in 1978 because it was felt that the British were making it too difficult to retrieve Spanish fugitives. It is understood that pressure is being put on the Government by the United States not to assist in the extradition. The US was instrumental in providing advisers to assist Gen Pinochet before and after his coup and in the subsequent \"counter-subversive\" role. There were around 400 American \"advisers\" assisting Gen Pinochet. The London Clinic would not comment on their patient yesterday but it is understood that he may have to remain in hospital for treatment for up to two weeks. Suggestions that Gen Pinochet had entered the country using a passport under a different name have not been confirmed or denied. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said it was a matter for the Foreign Office and a spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was a matter for the Home Office. Neither the Chilean embassy nor Scotland Yard was able to comment. The Spanish embassy said it was aware of the suggestion, but did not have evidence of it. Foreign Office officials insisted that the immunity question had been examined by their legal experts last week and that they had concluded that the general's diplomatic passport did not grant him protection. Despite protests in Santiago, the Chilean government has taken a non-confrontational line, saying it understands that the British decision was a legal one, rather being politically motivated. Strikingly, the Foreign Office has failed to trumpet the decision or claim it is part of Robin Cook's ethical foreign policy, apparently reflecting the nervousness of any government about creating diplomatic complications or legal precedents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1998/oct/24/hamiltonvalfayed","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1998-10-24T15:22:29Z","webTitle":"Crossing swords with Mohamed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/oct/24/hamiltonvalfayed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1998/oct/24/hamiltonvalfayed","fields":{"headline":"Crossing swords with Mohamed","bodyText":"My first thought on meeting Mohamed Fayed's security guard was to wonder where he had hidden the bug. He was wearing a T-shirt and jeans, so it seemed unlikely that he was carrying the device himself. Perhaps he had rigged up the east London hotel where he had suggested we could talk undisturbed. I did not know what to look for, so for the first few minutes of our talk I put my wariness down to paranoia, and listened to what the guard, Paul Handley-Greaves, had to say. His story was bizarre. He told me he had been dismissed from Fayed's security staff because he was having an affair with another Harrods employee, something which was expressly forbidden by Mohamed Fayed. He was now looking for similar work in the United States, but he needed money. So he had approached Vanity Fair magazine, of which I am London editor, which he knew was engaged in a bitter libel dispute with Fayed. His proposition was simple. For £5,000, he would hand over a secretly-recorded video of Fayed making love to an employee in a suite of offices at the store. He thought that we might be interested because the Vanity Fair article alleged to be libellous had, among other things, accused the owner of Harrods of routinely harassing his female staff. But when Handley-Greaves started talking sums of money with a kind of leering eagerness, I sensed we were being recorded. David Hooper, a lawyer for the magazine publishers Conde Nast, and I had been investigating Fayed's affairs for a year, and we had learned that evidence simply didn't fall into our laps like this. We had found several women who had been sexually harassed by Fayed, and other employees who had been bugged, intimidated and bullied. But it had taken considerable effort to track them down and then persuade them to give us sworn statements about their experiences. Besides, Handley-Greaves and his story didn't feel quite right, and the video seemed just too convenient. We concluded that it was almost certainly a plan to contaminate the rest of our genuine evidence and force the magazine to fold its case. Our suspicions turned out to be right. My conversation in the hotel was indeed recorded and Handley-Greaves, far from being a disgruntled ex-employee, was still very much at the heart of Fayed's operations. Within a few months, Fayed's lawyers made an unsuccessful complaint to the City police in London that we were trying to buy stolen property - which was a surreal notion, since there was never any evidence that a video had even existed. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate that we had been wise to Handley-Greaves in our first meeting, and had been intrigued by his performance. What we all grasped then was that once someone takes on the owner of Harrods, they enter a world where few things are what they seem. We never knew if the other side were listening to us, and we were constantly on our guard for traps. We were advised that Fayed's people would have copies of private telephone bills, which meant that they knew who we were talking to. In the end, we prevailed because there were so many witnesses willing to support our original allegations. The Vanity Fair case did not go to trial. We were jubilant, but we were also left with the eerie sense that we had been dealing with a foreign power: a fiefdom, which despite its real location in Knightsbridge, operated quite independently from the rest of Britain, with a security service of its own, an armed police force and a tyrant in command. Tom Bower's new and unauthorised biography of Fayed (Macmillan, £18.99) captures this sense perfectly. For the first time, Fayed's life is properly assembled. All the evasions about his past have been stripped away, his bluster and clowning laid aside, while the pompous effusions of his spokesman, the former BBC journalist Michael Cole, are forgotten. What remains is a story that began in Alexandria with the boy Mohamed selling Coca-Cola and sewing machines and ended with him in his sixties sitting on the deck of a vast yacht, one arm wrapped around the waist of an unprotesting Princess of Wales, the other indicating the doubtful opportunity presented by his son, Dodi. It is a remarkable trajectory which involved much self-invention and paranoia, double-dealing and boasting. He hired helicopters and Rolls-Royces to impress, described his father as a 'pasha', and dished out paste diamonds to his girlfriends. One of his lines was: 'I built Dubai, you know. Dubai's wealth is all due to Mohamed Fayed.' He was so preposterous and his manners so coarse that few noticed his guile and demonic drive. He snatched Harrods from the grasp of Tiny Rowland, no mean feat, considering Tiny's cunning - and deceived practically everyone who had been given the responsibility to investigate the origins of his wealth. Few bothered to question his assertions about Dubai, or to investigate his less-advertised links with the Sultan of Brunei, because they were more alarmed at the idea that Tiny Rowland would own Harrods if Fayed did not get it. So Fayed was sitting next to Carol Thatcher at a dinner, and very soon after that Norman Tebbit announced that there would be no inquiry into Fayed's acquisition of the store. 'Fayed was the victor,' writes Bower, 'he was no longer the commission agent, a middleman, a servant and a groveller to kings and sheihks. He was the principal, who had the power to say 'I don't need that person'. ' As Bower observes, the singular nature of Harrods itself is central to the Fayed story. 'No other store offered the certainty of meeting the famous,' he writes. 'The world of Harrods was not only a place of work, but also the hub of social life. Friendships and marriages were forged in the shop.' Fayed would not have comprehended this concept of his purchase. He believed that he had captured a citadel of the British establishment, and it is clear that he also saw Harrods as his personal kingdom, where the employees were his subjects. His private army of ex-SAS soldiers increased to match his status. They wore fatigues on duty at his home in Oxted, Surrey and stood to attention when he entered the room. Bower reveals that Fayed's guards were issued with Walther PPK handguns, and, in the country home there was a locker which contained pump-action shotguns, semi-automatics, revolvers and a 32mm machine gun, from the Middle East. As with senior employees at Harrods, the guards' lives were made more tolerable by handouts of £50 notes. For these, they were expected to keep their mouths shut and carry out Fayed's bizarre orders unquestioningly. On election day in 1992, Fayed told a former SAS trooper, John Evans, to shoot his ginger tomcat, on the grounds that it was dirty. (Fayed has a famous dread of germs.) Evans, a veteran of Ulster who has the Military Medal, shot the wrong cat. Bower wrote: 'Hearing the news from the housekeeper, Fayed exploded: 'Fuggin' nothing is fugging done properly'. ' Evans was then required to ambush the right cat, but the cat escaped into the house with a bleeding head. During our battle with Fayed, we gained extraordinary glimpses of his set-up at Oxted. One came from a woman named Pip Dumbill, a temporary nanny to Fayed's three children. All we knew was that she was called Pip and came from Australia or New Zealand. After five months of search and some luck, we located her in the Himalayas. A fax was posted on the outside of a hut which housed the local communications centre. Five minutes later, Pip Dumbill happened to pass the hut, saw the Vanity Fair notepaper flapping in the wind and called us. She told us how she was sitting in her room at Oxted one weekend evening when the internal phone rang. It was Fayed, suggesting that they have a drink. She agreed hesitantly and asked where she should go. He told her not to leave her room until he arrived, which he did a few minutes later, in his dressing-gown. Then he took her by the hand and led her a convoluted route through the darkened house because, as he explained, he did not want to be spotted by his security cameras. Once in his bedroom suite, he made a pass, offering her £100 to sleep with him, which she declined. Fayed's lunge for Pip Dumbill was not one-off. It was part of a pattern. He would select his target and insist that she have a medical examination, which included an Aids test. Once the woman had been cleared by a Harley Street doctor, he would make the pass. This was preceded by his original chat-up lines - 'How's your pussy?' and 'Did you have a good fug over the weekend?' Another female employee came to our notice after she had successfully sued Fayed for wrongful dismissal. Fayed had persuaded Hermina da Silva to join him in his bedroom, where he attempted to seduce her with kisses and fondles. Da Silva rejected his advances and later gave in her notice, saying that she had been forced to leave by his behaviour. It was at this stage that John Macnamara, an ex-policeman who now runs all Fayed's security operations was brought in to deal with the threat she posed. He made false allegations of theft against da Silva, as a result of which she was arrested. She was released without charge and, showing considerable courage, pursued her case, eventually receiving compensation of £12,000. We were constantly struck by the way Fayed's senior personnel appeared in some cases to be immune from the law. No charges or official investigation followed the da Silva incident, nor the discovery of crack cocaine equipment in a bag containing Salah Fayed's passport. Salah, one of Mohamed's younger brothers was travelling to Scotland with his personal assistant, a young woman named Rachel Crowe. During the journey, they left the bag in a cab. The driver handed it in to the police, who found equipment for smoking crack cocaine. When Mohamed Fayed heard about the arrest he said: 'Tell the police that the bag belonged to the girl.' His considerable influence was brought to bear on the Scottish police and the incident was hushed up. We traced Rachel Crowe to southwest London. Although she had long since left the Fayeds' employment and was now working as an air hostess, she would not speak about the incident. I remember her standing in the doorway shivering, her eyes simultaneously betraying anxiety and rapid calculation. 'Please,' she said, 'never, never contact me again. Please!' The fear that Fayed's people inspired in potential witnesses was striking. David Hooper's team never pushed them, for the memories were sometimes painful. I remember one interview with a woman whom I shall call Candida. After about 20 minutes, her considerable poise disappeared with a sudden convulsion of self-loathing. 'You have to understand,' she said. 'I simply cannot bear for people to know what happened to me. It is my lifelong shame.' We knew that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg, much of which has now been revealed by Tom Bower's inquiries. As I read his narrative and recall our evidence, I found myself amazed that Mohamed Fayed has got away with so much for so long. The harassment alone makes Bill Clinton look like a hesitant teenager. Then there are the huge surveillance operations, the racism and persecution of employees who have left Harrods. You no longer wonder why there was doubt about Fayed's application to become a British citizen. Indeed, you wonder why the man is not facing several official investigations. Part of his success has been to persuade the British that doubts about his ownership of Harrods were entirely motivated by our racism. Fayed has always depicted himself as the outsider, the simple man of honour and enterprise who had been rebuffed by the British establishment because he was an Arab. This line, repeated over the years by his spokesman Michael Cole, has served him rather well. He has been given the benefit of many doubts because he is an Arab. This ploy is richly ironic when you learn about the institutionalised racism at Harrods. There was the case of Sandra Lewis-Glass; Vanity Fair contacted her after her appearance at an industrial tribunal. Lewis-Glass was employed to handle the short-term letting of flats at Fayed's Hyde Park residence - numbers 55 and 60 Park Lane. One of her less appealing duties was to ensure that no blacks occupied the flats in 60 Park Lane, where Fayed lived. It was not easy for Lewis-Glass. Her own father is black. Eventually, she fell foul of Fayed when he began to suspect her of betraying him to Westminster City Council, which had learned that Fayed's company was reporting the lets as long leases to avoid paying higher business rates on short tenancies. Lewis-Glass was fired and on the same day was followed by an undercover surveillance team, reporting to John Macnamara. At a restaurant, the team secretly recorded her saying that she wished she had not left vital computer discs, which would prove the deception over short-term lets in her office. Within a few days, Lewis-Glass was arrested on suspicion of stealing two floppy discs worth 80p each. She was held for nearly 20 hours, before being released without charge. Fayed's ability to influence events and threaten former employees extends well beyond Harrods. As Bower remarks, Fayed could not only buy MPs, he could also, through Macnamara, launch police investigations. Occasionally, Macnamara's undercover operations reached to Europe and the Middle East, most sensationally in the case of Christoph Bettermann, a former managing director of Harrods. In 1991, Macnamara informed Fayed that Betterman, previously a marine salvage expert, had been talking to a headhunter. He knew this because he had bugged Bettermann's private line. When confronted by Fayed, Bettermann guessed what had happened and resigned, at which point Fayed threatened him: 'If you stay with me, I'll make you rich; but if you leave me, I'll destroy you.' Bettermann ignored the warning and left. Eight months later, in 1992, Bettermann was arrested in Dubai on charges of embezzling $900,000. Behind this was an outrageous letter from Fayed to the Crown Prince of Sharjah, which alleged that Bettermann had embezzled millions of dollars. There was also a tape recording made - and, it is believed, doctored - by Macnamara, which suggested that Bettermann had admitted the fraud. 'Sitting in a cage among common criminals for the first of 24 court hearings,' writes Bower, 'Bettermann was presented with the transcript of his conversation with Macnamara in Spain. Naively, he had accepted Macnamara's word that he was not being secretly recorded.' All charges were subsequently dropped in Dubai, but it was a clear lesson for anyone who worked at Harrods. If this was the way a former managing director was treated by Fayed, what would he do to a floor manager or sales assistant who crossed him? All the old spirit of Harrods had gone. Now people watched what they said on the phone and reminded themselves that every corner of the store was covered by closed-circuit TV cameras. They could not even be sure of their colleagues, for there was a network of informers reporting to Fayed's office. Bettermann returned to Britain to sue Fayed for libel contained in that letter to the Crown Prince. On the morning of the trial, Fayed's lawyers failed to turn up to contest the case. Bettermann received maximum damages and costs, but he was never compensated for the time he spent in jail, and was robbed of a much-needed public apology. It is worrying that Fayed possesses powers of intimidation and extremely troubling to know that nothing has been done to investigate links between Macnamara and certain police stations in London and the home counties. Perhaps the publication of Bower's account will prompt such an investigation. But for the moment there is an interesting lesson from the experiences of da Silva, Lewis-Glass, Jones and Bettermann about Fayed's personality. He has an elemental vindictiveness. It is the characteristic responsible for his feud against Tiny Rowland. It also inspired him to turn on the Conservative Party in the cash-for-questions and Jonathan Aitken scandals. The British public has benefited from his desire for revenge, but we should remind ourselves that Fayed was part of an extremely questionable transaction. If he had gained all that he wanted from Ian Greer, Neil Hamilton, Tim Smith and Sir Michael Grylls, then we would never have heard of those sleaze allegations. However, it is worth noting that despite revelations about Fayed's dishonesty, no serious doubt has been raised over the allegations made against Hamilton and other MPs. After investigating Fayed's life for almost a year, Bower has declared himself satisfied that Hamilton and Smith did accept cash in exchange for parliamentary questions. It is impossible to ignore the evidence in Bower's book. At the least, Fayed emerges as an extremely nasty piece of work who has traded on a caricature of victimhood, while causing misery among his employees and those he set out to woo to advance his status in Britain. Bower establishes the lies, the harassment, the bugging of phone conversations and the vilification in Fayed's Knightsbridge fiefdom. Fayed's story has not ended. The Parisian authorities have yet to report on the crash in which Diana and Dodi died. And next week Fayed is due to defend himself in a civil case brought by the widow of Tiny Rowland. Things do not look good for him. As Bower concludes: 'Like so many autocrats, Fayed has become his own worst enemy. The inevitable consequence will be the collapse of his empire.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1998/oct/24/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.terrypratchett","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1998-10-24T15:55:40Z","webTitle":"Terry Pratchett's weird world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1998/oct/24/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.terrypratchett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1998/oct/24/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.terrypratchett","fields":{"headline":"Terry Pratchett's weird world","bodyText":"Terry Pratchett has finally achieved the status of a national institution as our foremost comicnovelist. He is the literary equivalent of John Peel - similarly known as a lovely man. Modest, unpretentious, ironic, both he and Peel emanate a comfortable sort of mild subversion, like a favourite woolly jumper at a black-tie dinner. It would be worse than uncharitable to mutter, like the mother in the Louis MacNeice poem presented with her fifth baby, 'Take it away; I'm through with overproduction'. Yet, to the twisted soul of the bibliophile, it is never wholly easy to see a beloved author pass from cult status into mass cultural acceptance. Having feasted rapaciously and virtually in private, sometimes for years, on the work of writers such as Pratchett, Ruth Rendell, Don DeLillo or Alice Munro, the pleasure one feels when they are finally accorded their well-earned acclaimis always tempered by a faint sense of loss. Ungraciously, the bibliophile starts seeking another gifted unknown to collect. But then bibliophilia is a pathological condition marked by covetousness, elitism and other undesirable, seriously psychopathic traits. Carpe Jugulum is the second Discworld novel to come out this year, and the 23rd book in the best-selling series. A lengthy canon such as comprises the Discworld novels has so many loyal and indiscriminating fans that it seems almost superfluous to assess each novel separately. (Who, apart from obsessives, can differentiate between the Jeeves books?) Suffice it to say that any such cycle has its ups and downs and that the last really great Discworld novel was Hogfather. Carpe Jugulum is far less animated and memorable. For anyone who has spent the last few years in religious retreat or a chemical stupor, Pratchett's great creation is the Disc, 'world and mirror of worlds', a flat earth carried throught he endless starry reaches of space on the back of a giant turtle. Sea pours endlessly over the rim of the Disc and at its icy centre is The Hub, where the gods live in a place called Dunmanisfestin. The various continents and cities of the Disc are always more than recognisable, despite some stunning rips in the space-time continuum: Ephebe and Tsort approximate to classical Greece and Rome. Genua is strongly reminiscent of New Orleans. The small, rural kingdoms of Sto Helit, Lancre and Quirm insistently evoke the northern provinces of England. The desert kingdom of Djelibeybi is somehow overwhelmingly Egyptian, and the lost continent of Fourex brings immediately to mind Alan Coren's poignant operatic epic Oedipus Bruce. ('Queen Glenda's me mum. I've only gone and married meflaming mummy!'). The Disc is peopled by, well, people - and by witches, wizards, trolls, assassins,werewolves, elves, dwarves and every other stock character from fantasy, all of whom behave much like human beings, apart from certain species characteristics or an ability to practise magic. Many of the books are set in the Disc's capital city, famously evoked in the quotation 'A man who is tired of Ankh-Morpork is tired of ankle-deep slurry.' Unseen University with its memorable faculty of huge and hugely eccentric wizards is located here. Several more Discnovels are based in the tiny agrarian community of Lancre, far away in the chilly Ramtopmountains. This is home to three of the strongest (in every sense) Discworld characters, the witches - kindly, salacious Nanny Ogg, stately Granny Weatherwax, and the droopy, NewAge feminist Magrat Garlick. (' 'When shall we three meet again?'... 'Well, I can do nextTuesday.' '). The best-loved and most familiar characters do pop up all over the Disc in theother books. Death, in particular, appears everywhere and is a complete anthropomorphic personification, conforming exactly to expectations, apart from his horse, Binky. (He hadtried fiery steeds but they tended 'to set light to their own bedding and stand in the middle, looking embarrassed'.) Despite outward appearances these cannot really be called fantasy novels, partly because Pratchett is too intent on undermining all the conventions of the genre and partly because they mirror so effectively the current concerns of our own society. For example Men At Arms considers political correctness and equal opportunity employment, (for trolls, werewolves and so on) while Moving Pictures features the corrupt growth and widespread influence of Hollywood. Transposing such issues to another, wholly original, world is the creative equivalent of fuelling a huge blast-furnace single-handed. Although accessible to any reader, the real delight of the Disc novels is the way in which Pratchett parodies and plays with all the tropes of literature and literary theory. Guards, Guards satirises the noir-type private-eye novel, while Witches Abroad considers narrative causality in fairy-tales. Wyrd Sisters loosely utilises the plot of Macbeth, while Lords AndLadies is based, more substantially, on A Midsummer Night's Eve, detouring to attack the current tyranny of style in society by way of parallel-worlds theory. Although tightly plotted, each novel is classically baggy with content ranging through anything from myth, fable, particle physics, tourism, camel-driving and religious wars to the prevalence of shopping malls. Literary parody is rampant - a famous scene from Tom Brown's Schooldays is re-enacted in Pyramids and wisps of Great Expectations drift through Mort. Carpe Jugulum, which loosely translates as 'Go For The Throat', follows the now inimitable Discworld formula. Knowing that however stymied by CD-ROMs, modems or RAM, everyone knows exactly what to do when faced with a vampire, Pratchett proceeds tooverturn our hoary certainties. Lancre is taken over by the vulgar, upwardly-mobile vampire family of the Count de Magpyre, attended by their unfaithful retainer Igor, a man of many parts - that is, he doubles as a Frankenstein's monster. In aligning the witches to combat this new outrage, Pratchett finds Magrat, now married to King Verence, trying to combine herwitching career with motherhood, having just produced Esmerelda Margaret of Lancre.Pratchett also manages to deal with the myth of the phoenix, the nature of sin, Scottish tribal wars, the dilemmas of the contemporary Christian Church, the cliches of monster films and the increasingly complex psychology of Granny Weatherwax. Pratchett's position as a leading comic novelist now seems as permanently assured as that of P G Wodehouse. Naturally his extremely broad appeal and light contemporary touch ensure his readership but what exactly qualifies him for permanent print status? Successful serious literature deals primarily with character and personality. Changes in setting are affected by human nature and character development. (Consider, say E M Forster or Ibsen.) Comic literature, specifically modern comedy, reverses this process in that it is the setting that is of paramount importance. A situation-specific fictional world must be established, a closed system in which normal rules can be suspended and the wild rumpus begin. For comic purposes this can occur in two ways. The setting can be fantastical and the humour arise through contrast with pragmatism, contemporary attitudes and down-to-earth detail. Such is the case with the Disc, with Cold Comfort Farm, Red Dwarf, Evelyn Waugh's California mortuary in The Loved One and the ludicrously exaggerated aristocratic world of Bertie Wooster. Alternatively, the setting can be mundane - an hotel, a university, a river-trip - and the comedy ignite through the introduction of anarchic elements: thus Basil Fawlty, Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim and Three Men in a Boat, not forgetting Montmorency. So Pratchett's Discworld adheres closely to an established comic structure which allows him to comment on human society from a position of infinite flexibility. Unlike many humorists his fundamental attitude is kindly rather than misanthropic; he is quietly, unobtrusively ethical, and consistently promotes ordinary decency; he is highly amusing without resort to crude stereotyping. All this, aligned to his turbo-charged imagination and heightened awareness of literature and literacy, suggest that he will remain an enduring, endearing presence in comic literature. As Granny Weatherwax says 'Words is important'."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1998/nov/27/1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1998-11-27T17:32:14Z","webTitle":"Priests strum their way into pop culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/nov/27/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1998/nov/27/1","fields":{"headline":"Priests strum their way into pop culture","bodyText":"In Brazil religion is the new rock 'n' roll. Number one in the pop charts is a CD of a service by Father Marcelo Rossi, aged 31, a former games teacher whose good looks and stage presence have turned him into a Catholic sex symbol. Meanwhile, Father Zeca, aged 28, a guitar-strumming surfer, held a mass this month for about 15,000 people on Rio de Janeiro's chic Ipanema beach. Fathers Marcelo and Zeca reflect a phenomenon which is causing significant changes to the Church in the world's largest Catholic country. A new wave of charismatic priests is responding to the surge of Protestant evangelical churches by adopting a populist, accessible, evangelical style. Only now has the Catholic Church regained the initiative. Over two decades membership of the Protestant evangelical movement has grown from virtually nothing in Brazil to about 12 per cent of the population, and it has become an important political force. \"What we are seeing is a renewal of the Catholic Church, much-needed because of the growth in the [evangelical] movement,\" says Regina Novaes, a researcher at Rio's Higher Institute for Religious Studies. \"It is the most important time for the Church in decades. Without doubt this regrouping is avoiding a greater exodus.\" Father Marcelo brings the aura of rock star to his services in Sao Paulo, which are now held in an old factory that can hold up to 60,000 people. He keeps the sermons brief and concentrates on singing and dancing to tunes such as The Lord's Aerobics, in which he performs a choreographed routine with choristers, reminiscent of the film Sister Act. His popularity is so huge that he is Brazilian television's biggest draw, able almost to double the ratings of any programme he is on. His CD, Music To Praise The Lord, has sold almost 2 million copies in two months, making it the best-selling album of the year. In Rio, Father Zeca started the campaign Deus e Dez, which means God gets ten out of ten. At his services, he likes to yell out \"Deus e Dez, yes!\" like a footballer who has just scored a goal. Observers believe that both priests are a reaction to the growth of evangelical churches, such as the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which started in Brazil in the 1970s and now has churches in 65 countries including Britain. The Universal Church has grown especially fast in poor suburbs where former Catholics were drawn to its livelier services and its belief in a closer contact with God. The middle class has tended to shun the evangelical churches, however, partly because Universal's leader, Bishop Edir Macedo, has been at the centre of many allegations of financial corruption. In 1989 Bishop Macedo bought one of Brazil's main television stations, which brought him into public life. He now lives in Miami. His movement turned religion into a political issue. In October's election, the number of evangelical deputies in congress rose to 27. They come from several parties - mostly rightwing - although they vote together on many issues. Unlike most evangelical priests, Fathers Marcelo and Zeca are middle class and appeal to Catholics from all social groups. They are especially popular with young people. Ms Novaes believes that their style has put the Brazilian Catholic Church on a different path. \"This process of charismatisation will change the Catholic Church at all levels. Nothing will be like it was before.\" There are more than 120 million Catholics in Brazil - at least six times the number of Protestants. Ms Novaes thinks that Brazil will always be predominantly Catholic. \"Catholicism has more flexibility here than Protestantism.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1998/dec/08/pinochet.chile","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-08T15:35:22Z","webTitle":"Pinochet law lord linked to Amnesty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/dec/08/pinochet.chile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1998/dec/08/pinochet.chile","fields":{"headline":"Pinochet law lord linked to Amnesty","bodyText":"One of the law lords who ruled that General Augusto Pinochet should face trial for human rights atrocities is a director of a charity affiliated to Amnesty International, it emerged yesterday. Amnesty last night admitted that Lord Hoffman - who last week was at the centre of allegations over his wife's links with the human rights organisation - has been an unpaid director of Amnesty International Charity Ltd for seven years. Although the organisation insisted that Lord Hoffman's work with the charity was entirely unrelated to its campaign to have Pinochet extradited to Spain, the revelations could not have come at a worse time. The Home Secretary, Jack Straw, will decide by Friday whether to allow the extradition process to start or to send the former Chilean dictator home, and his deliberations are at a delicate stage. Lord Hoffman's seven year involvement with the charity was conceded by Amnesty yesterday in a letter to Kinglsey Napley, the solicitors acting for Pinochet, who had demanded from them details of his links with the organisation. Amnesty also admitted that in 1997 Lord Hoffman was involved in a Amnesty fundraising appeal for a new building for the organisation in the United Kingdom. According to Amnesty, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, who originally ruled in the High Court that Pinochet had immunity from the jurisdiction of the English courts, was also involved in this appeal. The general's lawyers are already seeking to overthrow the House of Lords ruling against Pinochet on the grounds that Lord Hoffman's wife, Gillian, is an administrative assistant with the human rights organisation in London. Submissions sent to Mr Straw claim that Lady Hoffman's position puts into question the validity of the law lords' ruling. Amnesty has been one of the most vociferous voices in the campaign to extradite the former dictator to Spain. During the House of Lords hearings, law professor Ian Brownlie made representations to the five law lords on behalf of Amnesty and other human rights organisations. He argued that Pinochet does not have immunity from prosecution. Amnesty International Charity Ltd was set up in 1986 after Amnesty tried and failed to win charitable status for its entire operation. It was established to pay for research and educational work into human rights issues and is funded by donations from individuals. Its directors - Lord Hoffman and Peter Duffy QC - and the company secretary, Stuart Whitehead, are not salaried, and meet periodically to review finances and prioritise future projects. Once a year the board has a formal meeting with executives from Amnesty International. \"Lord Hoffman has been a director of the charity for several years,\" said a source at the charity. \"The charity does not have any involvement in the human rights campaigning of Amnesty International, and has not had anything to do with the crisis over Pinochet. \"I can only assume that Lord Hoffman decided that there was no reason to declare his interest in the charity, though it is easy to see how people could draw the wrong conclusions.\" Last night a spokesman for Amnesty said: \"The involvement of senior legal figures, including Lords Hoffman and Bingham, with Amnesty International charity work is a matter of public record and we were surprised when Pinochet's solicitors wrote to us about it. \"If Pinochet's team are raising this question now, it a sign of how desperate they have become.\" The earliest the Home Secretary is expected to announce his decision is tomorrow, although it is more likely to be nearer the end of the week. On Friday, the 83-year-old former dictator is due to make his first public appearance since his arrest at a bail hearing at Bow Street magistrates court in London. Yesterday Solicitor Geoffrey Bindman, representing Amnesty International and others, wrote to Mr Straw asking for advance notice of the decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1998/dec/18/iraq1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-18T01:52:08Z","webTitle":"The plan for liberation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/dec/18/iraq1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1998/dec/18/iraq1","fields":{"headline":"The plan for liberation","bodyText":"It is now evident that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction will not be destroyed unless he and his regime are removed from power. On this essential point there is a convergence of interests between the Iraqi people and those of the international community. The people of Iraq are eager to regain their country from the totalitarian dictatorship of Saddam, and the international community is determined to eliminate Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. This convergence has been obvious for several years, yet it is only recently that policy-makers in the United States and the United Kingdom have come to recognise this fact and begun acting upon it. The US Congress took the first step when it moved decisively in October of this year to pass the Iraq Liberation Act - which has since endorsed by President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair. The Liberation Act authorises the President to provide up to $97 million in military assistance and training to the Iraqi National Congress, for the purpose of overthrowing Saddam's hated regime. This historic Act specifies that the policy of the US requires the removal of Saddam and pledges its support for a new and democratic Iraqi government. President Clinton signed this Act into law and, in co-operation with Mr Blair, has undertaken to fulfill its purpose. For the sake of the Iraqi people, the President should act quickly. The Iraqi people are elated by this new approach to Iraq and to the problem of Saddam. They recognise the Iraq Liberation Act as an historic opportunity and are ready to offer their hearts and lives to liberate their country. Yet they are haunted by the disaster of 1991, when coalition forces allowed Saddam to slaughter a lightly armed population with helicopter gunships, tanks and artillery. The Iraqi people need more than American and British legislative and rhetorical support - they really need concrete action. Specifically, the Iraqi National Congress has developed a detailed military plan endorsed by American and British military officers based on military exclusion zones, no-fly zones and the support of the Iraqi National Congress's unified Iraq Liberation Army. Protected from Saddam's heavy armament and aerial attacks, the INC would establish an alternative Iraqi administration in the liberated areas, leading to the formation of a new and representative provisional government. Under such a plan, the Iraqi people would be allowed to free themselves, establish new administrative, technical and humanitarian institutions and rejoin the international community. The international community would also benefit. The Iraqi National Congress is committed to a new Iraq, free of the weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi people have been the first victims of Saddam's nuclear, chemical and biological horrors. Unscom, the IAEA and other international monitoring organisations would be free to help the INC destroy Saddam's weapons and guarantee that the new Iraq would maintain only a conventional and defensive military. Bombing alone will never accomplish this essential goal. Saddam and his gang of thugs are the problem; they cannot be part of the solution. Whatever the provocation leading to the current attack, such military action must be supported by a political plan. Iraq is a country of essential strategic importance - for it has the largest oil reserves in the world, a critical geographic position and a talented and industrious population. Such resources must be harnessed for the good of the Iraqi people, the region and the world. The Iraq Liberation Act shows the way forward. Declare that Saddam does not represent the Iraqi people; move to indict Saddam and his henchmen for their crimes against humanity and establish an effective mechanism that will lead to the creation of a new Iraq, at peace with its people and its neighbours. Such actions require international support. No people under such a brutal dictatorship can free themselves without the aid of outside assistance. The Iraqi National Congress represents the united opposition to Saddam and his regime; America and the United Kingdom represent the international community's democratic conscience. Together, they can remove the scourge of Saddam and help establish an Iraq, a region and a world safer and less evil than today. The time is now; the Iraqi National Congress is ready. May every bomb that falls fall for the freedom of the Iraqi people.

For several years, the veteran Labour peer and Methodist preacher, who was famous for his open-air preaching at Tower Hill and later at Hyde Park's Speaker's Corner until well into his nineties, had been confined to a wheelchair.However, friends and colleagues said his ill health did not dim his vitality. Yesterday morning he returned home from hospital where he had been treated for a serious chest infection, sat down in his favourite chair and died peacefully. Lord Soper's death ends a remarkable life which has encompassed many of the most dramatic and morally complex events of the 20th century, to which he brought a voice of compelling Biblical authority and Christian conviction as a pacifist, socialist and animal rights activist. Tributes from many politicians, particularly on the left, claimed the Labour peer as an inspirational figure. Tony Benn MP said: \"He was a prophetic voice and a profound influence. His convictions came from his heart and from his beliefs which he applied in every situation. He rang true and that was the source of the power he had as a speaker.\" Nigel Collinson, secretary of the Methodist Conference, described Lord Soper as one of the best known ministers of his generation. \"He will be best remembered for his pacifism,\" he said, \"and how he believed life on earth had to be imbued with the values of the Kingdom of Heaven. To him, there was no dichotomy between the two. The way we live now could reflect the teaching of God.\" Lord Soper dedicated his legendary preaching career, which lasted for more than 65 years, to controversial causes such as the fight against gambling and drink, as well as against capitalism, slave labour, racial inequality, homelessness and capital punishment. The sermons, delivered every Wednesday come rain or shine, first at London's Tower Hill and then every Sunday afternoon at Speakers' Corner, established his reputation for powerful and tough rhetoric. His motto, \"Hit 'em as hard as you can as long as it's above the belt\", conveys both his pugilistic attitude to debate and his sense of decency and fair play. In 1965, he was made a peer for his work among the poor and homeless. A one-time chairman of Shelter, and president of the Methodist Conference, his public life continued into his nineties when, as president of the League Against Cruel Sports, he campaigned for the National Trust to ban foxhunting on its land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1998/dec/24/audreygillan","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-24T00:01:54Z","webTitle":"Pinochet 'cannot go to church'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/dec/24/audreygillan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1998/dec/24/audreygillan","fields":{"headline":"Pinochet 'cannot go to church'","bodyText":"General Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, will not be allowed to leave his home to attend midnight mass tonight because of security fears. Instead, the church must go to him. Bow Street magistrates court in London yesterday decided that the 83-year-old general must abide by bail conditions which confine him to the home he rents on Surrey's exclusive Wentworth estate, granting an amendment that he can leave in the event of a medical or dental emergency. Under the bail terms Pinochet is not allowed to leave the house or walk in the garden. Last night, the Catholic church became embroiled in the row over the former dictator's detention in the United Kingdom, when the Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, the Right Reverend Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, whose diocese includes Wentworth, said: \"There is an expectation that all Catholics will make every effort to attend Mass on Sundays and special feast days such as Christmas. \"I regret that General Pinochet may be unable to fulfil his obligation this Christmas time. \"His present condition should not prevent him from doing so, and it stops him from joining other Christians in their celebration.\" Pinochet, who is fighting moves to extradite him to Spain to face charges of human rights atrocities, will be joined by some of his family - including children and grandchildren who have flown from Chile to spend Christmas with the ageing general. Pinochet's solicitor, Michael Caplan, told the court that his client, a devout Catholic, would be seen by a priest for Christmas Eve mass. The chief metropolitan stipendiary magistrate, Graham Parkinson, had said that it would be better for a private religious service to be held. \"I would not have agreed to him going to church. It has got to come to him,\" he said. Earlier in the week former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont, who has been a vocal critic of the extradition case against the general, called for his bail to be relaxed to allow him to attend church at Christmas. In a letter to the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, Lord Lamont said that the general had not been convicted of any crime, and as he was a \"frail old man\" it was unnecessary to restrict his movements tightly. Lord Lamont described the general's treatment in England as \"vindictive in the extreme\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1998/dec/24/features11.g28","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-24T00:01:55Z","webTitle":"Once in royal . . .: Going off message?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1998/dec/24/features11.g28","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1998/dec/24/features11.g28","fields":{"headline":"Once in royal . . .: Going off message?","bodyText":"\"Now a silence falls in the islands and in the Antipodes. In the dead of winter or high summer, at midnight or midday, dusk or dawn, British people all over the world are listening.\" So ran the patter of the BBC warm-up man before the first royal Christmas broadcast on December 25, 1932. The Manchester Guardian assessed this as 'pardonable rhetoric', but it was more than that: it was an expression of wonder that the peoples of the British Empire were being spoken to at once thanks to the marvel of wireless. Even now, George V's three-minute speech, written by Rudyard Kipling, touches the reader, or at least touches one infinitely more than the forced philosophising and sentimental banality of later royal broadcasts. The King said: \"I speak now from my home and from my heart to you all. To men and women so cut off by the snows, the desert or the sea, that only voices out of the air can reach them . . . To all - to each - I wish a happy Christmas. God bless you!\" Now such wonder at radio technology - or indeed any form of mass communication - is hardly possible in a royal speech. But we can still just about appreciate the niceness of that home-heart parallel, as well as the all-embracing, each-referring ending - even if such a gentle speech could hardly work today. George V did not want to repeat the broadcasting experience, and was only persuaded to do so because of appreciative letters from around the globe. He became convinced that a regular address would serve to unite the Empire. Familiarity need not breed contempt. Perhaps his first instincts were right. Perhaps familiarity with the annual speech has bred contempt. It is one thing to hymn the marvels of the wireless once, but quite another to sustain interest year after year when all you have to go on is where you've been that year, interspersed with dime-store philosophising. What about a few jokes, Queenie? Or a few magic tricks? A song - Phil on the old Joanna? You could large it in a Big Willie style. Either that or you should contemplate getting Irvine Welsh or Will Self in to do a few sample drafts for Christmas 1999. Something, anything, lady. Because the current deal isn't working and hasn't for nearly half a century. The opening sentences of Queen Elizabeth's first Christmas broadcast in 1952, for instance, were not auspicious. Compare the following with Mr Kipling's exceedingly simple sentences. \"Each Christmas, at the time, my beloved father broadcast a message to his people in all parts of the world. Today I am doing this to you, who are now my people. As he used to do, I am speaking to you from my home, where I am spending Christmas with my family - and let me say at once how I hope that your children are enjoying themselves as much as mine are on a day which is especially the children's festival, kept in honour for the Child born at Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago.\" Apart from the then-moving reference to her beloved father, George VI, this was an inept beginning, through which inverted sentences ran like sores. \"Today I am doing this to you\" sounds like a punch in the mouth rather than an affectionate greeting, while the \"who are now my people\" has a gracelessness about it that, even in a more deferential age than ours, must have rankled. This, too, was the first time but not the last (if only) that she mentioned the Commonwealth, \"that immense union of nations, with their homes set in all four corners of the earth.\" What was worse, though, was that the Queen's distaste for broadcasting shone through the sentences - it seemed she was just following the example set by her father out of duty rather than out of personal conviction. She found succour only in sentiment: the Queen, who had acceded to the throne 10 months earlier and would be crowned the following June, asked her Commonwealth subjects to pray that she might serve God \"and you all the days of my life.\" As Ben Pimlott writes in his biography of Elizabeth II: \"If the impact of such cliched phrases came from the disturbing sense that she meant them, there was also the sense that she was not a natural or spontaneous communicator like her mother.\" In 1957, the Queen bowed to pressure and delivered the Christmas broadcast on television. Daphne du Maurier prepared draft suggestions and BBC announcer Sylvia Peters made her a special film demonstrating the \"five best ways to make a speech on TV.\" It's not clear if the tips worked, but, in any event, the prospect of giving a televised address ruined the Queen's lunch, and not only because the final draft was Prince Philip's. \"I hope your Christmas went off well,\" she told a courtier. \"Ours was upset by the television, which was nerve-racking.\" True, Christmas 1957 was a difficult time for the monarchy, and the pressure was on the Queen to deliver a speech that wasn't achingly woeful. Earlier in the year, angry young John Osborne had said: \"My objection to the royal symbol is that it is dead; it is a gold tooth in a mouth filled with decay.\" Worse, John Grigg, then Lord Altrincham, had written a controversial article in which he had argued that the Queen's true character had been misrepresented by her advisers. They had made her speak in an unnatural manner out of fear that her mystique would disappear if she sounded normal. Her speeches were, as a result, \"prim little sermons\", and her style of speaking \"a pain in the neck\", said Grigg. \"The personality conveyed by the utterances which are put in her mouth is that of a priggish schoolgirl, captain of the hockey team and a recent candidate for confirmation.\" There's not a little truth in this, as Tom Nairn noted in his book on the monarchy, The Enchanted Glass. Only about 3 per cent of Britons speak the Queen's English, he claimed. \"It's also true that many of those 3 per cent like to chuckle in private over the royal way with English. What they discern is a prim over-definition of accent, lacking proper casualness and freedom and separating it inexorably from the real real thing.\" But as the mystique of royalty and the deference accorded to it have been stripped away down the years, the monotony of the speeches has become more apparent. \"Television has ruined the whole thing,\" said Michael Adeane, the Queen's private secretary in 1963. \"The Queen is gay and relaxed beforehand but in front of the cameras she freezes and there is nothing that can be done about it.\" Adeane said he would give his soul to find some reason to stop the Queen's Christmas broadcast. Viewing figures have fallen steadily since 1957 when 16.5 million Britons tuned in to 11.5 million in 1997, but it remains a fixture in the dysfunctional disaster of the British Christmas, like overcooked turkey. Consider four decades of the Queen's Christmas broadcast. In 1962, the Queen opened with this: \"A merry Christmas and a happy New Year. There is something wonderful in the way those old familiar warm-hearted words of the traditional Christmas message never seem to grow stale.\" Only someone thoroughly disconnected with the real Christendom could believe these words were not stale. Stale, too, was her report that the Commonwealth continued to grow. Stale, again, were her plans for 1962: \"My husband and I are greatly looking forward to re-visiting New Zealand and Australia in the New Year . . .\" In 1972, the Queen reported: \"I have visited almost all of the 32 independent Commonwealth countries, and we are looking forward to going back to Canada and Australia next year.\" The speech would have been only moderately less interesting if she had listed all 32. In 1982, she delivered an extended paean to the Commonwealth Games. \"In October I was in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games and then went by sea in Britannia to visit a number of those beautiful Commonwealth island countries in the Pacific.\" In 1992, the Sun stole the Queen's thunder and published her speech two days before broadcast. Charles and Di, Andrew and Sarah, had all separated, Princess Anne and Mark Phillips had divorced, the papers were filled with toe-sucking and other embarrassing jibes at the royals, Windsor Castle burned and the Royal family now had to pay taxes. But the speech was hardly as fruity as the Sun might have hoped. She began: \"This year, I am speaking to you not from Buckingham Palace, but from Sandringham, where my family gathers every year for Christmas.\" Talk about burying the lead! The Queen did not throw herself vulgarly on the bosom of the Commonwealth, but instead spoke with an other-worldly reserve that, in the context of a year of harsh commentary on the Windsors, may well have been the best approach. \"Like many families, we have lived through some difficult days this year . . . But Christmas is surely the right moment to try to put it behind us and to find a moment to pray for those, wherever they are, who are doing their best.\" That other-worldly reserve also, particularly amid the sentiment of the post-Diana era, was striking in 1997. \"At the Christian heart of this United Kingdom stands Westminster Abbey, and it was right that it provided the setting for two events this year - one of them almost unbearably sad, and one, for Prince Philip and me, tremendously happy.\" But to pit the death of Diana against the golden wedding in the first sentence was surely bad judgment. So, too, was devoting the rest to the usual banality: \"Prince Philip and I were touched by the way the Canadian people welcomed us again to Canada.\" Enough with the Commonwealth already! At least now there are alternatives. Channel 4 this year offers the latest of its Alternative Christmas Messages when Stephen Lawrence's parents speak at 3pm. Channel 4 began this in 1993 with Quentin Crisp, The Queen Of New York; it was followed by Jesse Jackson (1994); Brigitte Bardot, the Animal's Friend (1995); Rory Bremner As The Queen Of Hearts (1996); last year Margaret Dibney, the 13-year-old Ulster schoolgirl lionised by Tony Blair. Instead, this year you could try cable: there's Bedknobs And Broomsticks on Disney. Or a three-hour special of old Christmas Coronation Streets on Granada Plus. But the best bet is The Simpsons on BBC2. That, at least, is reliably well written, moving and impeccably performed. All this fracturing, this dissent, this dissolution of nationally unifying is a good thing if it means we can choose something other than prim little sermons and homilies about the Commonwealth. If a silence does fall across Britain tomorrow at 3pm and all British peoples will be listening, then it will no longer be to the same nationally unifying thing. No longer exclusively to the Queen of this once United Kingdom and supine Empire. To all - and indeed to each - a happy Christmas. God bless us!"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sport/1998/dec/29/cricket5","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-29T13:10:47Z","webTitle":"Reversal of fortune","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/1998/dec/29/cricket5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/1998/dec/29/cricket5","fields":{"headline":"Reversal of fortune","bodyText":"Australia and England reversed roles on the last of the three extra-large days of Test cricket at Melbourne today, and there were some telling lessons for both sides in this game's blockbuster finale. Like their guests on innumerable occasions, the hosts succumbed to the habit of waiting for someone else to do something, somebody else to pitch in. With the Ashes in safe keeping already, none of the Australian septet skewered in 79 deliveries for 32 runs appeared over-keen to recapture the initiative that steadily oozed England's way. Even Steve Waugh, in exposing Stuart MacGill to Darren Gough during what proved the final over, seemed to trust overmuch to fortune. One should not make too much of Australia's supposed fourth-innings frailties, when they have in recent times chased targets at Port Elizabeth and Bangalore with composure and resolution. But here was a timely reminder that Test gauntlets thrown down must be accepted. England, in the meantime, displayed some qualities hitherto in this rubber associated almost entirely with Australia. There was an acknowledgment at last that Test victories, while they sometimes hinge on freakish performances, are at least as often composed of subtle accretions. Acclaim will be showered on the manful bowling of Dean Headley and Darren Gough, but two other factors should not pass unrecognised. Alan Mullally, the biggest bunny outside the kingdom of Hugh Hefner, had played above his station once on this tour already, his 23 not out at Townsville conjuring England's only previous first-class victory. The 23 he helped Gus Fraser raise for the last English wicket today proved as priceless as it was unlikely. The other facet was Mark Ramprakash's gymnastic catch to upend Justin Langer at the very moment when all hope seemed to have dissipated, but which rejuvenated his comrades like a snort of snuff. It is in the areas of tailend batting and fielding that England have trailed Australia throughout this series, and the way that the efforts of Mullally and Ramprakash narrowed this deficit today showed how fundamental they can be to success. In the context of the Ashes, of course, England's victory is immaterial. It is certainly a little galling, in demonstrating too late what the visitors are capable of, and might finally prove as meaningless as their similar consolation victory in Adelaide four years ago, immediately after which the team was stuffed out of sight at Perth. But on all at the MCG it will leave an indelible trace: the one-day matches now just around the corner in Australia will seem especially banal by comparison. They also serve in a Test match who only stand and wait, and three constituents of this game who helped make it such a rewarding spectacle should not be overlooked. First was the Melbourne Cricket Club, whose expensive but far-sighted decision in the early 1990s to underlay their ground with sand meant that only the first day of the match was lost after a deluge that might have robbed other grounds of several. Second were umpires Steve Bucknor and Daryl Harper, who officiated with nerveless precision through three elongated and arduous days. Last but far from least were the crowd, who bestowed favour with generous impartiality throughout. The Barmy Army in particular were indefatigable from start to finish, and even the most partisan Australian would not have begrudged them their reward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/1998/dec/30/5","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-30T01:53:49Z","webTitle":"2001:a political odyssey into the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/dec/30/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1998/dec/30/5","fields":{"headline":"2001:a political odyssey into the future","bodyText":"It's May 2001. A date is set for a general election in four weeks time. It will be a campaign fought on whether Britain has suffered from opting out of the single currency. Tony Blair and William Hague are ready to lock horns on the hustings over the costs and benefits of joining EMU. By the time the United Kingdom next goes to the polls, the euro will be two and a half years old. Many of the uncertainties surrounding the currency at its launch will have been resolved and the economic consequences for Britain of staying out will be clearer, at least in the short and medium term. But the campaign is also about the politics of the European Union for many of those taking part in what is, in effect, a dry run for the referendum that will follow Labour's expected election victory, albeit by a much narrower margin than predicted after the 1997 landslide. Those prepared to take a punt on the economic outlook for the next two years paint very different scenarios depending on where they stand in the EMU debate. So do those who look at the constitutional dimension: can Britain remain a sovereign, self-governing state while participating in a single currency and all that entails? Yes, say those in the pro-camp. No, say the sceptics. For Europhiles, it is simple. Britain will miss out on the benefits of the most significant European development since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The 11 founder members will enjoy steady growth, insulated from the turmoil still reverberating throughout the world's financial markets. Using one currency will make companies more competitive and consumers will benefit from lower prices. Meanwhile, outside the Eurozone, sterling's volatility will be a continuing headache for exporters, the City's competitive advantage in the financial markets will be destroyed and a flood of Japanese and American business investment will relocate to the continent. On the other hand, the Eurosceptics outline a darker scenario for the countries participating in the new currency. EMU will bring Europe's faltering growth shuddering to a halt as Wim Duisenberg and his anti-inflation hawks on the new European Central Bank (ECB) wind up interest rates to foil German and French policymakers' attempts to boost employment with looser fiscal policy. That in turn will ramp up the euro's value against other world currencies and guarantee the deflationary scenario that already hovers over Europe. On the outside, say sceptics in the Labour and Tory ranks (not to mention the Institute of Directors), Britain will benefit both from lower sterling and the ability to absorb external economic shocks with an independent monetary policy. The Labour leaders, with Gordon Brown, the chancellor, setting the tone for Mr Blair, have insisted from the start that EMU is an economic issue, to be judged by the Treasury's five tests of national self-interest, not a constitutional one. William Hague's Tories say it is both economic and political. They arouse tabloid angst over the Queen's head disappearing from the coinage but argue more deeply that a country which does not control monetary policy - interest and exchange rates - will soon lose control over tax policy, investment and much else. If the pro-camp says it is the biggest decision since 1956, the antis liken it to 1940, a moment deeply embedded in the British psyche, when Winston Churchill led the forces of defiance against Hitler. Euro-federalists see the new Europe preventing such destructive tribal wars. More dispassionate analysts suggest the apocalyptic economic scenarios on both sides are rather overdone. \"In the short term, the costs of staying out are mainly political,\"says Professor Charles Bean of the London School of Economics. \"EMU at the end of the day is a political project. Economically, the costs and benefits either way are relatively small.\" Professor Bean agrees that if the euro is a 'weak' currency - its value against the pound and other outside currencies falls - some companies who do much of their business with Europe will be in trouble. But, he says, companies can protect themselves against that risk by hedging - taking out financial instruments as insurance against depreciation. However, Bronwyn Curtis, chief economist at the Japanese bank Nomura, is less sanguine. She thinks sterling could return to its uncomfortably high levels of earlier this year when it was boosted in the run-up to EMU by nervous investors worried that the new currency would not be as strong as those it is replacing. Although sterling has fallen from its high of DM3.10 just before the announcement of the starting line-up for EMU, Ms Curtis argues that its 'safe haven' status is unlikely to diminish immediately. \"The Swiss franc and sterling will be the main alternative European currencies for investors... There is a danger that sterling could continue to be high and volatile.\" On the other hand, some analysts say many factors are likely to cause the pound to sink against the euro. First, most forecasts suggest Britain will be growing at a slower rate than the rest of Europe next year, which will cause investors to seek better returns on the Continent, driving up the value of the euro. The US dollar is widely expected to fall because of America's ballooning trade deficit. The pound usually moves in lockstep with the greenback. The same point could be made about British politics. Only this month Mr Blair said that choosing between Europe and the US was a \"false choice\". We could have both, as the bridge between the two, interlocked with our special place in Nato, in the Commonwealth and the United Nations Security Council. That may be inspired by nostalgia. A United Europe will want Britain and France's places on the Security Council. Britain outside Euroland would be marginalised, even more Washington's lapdog than it appeared in the recent Gulf attacks. The Euros say our fate lies in Europe, so does our influence. We must choose! Nonsense, the Tories will say in the 2001 election campaign and in the referendum expected the following spring. Britain is a free trading nation, not a static mercantilist European land power. When forced to choose between Europe and the open sea it always picks the sea. By that argument, there is a world out there eager to trade with a small, inventive nation. The Britain of 2001 will not be as recklessly confident as it was in 1940. But the habits of self-government are deeply entrenched. Blair's constitutional shake-up may make Britain fit for a Europe of the Regions, with its devolved assemblies and judge-made law. We shall see. Jobs will loom larger in many voters' minds. As well as the behaviour of sterling, the big unknowns are whether UK businesses will relocate in the Eurozone in order to enjoy the advantages of the single currency and whether Britain's position at the head of the inward investment league table will be threatened. Professor Bean thinks that financial services firms are unlikely to flood out of London once the euro is launched: \"I think businesses make decisions about location based on access to markets and regulatory regimes.\" Ms Curtis isn't so sure. \"The City will be gradually undermined. You can already see it happening.\" So will we rage against the dying of the Westminster light? Or go quietly into what we hope will be a dull, prosperous future. That is the question."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1998/dec/31/features11.g27","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-31T04:21:19Z","webTitle":"Economic crisis, sheep with two heads and strange omens in the sky.

Sounds familiar?","bodyText":"Today Pre-Millennial Terror means the fear of ending up at the wrong party. A thousand years ago, it was about the coming of the Antichrist. By 999 strange omens had started to fill the sky, and children were born in the form of monsters. Empires collapsed as famine, disease, political chaos and religious fervour swept the globe. To many, it seemed as if the world was coming to an end. For those awaiting the end of the world, the final decade of the first millennium opened promisingly, with Halley's Comet bringing such terror that when it next popped up, before the Battle of Hastings, the Pope of the day excommunicated it. As 1000 approached, the omens became increasingly bad. In 992 Good Friday occurred on the Feast of the Annunciation, a coincidence long held to herald the advent of the Antichrist. In 995 German chroniclers saw famine and plague and a child born in the form of a monster as augurs of divine judgment. By 999 people throughout France had begun to witness extreme visions of heaven and hell, a phenomenon they called 'holy fire' but that we now know was ergotism - mass poisoning by a natural form of LSD. Christians had been waiting for the end of the world since the death of Christ. Medieval millennialism was about the fear, or hope, of a great final battle between the Antichrist and the Messiah. Prophesies in the Book of Daniel, the Revelation of St John, and the popular but uncanonical books known as the Sybilline Oracles, told of chaos that would usher in the reign of the Antichrist. Christ would then return to earth and, after victory in the final battle, establish the Kingdom of the Saints. However, as the centuries of the Christian era advanced and the Church established its dominance over Europe, many came to suspect that the Apocalypse would not arrive immediately. Nor did the hierarchy seek to encourage speculation about the exact date of its arrival, especially as some soothsayers chose to identify the clergy with the Antichrist and behaved accordingly towards them. In the fourth century St Augustine claimed that such prophesies ought not be taken literally, and that the Kingdom of the Saints had already arrived in the form of the Church. Thereafter, to look for the date of the world's end was often to court disapproval, but such preoccupations did not go away. In 601 the Pope wrote to Ethelbert, King of Kent, warning him that 'the end of the world is at hand and the everlasting Kingdom of the Saints is approaching'. But, hedging his bets, he added that it would arrive 'in due course'. Over the next four centuries, there were always prophets announcing the end of the world. Nor were potential Antichrists and Messiahs in short supply. Emperors, kings and popes could be seen as either, sometimes as both, and the usual targets - Jews, heretics and outsiders - could be persecuted as part of the prelude to the final battle. Millennialism increased in times of instability, and 999 was such a time. The 10th century had seen the Christian world brought closer to destruction than ever before, as it was assailed by heathen hordes, internal feuding and anarchy. Although the danger from Muslims and Magyars in the east had abated, in 999 the English were fighting off the Danes, and it seemed as if the entire Iberian peninsula was about to fall to the Muslims. Popular that year was a treatise written 50 years earlier called The Origin And Life Of The Antichrist. Its author, a monk named Abbo, described how Christ's enemy would be born in Babylon to a Jewish mother and a demonic father, and would set up his kingdom on the Mount of Olives. But there was no need to fear his coming so long as France was ruled by the descendants of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor. The house of Charlemagne fell in 987 and destructive struggles for power followed. A contemporary wrote, 'With the world coming to an end, since men are driven by a briefer life, so does a more atrocious cupidity burn in them.' In the ensuing crisis, preachers announced the end of the world in 1000, pilgrimages were made to Jerusalem in the hope of witnessing the Last Day's unfolding, and mass gatherings called for a return to peace. But how much of this was caused by the approach of 1000? Many modern historians suggest there was no marked millennial feeling - after all, disease, poverty, political chaos and superstition were part of everyday life. And how many knew or cared what year it was? Most damningly, there is very little documentary evidence to show widespread fear. However, Professor Richard Landes, of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, disagrees. In his view, hostility to millennial ideas produced a 'consensus of silence'. Therefore, he argues, the remaining evidence is only the tip of the iceberg. There was certainly some interest in the date, especially in Germany and France. On the feast of Pentecost in 1000, the German emperor Otto III disinterred the body of Charlemagne. Many had associated him with the legend of a lost emperor who, thought to be dead, would rise from his sleep to fight the Last Battle. Otto did not find him awake but sitting up in a chair, at which point he proceeded to clip the dead emperor's fingernails. Rodulfus Glaber, a French monk, wrote about 'the many events which occurred with unusual frequency about the millennium'. These included the death of the greatest men of his time and the arrival in France of 'strange men with indecent shoes and clothes too short for them'. He also described how Christian communities competed with each other in a construction programme to cover the world with new white buildings, which he admits were not really necessary. Nor was Rodulfus dissuaded by the fact that the world did not end. Instead he, along with many others, switched his attention to 1033, the anniversary of Christ's death. This year, he notes, was prefigured by disastrous omens, including a worldwide economic crisis that 'began in the Orient and spread to England', bringing with it price inflation and cannibalism. The main English contribution to such millennialism is the letter of Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, to the English people in 1014. In a piece worthy of the Telegraph letters page, he complains of monstrous taxes, an agricultural crisis, men betraying their lords and widespread backstabbing. Finally, he warns how the Britons once so angered God that he allowed an army of the Angles to conquer their land, and suggests that history might repeat itself. And of course he was right. The first century of the new millennium saw Ireland gain a form of political unity for the first time and Scotland consolidate its nationhood. But for England, the 11th century was dominated by the Norman conquest. Millennialism permeated medieval life. In a superstitious society in which war, plague and famine were ever-present, the end of the world must have seemed not only imminent, but inviting. Those who looked for signs of the Antichrist and the Messiah everywhere were not to be deterred by their failure to turn up on schedule, just as we can be sure that latterday millennialists will not be put off by the failure of the world to end in 2000. When 1000 passed, and then 1033, and the prophets of doom died without taking the world with them, there were plenty more ready to take their place. If anything, the aftermath of the first millennium saw a rise in the terror of damnation, with the crusading movement and a vogue for apocalyptic writing. Just like today, there were always as many ready to say 'The end is nigh' as those who said 'Cheer up - it might never happen'. Boston University's Center of Millennial Studies website is at www.mille.org. Michael Staunton is a lecturer in medieval history at St Andrew's University, Fife."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"culture/1998/dec/31/artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1998-12-31T04:21:37Z","webTitle":"Grown-up Clara in too-sensible Wonderland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1998/dec/31/artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1998/dec/31/artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Grown-up Clara in too-sensible Wonderland","bodyText":"The Nutcracker Birmingham Royal Ballet The Lyceum, London Long ago, before the redevelopment of Sadler's Wells and the tragi-comic events at the Opera House, there was a large and enthusiastic lobby angling for The Lyceum to become London's premier dance house. In fact, the theatre went the way of most West End venues - it was bought up by Apollo Leisure to house shows such as Jesus Christ Superstar. But it remains a charming place for ballet to visit, and its riotously opulent decor is the perfect frame for Birmingham Royal Ballet's Nutcracker, which is the most decoratively traditional of the versions currently danced. It was staged by Peter Wright back in 1990, yet the magic of its transformation scenes (the key to any Nutcracker's success) is still potent. When the Christmas tree and drawing room start to grow, the change of scale is so monumental that you feel like Alice plunging into the hallucinations of Wonderland. The battle with the mice under the tree's huge branches has the shadowy menace of nightmare, and when Clara arrives at the Kingdom of the Sweets - after a glorious flight across the stage on a swan's back - she finds herself in a terrifyingly cold, grey castle, which awaits Drosselmeyer's conjuring gesture to bring it to brilliant life. Such details put the ballet in touch with other ballets and other fairy tales, like Sleeping Beauty, The Snow Queen and Swan Lake. It also suits the new frame within which Wright views the ballet, which is that Clara, rather than being a child, is a ballet student, whose encounter with the fantasy dancing characters in the Kingdom of the Sweets becomes her rite of passage into ballerinahood. This notion smooths away several of the The Nutcracker's creakier dramatic inconsistencies and makes space for some new and delightful choreography. But it also makes the ballet too sensible. The disturbingly anarchic elements left over from the original Hoffmann tale are nearly all gone. Drosselmeyer lacks the quasi-sinister, quasi-tragic status of a man who sees beyond the surface of domestic life. Despite the magic of the setting, there is no really urgent battle being waged between good and evil, terror and normality. And although Sandra Madgwick was light-footed and ecstatic in the role of Clara, she is obviously a grown-up. We don't see the ballet through the bewildered wonderment of a child."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"culture/1999/jan/01/artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-01T17:09:00Z","webTitle":"Natural talent fulfils demands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/jan/01/artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/jan/01/artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Natural talent fulfils demands","bodyText":"The career of the young Scottish director David McVicar has blossomed so quickly, since his successes at Opera North and Scottish Opera especially, that he is already in demand across Europe. His production of Handel's Tamerlano was revived in Dusseldorf in the autumn, and a Rosenkavalier will be unveiled in Glasgow in February; meanwhile a new Idomeneo has come into the repertory of the excellent Flanders Opera, a company which divides its performances between the houses in Antwerp and Ghent. McVicar has staged Mozart's greatest opera seria before; it was the miracles he worked on a minimal budget for Scottish Opera two years ago, taking responsibility for sets and costumes as well as the direction, that really marked him out. There has been more money to spend in Belgium, and this time he has treated himself to the services of a designer - Michael Vale, one of his regular collaborators - but uncluttered elegance and economy are still the hallmarks of their approach. Vale provides a permanent, unspecific setting - interlocking stone panels furnish the backdrop - sliding open at the climax of the second act to reveal the sea monster who ravages Idomeneo's Cretan kingdom. Echoes of the Scottish production remain, but in almost every respect, from the largest set piece to the smallest gesture, the staging has been reinvented. Idomeneo is not an easy work to stage well but once again McVicar handles it with utter naturalness. There is a wonderful fluidity and confidence about the way in which he places his singers, creating patterns that are always satisfying and perfectly balanced, yet without regimentation. The approach has classical poise, concentrating attention on the protagonists, teasing out what they feel and what motivates them. When Idomeneo has fulfilled Neptune's demands and passed on his kingdom to Idamante, he takes his leave without fuss, merges into the chorus and walks quietly offstage; as he does so Idamante suddenly panics, and tries to run after him - a heartstopping moment that sums up their relationship in the simplest gesture. Everything about the show has that same quality of perception, adding up to a Mozart production of the highest class, and one also prepared musically to an equal standard. The conductor, Marc Minkowski, manages to make the modern instruments of the Flemish Opera Orchestra sound like period ones, paring down the strings' vibrato to the minimum, keeping wind textures light and the rhythms unfailingly buoyant. The young cast is dominated by the lithe, persuasive Idomeneo of Richard Croft, and the unfailingly touching Ilia of Veronica Cangemi; Russell Smythe is a sturdy Arbache."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/1999/jan/03/7","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-03T23:20:27Z","webTitle":"Business as usual as Dublin dives in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/03/7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jan/03/7","fields":{"headline":"Business as usual as Dublin dives in","bodyText":"Inevitably, there was a protest to mark the introduction of the euro. 'The End of the Punt = The End of Irish Democracy' said a placard carried by a small group of demonstrators outside Dublin's Central Bank on New Year's Day. 'An act of national treason,' was how Citizens for Defence of the Irish Punt described the decision to adopt the single currency. But most Irish people seem ready to take the changeover in their stride. Yesterday several stores in Dublin had marked the price reductions in their January sales in euros as well as punts. In case there are any arguments, the Central Bank has a helpline giving an 'irrevocable' conversion rate. The full impact of entry to a new economic sytem will not be felt until euro notes and coins are introduced in 2002. In the meantime Irish banks, government departments and public services have begun an intensive programme of familiarisation. Plans are under way to have the national lottery tickets (and, presumably, the prizes) printed in euros and punts. Irish consumers will soon receive their gas, electricity and telephone bills in both currencies. Before the end of 1999 tickets for all forms of public transport will be issued in punts, pence and euros. This weekend Irish banks are working overtime to ensure that they are ready to cope with the demand, should it exist, for travellers' cheques and other documents in euros. Government ministers have been at pains to stress the benefits of membership of a new currency zone of 290 million people. The Finance Minister struck a slightly doubtful note when he described membership as 'rather like marriage in Ireland before the introduction of divorce - there's no getting out of it.' Some economists have expressed serious worries. These are mainly to do with whether low interest rates will fuel a spending bonanza which could lead to inflationary wage demands. The success of the Irish economy has largely been built on fairly tight wage agreements. There is also concern that the United Kingdom, which is still Ireland's largest single trading partner, has opted not to join yet. At the moment the punt is worth around 90p sterling and this rate suits Irish exporters selling goods in Britain. But any wider fluctuation could cause real problems. If the pound sterling were to gain against Emu currencies it could lead to inflationary pressures in Ireland, where British goods form a large proportion of products on sale in supermarkets and other shops. On the other hand, any weakening of sterling against the Irish punt would bring problems for Irish exporters, particularily farmers. The issue is particularly sensitive in relation to cross-border trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland, because peace has brought hopes of closer co-operation between the two economies on such issues as tourism and agriculture. In the past, any serious difference between prices on either side of the border has brought difficulties for traders in the area where costs are higher. John Taylor, the deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, has described Ireland's decision to join Emu as 'politically driven and not based on sound economic reasons'. But public opinion in the Republic approves the step as another mark of Ireland's commitment to the European Union. One of the benefits of the Republic's enthusiastic membership of the EU is that it has lessened its dependence, political and economic, on Britain and this is seen as no bad thing. Ireland has profited from membership of the EU but it has also worked hard to meet the criteria set down for membership of the single currency. This step towards economic integration may not make much difference in the short term, but politically it is seen as a significant move towards Ireland's acceptance as a full and equal member of the EU and, as such, is welcomed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jan/05/11","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-05T03:01:40Z","webTitle":"Radio ham makes the TV news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jan/05/11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jan/05/11","fields":{"headline":"Radio ham makes the TV news","bodyText":"How we see the news on television is being determined to a large extent at a 200-year-old former rectory in the East Midlands countryside. The man responsible is a company director who was bitten by the broadcasting bug as a youthwhile spinning records for a radio station he built himself and ran from his bedroom. As co-founder and technical director of OmniBus Systems - now the world leader in television station automation - Ian Fletcher has considerable influence over the way the news is presented on British terrestrial television. \"Our media management tracks all the disparate bits of information flying around the TV station - video pictures, stills, captions and so on -brings them together and physically manages their movement without the user being aware of the complexity of what's going on,\" he says. In less than five years, OmniBus has helped to change the way broadcasters carry out their jobs. Its automation systems, installed at more than 50 sites around the world, control every aspect of television production; its client list includes the BBC, ITN and MTV Europe in Britain and overseas operations include TV4 in Sweden where it helped create the world's first tape-less, digital television station. Early next year, every national news programme on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom will be under OmniBus automation control and the company's extensive links with the BBC are a particular pleasure for Mr Fletcher, who approached the corporation for a job as a 16-year-old. \"They patted me on the head and told me to go away and get some experience in local radio,\" he recalls. \"Radio Nottingham gave me a basic grounding in broadcasting engineering, while a City and Guilds course in photography brought me into contact with computers for the first time. \"I remember how frustrated I had been as a boy, designing things in my head and finding out that you couldn't actually carry them through. With computers, even though I knew nothing about programming, I found a medium that allowed me to do something with those ideas.\" The release of the BBC Micro computer allowed Fletcher to take those ideas into the world of video production; after re-mortgaging his parents' house (with their approval), he set himself up in business with a small outside-broadcast truck. \"To be honest, though, I was probably more interested in the computers than the video and I'd spend more time designing little bits of software to help cope with the vast amounts of work that we might get one day rather than worrying about getting the work itself. That was certainly one of the reasons why it was not a phenomenal success. \"And there were situations like being in Stoke at 2am on a Sunday after covering the wrestling for Screensport, avoiding all the old ladies who were assaulting officials with their handbags. \"The business was hand-to-mouth when we didn't have the money to pay salaries. We also spent two or three years of software time designing an audio mixing product which, by the time we'd finished, was far too big and complex for anyone to afford.\" Some business focus arrived in the shape of Glyn Powell-Evans, now chairman of OmniBus, who spotted potential in Mr Fletcher's BBC Micro programs; the two men began selling inexpensive character generators, countdown clocks and utilities which duplicated the functionality of costly broadcasting equipment built by the leading companies. Eventually, the software company overshadowed the video business and the team's first big product, the ManuScript character generator, was licensed to a larger manufacturer, funding development of what was to become OmniBus Systems. \"Looking back at it now, it seems slightly crazy,\" Mr Fletcher says. \"The two of us writing the software had had no formal training and we taught ourselves what we needed to know to do the next job. We built this incredibly complex multi-layered processing board with all the processors talking to each other to provide 3-D text and stuff that no one had done before on screen. It should have been impossible but I'm one of those people who don't recognise the phrase 'you can't do that'.\" In the early 1990s with 15 employees, Mr Fletcher began to form an idea of the full potential of OmniBus in the television studio. \"We were lucky in that we had one or two visionaries in the industry who recognised what we were trying to do with OmniBus and bought it when common sense perhaps said they shouldn't have done. \"The BBC built two studios at Television Centre using the technology we were basically providing from an old bus garage outside Nottingham. On the back of that, we secured the large contract with TV4 in Stockholm, where our software was extensively utilised in the first real fully digital TV station. It was real seat-of-the-pants stuff but we would never have financed the company without that struggle. Now, we are working on concepts that will be ready for the TV stations not of next year but five years' time.\" Today, OmniBus software runs entire television stations in different parts of the world and has just taken on its 100th employee. Last year's turnover was about £7 million and this year's is expected to be £10 million. OmniBus prides itself on being a different type of company. Its software, for example, does not run on Windows and PC-type interfaces but on its bespoke operating system. And the firm's philosophy is based on working hard but having as much fun as possible doing it. \"Taking life a little less seriously than other companies do is something that has endeared us to our customers,\" says Mr Fletcher. \"Our rivals go to great lengths to stop their customers talking to one another but we encourage it at our seminars, which usually degenerate into unadulterated fun. Seeing very senior TV executives in their suits trying to crash into each other at full speed on the dodgems is a sight to behold. And our website is not the usual corporate stuff; we gently poke fun at ourselves and our customers alongside the technobabble.\" The company's choice of HQ also speaks volumes; the team is housed in a converted Georgian rectory and recently spent £2 million on building an exact replica next door. Another difference is the company's in-house consultancy group which is in place to look after broadcasters before, during and after the installation of new technology. \"Whether a modern TV station works or not is not really about the technology but the way you implement it, train your staff and manage the changes. It is a painful process; some of these procedures have been around for 20 or 30 years so it's rather like the transformation the print industry went through when it moved over to computers from hot metal. \"And we all know what happened then. That's why we take an active part and don't simply walk away after a sale like many other companies.\" Five years ago, leading manufacturers of broadcasting equipment regarded OmniBus as wacky eccentrics; today, American and Japanese conglomerates are queuing to enter partnership agreements or work with the company on its products. OmniBus, however, retains a single-minded approach to development, Mr Fletcher says. \"If you ask 50 different people what we should be designing, you'll get 50 different answers. If you ask a customer what improvements to make, they'll say they want something cheaper and faster; in other words, fundamentally what they already have. \"So we don't indulge in market analysis or focus groups. We're not very democratic in that sense but the approach often allows you to come up with something completely off-the-wall.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jan/06/emu.theeuro2","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-06T03:30:06Z","webTitle":"The sovereign that never ruled","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jan/06/emu.theeuro2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jan/06/emu.theeuro2","fields":{"headline":"The sovereign that never ruled","bodyText":"The elan and enthusiasm with which the birth of the euro has been greeted on the Continent and in the financial markets evidently isn't shared by the British public. The Guardian's ICM poll shows opinion across the nation hardening against the euro, particularly among women. Readers of the tabloids hate the idea of abandoning the pound. If, then, Tony Blair really cared about what the Sun reader thinks then the United Kingdom would never become part of euroland. Sun readers, the paper intoned on January 4, the first trading day 'like the rest of the country are overwhelmingly opposed to giving up the pound'. The further one moves away from the City of London - where euro trading means good business and profits - the more one is likely to encounter a visceral opposition to the new single currency and a warm affection for the pound, even among the professional classes. British Airways and Marks and Spencer may be willing to take it but otherwise the new currency does not appear to have generated that much excitement. This may well be a response to the fact that it is plastic/electronic/ cheque currency and there are not as yet bundles of crisp notes in the wallet. But there's more to it. Somehow the pound - sterling - has imprinted itself on the national psyche as a symbol of our sovereignty. It is as if the pound, adorned with the Queen's head, were suddenly to vanish from British life it would be accompanied by financial rule from Frankfurt, political control from Brussels and Strasbourg and the fatal compromise of Britain's ability to set its own taxes. This, even though the sovereign's head has only been on Bank of England notes since 1946. So wary has the Blair Government become of the euro myths - many of them fomented by the unrelenting Europhobe press - that Britain refuses even the slightest tilt towards the euro. Whereas on January 1 two other 'out' countries - Denmark and Greece - decided to move into the ante-room by rejoining the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Britain remains as steadfastly outside as it has been since Black Wednesday in September 1992 when George Soros turned his guns on the pound and helped to eject it from the ERM. Chancellor Gordon Brown seems simply to have adopted the Tory position that Britain 'has no intention of rejoining' the ERM. The official view is that Britain can achieve its economic objectives by pursuing long-term monetary and fiscal policies aimed at stability, without the need to rejoin the ERM as a preliminary to becoming part of the single currency. But stability and the pound have not been historically compatible. Far from being the 'store of value' - which the currency is meant to be - or even as 'good as the Deutschmark,' as John Major once famously promised, the pound has been a dead loss. Instead of being a symbol of Britain's greatness, as the keep-the-pound lobby would have it, sterling has been at the core of almost every political crisis this century. Winston Churchill's vainglorious decision to peg the pound to gold at the parity of $4.86 in 1925 was typical. An overvalued currency led to a calamitous decline in exports and a brutal attack on the policy by John Maynard Keynes in his pamphlet The Economic Consequences Of Churchill. The pound's unrealistic value was almost certainly a factor in the severity of the Great Depression in Britain. If there is a single thread which connects the economic and political troubles of Britain since the end of the second world war, it's the sterling exchange rate. At times too high (in the immediate post-war period) and more recently during Gordon Brown's stewardship at the Treasury the secular trend in its value has been downwards. Anyone holding sterling would have been better off owning marks, US dollars or Swiss francs. The pound has been a symbol of decline and an endless cause of difficulty for our rulers. The easiest way to track sterling's decline is against the US dollar. For much of the postwar period the North Atlantic was Britain's most important trading and investment zone and there has been a tendency for sterling to move in tandem with the American currency, rather than the trading blocs which developed around the mark (now at the core of the euro) and the Japanese yen. But despite being an appendage to the American economic machine, sterling has seldom managed to keep pace with the dollar. The economic consequences of Churchill were quickly forgotten. Britain made precisely the same error of pegging sterling at too high a level in 1945. This time around there was a new international financial architecture in the International Monetary Fund, set by the Allied powers at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire in 1944. Victorious Britain claimed a high exchange rate at $4.03 to the pound - one which reflected its expectation of post-war advantage relative to the destroyed economies of Germany and Japan. The British position was complicated by the 'sterling balances' - assets held in pounds by foreigners - which may have led Britain to believe that it had a moral obligation to maintain a strong pound so as not to write-down the value of these investments(1). The strains caused by convertibility, which allowed foreign holders to switch out of sterling in 1947, together with the deterioration in Britain's balance of payments - as exports fell and imports soared - led the Attlee government into a decisive devaluation on September 18, 1949, when the value of sterling was cut by 30 per cent to $2.60. Devaluation against the currencies of all Britain's trading partners was a less severe 9 per cent. The 1949 devaluation proved to be a defining political moment. For much of the next five decades a falling pound came to be regarded by politicians as a symbol of economic and political failure. Successive governments fought rearguard actions in an effort to maintain sterling's parity, rather than recognising that its weakness was a reflection of a changing world economy: the reappearance of Germany and Japan as industrial powers following Marshall aid; the rise of the European Union and more latterly the rise of east Asia and Latin America as economic challengers to the West. As Philip Stephens noted in his authoritative study of the politics of the pound: 'Bretton Woods had another weakness as far as British governments were concerned - it hardened the equation between devaluation and political humiliation. Clement Attlee's Labour government never fully recovered from the devaluation of 1949'(2). IN the mind of the politicians a weak pound was an acknowledgement of economic mismanagement, rather than shifting trends in global trade and output. Britain's second post-war Labour prime minister came to office determined that his administration - unlike Attlee's before it - should not be remembered for devaluation. But like its predecessor the battle was lost against the 'gnomes of Zurich', the speculators who had realised that the pound was wrongly valued. In November 1967 the pound's value was adjusted downwards from $2.80 to $2.40 and Wilson promised the people that the pound in their pocket had not been devalued. As prices in the shops soared and inflation climbed the pound failed to represent the core British values which its current adherents would like to impute. It was felt that once the Bretton Woods system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates came to an end after 1973 - when exchange rates floated - the severe crises for sterling which had been a feature of the era would come to an end. But not a bit of it. In 1976 the pound again came under enormous pressure, triggering an application to the IMF for loans to support the currency and the imposition of financial terms by the Washington bureaucrats. This effectively opened the door to a new monetarist approach to policymaking, which was eventually adopted by Mrs Thatcher. Her early experience was not much better. At the time of her election on May 3, 1979, sterling was still below its point before the 1976 IMF credits. But soon after the election, as the Government removed exchange controls, raised taxes and tightened monetary discipline over the economy, the pound soared. By the end of January 1981 it was some 20 per cent higher than on election day and by some measures was as much as 50 per cent higher. The pound was temporarily a source of pride; at the Treasury the loss of competitiveness - which would eventually contribute to higher unemployment - was a serious cause of concern(3). During the past two decades alone, the pound has lost half its value against the mark. Since the war it has been associated with instability and failure. However correct government policies have appeared in domestic terms, the foreign exchange markets have regularly driven them off course. Moreover, all markets tend to overshoot. The pound has had its particular problems. The legacy of the sterling balances was an overhang in the 1960s and 1970s which put Britain's international obligations in conflict with its domestic priorities. The inordinate amount of government time spent dealing with the problems of the pound, whether too high or too low, was a distraction from recognising the British economy's lack of competitiveness and the need to cultivate those sectors of the economy where Britain excels, from finance (in the City of London) to pharmaceuticals and software technologies. Commercial neglect and uncompetitiveness, recognised belatedly by the Tories when Michael Heseltine was trade secretary, and more recently taken up by Peter Mandelson during his brief sojourn at the DTI are at the centre of Britain's economic difficulties. Over the decades, the pound has distracted policy makers from this focus. It has also been a disappointing investment. Sterling assets held in government stock or cash have gone down and down in value for the last 79 years(4). Only by holding shares have investors, either individuals or pension funds, been able to insulate themselves from the ravages of bad economic management and the long-term decline in the pound. There should be no sentimentality about a currency which has kept the economy on a roller-coaster for much of this century. Opposing the euro on rational economic grounds is fair enough. But to suggest that the new currency will be inferior to the pound would be a failure to heed the lessons of Britain's past. Sources: (1) B.W.E.

From Harold Macmillan to Tony Blair, most prime ministers have spoken for it, as the route to the heart of the British temperament, the path between extremes that leads to victory at the ballot-box. It was therefore inevitable that someone would try and open up a middle way on Europe, though perhaps less so that the pioneer should be David Owen, whose career, for a middle-way politician, revealed at every decisive stage an incapacity for compromise which eventually was destroyed by it. What Owen wants on Europe seems quite reasonable. He says he's very much for Europe, but very much against the euro. He has other supporters, names as yet unknown, but including Jim Prior, a middle-minded hero of the Thatcher years. They'll launch their campaign next month, and could make some headway. Isn\"t this the perfect escape-route for genuine lower-case euro-sceptics, who want nothing to do with the xenophobes and men of intellectual violence dominating the cause?

Yet, of the positions that can be taken about the euro, this one is, I think, the most obviously doomed. With the arrival of the single currency, an avalanche has buried the middle way. The Owen-Prior vision is flawed both intellectually and politically: a telling start to the post-euro British debate that will now unfold. Sweetly reasonable though it is, it has the same ambivalence as other sceptic thinking, notably at the top of the Conservative Party. While purporting to be tactical and economic, it is fundamental and political. There is deep dishonesty, or at least incorrigible evasion, at the centre of this middle way. It says the euro is bad because the bank that runs it is only vestigially accountable to elected politicians. That is quite correct. Yet, in common with every other sceptic, the middle way-ists run away from all attempts to rectify the fault. The idea of strengthening the European Parliament or electing the Commission touches their most easily horrified sensibilities. While posing as detached British watchdogs, shrewdly waiting to see what happens, they make a case that favours retaining every defect which they attack the euro for presenting. Opposing further political integration is a defensible position. But there is nothing middle-way about it. Now that the euro is here, the prime and living project of the European Union, political development, is unavoidable. To oppose it is no longer an academic exercise, but a case whose logic would lead to the steady distancing of Britain from the rest of Europe and ultimately from the Union. What is \"middle\" about a way that inexorably locates Britain on the fringe, and ultimately carries her over the edge into a different world? So much for intellectual coherence. But the political realism is no more compelling. The think-tank Owen is setting up is strictly for people \"whose hallmark is a lifetime of commitment to the European Union\". He doesn't want anything to do with those with \"a long track record of scepticism\". Understandably, he's fastidious, seeking ground from which the xenophobes will be excluded, insisting that the No argument can be made by people whose pitch is not full of fear and hatred, and whose only fight is with the secluded little matter of the currency. This ambition overlooks the unsheddable burden of history. It's rather too late to be removing from the anti-euro case the decades of straightforward anti-Europe sentiment that lie behind it. The depth of this sentiment long ago defined the language in which the anti-EU argument is now always conducted. It's as if no other language would be understood. As time goes on, this reaches ever further towards the kind of last-ditch extremism that allows no merit in any aspect of \"Europe\". The mind-set created by 18 years of Thatcherism, and the incessant anti-Europe propaganda in most of the tabloid press, together leave no space for the subtle distinctions Lord Owen says he hopes to make. He\"s not the first to try. Before Christmas, I was an almost solitary journalist attending the first meeting of the Congress for Democracy, an attempt to federate the 30-or-so groups and splinters fighting against the euro. Run by the Tory MP, Michael Spicer, it was a civilised, rather meek, occasion: a gathering of single-issue zealots that sat Michael Portillo down alongside the Communist Party; Peter Shore; the Freedom Association; Save Britain's Fish; and anyone else who says the euro will be the end of British life as we know it. Here, too, many people wanted to say they weren't anti-European. They were just anti-euro. But the utterance of any pro-Europe thought, of even the most abstract kind, somehow eluded them. It would have been like swearing in church. Once on their feet and in full flow, no campaigner against the euro can find a single thing of merit that might validate their contention to be, at heart and in general, in favour of any aspect of the European Union. Nor, in my experience, can David Owen, with his fears for any integrationist development in, for example, foreign policy. Yet, to make sense of the middle way, some positive thoughts are obligatory. The fact that they are invariably absent shows how deluded is the pretence that that way exists. Over Europe, it no longer does. This may be regrettable, but it also clears the ground for the referendum on the euro. Here is a choice which, both sides can begin to agree, will not be blurred. It will be a choice not just about the currency but about the entire future of Britain as a European country: no pretence, no bolt-hole, no escape from finality. Personally, I welcome this. That way it will be more easily won by a government which puts its weight behind the case, though Tony Blair needs to start crusading soon. The narrow economic argument about the euro would be harder to push. But in the end, that's not really what the Owen line is about. The veil of middleness is self-deceiving. Behind it, the only logic is visceral and extreme. The man who left the Labour Party because it was anti-Europe is heading, with a symmetry that befits him, towards opposing its every effort to make the United Kingdom a European country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jan/08/executivesalaries","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-08T11:54:23Z","webTitle":"US's top-earning executive takes $5m pay cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jan/08/executivesalaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jan/08/executivesalaries","fields":{"headline":"US's top-earning executive takes $5m pay cut","bodyText":"Michael Eisner, who is America's highest paid executive, saw his bonus cut in half as Walt Disney was hurt last year by a crop of disappointing films and poor ratings at its ABC television network. Mr Eisner's bonus shrank from $9.9 million ( £6 million) last year to $5 million while his salary went to $764,423 from $750,000. But most of his wealth comes from stock options and last year he exercised options worth $569.8 million, making him America's top earning chief executive. He also signed a new contract that will earn him another $700 million if the company's share price rises 10 per cent over 10 years. Roy Disney, the company's vice chairman, received $410,000, down from $700,000, chief financial officer Thomas Skaggs $650,000, down from $900,000 and chief of corporate operations Sanford Litvack dropped from $1.47 million to $1.1 million. Disney shares fell nearly 7 per cent during the year while net profits dropped 6 per cent. In his year-end letter to investors, Mr Eisner compared 1998 with 1991: 'both were years of key strategic investments and significant new initatives'. Disney last year invested in the cruise business and the Internet which Mr Eisner said will pay off in the long run. Disney also spent heavily on theme parks and cable channels but received little help from its film division. Deep Rising, Krippendorf's Tribe and Kundun flopped. Hits such as Armageddon, Enemy of the State and the Waterboy kept Disney number one in box office sales. But Mr Eisner complained about ballooning costs of movie-making even though the Magic Kingdom has the reputation as being among Hollywood's stingiest studios. 'In too many instances, profits did not materialise from the revenues achieved by our films,' Mr Eisner wrote. 'We succumbed to the overall industry trend of paying more and more for talent in front of and behind the camera.' Jill Krutick of Salomon Smith Barney cut her first quarter estimate for Disney profits by $120 million to $1 billion, or 31 per cent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jan/08/8","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-08T11:54:30Z","webTitle":"New car registrations soar despite industry troubles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jan/08/8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jan/08/8","fields":{"headline":"New car registrations soar despite industry troubles","bodyText":"New car registrations in the United Kingdom last year were the second highest on record, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported yesterday.

Tony Blair's trip to South Africa last week was seen an attempt to discover the truth about Nelson Mandela's political heir, whose true nature and ambitions remain elusive. Officially Deputy President, Mbeki, 56, is believed to have been the day-to-day ruler of South Africa for much of the past year. When the African National Congress wins Souh Africa's second democratic general election later this year, Mbeki will be confirmed as President. But his character still puzzles the country. He has a master's degree from Sussex University and is a capable economist. His oratory can be passionate: his most famous speech, \"I am an African\", stirred memories of Martin Luther King. And his vision of an \"African renaissance\" built on democracy, self-reliance and economic growth has already been welcomed with enthusiasm by Africa's black intellectuals. But his record also suggests a talent for blundering and his role is not fully understood, for he rarely gives interviews, apparently through shyness and dislike of the press. He seems to have been behind the policy of \"constructive engagement\" towards the tyrants of Africa, leading to Mandela's humiliation over Nigeria's execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and alliances with such figures as the Democratic Republic of Congo's Laurent Kabila and Zimbabwe's increasingly eccentric and despotic Robert Mugabe. Mbeki must also take some responsibility for last year's bizarre invasion of the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho. Of dubious legality, the action fuelled fears that South Africa was set to become the continent's 'bully boy', humiliated its armed forces and virtually destroyed Lesotho's capital, Maseru. Mbeki, like Mandela himself, was out of South Africa at the time, but it is assumed that the Deputy President gave the go-ahead to the acting president, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The appeasement of the Zulu warrior-chief is another hallmark of Mbeki's leadership. An end to a feud which has caused so much carnage is clearly desirable, and Buthelezi would be a useful ally when Mbeki tries to bring traditional tribal leaders into the governmental system, a major task he will face as President. But if the ANC achieves a two-thirds majority in the general election, it will be able to rewrite the constitution, and there are fears that Mbeki is following the example of Mugabe, who made a pact with Joshua Nkomo to create a de facto one-party state. Mbeki's reputation has also been damaged by political scandal. He has been implicated in the 'Sarafina II' affair, a plan to fight Aids by staging a spectacular musica l- Mbeki was said to be the inspiration behind the idea - which collapsed into bankruptcy amid allegations of fraud. Then there was the Virodene scandal: a couple of white researchers who claimed it was a 'miracle' anti-Aids drug somehow secured an audience with Mbeki and the Cabinet, bypassing the respected Medicines Control Council. Ministers gave a standing ovation when allegedly cured patients were paraded. It later emerged that Virodene was based on an industrial solvent and that the claims made for it were highly dubious. But the politicians continued to champion the drug, and Mbeki attacked the council, saying that \"the cruel games of those who do not care should not be allowed to set the national agenda\". Then there was Emmanuel Shaw II, former Liberian Finance Minister who, apparently armed with a recommendation from Mbeki, found a spectacularly paid niche as an economic adviser to the state-controlled Central Energy Fund before decamping, leaving large debts but taking the toilet fittings from his luxury Johannesburg flat. Another affair involved Vito Palazzolo, an Italian living in luxury on the Cape, who turned out to be a key member of the Mafia who had fled there after jumping bail in Switzerland. The corrupt apartheid-era politician who helped him obtain citizenship has been jailed but Palazzlo continues to enjoy the high life; one of his protectors is a former ANC intelligence agent who has been running a mysterious independent police unit directly answerable to Mbeki. Not even his strongest critics suggest that Mbeki is himself corrupt. But they do question his judgment in choosing friends and what appears to be a blind mutual loyalty between the Deputy President and his advisers. One of his spokesmen was accused of seeking sexual favours from a winsome New York Times reporter in return for an interview with Mbeki. Despite public humiliation, the aide remains in office. Not until Mbeki formally steps into Mandela's gigantic shoes will an anxious Africa get its first clear sight of the man who would be the father of its latest incarnation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/1999/jan/10/tvandradio.television","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-10T03:20:02Z","webTitle":"An Offa you can't refuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/jan/10/tvandradio.television","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/1999/jan/10/tvandradio.television","fields":{"headline":"An Offa you can't refuse","bodyText":"Next time we're negotiating the interchange between the M40 and the M6 at Spaghetti Junction, I shall replay Jonathan Davidson's treatment for radio of Mercian Hymns (Radio 4) by Geoffrey Hill to remind me that Birmingham isn't as awful as it looks from up there. You can tell by the 11.30pm scheduling of this gloriously original piece what they think of experimental radio at the Beeb. A thousand years ago, the Midlands, now home of Vauxhall Motors and Ambridge, was part of the ancient kingdom of Mercia whose rulers included King Offa. This sound-poem crammed with noises off - church bells, playground chants, pneumatic drills, taxis - painted an atmospheric picture of life then and now, with Offa's words providing the seamless continuity between ancient and modern. Any idea of dozing off before The Late Book was immediately squashed by that first mesmeric litany of titles. 'The naming of Offa; King of the perennial holly grove, the riven sandstone, overlord of the M5, architect of the historic rampart and ditch of the citadel and Tamworth, the summer hermitage at Holy Cross.' Even without Simon Russell Beale as Offa, this celebration of the Midlands past and present would have been a tour de force. Late night listening on Radio 4 is a bit of a lottery. The Wednesday night comedy hour was a case in point. Rarely have I found a funny programme unfunnier than Sean Lock's 15 Minutes of Misery, recorded in a Crouch End pub - full, by the sound of it, of Lock cronies. We were rescued stylishly by Peter Bradshaw's 15 minutes of sheer talent For One Horrible Moment (Radio 4), a take-off of Alan Clark's diaries which made me laugh out loud. Bradshaw's portrait of an eccentric English upbringing makes the Mad Hatter look as banal as the man on the Clapham omnibus. Finally, I am not a follower of Suzi Quatro but Rockin' with Suzi Q, her Saturday night slot on Radio 2 as presenter of vintage rock 'n' roll, makes me wish I were. You don't need much to link a couple of songs except for a husky laugh and a few well-chosen words. Maybe Zoe Ball should take a tip from Suzi. You don't have to load every link with innuendo to get the message across."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/1999/jan/11/5","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-11T03:23:18Z","webTitle":"Back to Old Labour gaffes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jan/11/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jan/11/5","fields":{"headline":"Back to Old Labour gaffes","bodyText":"Looming dour, and probably dire, 1999 offers the prospect of New Labour's honeymoon ending in an Old Recession. The ritual litany of 1981 and 1991, 'see it through', 'stability worth the sacrifices', 'only way to success', sounds as futile now as it was then, for New Labour is lumbering into the third-year bunker the party entered in 1947, 1966 and 1976. Then the difficulties were inherited. Now we've created our own, do-it-yourself recession. Labour government needs economic growth. We inherited modest growth but set out to kill it, to show ourselves as being respectable. Our business focus groups had urged 'stability', an end to 'stop-go' and 'political' control of interest rates. So we offered monetarist orthodoxy and gave the keys of the kingdom to Eddie George. Giving the Bank of England power over interest rates puts the wolf in charge of the lambs, and amounts to brain surgery with a band-saw because inflation is attacked by clobbering manufacturing. That is the nation's front line, and exposed to intense competition while the protracted service sector is not. Manufacturing suffers but services, especially financial services, are largely unscathed. A target of 2.5 per cent inflation drives out all other considerations: growth, jobs and any G7 or European proposals for lower rates to fight deflation. Higher rates make a higher exchange rate inevitable, a problem compounded in an world of financial uncertainties. We're doing voluntarily what we did compulsorily from 1990 to 1992. Given the crucial importance of the exchange rate, disastrous consequences are inevitable. Factories, lines and jobs will close, production and processing will be transferred overseas - as firms including Hornby and Marks &amp; Spencer are doing - investment decisions are cancelled and business battens down the hatches. Manufacturing generates growth and productivity. Services don't, so as their lopsided dominance increases we become a stagnant society, inflation prone yet interest rate immune. New Labour should have learned the lesson which had begun to dawn on Ken Clarke after the Tories' two disastrous bouts of engine-clobbering. We didn't, and so cannot avoid the consequences. Facing domestic clamour and competitive reductions overseas, the Bank of England has panicked and started bringing interest rates down, but too little, too late, and real rates remain much higher than in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. Nominal rates, are far higher than everyone else's, although our productive economy is weaker. Uncompetitiveness is our lot unless we run the exchange rate for competitiveness, not deflationary discipline. The exchange rate is a clearing mechanism and must adjust to balance trade, preferably with growth and high unemployment. A competitive rate is one which does that. We are far from it, and cannot move to it because of Gordon Brown's doomsday machine. Interest rates are the determinant of exchange rates, decided by the monetarist prejudices of academics playing safe, using inaccurate data and obsessed with a now irrelevant inflation problem. At this exchange rate it is not profitable to produce here. British production, from pigs to porcelain, does not pay. The Government's reaction is similar to the Tories'. Business is told to improve productivity, although it rises only with production and like competitiveness is unimportant compared to the exchange rate. Business is told to invest when it can't be profitable, with overvaluation. It's offered subsidised labour and skills upgrading, but neither will work if the product doesn't sell because imports are subsidised and exports taxed. Failure is blamed on world crisis - although we've left ourselves very exposed. Make it profitable to produce and markets will work, and investment and growth will come. Continue as we are and Labour fails. A recession in 1999 doesn't preclude election victory in 2001 with a large majority. Yet growth and jobs should be central, and both will suffer, and the hopes on which we were elected will be set back for four more years.

The combination of BAT, which is already the second biggest tobacco company, and Rothmans, the fourth largest, will create a group selling more than 900 billion cigarettes a year. But the merger aims to save about £250 million a year, much of which will be achieved through redundancies from the combined 70,000 workforce, roughly 5,500 of which are based in the United Kingdom. The companies refused to identify the scale of job losses yesterday but said there is less overlap in their UK businesses than in some other countries. They claimed that competition in the tobacco industry meant employment attrition was a reality with which the business had been coping for years. Some industry sources suggested, however, that more than 1,250 jobs worldwide could be at risk. BAT employs 200 people at its London headquarters and another 900 in its factory in Southampton. Rothmans' main factories are at Spennymoor and Darlington in County Durham. Its head offices are in Buckinghamshire. Rothmans, whose brands also include Peter Stuyvesant, is controlled by the wealthy South African Rupert dynasty, which will become a 35 per cent shareholder in the enlarged group. Together, BAT - which hived off its giant insurance business last year to create a stand-alone tobacco company - and Rothmans will sell one in six of the 5.6 trillion cigarettes consumed worldwide each year. The group will have a strong position in huge but mature markets such as Europe and America, where profits are still growing but consumption is stagnant. But its real strength will lie in emerging markets such as Latin America and the Far East where smoking is still a growth business and where consumers are likely to trade up to more expensive so-called international brands as their economies become richer. In some markets such as Africa, cigarettes are sold individually in times of hardship to help ensure that even the poor are able to continue their habit. Martin Broughton, the chairman of BAT, denied the deal had anything to do with the proliferation of smoking-related litigation which recently saw preliminary hearings in the High Court in London. But Johann Rupert, of Rothmans, said the recent $360 billion settlement with health authorities in the United States, in which BAT participated, had made the deal more straightforward. The deal opens the way for BAT to sell cigarettes in the UK market for the first time since 1911. Although the company makes Benson &amp; Hedges in the UK it sells them only overseas (Benson &amp; Hedges sold in the UK are made by Gallaher), and it disposed of the British rights to brands such as John Player in the early part of the century. Experts said the huge merger could act as a catalyst for a much bigger reshuffle among the world's big tobacco companies, most of which tend to be dependent on domestic markets and will find it difficult to compete with Philip Morris and a strengthened British American group in global markets. The industry is also labouring with huge overcapacity sparked by an enthusiastic expansion into Russia and eastern Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jan/13/yemen2","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-13T17:45:46Z","webTitle":"Pick of the Yemen links","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/13/yemen2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jan/13/yemen2","fields":{"headline":"Pick of the Yemen links","bodyText":"General information Supporters of Shariah The website of Abu Hamza al-Masri, whose movement, Sons of Shariah, operates from the North London Central Mosque in Finsbury Park.

The move reflects the family's bitter disappointment at the resignation of the only serving senior officer who faced a disciplinary hearing. Detective Inspector Ben Bullock, charged on seven counts of neglect of duty, will retire at the end of April on a full pension of about £25,000. It is unlikely that any disciplinary panel will meet before then. Although his decision brought renewed criticism of the widespread police practice of avoiding charges by taking early retirement, it is normal practice for officers to retire after 30 years service. During the public inquiry into Stephen's murder, Mr Bullock, aged 49, intimated that he was planning to retire after serving 30 years. In his case tighter disciplinary regulations to be introduced in April would probably not have made any difference. Imran Khan, the solicitor for Stephen's parents, Doreen and Neville Lawrence, said yesterday that the failure to hold any officer to account was \"injustice heaped on injustice\". He told the Guardian: \"The Lawrences are clear they want action, and we have to work out how we can do that.\" Interviewed on GMTV, Mrs Lawrence said: \"Yet again the police seem to have failed us, and I want to know why. We are going to have to do something. This just can't be allowed to happen.\" Mr Khan, together with the family's barrister, Michael Mansfield QC, believe there may be an innovative approach to the legal problem based on a judgment in the European Court of Human Rights last year. In the case of Osman v the United Kingdom, it overturned a House of Lords ruling on police immunity from actions for negligence. The judgment said individuals should have access to the courts to hold the police accountable for the \"actions and omissions\". Home Office lawyers are drawing up guidance for the police on the implications of the case. More details emerged yesterday about the curious timing of Mr Bullock's resignation and the announcement on Tuesday by the Police Complaints Authority that he was to be charged. He was advised last March, just before the public inquiry began, that he faced a charge of neglect of duty. As second in command of the investigation, he was criticised at the inquiry for being partly responsible for some of the blunders which led to the failure to arrest the five suspects in the first few days. Sir William Macpherson, the inquiry chairman, privately told the Police Complaints Authority that he did not want any charges laid during the first part of the inquiry into the police investigation. This ended in July, when Scotland Yard agreed to draw up the charges. According to the PCA, the Lawrence family were told in a hand-delivered letter on Monday that the charges were to be brought. The announcement was made on Tuesday, the same day that the Yard informed the authority that Mr Bullock had put in his resignation papers. He then claimed that he was going to fight to clear his name. Last night the police remained cagey about when he had handed in his notice, but it appears that it happened sometime last week. An existing regulation - which Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, insists must be rigorously applied in future - is that disciplinary matters must be completed before an application for early retirement can be considered. But the Met takes the view that the process begins only when charges are announced. Four other senior officers who would have faced charges all retired well before the public inquiry began last year. Who was who in Met's bungled investigation of teenager's racist murder The four former senior officers who would have been charged with disciplinary offences if they were still serving are Det Chief Supt William Ilsley, Det Supt Ian Crampton, Det Supt Brian Weeden and Det Chief Supt Roderick Barker, writes David Pallister. They all retired before the Lawrence inquiry began last March after 30 or more years' service. Mr Ilsley was the officer in charge of crime in south-east London and had overall control of the bungled investigation. He offended Mrs Lawrence by apparently folding up a list of suspects' names she had handed him as if it was of no importance. He left in 1995 to join the security company Kroll Associates. Mr Crampton was senior officer in charge of the investigation for three days after the murder. It was he who decided not to arrest the suspects, despite numerous tip-offs. The surveillance operation he authorised was described by the inquiry counsel as a \"crass failure\". He retired in 1996. Mr Weeden led the investigation for 14 months. At first he continued the strategy to delay arrests. Nearly every aspect of his investigation, from surveillance to identity parades, handling of witnesses and interviews with suspects, were criticised at the inquiry. He admitted he did not realise he could arrest the suspects on \"reasonable suspicion\" alone. He retired in 1994. Mr Barker reviewed the investigation in 1994, after the CPS decided not to prosecute the five suspects. He found that the investigation had \"progressed satisfactorily and that all lines of inquiry had been correctly pursued\". He admitted that he had omitted shortcomings in order to maintain morale. The inquiry chairman called his report indefensible. The seven charges against Ben Bullock, second in command, have not been specified. But when Det Supt Bill Mellish took charge in July 1994, he said he found a \"dispirited and negative team\". Mr Bullock did not seem to have \"one innovative or positive strategy\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jan/16/claredyer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-16T04:31:22Z","webTitle":"Law lords condemn Hoffmann","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/16/claredyer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jan/16/claredyer","fields":{"headline":"Law lords condemn Hoffmann","bodyText":"In an unprecedented move yesterday, law lords accused their colleague Lord Hoffmann of acting as \"a judge in his own cause\" by failing to declare his close links with Amnesty International when he sat with four other judges to decide whether the Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, was immune from arrest and extradition.

So well known is the rule, said Lord Hope, that no civil court in the United Kingdom has had a judgment set aside for a breach of it this century. In criminal cases the rule was even more important. \"Judges are well aware they should not sit in a case where they have even the slightest personal interest in it, either as defendant or as prosecutor,\" Lord Hope said. Lord Hutton said public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice would be shaken if Lord Hoffmann's deciding vote that General Pinochet could be prosecuted was allowed to stand. The five were delivering the reasons for their unprecedented setting aside on December 17 of a landmark three-two majority ruling on November 25 that former heads of state are not immune from prosecution for crimes against humanity. Lord Hoffmann failed to disclose that he was chairman of Amnesty International Charity Limited, the fund-raising arm of Amnesty International, although Amnesty had been allowed to intervene and was in effect a party to the appeal. Amnesty backed arguments by the Crown Prosecution Service, on behalf of the Spanish authorities who are seeking to extradite the general, that he should not be protected by sovereign immunity.

Dr David Robertson, an Oxford don and author of a new study of the law lords, called for his resignation on BBC Radio Four's PM programme yesterday. \"He has probably lost the confidence not so much of the public as of his fellow judiciary,\" he said. It emerged last night that Lord Hoffmann has been removed from a panel of law lords that was due to sit on a Privy Council appeal next week in the Bristol heart surgeons case. Bias is a central allegation in the appeal by Dr John Roylance, the former chief executive of United Bristol Healthcare Trust, against the General Medical Council's decision to strike him off for serious professional misconduct. Dr Roylance alleges that the GMC's president, Sir Donald Irvine, who chaired the panel hearing his case, was biased. Sir Donald's young grandson was undergoing treatment for a heart condition at the time. Lord Hoffmann could not be reached for comment last night, but he told friends before the law lords gave their reasons for setting aside the November 25 judgment that he had no intention of resigning. The judges said they were not suggesting that Lord Hoffmann was actually biased in the Pinochet case. He was not paid by the charity and took no part in Amnesty International's policy-making activities. But his links with Amnesty were so close that he was disqualified by law from sitting as a judge in the case.

First the rights to Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch were snapped up by Channel 4 Films, whose boss David Aukin and second in command Allon Reich are Highbury regulars. Now it emerges that Emily Watson's Arsenal affinity did her no harm in landing the lead in Angela's Ashes, the film of Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoirs. She admits that when she auditioned for the film's Gunners-mad director Alan Parker, \"Arsenal was pretty much all we talked about\". It gets worse. The new British film Plunkett And Macleane, about two 18th-century highwaymen, features two comic cockney courtiers. Their names? Dixon and Winterburn. Hard to imagine a long conversation between the England goalkeeper and our head of state, except perhaps about fashion disasters. But they do things differently in central Europe. Asked in last week's QPR programme which person he would most like to meet, the Czech goalkeeper Ludek Miklosko plumped for his country's president, the playwright and former dissident Vaclav Havel. \"We could talk about life,\" he said. The Diary is saddened to learn that this year's FA Cup final commentator is to be Clive Tyldesley, not out of nostalgia for the BBC or Brian Moore but because it means Tyldesley's colleague Peter Drury will not be adding his gravitas and knowledge of the animal kingdom to the occasion. Struck by the extravagant celebrations of Swansea's mascot after their win over West Ham on Wednesday, he reminded viewers that \"Cyril the Swan was a mere cygnet when Swansea last had a night like this\". Wembley will be the poorer. Goalkeepers (if not teachers) can take comfort in the recent experience of the Labour MP for Reading West, Martin Salter, who asked some primary-school children the name of the Chancellor. One nine-year-old confidently piped up: \"Gordon Banks.\" (Thanks to Russell Newmark) Rarely has a song so readily suggested itself as the basis for a chant in praise of a player as in the case of the 18-year-old Zaire-born striker Lomana Tresor Lua Lua, who scored on his Colchester debut last week. The mid-Eighties compilation album simply titled Louie Louie offers a pleasing variety of interpretations of that classic number for United fans to choose from. We recommend Iggy Pop's version. They said satire died when Henry Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize. Any doubts were surely extinguished by this month's issue of the publication Chelsea, which describes itself as \"the official magazine de London's classiest club\". Book now for Aberdeen v Hearts on May 22; it may be a really nice match. Scotland are currently leading the competition for an extra place in Europe next year because of the good disciplinary record of their clubs and national teams. That place goes to the club with the least number of red and yellow cards, a competition the Dons are currently leading. So will they be pussyfooting around to get into Europe or getting stuck in to avoid relegation? \"It seems there is one set of rules for Premiership players and another for those from the Nationwide League,\" complained one manager of a battling lower-division club this week after FA disciplinary committee rulings went against his side and in favour of their Premiership opponents in the FA Cup third round. Yes, Joe Royle, life is hard for the little guys of Manchester City when they come up against well-heeled members of the privileged elite such as, er, Wimbledon.

According to Whitehall sources, it suits \"ministers who are frankly not going to mind where they stay - so long as it is comfortable and convenient\". Jack Cunningham, the Cabinet Office Minister, instead chose the Conrad Hilton, the nearest thing to a six-star hotel in Brussels, and where the decor is more akin to London's Ritz, Savoy or Dorchester. It is remarkably expensive, even by Brussels standards, and is not convenient for the European Commission headquarters. A room at the Conrad Hilton is costs £254 a night, although the Cabinet Office is insistent Mr Cunningham paid less than that. The Hotel Dorint is a modern, confortable hotel that would suit a businessman. As a three-star Euro standard hotel, it charges £174.50 a night for a single room. Under a deal arranged through the European Commission, United Kingdom ministers and officials pay at least £35 a night less. Is Mr Cunningham, who also flew last week to Washington via New York by Concorde, enjoying the high life at the taxpayers' expense, as was alleged at the weekend? Or is he being pilloried by a press that expects too much from its servants? During his stay at the Conrad Hilton Mr Cunningham, as agriculture minister, had been under a punishing work-load, negotiating the lifting of the beef ban. And surely British ministers should not been seen as Europe's poor relations, economising at the Dorint while their counterparts bond in the Conrad Hilton? Lewis Moonie, Labour chairman of the Commons finance and spending committee, is sympathetic. \"Ministers should not be extravagant but when they are working overseas, long hours into the night, they should be expected to have a reasonable standard of comfort where they are, at a hotel where you can get a meal late at night.\" Mr Cunningham's tastes were defended, too, by the much-travelled Denis MacShane, MP for Rotherham and parliamentary private secretary to Joyce Quin, the Minister of State for Europe. \"Jack Cunningham was involved in a Herculean task. Frankly his expenses are a mere fraction of the savings he has made on behalf of the British farmer by taking up the BSE issue. His use of private planes would not be an issue in France, where they have a fleet of 20 jets to make sure ministerial inconvenience on travel arrangements is kept to a minimum.\" When allegations that Mr Cunnigham enjoyed the high life were made the first suspicion was that another Cabinet minister was settling old scores. That suspicion gave way yesterday to a belief that Mr Cunningham was being shafted from within his department by a civil servant. \"The finger is pointing in his direction and he will get a bullet in the neck before long,\" a Westminster source said. The rules governing expenses, though set out in the ministerial code, are vague: \"always to make efficient and cost-effective travel arrangements\". In the end, it is up to civil servants to approve travel plans. Mr Cunningham had permission, so technically he is in the clear. But has he breached the spirit of the code? William Hague, the Conservative leader, claimed he had. He told BBC Radio Five yesterday: \"It's like Animal Farm, where the pigs eventually take over the farm.\" The Conservatives asked Tony Blair for an inquiry. Both Downing Street and the Cabinet Office were resistant, claiming that all details about Mr Cunningham's trips had already been answered. The Tories have put down a series of parliamentary questions on ministers' travel since May 1997, showing spending is generally higher than under them. Mr Blair spent £11,613 per trip on average, compared with £11,136 for Conservative prime ministers; George Robertson, the Defence Secretary, spent £3,910 per trip, compared with £3,433 under the Tories. If it had been Mr Blair flying by Concorde - as he has - it is unlikely there would be a fuss. The problem is that Mr Cunningham has built up a reputation. When appointed agriculture minister, he quit his run-down offices in Whitehall Place for a listed building, Nobel House, in Smith Square, and spent thousands of pounds on redecoration. When he moved to the Cabinet Office, he immediately rejected the office of his predecessor, David Clark, took over an office used by 18 of his staff, and ordered a new mahogany desk. It is against that background that the Brussels trip and the Concorde flight are judged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jan/20/davidsharrock","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-20T02:24:30Z","webTitle":"Jordan welcomes Hussein's return to make changes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/20/davidsharrock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jan/20/davidsharrock","fields":{"headline":"Jordan welcomes Hussein's return to make changes","bodyText":"King Hussein of Jordan, the Arab world's longest ruling leader, returned home to his desert kingdom yesterday after a six-month absence for cancer treatment, ready to prepare his country for the day he will no longer be its absolute monarch. As befits the tribal character of Jordan, sheep were slaughtered throughout this largely barren country of four million people in honour of the king's return. King Hussein, accompanied by his American wife Queen Noor, flew by private jet from his London residence to the Jordanian capital, Amman, where he was greeted by dignitaries, including the Palestinian Authority president, Yasser Arafat. On descending from the jet the king's first action was to kneel and pray on an oriental carpet facing towards Mecca, the centre of the Islamic faith. 'My plans are to rest a bit maybe, but there's a lot to be done,' he told reporters. He said that his nearly 47 years of rule had been 'a continuous struggle' to improve Jordan, but added: 'Every now and then we have to review, to consolidate.' He thanked his brother Crown Prince Hassan for deputising for him during his long illness and stay at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, where he underwent chemotherapy for non-Hodgkinson's lymphoma. Government assurances that the cancer is completely cured have not dampened expectantations that change is imminent. He is to return to the cancer clinic within two months for further tests. Before that time he may call a 'family council\" to decide the question of the succession. In response to an Arabic newspaper claim that he has come under pressure from Washington to put the royal house in order, the king said in a statement: 'No one knows what is in the mind of the al-Hussein until it crystalises into a reality.\" Officials fed the speculatiion that he intends to change his choice of designated heir from his brother the crown prince to his son Hamza, aged 18, who is studying at Sandhurst. 'His majesty, a strong believer with a sense of deep faith in God's will, confronted during those difficult days life and death,' an aide said. 'It naturally rekindled a wish to seek posterity through passing the succession to one of his sons.' In a televised speech shown in Jordan before his return, King Hussein said he was determined to dispel concerns about Jordan's future and promised big changes, but he gave no details. In contrast to his past strong endorsement of Prince Hassan, the speech made only passing reference to him. Hamza is the king's favourite son and has been at his bedside for much of his illness. Queen Noor has encouraged her husband to push their eldest son forward to secure the Hashemite blood line. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and neighbouring Saudi Arabia are the world's only two countries to be named after their ruling families. If the king chooses Hamza in preference to Hassan, who has been his deputy for more than 30 years, it will not be a popular choice. Rami Khouri, a political columnist, believes that the crown prince will become the next monarch, but that King Hussein may seek guarantees that in due course the crown will pass to his son. 'Most Jordanians have known no other ruler. We have a parliament but it lacks credibility,' Mr Khouri said. 'Jordan is oligarchic but not a police state, autocratic but not authoritarian, top heavy but not tyrranical. Its been undergoing a transition for 15 years and most Jordanians feel slow, steady progress is best.' But Laith Shbailat, Jordan's outspoken, self-declared opposition leader, said that only the king has the popularity and strength to establish a fair system of government based upon Britain's constitutional monarchy and he must do it soon or the country will face chaos after his death. 'The country is in a very bad state economically and politically and the people are very angry although they don't show it because they are afraid. I'm afraid that the only pressure he will listen to is people taking to the streets like they have done four times in the last decade,' said Mr Shbailat, who has been imprisoned three times for speaking out. King Hussein's reign has been an oasis of stability in a turbulent region. That it may now soon end causes concern among neighbouring states and western powers. Yesterday, however, Jordanians preferred not to contemplate the future but to celebrate the return of their king. 'It's Eid [the festival marking the end of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan], it's raining and our king is home - what more could we ask?' said Metri, a travel agent, who twirled his umbrella gleefully as King Hussein swept past in a vintage white Mercedes, waving and smiling at his subjects as he poked his head to the vehicle's roof."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jan/20/22","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-20T02:24:32Z","webTitle":"The gremlin spoiling a City fairy tale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jan/20/22","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jan/20/22","fields":{"headline":"The gremlin spoiling a City fairy tale","bodyText":"Observers outside the City's square mile might be forgiven for wondering what all the fuss is about. After all, British Aerospace's £7.76 billion alliance yesterday with GEC's Marconi defence arm is just the latest merger in an increasingly competitive and global market. What's more, defence firms this side of the Atlantic have been slow to amalgamate. (Trends in defence contracting would have had more public airing if more MPs bothered to attend debates on defence policy and arms spending). But the significance of yesterday's creation of New BAe, the third-largest defence contractor in the world, is immense, even more so geo-politically than politically. It goes to the heart of Britain's relationship with Europe. Tony Blair was quick to grasp the point. Late on Monday, he called in Dick Evans, BAe's chairman, and George Simpson, GEC managing director (and Labour life peer) to discuss the merits of their planned merger. Britain has opted out of the single currency, but last year Mr Blair proclaimed that it would be at the heart of the European Union's struggle to develop a common defence and security policy. Defence was to be one area where Britain could take the lead even though the Prime Minister has proved himself profoundly transatlantic in strategic thinking. His government enthusiastically endorsed the Tories' purchase of the US Tomahawk cruise missile for Navy submarines. The decision was political. It indicated that in any future military action involving low-risk initial air strikes of the kind made against Iraq - and threatened against Serbia - the United States need not be alone. But Mr Blair, aware that some other Europeans view Britain as the Americans' Trojan horse, proved reluctant on Monday to approve the BAe/GEC marriage. His preference was for BAe to link up with Germany's Dasa and Marconi to get hitched to Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics firm. These would have been semi-final pairings before the grand finale - envisaged as a European Aerospace and Defence Company (EADC) built around these four (and other, smaller companies). Messrs Evans and Simpson believe they convinced him their wedding did not preclude a bigger European family. But the Germans reacted angrily to the merger yesterday, warning that it posed an obstacle to European integration. That shows the politics surrounding the creation of some bigger, integrated, pan-European entity are even more fraught than they were in 1986 when Michael Heseltine walked out of the Conservative cabinet in protest at Mrs Thatcher's preference for an American rather than a European saviour of Westland, the helicopter-maker. With New BAe looking as much to the US as to Europe for future growth, Mr Blair could yet find himself entrapped by the classic British dilemma of having to make a choice between alignment with the US or with the rest of Europe. Things looked simpler a year ago. Then the British, French and German governments were echoing the \"consolidate or die\" injunction that had been delivered in 1993 at the \"last supper\", a dinner of American contractors addressed by Lee Aspin, then American defence secretary. \"France, Germany and the United Kingdom share a vital political and economic interest in an efficient and globally competitive European aerospace and defence electronics industry\". The European defence manufacturers were under pressure to rationalise and maximise potentially enormous cost-savings. In the post-cold war era, military budgets were being slashed and the sheer cost of research and development was beginning to outstrip even the funding capabilities of the American Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. Hopelessly fragmented on national lines, Europe was \"blessed\" with 10 prime contractors for military aircraft and helicopters (compared with five in the US), four for main battle tanks compared with one in the US, 12 for missiles (the US has three) and at least 14 for tracked armoured vehicles compared with two in America. Three key players - British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and Dasa, the aerospace arm of what is now DaimlerChrysler - were already partners in the highly successful challenge to the Americans in the field of wide-bodied civil airliners posed by Airbus Industrie. BAe, Dasa, Alenia, the Italian firm and Casa, the Spanish contractor, moved to take on the American dominance of fighter aircraft through the Eurofighter. Commercial logic certainly, perhaps political logic too, called for both a common European security policy and a converged manufacturing base to accompany the single currency. The advent of the euro seemed to give further impetus to the creation of the EADC, the unified European defence company. But national pride, industrial machismo, political sensibilities and the need to protect jobs at a time of excessive unemployment in continental Europe proved formidable obstacles to the desired process of consolidation. Restructuring moved therefore with glacial speed. The French, with their neo-Gaullist national hauteur even under the socialist premier, Lionel Jospin, were trusted by no putative partner. It was not just that Mr Jospin was a reluctant privatiser (though he has taken significant steps, reducing the state's stake in Aerospatiale to below 50 per cent). That was never enough for BAe and Dasa who were both wedded to shareholder value and wanted the French industry privatised first. The French also made plain that cost-savings were fine provided they did not mean tens of thousands of French job-losses. And, just as the German government had forced its aerospace and defence industry to weld together as Dasa in the 1980s, so the Jospin administration made its priority getting its own industry into shape before countenancing any pan-European moves. So Aerospatiale, Dassault, Larardere and others are being encouraged to merge while GEC was unceremoniously shut out of the privatisation of Thomson, the defence electronics firm. In other words, the French wanted to control the process on their terms. That apparently left BAe and Dasa free to conclude their own deal and, just before Christmas, a £24 billion merger seemed ready for signature; what's more it appeared to have Blair's blessing even though he really wanted the French on board. But, six months previously a strategic review at GEC had concluded that its Marconi defence arm had no future on its own. Then the company's MD, George Simpson, a renowned deal-maker, started a Dutch auction to gain the best value for his shareholders for what he called yesterday \"the pretty girl in the defence consolidation dance.\" Mr Simpson made fresh approaches to BAE's chairman, Dick Evans, and chief executive, John Weston, and even offered the prospect of a trilateral deal with Dasa. A pre-Christmas meeting scuppered that, largely because Daimler would have seen its stake - 35 per cent in a BAe/Dasa merger - reduced to just 20 per cent. But GEC had already become America's sixth biggest defence contractor through its £900 million purchase last year of the Texan defence electronics firm Tracor, and the collapse of the planned merger between Lockheed and Northrop Grumman opened another window of opportunity. As late as last week GEC executives were in Washington talking to Lockheed and both Northrop and Grumman are believed to have made tentative offers, both valuing GEC higher than BAe. Behind the scenes both American manufacturers and, more critically, the Pentagon were putting on the squeeze -arguing for \"a truly trans-Atlantic defence company\" and warning that a \"Fortress Europe\" approach excluding the Americans would damage British firms' access to both markets and confidential technology. The Pentagon was adopting a similar hard-ball approach behind Raytheon's bid to provide new smart missiles for Eurofighter. In the end, anxious to prove his European credentials, Mr Blair effectively vetoed an American tie-up for GEC. But the French, in the guise of Thomson, were still in there and offering far greater \"synergies\" (reduced costs) than BAe - up to £500 million a year against £275 million. Just a few hours before he concluded the BAe deal early yesterday morning, Mr Simpson received an improved offer from Thomson, valuing GEC at around £6 billion. It was not enough and, anyway, \"we couldn't imagine Thomson cutting thousands of jobs in the South of France; here yes\", as one insider put it. And so, a City fairy story for at least the last 15 years, a BAe/Marconi alliance, became a reality. But the consequences of this Anglo-British marriage are far-reaching despite the best efforts of corporate chieftains to insist that the deal opens rather than closes the door to further pan-European restructuring. The Italians and the Swedes may be delighted but the Germans are deeply miffed and determined to pursue \"other European and trans-Atlantic options\" while the French are already exploiting those hurt feelings on the other side of the Rhine (\"offering Dasa the tradesmen's entrance,\" as Yves Richard, their defence minister, put it). New BAe yesterday paraded itself as the world's first global aerospace and defence company, at home in eight countries' markets. But New Labour is going to be deeply unhappy if this inexorably brings about two rival groupings in Europe - a British core company with some interests in Italy, Spain and Sweden and a trans-Atlantic bias and a Franco-German competitor. Dick Evans said Europe could only afford one corporate entity in this sector but the fear now is that he and, unwittingly, Blair, have confirmed Britain's classic two-way stance towards Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jan/20/patrickbarkham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-20T02:24:48Z","webTitle":"League of nations Are our chief executives really underpaid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/20/patrickbarkham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jan/20/patrickbarkham","fields":{"headline":"League of nations Are our chief executives really underpaid?","bodyText":"Rank Country Salary* 1 US $1,072,400 2 Brazil 701,219 3 Hong Kong 680,616 4 Britain 645,540 5 France 520,389 6 Canada 498,118 7 Mexico 456,902 8 Japan 420,855 9 Germany 398,430 10 South Korea 150,711.

The British chief executive's traditional lament that Britain lags behind the rest of the world in the top pay league appears increasingly unjustified. Britain is fourth in the pay league, well ahead of economic superpowers such as Germany and Japan. And they enjoy the third highest levels of basic pay in the world - ahead of Hong Kong, whose executives receive more generous bonuses than Britain. The United States is the world leader in chief executive pay. The American way is to offer generous basic pay (38 per cent higher than the United Kingdom, according to another survey) alongside massive bonuses and incentives such as stock options (which work out at more than five times higher than the UK). When British companies acquire American ones, such as BP's recent purchase of Amoco, there seems little alternative but to embrace higher pay and bigger bonuses. Business leaders argue that it's the price of entering the American market. Mergers tend to enhance corporate profitability at the top levels. Global mergers look likely to push chief executive pay up to the highest common denominator, yet companies will still choose to relocate their humble labour force to where wages are cheapest. One day, perhaps, a real pioneer will send its chief executives to South Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jan/20/claredyer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-20T02:25:24Z","webTitle":"Pinochet's future may hang on a date","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/20/claredyer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jan/20/claredyer","fields":{"headline":"Pinochet's future may hang on a date","bodyText":"The seven law lords who will decide whether the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, can be extradited to stand trial in Spain are to ask the Foreign Office to certify when the United Kingdom recognised him as head of state in Chile.

As befits the tribal character of Jordan, sheep were slaughtered throughout this largely barren country of four million people in honour of the king's return. King Hussein, accompanied by his American wife Queen Noor, flew by private jet from his London residence to the Jordanian capital, Amman, where he was greeted by dignitaries, including the Palestinian Authority president, Yasser Arafat. On descending from the jet the king's first action was to kneel and pray on an oriental carpet facing towards Mecca, the centre of the Islamic faith. 'My plans are to rest a bit maybe, but there's a lot to be done,' he told reporters. He said that his nearly 47 years of rule had been 'a continuous struggle' to improve Jordan, but added: 'Every now and then we have to review, to consolidate.' He thanked his brother Crown Prince Hassan for deputising for him during his long illness and stay at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, where he underwent chemotherapy for non-Hodgkinson's lymphoma. Government assurances that the cancer is completely cured have not dampened expectantations that change is imminent. He is to return to the cancer clinic within two months for further tests. Before that time he may call a 'family council\" to decide the question of the succession. In response to an Arabic newspaper claim that he has come under pressure from Washington to put the royal house in order, the king said in a statement: 'No one knows what is in the mind of the al-Hussein until it crystalises into a reality.\" Officials fed the speculatiion that he intends to change his choice of designated heir from his brother the crown prince to his son Hamza, aged 18, who is studying at Sandhurst. 'His majesty, a strong believer with a sense of deep faith in God's will, confronted during those difficult days life and death,' an aide said. 'It naturally rekindled a wish to seek posterity through passing the succession to one of his sons.' In a televised speech shown in Jordan before his return, King Hussein said he was determined to dispel concerns about Jordan's future and promised big changes, but he gave no details. In contrast to his past strong endorsement of Prince Hassan, the speech made only passing reference to him. Hamza is the king's favourite son and has been at his bedside for much of his illness. Queen Noor has encouraged her husband to push their eldest son forward to secure the Hashemite blood line. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and neighbouring Saudi Arabia are the world's only two countries to be named after their ruling families. If the king chooses Hamza in preference to Hassan, who has been his deputy for more than 30 years, it will not be a popular choice. Rami Khouri, a political columnist, believes that the crown prince will become the next monarch, but that King Hussein may seek guarantees that in due course the crown will pass to his son. 'Most Jordanians have known no other ruler. We have a parliament but it lacks credibility,' Mr Khouri said. 'Jordan is oligarchic but not a police state, autocratic but not authoritarian, top heavy but not tyrranical. Its been undergoing a transition for 15 years and most Jordanians feel slow, steady progress is best.' But Laith Shbailat, Jordan's outspoken, self-declared opposition leader, said that only the king has the popularity and strength to establish a fair system of government based upon Britain's constitutional monarchy and he must do it soon or the country will face chaos after his death. 'The country is in a very bad state economically and politically and the people are very angry although they don't show it because they are afraid. I'm afraid that the only pressure he will listen to is people taking to the streets like they have done four times in the last decade,' said Mr Shbailat, who has been imprisoned three times for speaking out. King Hussein's reign has been an oasis of stability in a turbulent region. That it may now soon end causes concern among neighbouring states and western powers. Yesterday, however, Jordanians preferred not to contemplate the future but to celebrate the return of their king. 'It's Eid [the festival marking the end of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan], it's raining and our king is home - what more could we ask?' said Metri, a travel agent, who twirled his umbrella gleefully as King Hussein swept past in a vintage white Mercedes, waving and smiling at his subjects as he poked his head to the vehicle's roof."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/jan/21/lordreform.constitution3","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-21T19:20:35Z","webTitle":"Lords reform: the background","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jan/21/lordreform.constitution3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jan/21/lordreform.constitution3","fields":{"headline":"Lords reform: the background","bodyText":"The Labour Government's White Paper on the reform of the Lords is unremarkable and yet uniquely radical. It is likely to herald the end of constitutionally-enshrined aristocratic government in Britain. How and why did it come about, and why has it been such a long time coming? What is the House of Lords? The House of Lords is the middle third of the ancient triumvirate in British politics: existing to represent the interests of the aristocracy, it comes after the Monarchy and before the Commons. Parliament consists of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Historically, they combined to challenge and check the power of kings. The Lords is now the second legislative chamber, responsible for amending and scrutinising the Commons' activities and the activities of government. It is sometimes known as the Upper House. Who makes up the House of Lords? The House of Lords is made up of a majority of hereditary peers - Lords who inherit their title from their fathers. In 1958, the Life Peerages Act enabled the prime minister to appoint life peers - Lords whose position is for life but not handed down to their heirs. Today, there are almost 800 hereditary peers and slightly more than half that number of life peers. Also seated in the House of Lords are 26 bishops, reflecting the Church of England's role as the official state religion, and 19 Law Lords. What does it do in this day and age? The Lords still perform two important functions in British politics. Firstly, they are part of the legislative process. Most major legislative bills are designed by the Government and are debated in the Commons, but the Lords also debate most legislation and can propose amendments to it or delay it. Secondly, they perform a critical function, scrutinising the work of the Commons and the Government. Why has everyone got it in for the House of Lords? The House of Lords is widely condemned as undemocratic. Political scientist John Kingdom wrote that \"it is one of the most curious of the curious anomalies in British public life, defying all logic of democratic and secular politics\". The House of Lords was created in medieval times, based on the principle that certain people are \"born to rule\" because of their aristocratic lineage. This is fundamentally at odds with a modern representative democracy, where ordinary people are supposed to have a modicum of political input through elected representatives. Here, critics of the Lords tend to split into two camps. On the one hand, those in the Commons tend to argue that it is a travesty of democracy that unelected Lords can block the will of an elected government. This happened recently when the Lords opposed the Government's plans for proportional representation in elections to the European Parliament. There is also an in-built Conservative majority in the Lords because of the traditional bent of the hereditary peers. The Lords have historically been more inclined to block the legislation of a Labour government than a Conservative one. On the other hand, more radical critics of the Lords argue that it is an ineffectual second chamber, lacking the power or authority to properly check the will of the government-dominated Commons. Many commentators suggest there should be a balance of power at the centre of the state and that the old, feeble, and widely discredited Lords provide no balance. Such critics also argue that the 1958 Life Peerages Act hardly diluted the undemocratic character of the Lords because life peers are chosen on the whim of the prime minister. This enhances the PM's disproportionate power in relation to the Lords and encourages the Lords to be a chamber of government loyalists, unlikely to properly scrutinise the government. So what is good about the House of Lords? Apologists for the Lords argue that it is a vital part of the unique and ancient British political system, which remains highly respected around the globe. More convincingly, the Lords are defended on the grounds that their experience, expertise and alternative views provide an invaluable and informed check on the government and the Commons. The House of Lords continues to do good, if unspectacular, work through its committees and debating chamber. It often improves the technical details of legislation that may be rushed through the Commons. And the fear that life peers would create a subservient Lords in debt to the PM's patronage has not been borne out by historical experience. Because most of the Lords are in the twilight of their political careers, they are not dependent on anyone's patronage. This enables them to speak out freely and fearlessly in a way that the Commons, where political parties and the government hold sway, cannot. At times the Lords can seem more in tune with public opinion and good sense than the government. Its recent opposition to student fees is one example. As the highest court in the land, the House of Lords has distinguished itself in recent years as a liberal appeal court (although critics might argue that the Pinochet affair is a less favourable example of judicial (in)decision-making). Why hasn't reform occurred before now? It is a remarkable fact of British politics that the Lords has remained untouched for so long. As long ago as 1871, the respected Victorian constitutional theorist Walter Bagehot declared that the House of Lords' principles of aristocratic leadership were \"utterly dead\". In 1911, the Liberal government led by Lloyd George threatened to abolish the Lords if it continued to block their reformist agenda. The changes that Lloyd George instigated were envisaged as a temporary measure at the time, with an elected chamber expected to soon replace the Lords. That the Lords remained practically untouched (save for the 1958 Life Peerages Act) for the next 88 years is testimony to the reverence of tradition in British political life. It is also testimony to the domination of the Conservative government in post-war politics, which has remained implacably committed to retaining the constitutional status quo. What are the problems with reform? Reform has been slow to arrive also because no obvious solutions present themselves. Reformers potentially have three options: minimal reform, establishing an entirely new upper chamber, or completely abolishing it. But complete abolition would further damage any balance of power at the centre of the British state. It would place too great a burden on the Commons, which many commentators believe lacks the muscle to properly scrutinise government anyway. Labour's preferred option is phasing out hereditary peers' voting rights to create a chamber of nominated (or \"life\") peers. This would enhance Labour's control over the Lords and enable it to ensure a fairer representation of ethnic interests, for example. The chief criticism of this is that it lacks democratic legitimacy, because the Prime Minister will retain the power to appoint life peers and shape the character of a subservient second chamber. The second option is the creation of an entirely new upper chamber. This could either be directly elected by ordinary voters, or indirectly elected from devolved institutions, such as the new Scottish, Welsh and Irish assemblies, local authorities and even the European Parliament. But the problem with this reform is that it may create a second chamber which enjoys greater democratic legitimacy than the much-maligned House of Commons. Few MPs are inclined to vote in favour of creating a chamber which may usurp the democratic functions of the Commons. What is the likely outcome of this White Paper on Lords reform? The Labour Government has tended to favour incremental and moderate alterations to the constitution since its election in 1997. For instance, it has proposed proportional representation for European Parliamentary elections while ignoring appeals for a similar system for the Commons. In the case of the Lords, Labour favours a hybrid system, retaining peers nominated by the Government, but adding some element of indirect election from local and regional assemblies. This is likely to occur in two stages, with the majority of hereditary peers being deprived of their voting and sitting rights, although a Lords amendment may temporarily preserve a small number (thought to be 91). After a Royal Commission investigation and a debate by a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament, the Government says it is committed to making \"every effort\" to instigate a final reform of the House by the next general election, which must occur before 2002."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/jan/22/features2","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-22T01:06:34Z","webTitle":"A joke or the most brilliant film-maker in Europe?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jan/22/features2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/jan/22/features2","fields":{"headline":"A joke or the most brilliant film-maker in Europe?","bodyText":"The phobic film-maker Lars Von Trier made one of his rare public appearances last week. He featured in Channel 4's knobs and knockers series Eurotrash, directing a film naked from the waist down. That, he said, is the best way to prepare actors for sex scenes -- declare a nude day and lead by example. Recently, Von Trier, who is best known for Breaking The Waves and The Kingdom, has made the news with his sex scenes. His new film, The Idiots, famously includes an explicit penetration scene, which makes it illegal for it to be shown uncensored at cinemas in this country. Many people have found the film's subject matter even more offensive than its bristling erections: The Idiots is about a group of educated people who spend their lives pretending they are spastics, \"spassas\", spassing about to find their inner idiot, an unadulterated purity. The Edinburgh film festival dismissed The Idiots as a joke that wasn't worth any sensible audience's two hours. Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard declared it one of the worst five films ever. The Idiots is the first movie Von Trier has made under Dogma 95 rules. Dogma 95 is a group, and a set of principles, he set up to create a new form of honest cinema. All members undertake a vow of chastity -- no artificial lighting; no tacked-on music; no scenes shot out of sequence; all films made with hand-held cameras; directors not credited. Dogma 95 has also been labelled a joke, an old fashioned piss-take for the intelligentsia. Even Von Trier's grandiose name has been called a provocation. He has not helped matters in the past, declaring everything that has been said about his life a fiction and saying that he regards film-making as the ultimate in masturbation, his own pleasure being the sole goal. In Denmark, Von Trier is feted, adored and ridiculed -- the genius as national laughing stock. Yes, Lars, this is all very well, they say, but when are we going to see the real you, the real Lars? And he looks baffled, a bit hurt, and says this is the real me. Maybe Von Trier is destined to be terminally misunderstood. Sure, he can play the buffoon, sure he's a tease, definitely a little bonkers, but he is also the most original and questing film-maker working in Europe today. A far cry from the Von Trier of Eurotrash, dubbed in the classic upper-class twit's voice announcing there's nothing he'd rather make than a porn film. We're on the outskirts of Copenhagen in a disused military barracks stocked with long, brown buildings that look like chocolate bars. This is his new studio. It's silent. In the distance, I see Von Trier disappearing into what could be a cowshed with an alarmingly handsome man. It could be a spoof of a Carry On movie. So I give chase. \"Ah hello, oh yes, this is Thomas,\" he says proudly. Thomas Vinterberg, Von Trier's protege, directed the first Dogma film, Festen -- a movie about family dysfunction that is as funny as it is harrowing. \"It was two o'clock wasn't it?\" says Von Trier, looking at his watch quizzically. It's 1.40, and I've arrived 20 minutes early. \"I'll be 20 minutes. I have to find somewhere for Thomas to live. If you come in here, and eat some of our cake and maybe have a coffee.\" He directs me into another chocolate bar building. Twenty minutes later Von Trier appears, apologises that he needs a pee so we'll be running a little late. He's wearing a T-shirt tucked into his jeans, a shirt tucked into his T-shirt and a cravat tucked into the shirt -- a neatly packaged man. Maybe the cravat is one of those postmodern jokes I've been warned about. We pass his producer's office, crammed with awards from Cannes, Berlin and Venice, and arrive in an office stuffed with shabby family photos. He hauls his legs on to the desk top and tells me that whatever people say, he's proud of The Idiots. \"It's a very serious film. I think it's the best film I've made... though maybe that's not saying much.\" I tell him I love it, and find it extremely moving but haven't a clue why. What does he think the film is about? The seconds tick past, 20, 30, 40, then: \"This doesn't translate very well in a newspaper does it? There is hope ... joy.\" Strange. Many people would say it was the most hopeless, joyless film they have seen, but I know what he means. In the same way that the traumatic Breaking The Waves is also perversely joyful and hopeful. Not in a logical way, not in a way you can begin to explain, just in the tiniest, most tender nuances. On the other hand, Alexander Walker called The Idiots \"a grotesque offence against the human condition\". Who in their right mind would mock people with cerebral palsy and Down's syndrome? Actually, as a child, whenever I went on school trips, we would stick our heads out the back of the bus trying to convince people we were retarded. A friend of mine tells me that at college he and his friends used to nick wheelchairs and waltz into town pretending to be mentally handicapped. When people laughed, they screamed at them for their cruelty. Perhaps we've all done it. Occasionally Von Trier talks in the kind of warm, anecdotal riddles you find in his films. He tells me about a white man who had a black adopted son. \"He called him nigger throughout his childhood, saying you may as well get used to it.\" Why deny the real world? I tell him that at school I used to be called a \"Yiddisher git\" because I was Jewish and \"nigger lips\" because my lips were well-endowed. Von Trier stares at me. His mouth sags; it's almost a look of envy. \"You know, I thought I was Jewish...\" When his Jewish father died seven years ago, his mother told him he wasn't actually his father. In one swoop, he lost his dad and his identity. Shortly afterwards, Von Trier's mother died. \"I had a breakdown,\" he says casually. He never thought finding out about his non-biological father, whom he loved, would bother him but it did. Nor had he, or the family, been religious; it was just the sense of loss. \"What I really liked about being Jewish was being on the losing side. I think many Jews are like that.\" He has a victim mentality? \"Ah yes. Victim is a good word. So I've been to concentration camps being a victim you know, and it kind of changes everything.\" As he talks I can hear a weird kind of hum. It takes a while to realise this is Von Trier's muted self-conscious laughter. A man walks into the office and Von Trier quickly uncrosses his legs and removes them from the table. He apologises, repeatedly, with a big smile. \"Are you circumstanced? Is that the word?\" he asks out of nowhere. \"Ah, circumcised.\" Von Trier's parents were political radicals who used to take him on demos and look on approvingly when he broke US embassy windows. They told him he was his own little man and refused to order him about. If he didn't fancy a trip to the dentist, so be it. Von Trier says he found the freedom cruel and oppressive. The only thing they were dogmatic about was atheism and communism. Meanwhile, he quite fancied the idea of a God. Just imagine, he'd think to himself, how much easier things would be if there was a deity, a force greater than us. The young Von Trier became as confused and anxious as he was precocious. When he wasn't out on his bike with a movie camera practising tracking shots, he was reordering the universe in his head. He points to two objects on the table, and places and replaces them obsessively. \"I believed if this was not put here and this was not put there, then there would be an atomic war tomorrow, and that's a responsibility to have on your shoulders. I had to do these things every day every minute to have responsibility for everyone's lives.\" Was this superstition? \"Yeah, you could say that, but it was more...\" and the humming starts again. \"It was more a Jesus complex ...\" Eventually, at 12, he ran away from school and even his mother suggested something was not quite right. \"I was in a mental hospital. Not for very long.\" How long? \"A couple of weeks. I ran away of course. It wasn't exactly a mental hospital. It was a hospital, it was a kind of day centre.\" He thought he was mad, and he wanted to be. \"It's like wanting to be Jewish, I wanted to be a mong, huh-huh, exactly the same. Oh yes.\" Really? \"It's just that I feel very much related to the outcast.\" His laugh, an apology for his own daftness, melts away into nothingness as he tells me how he grew up, away from communism and into Nietzsche, Bowie and Strindberg. He filled his days with obsessions, acting, directing, and passing exams. Von Trier's early films were fantastically over-elaborate. He says he hates them. Europa and The Element Of Crime would have been better off shown in galleries than cinemas. The critic Pauline Kael said he was great, others renamed him Lars von Trying. They weren't so much movies as a series of hypnotic images -- overlays, underlays, dissolves, more tracking shots, vertiginous, impossible angles, clever-clogs references to the great and good of film, noir movies so noir even the shadows had shadows. He knew how to do everything. Except work with actors. The actors weren't even ciphers, they were little more than anonymous voiceovers. Although the plots confound me in these beautiful, pretentious films, they ultimately seem to be stories about faith. Faith in the most lateral sense. Maybe the belief that you can solve a crime by getting into the head of a criminal, or maybe the belief that no nation can be written off as evil, that after the war Germans needed help rather than punishment. \"My family hated all my films. They thought they were fascistic.\" Why? \"Because they are in a sense. My films celebrate belief, and maybe they were also celebrating it, but atheism was very important to them. It was their religion and everything romantic was bullshit, which is strange because there was a great deal that was romantic in communism. I had an iron helmet with a little Iron Cross, and a fascination with the darker side of man and suffering and violence.\" Von Trier says he was confused when his parents denounced his work. After all, he was just taking their principles to the logical conclusion. \"All my childhood I heard, them excusing murderers because it wasn't their fault. Well, if you can say that about a murderer you can say it about a Nazi. But they were not prepared to do that.\" The only film his remaining family have approved of is The Idiots, because they see it as a return to idealism. Both his parents worked for the social ministry, his mum looking for places to set up institutions for the retarded. The family lived in a wealthy area of Copenhagen, which was also the area most resistant to the institutions. \"The film takes place in this county she hated.\" He looks bashful and apologetic. \"So you could say the film is really me getting very old, adapting suddenly to my parents' point of view.\" This is a very serious paper, he says. Okay, then, let's talk about sex. Why was it so important to have a real gang bang? Did he want to shock? No, he says, he wants us to equate it with the scene in which the actor-retards meet real people with Down's syndrome. Suddenly we realise this is beyond game-playing, beyond film. And our understanding is hijacked. \"At first you think it's a fault, they're not allowed to do that in a film. You stop for a minute, and then maybe the movie becomes bigger because you cannot just relax and say I know exactly what this film will bring. It's like when you put animals or children on the screen, you know if they were funny they were funny in real life. It was nothing they were instructed to do. It's exactly the same with the hard-on. It has to be a reality.\" He looks out of the window, master of all of he surveys. \"Isn't it fantastic? Ten buildings. We have 10 buildings here.\" He tells me about the Morten Koch (Denmark's Barbara Cartland) television series he has made, the difficulties with the film he is making here over the next quarter-century, shooting two minutes every year, and the musical he's planning with Bjoerk. \"We have underground film-makers who come here and use our sets to make splatter films. And another group are making porn films. Every month we're going to have a masterclass which will be free and go out on the Internet. Wouldn't it be great if this became some kind of socialist co-op? I feel quite touched when I hear myself.\" To an extent The Idiots is an attack on bourgeois nimbyism -- of course the mentally handicapped are sweet and lovely, at a distance. But the film goes much deeper. In the end its power lies in something rawer and less tangible: again, it is the desire and need to believe, however crazed the thing you believe in. One by one the commune are exposed as establishment-bound frauds, until we are left with a single working-class woman certain that the discovery of her inner idiot has rescued a tormented life. It's so bizarre, so unlikely, that no wonder many people feel he is winding us up. Yet the quest for faith in any number of guises emerges time and again in his films -- as it does in those of his hero, the Danish director Carl Dreyer. In his black, hysterical hospital soap opera The Kingdom (commonly described as ER meets Twin Peaks) the only people who seem to understand life are two domestics with Down's syndrome. In Breaking The Waves a shred of a girl falls in love with a butter mountain of a man. Again, she is simple-minded, possibly deranged; we are never told. Her love is so intense it becomes a belief system. When her husband is paralysed in an accident he tells her he can only recover if she takes lovers. She becomes a puritan tart, is beaten to death, and he recovers. Again it's beyond ridicuous, but heart breaking in its tenderness. Does he really believe that the simple-minded have a purity of vision, that there is an attainable inner idiot? Is it not just a sentimental alternative to the brilliant fug of his own mind? \"There was a guy called Steiner and he set up a school for people with Down's syndrome. He said they were angels, not in the sense that they were very good, but in the sense that they were sent from God because they were a different breed. I always thought that was a very beautiful idea, and that is how they are used in The Kingdom And The Idiots.\" Yes, but does he believe Steiner's theory? \"You and I, we don't believe in anything, but we'd like to believe in something,\" he says with bewildered, agnostic passion. \"You know it's like people ask, 'Do you believe in ghosts?' and I say I would like to. If a ghost came in here and we could see it we'd be very very relieved because it meant somehow there was meaning to the whole thing. There was something bigger than us. It would be wonderful.\" These films could not be more different from the frigid elegance of his early work. In the nineties he became as driven by performance as he had been by technique. He told actors it didn't matter if they made mistakes, cock-ups were great, sod continuity, so long as the greater truth was there in the looks and glances and silences. The actress Katrin Cartlidge, who starred in Breaking The Waves, says \"It was as if he was undergoing a personal perestroika. He was trying to rebuild himself, very bravely. I think he was moving away from something that had a grip on him, his mania of technology, and somewhere within there was this other Lars who wanted to understand people.\" Von Trier's producer Vibeke Windelov says he'll hate her for saying this, but she thinks Von Trier's films grew up because he grew up. He made Breaking The Waves just after his divorce from his first wife, the mother of two of his four children. \"That changed him. It changed him, for all of us, for the better. It opened him up as a person. I don't think he could have made Breaking The Waves without the divorce. Now he is much happier because he is married to someone who loves him.\" Von Trier agrees. \"How old are you?\" he asks me. \"Have you yet learned that you should surround yourself with people who are nice to you? That was very important for me. Early in my life I tended to be fascinated by people who were not nice, especially women.\" So he's happier these days? He swirls the idea around before reluctantly conceding he is. \"And there are these pills I am taking. Wonderful. What are they called in English?\" Prozac? \"Ah yes. Prozac,\" he shouts with delight. \"Wonderful,\" and he tells me how pleased his wife is because nowadays they can eat in retaurants and stay in hotels without him having a panic attack. Why did he have panic attacks? He says he doesn't know -- yes, it's ludicrous that he could control an army in the name of a decent movie, yet is helpless when left to himself, but what can you do? He tells me even his discipline is obsessive -- it began as a child when he decided he had to finish his homework on the bus home from school. What is his greatest phobia now? \"Would you . . . would you be my analyst?\" I think he's joking. \"Right now? Right now, it's only the cancer I'm thinking of. Maybe 10 hours a day I spend thinking about it when I'm not working, so work takes my mind off it.\" Jeezus! I had no idea. \"Oh no. I don't have cancer. I just spend 10 hours a day thinking about it.\" The National Film Theatre is celebrating the work of Lars Von Trier in a season that runs throughout February. The Idiots is released later this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1999/jan/23/5","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-23T02:19:05Z","webTitle":"Hussein tells brother he can't take throne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/23/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jan/23/5","fields":{"headline":"Hussein tells brother he can't take throne","bodyText":"King Hussein of Jordan yesterday told his brother, Prince Hassan, he was removing him as heir to the throne in a move aimed at retaining the crown for Hussein's sons, sources close to the king said. King Hussein, 63, told Prince Hassan through aides that he will appoint him as his deputy, a new post which appears to entail limited authority, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear whether King Hussein was ready to announce a new successor to the throne of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which he inherited from his father Talal in 1953 at the age of 17. The change, which comes three days after King Hussein's return from cancer treatment abroad, is expected to be announced soon, the sources said. Prince Hassan, 51, was named crown prince to succeed the king in 1965. Other sources said the strongest candidate to become crown prince is King Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah, provided that the future king would appoint his brother Hamza as his heir. Abdullah, 36, is King Hussein's son from his second marriage, to the British woman Toni Gardiner, who adopted the name Mona when she converted to Islam upon her marriage to Hussein in 1960. Hamza, 18, is King Hussein's son from his fourth marriage, to American-born Queen Noor, the former Elizabeth Halaby. King Hussein appears to be worried that if Prince Hassan succeeds him, it would be Hassan's sons who would be in line for the throne. The constitution stipulates that King Hussein's successor is his eldest son. The king has recently hinted that when he appointed Prince Hassan, he had no other choice at the time because his children were young. Prince Hassan's new post will be like that of the vice-president in the United States, but his authority will remain limited. It will not extend to declaring war, signing treaties and dismissing the government and Parliament. His term would end once the king abdicates, sources added. King Hussein hinted that he would replace Prince Hassan in a statement to his countrymen last Sunday, two days before his return from six months of treatment for cancer in the US. He clarified his intention further on Wednesday. Although King Hussein refused to confirm reports that he would replace Prince Hassan, he did not give his usual endorsement of his brother, raising speculation that a change was imminent. Officials have said Hussein has been cured following six rounds of chemotherapy and a marrow cell transplant for non-Hodgkins lymphoma."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jan/26/5","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-26T04:17:10Z","webTitle":"Soldier son to rule Jordan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/26/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jan/26/5","fields":{"headline":"Soldier son to rule Jordan","bodyText":"Jordan's King Hussein has designated his eldest son, Prince Abdullah, as his successor. The move comes after the king stunned many senior officials last week by removing his younger brother, Hassan, as crown prince after 33 years. The Hashemite monarch yesterday signed a decree naming Abdullah - who turns 37 on January 30 - as his new crown prince and discharging Hassan, aged 51, from the post. In Amman, royal sources were reported to be circulating claims that the switch was prompted by the king's disappointment in his brother's handling of Jordan's affairs during his six-month absence for cancer treatment in the United States. According to this version, King Hussein was also annoyed that Hassan had appeared to assume that the monarch would not be returning to the throne he has held for 46 years. But pro-Hassan figures in the kingdom suggested last night that these stories were being put about to discredit the erstwhile crown prince, so as to make more palatable the king's dynastic preference for one of his own offspring. \"There has been pressure on the king from certain establishment figures who stand to lose from a change in the status quo,\" said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hassan, Oxford educated and regarded as remote from Jordan's traditionalist bedouin subjects, is said by his admirers to have 'clean hands' in a country whose grave economic problems are being compounded by official corruption and whose severe water shortage is being neglected, according to critics of the king. King Hussein's priority now, in whatever time remains to him, will be to try to make the transition to his son as secure as possible: Jordan's ruler says he is fully cured of cancer, but must return to the US in March for more tests. The assumption among Jordanians, however, is that he believes he is living on borrowed time and is anxious to clinch the country's future and his family's grip before he dies. Abdullah is a popular figure, combining charisma and simplicity much like his father, according to his close aides. He has made his career in the army and has commanded Jordan's special forces since 1993. It seems reasonable to believe, therefore, that he commands the army's loyalty. He also benefits from being married to a Palestinian - the majority group in the kingdom. Abdullah studied and trained at Sandhurst, like his father; he also spent time at Oxford, the Fort Knox Cavalry School in the US and Georgetown University in Washington. His appointment is expected to be accepted with equanimity in Washington and at home. Reports were already circulating yesterday in Amman that Hassan may leave to live abroad. The greatest fear among the Hassan camp is that Abdullah may not demonstrate the commitment to constitutional and economic reform they assumed was on the way. At worst, Abdullah is an unknown quantity, but it may be years rather than months before the era of King Hussein finally ends. He has survived assassination bids and cancer treatment before. Nevertheless, some Jordanians feel that deposing Hassan was uncalled for. \"A lot has been invested in Prince Hassan in the last 34 years,\" said Labib Kamhawi, a political analyst. \"People feel that to brush him aside, just like that, is unnecessary.\" The king's greatest gift to Jordanians has been the relative stability which his rule has brought a country artificially created by Winston Churchill after the first world war to reward the Hashemites for their loyalty to the British empire. For decades, predatory neighbours have weighed the chances of carving up the desert kingdom among themselves, a fear likely to haunt Jordanians in the transition period. Israel is particularly concerned about the change in a country that in recent years has proved a sort of passive ally, acting as a buffer between it and hardline Arab regimes such as Iraq and Syria. King Hussein had believed that the Oslo peace process would create a new Middle Eastern order but has despaired at the frittering away of the opportunity by Binyamin Netanyahu's rightwing government in Israel. He fears that he will not live long enough to see the early hopes restored. Yediot Aharonot, Israel's authoritative mass-circulation daily paper, reported yesterday that the king's court told Tel Aviv not to interfere in his choice of successor. \"The sources indicated that [Israeli] messages and 'lobbying attempts' - in which the incumbent Crown Prince Hassan was presented as a 'stability factor' - had reached Amman,\" the paper said. \"Prince Hassan is a very positive figure as far as Israel is concerned,\" one senior defence source was quoted as saying. Hassan was made crown prince in 1965. He replaced Abdullah - the son of Hussein's British second wife, Toni Gardiner - who had been designated successor in 1963 when only one year old. Hussein amended the constitution in Hassan's favour at a time he feared for his own life.

The software group yesterday announced it was buying a 5 per cent stake in NTL for $500 million (£303 million) with an option to increase it to 6.2 per cent for a further $100 million. Microsoft, which bought a strategic $1 billion stake in the US cable company Comcast a couple of years ago, is determined to develop the skills and software to bring the Internet and email to the consumer via the television set. It believes that television access is one of the fastest ways to expand Internet usage and that cable networks are the ideal vehicle since they have the capacity for carrying the high-speed data needed for video and sound. At the heart of the deal, which was announced yesterday, is a combination of NTL's expertise in handling television signals and Microsoft's software skills. NTL's broadcast services division, originally the Independent Broadcasting Authority's engineering arm, operates a national network offering digital and analogue broadcast transmission services to major television and radio stations throughout the United Kingdom. It also owns cable television interests in the UK, operating under the CableTel name, and a national fibre-optic network capable of handling telephony and Internet traffic. An NTL spokesman said the group would benefit from Microsoft's online expertise and its Microsoft Network online service. Microsoft and NTL said they planned to develop new broadband services for customers in the UK and Ireland jointly. The two companies said the $500 million investment in NTL would 'accelerate deployment of high-speed voice, video and data services over its national fibre-optic telecommunications networks and continue the company's rapid introduction of advanced Internet, telephone and cable television services over its broadband facilities'. They plan to set up a technology group to guide the development of new digital services, and to enter into further agreements on software and services 'as opportunities arise throughout 1999'. NTL, which is based in Farnborough, Hampshire, but listed on the US Nasdaq market, is planning to seek a UK listing later this year. Judy Gibbons, director of Microsoft Network in the UK, said cable companies were in a unique position to deliver digital broadband services to the home, either to the personal computer or the television via a set-top box. She said Microsoft would benefit from early trials of innovative services NTL is planning to launch its own digital cable television service later this year. NTL shares rose $12 to $793.4 in early afternoon trading. Dixons, the electrical retailer, has been restructured and in the process created a separate company for Freeserve, its extremely successful Internet service provider. In the past three years Dixons has increased sales by two thirds and taken on 6,000 new staff. John Clare, chief executive, said the decision to create three business units around Currys, PC World and Dixons would allow the group to cope with growth without becoming top heavy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jan/26/3","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-26T09:02:24Z","webTitle":"Soldier son to rule Jordan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/26/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jan/26/3","fields":{"headline":"Soldier son to rule Jordan","bodyText":"Jordan's King Hussein has designated his eldest son, Prince Abdullah, as his successor.

That is, how long before the second largest country in the Union takes on the biggest city in Europe? By May 2000, Britain will have three new powerful regional leaders: one for five million Scots, one for seven million Londoners and a third for the three million Welsh. Perhaps the most obvious way of appealing to all Scots, or all Londoners, will be to make the case that other parts of the country are stealing \"their\" resources. Thus, the Scottish PM and London's mayor will almost certainly argue about money. London will want to repatriate part of the huge difference between what Londoners pay in taxes and the (smaller) amount of public money spent in the capital. The Scots will argue that London, in common with the rest of the English and Welsh, are living off Scotland's oil revenues. Such a debate between different regions will be just the start of a wider set of political wrangles about the use of power and resources in different parts of the country. After all, the Blair government's democratic reforms go well beyond the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the mayor of London. Scotland versus London would, in fact, be a contest between a country (or region) and a city. We should expect many more such battles. Within the regions, cities will make political demands that their regions will not be willing or able to meet. Predominantly rural regional interests will meet urban city concerns head on. What matters now is the speed with which Britain moves to new forms of regional and city government. Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are to start operating throughout England this year, overseen by regional \"chambers\" of councillors. RDAs and regional chambers are forerunners of possible elected governments for the English regions. A second-term Labour Parliament would come under enormous pressure for legislation to allow regions to opt for their own government. England's northern regions would be first to demand their freedom. Local government reforms to be outlined in a draft bill later this spring will encourage councils - among other possibilities - to adopt directly-elected mayors. Such mayors would mean far more power for city government. The current London mayoral contest attracts more attention than anything else in local government, but attitudes to elected mayors vary. Many Labour and Liberal Democrat activists are, to put it mildly, unenthusiastic. But a number of individual leaders and cities have conspicuously failed to rule out a move to a directly-elected first citizen. Glasgow's council leader, Frank McAveety, strongly supports the idea of a directly-elected provost for the city. Lewisham, in south London, is committed to a directly-elected mayor for the borough. Liverpool is almost certainly going further than any other major British city in adding democracy to the process of modernisation - by setting up a commission to consider a full range of options, including an elected mayor. Under future legislation for England and Wales, the public are to be given the possibility of triggering a local referendum on the creation of a mayor for their town or city. Beyond any early moves to mayoral government, there is also the domino theory. If, say, Leeds decided to go for an elected mayor, could Birmingham really resist? If Birmingham had a mayor, then surely Manchester would follow. The prominence given to directly-elected mayors would be immense. If Liverpool, Manchester or Birmingham had a directly-elected mayor, the individual concerned would be likely to have the same level of national and international prominence as the mayor of Barcelona or of Chicago. So, within a few years, regional governments in Scotland, Wales and possibly parts of England will face powerful local mayors, almost certainly with headquarters in the same city. In Barcelona, which in recent years has often been cited as a symbol of good government, the city and regional governments glower at each other across a small square. The region, Catalonia, seeks to become more powerful at the expense of Barcelona's city administration. Barcelona looks to the constitution in Madrid for protection. Later this year, Glasgow will face a Scottish parliament in Edinburgh, but without the comfort of constitutional protection in London. The United Kingdom, after all, does not have a written constitution. So if the Edinburgh parliament decides to take powers (or money) from Glasgow, there will be no constitutional court of appeal. No wonder Frank McAveety, as its current leader, wants to ensure that Glasgow has a powerful voice in the new Scottish politics. Similar battles between cities and regions can be predicted in England. If the North-west were to move forward to a regional assembly (inevitably based in Manchester), a Liverpool mayor would become a large and painful thorn in the side of the region. Even where the city and region have their headquarters in the same centre, it is easy to imagine major battles between, say, urban Bristol and the rural South-west. Imagine the collective power wielded by the mayors of London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Glasgow. A joint lobby by these and other city mayors would have immense clout with ministers and the UK Parliament. Like them or not, directly-elected mayors have considerable legitimacy and, where they exist, are widely accepted as personalising the civic spirit of a town or city. This legitimacy would be used as a weapon against regional governments. Thus a whole range of issues would provide fuel for disputes between regions and their cities. Rural versus urban concerns are the most obvious: the needs for decent urban public transport in Manchester would be pitted against the paucity of rural buses in Lancashire. Cities such as Liverpool, Glasgow, Sheffield and Plymouth would lobby hard against the regional government's perceived bias towards Manchester, Edinburgh, Leeds and Bristol. Where should the new Tate Gallery go, or World Cup matches be played? Should lottery cash be concentrated on a grand project for a city and its mayor, or would the cash be better spent on village halls throughout the region? When Scotland and London start - as they surely will - to slug it out about who should get more money, the fight will be a leading indicator of city versus region struggles to come.

There were fears that the illness had reasserted itself. On his homecoming exactly a week ago yesterday the 63-year-old king said he was totally cured. He took part in a tumultuous open-air cavalcade through the streets of Amman in celebration. The hours before his departure yesterday were heavy with intrigue and rancour in the Hashemite court. Overnight a bitter letter from the king dismissing his brother Hassan, after 34 years as crown prince and effective heir, was published and broadcast on television. It accused Prince Hassan of acting to 'fragmentise and politicise' the army and smearing Queen Noor and their children. The king's eldest son, Abdullah, was invested crown prince at a hasty ceremony at the palace and then, at a separate airport ceremony, was made regent while the king is away. After years of stability, it has truly been a palace revolution. Trying to reconcile the king's sudden return to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota with his homecoming declaration that he was cured, official versions of the past week's events sought to pin the relapse on last Tuesday's cavalcade, when King Hussein spent nearly an hour in cold driving rain waving to the crowds through the sunroof of a vintage Mercedes car. The official Petra news agency said the king's symptoms became evident that day. A palace statement referred to the cavalcade and the king also referred to it in a television interview, saying: 'It was so cold and I did not have adequate clothing.' He had 'low blood counts and fever', his physician said, adding: 'I, as well as doctors from the Mayo Clinic, thought it is best to send him back to the clinic for check-ups and treatment.' King Hussein acted quickly on getting home after six months in the United States to set his brother aside and install as crown prince his own eldest son, Abdullah - born to his English second wife, Toni Gardiner, who took the title Princess Muna. Prince Hassan attended yesterday's palace and airport ceremonies, but sources said that he had taken his unseating badly and looked unhappy. Security sources in the kingdom said the change in the brothers' relationship occurred last year, when King Hussein lapsed into a coma during the fourth of six sessions of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 'Hassan was going round telling everyone: 'He's dying, he's dying, he's not coming back', and started trying to sack some officers loyal to the king and put his own people in their places,' said the source. 'He was preparing to take over.' Supporters of Prince Hassan, on the other hand, say that such accusations are an attempt to blacken his name to justify the king's peremptory switch to his own son. During the king's six months at the American clinic a range of figures tried to get his ear in the hopes of influencing him with news or rumours that could secure their own position. King Hussein was accompanied back to Minnesota yesterday by his American-born queen, Noor, whose position looks more vulnerable now that the succession has gone to someone other than her eldest son, Hamza, who is said to be the king's favourite child. The queen and Prince Hamza were in steady attendance during the king's previous stay at the clinic. Yesterday Jordan television showed the king leaning on a stick and looking flushed - a far cry from the ebullient performance of a week earlier. In his letter to Prince Hassan, the king accused his brother's supporters of a smear campaign against Queen Noor and their children. 'Oh how much envy has Hamza been subjected to as a result of his closeness to me,' he wrote. He accused Prince Hassan and 'greedy' advisers of trying to force Hussein loyalists out of the army, including an attempt to sack the head of the armed forces, Field Marshal Abdul-Hafez Murei' Kaabneh. Responding, Prince Hassan pledged allegiance to the king. 'I put myself in your hands and abide by your honorable order,' his own letter said. An insider said that the prince was now 'taking a break' and would probably retreat to his post as head of the Royal Scientific Centre. 'His character is that he has always obeyed his brother.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jan/27/davidbrindle","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-27T03:25:33Z","webTitle":"Ashworth scandal nurse gets new job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/27/davidbrindle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jan/27/davidbrindle","fields":{"headline":"Ashworth scandal nurse gets new job","bodyText":"The statutory body for nursing awarded a prestige research contract to the chief nurse at top-security Ashworth hospital while his role in the Merseyside hospital's security scandal was under investigation, it has emerged. Colin Dale led work on the £30,000 contract - intended to set standards of excellence for nursing in secure settings - while on extended sick leave, the Guardian has established. Mr Dale, Ashworth's executive nurse director, was strongly criticised in this month's inquiry report, which followed revelations about pornography, drugs and regular contact between paedophile patients and a girl. The inquiry team said it would have called on him to consider his position, had he not already left his post. In fact, Mr Dale remains on the hospital payroll until the end of this month, when he will take early retirement from his £50,000-a-year job on grounds of ill health. Ashworth is declining to disclose details of his retirement package. On usual terms, however, he would receive a £25,000 pension and a tax-free lump sum of £75,000. Mr Dale's involvement in the research for the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) has caused consternation among nursing academics, especially as he is not known for his research record. Eleven bids were received for the contract, which was put out to tender. Four shortlisted bidders were interviewed last May, seven months after the Ashworth inquiry began taking evidence, and the contract was awarded to the University of Central Lancashire. Mr Dale was named co-leader of the university's bid and his name alone was subsequently published by the UKCC as the contact point for the project. One of the rejected bids came from a consortium of leading researchers offering £70,000 additional funding for the work. It is believed that at least £30,000 of this would have come from the Government's High Security Psychiatric Services Commissioning Board, which chose not to extend the same offer to Mr Dale's team. The research project, which is due to report in the autumn, represents the first official attempt to set standards for nursing in more than 60 secure units and 150 prisons. In its invitation to tender, the UKCC said key issues included addressing problems of working in \"closed\" settings and the complexity of relations with patients. The Ashworth inquiry team said Mr Dale had to bear the burden of its criticisms of security at the hospital, for which he carried lead responsibility. Describing him as a member of a \"dysfunctional senior management team\", the inquiry report said: \"He was not the right man for such a multi-faceted job. He would have been better focused on providing nursing leadership and developing nursing practice.\" Stuart Skyte, UKCC communications director, said the research contract had been awarded by a three-strong panel of officers according to established criteria. Mr Dale had been only one of a team associated with the successful bid. \"He stepped down voluntarily on the day the inquiry report came out to avoid causing any embarrassment for us.\" Alan Roff, deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Central Lancashire, said Mr Dale had never been employed by the university. \"It's true that he has been collaborating on this UKCC-funded research project and I have no reason to believe that his work has been anything other than successful.\" Angela Anderson, Ashworth's communications director, said the terms of Mr Dale's ill-health retirement were \"between him and the NHS pensions agency\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jan/27/12","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-27T09:21:01Z","webTitle":"King flies out of intrigue into clinic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/27/12","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jan/27/12","fields":{"headline":"King flies out of intrigue into clinic","bodyText":"King Hussein of Jordan was on his way back to an American clinic last night, a week after returning to his kingdom after lengthy treatment for lymphatic cancer.

Republican - A supporter of a united Irish Republic, incorporating Northern Ireland. Unionist - A supporter of Northern Ireland's political union with Britain. Parties and paramilitary groups Alliance Party Led by Sean Neeson, this is the only non-sectarian party in Northern Ireland (apart from the Women's Coalition) and attracts support from both Catholics and Protestants. The Alliance works for a compromise between the two communities and a continuing British presence in Northern Ireland. It has six seats in the Northern Irish Assembly, representing a 5.5 per cent share of the vote. CRF - Catholic Reaction Force A cover-name used by the INLA and the IPLO (see below). Continuity IRA/CIRA A splinter group which emerged in 1996 after the \"official\" IRA's ceasefire, and is believed to incorporate former members of several republican paramilitary groups. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) The right-wing Democratic Unionists believe that Northern Ireland should be an integral part of the United Kingdom, and have vehemently opposed the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn Fein's participation in peace talks. Led by the Reverend Ian Paisley, they hold 20 seats in the new Northern Ireland Assembly - just over 18 per cent. E4A The special intelligence unit of the RUC (see below), believed to have been responsible for several \"shoot-to-kill\" incidents in Northern Ireland during the 1980s. Fianna Fail The centrist Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) is the more republican of the two main Irish political parties. Founded in 1926 by Eamon de Valera, it is currently led by the Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. Fine Gael The second largest political party in Ireland, led by John Bruton. Gardai The Irish police force. INLA - Irish National Liberation Army Initially known as the People's Liberation Army after its formation in 1975, the INLA is a republican paramilitary group responsible for about 125 killings. It has suffered from a great deal of internal feuding, and announced a ceasefire in the summer of 1998. Its publicity statements can be found at the IRSP's website. IPLO - Irish People's Liberation Organisation A group that broke away from the INLA (see above) and was subsequently involved in the dispute between the Army Council and Belfast Brigade, both of which disbanded in 1992. IRA - Irish Republican Army The chief Republican paramilitary group, with links to Sinn Fein and sharing its desire to unite Ireland. While the IRA is holding to a ceasefire, the Continuity or Real IRA splinter group remains nominally active. History: The IRA's 1999 New Year message IRSP - Irish Republican Socialist Party The IRSP supports the INLA ceasefire, but opposes the Good Friday Agreement. Founded in 1974 by Seamus Costello, it seeks an all-Ireland socialist republic and the release of IRSP prisoners. Labour Party of Northern Ireland A left-wing Northern Irish party, conceived in 1996 as an alternative to the unionist and nationalist parties. It failed to win any seats in the 1998 Assembly elections. Labour Party of Ireland Left-wing Irish party, led by Ruairi Quinn, which has formed coalition governments with both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. LVF - Loyalist Volunteer Force A Protestant paramilitary group, formed in 1996, primarily made up of ex-Ulster Volunteer Force members. The original Leader, Billy Wright, was killed by a member of the INLA in the Maze prison in December 1997. A number of LVF killings ensued. Na Fianna Republican youth movement, affiliated to Sinn Fein. Official IRA The OIRA was formed by members of the original IRA, which split in 1970. It has carried out very few attacks since a ceasefire in 1972, although in the mid-1970s a feud with the IRSP developed. Orange Order The largest of the Loyalist orders, with between 80-10,000 members, the Orange Order holds numerous parades in Northern Ireland celebrating the British presence in Northern Ireland. These occasionally lead to violence, notably at Drumcree. Parades Commission A committee formed early in 1997 to try to mediate between loyalist marching organisations and the Catholic residents of the areas they pass through. People's Democracy A civil rights organisation which participated in elections until 1982. The PD was formed by students from Queens' University in Belfast to protest against alleged police brutality in 1968, and later clashed with Ian Paisley's loyalist demonstrators. PAF - Protestant Action Force A cover name for the loyalist UVF. Provisionals/Provos Another name for the IRA, which split into two factions - the Provisional IRA and the Official IRA. PUP - Progressive Unionist Party The left-wing PUP, with two seats in the new Assembly, generally supports the Good Friday Agreement , believing that it will effectively lead to greater autonomy from the Republic. However, it remains staunchly unionist and has close links with the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Red Hand Commandos and the Combined Loyalist Military Command, now banned. Red Hand Commandos A loyalist paramilitary group which was officially outlawed in 1973. It is associated with the UVF and forms part of the Combined Loyalist Military Command, which declared a ceasefire in 1994. RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) The RUC gradually took over the British Army's duties in policing Northern Ireland. Over 300 of its members (who are predominantly Protestant) have been killed during the Troubles, and approximately 50 people have been killed by the RUC. Sinn Fein The republican Sinn Fein, led by Gerry Adams, advocates a united Ireland free from British rule. It has links with the IRA. The party supports the Good Friday Agreement, and polled just over 16 per cent of the vote in the Assembly elections. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Led by John Hume, the SDLP wants to achieve the reunification of Ireland through democratic means. It has talked with Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, but always refused to enter into any form of alliance with the party. The SDLP is now the second largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, with 24 seats. UDA - Ulster Defence Association Also known as the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the UDA is the largest Loyalist paramilitary group and has been active during the 1990s. It forms part of the Combined Loyalist Military Command, which declared a ceasefire in October 1994. UDP - Ulster Democratic Party Led by the 26-year-old Gary McMichael, the UDP supports the Good Friday Agreement and endorses a progressive brand of unionism, in which Northern Ireland would remain part of Britain but with a devolved legislative parliament. UDR - Ulster Defence Regiment A regiment of the British Army in Northern Ireland that came into existence in 1972. Almost exclusively Protestant, the regiment was accused of having links with Loyalist terrorists, and eventually merged with the Royal Irish Rangers in 1992. UFF - Ulster Freedom Fighters A cover name for the Ulster Defence Association. United Kingdom Unionist Party A unionist party led by Robert McCartney, who broke away from the Ulster Unionist Party last year. Like the DUP, it did not participate in the Stormont talks. The UKUP won five seats (4.5 per cent) in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in 1998. UUP - Ulster Unionist Party The UUP is led by David Trimble and holds around a quarter of the seats in the new Assembly, making it the largest party. It has close links with the Orange Order, and has always opposed a united Ireland. Trimble did sign the Good Friday Agreement, but tried to exclude Sinn Fein from the talks at Stormont. Ulster Volunteer Force A loyalist paramilitary group which has been responsible for many sectarian killings. It forms part of the Combined Loyalist Military Command, which declared a ceasefire in October 1994. UVF statements can be found on the Progressive Unionist Party's website. Women's Coalition Holds two seats in the new Assembly. The Coalition promotes issues of particular concern to Northern Irish women, is non-sectarian and supports the Good Friday Agreement.

His bio-medical work probed the working of the brain at the microscopic and psychological levels, but he was equally at ease as an art historian. His studies in Egyptology challenged much of the mysticism surrounding the pharaohs and pyramids with a more rational interpretation of the mathematical system behind the architectural, engineering and economic achievements from the Old Kingdom onwards. His father was Cameron Deane Shute his parents separated when he was two while his mother, the writer Amy Pepper Staveley, caused a stir 70 years ago with The Unconscious Bigamist. She married six times. Educated at Eton, Charles excelled in classics and mathematics before going to King's College, Cambridge, to read English and moral philosophy. He then switched to medicine, and his qualification in 1946 was followed by two years in residential surgical posts at the Middlesex Hospital, London. When national service intervened, he was assigned to a Royal Army Medical Corps unit specialising in ear, nose and throat treatment. In 1951 Shute joined the teaching staff of the London Hospital Medical College as demonstrator and lecturer in anatomy. There, he worked with one of the giants of medical science, the anatomist Dixon Boyd, who was preparing for a move to Cambridge. Shute was invited to join him, and was appointed university demonstrator and lecturer in 1952, a post he held until 1969. His career was to have four distinct chapters, but also a unifying thread. The first two depended on his brilliance in devising new techniques in histology, the study of the tiniest structures of tissues. His early work compared the differences in the detailed structures of the jaw and the ear between humans and other animals, and their nervous systems. In the second phase, from 1960, he turned his attention to studying the brain, and in 15 years of extraordinarily fruitful collaboration with Peter Lewis, a histo-chemist, they embarked on a rewriting of the text books that others have continued. They began with the idea of studying the brain as a chemical organ, an approach that ran counter to the then prevailing view of the brain as being driven by nerve impulses. Shute and Lewis published more than a score of key papers identifying the pathways by which the brain's neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers, were relayed through the central nervous system. Neuroscientists know now that dozens of neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors, and other agents shuttle constantly across this vast communications network of hundreds of billions of brain cells, any one of which can have thousands of connections with other neurons. The hope is to find faults in this complex signaling system to account for disorders like autism, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Thirty years ago the only chemicals suspected of influencing brain activity were adrenaline and a substance called acetycholine. Shute and Lewis devised an ingenious method now a routine technique for preparing thin sections of rat brains to map the pathways that acetylcholine took in transmitting signals from neuron to neuron between different regions of the brain particularly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and other areas. In the mid-1970s, acetylcholine became the focus of hundreds of studies after scientists discovered that the neurotransmitter was critical to the process of forming memories. Shute extended his area of research into neuropsychology, and a phenomenon involving colour vision called the McCollough Effect. This had been first described in 1965 to a chorus of disbelief, but Shute devised a practical device to demonstrate its existence. The phenomenon affects people in different degrees, and is relevant today to the design of colour television and video screens to reduce eye discomfort and fatigue. The test involves looking at several brightly coloured striped images. After a while, the viewer starts seeing colours that are not really there: moreover the colours can change. There is even a version for people to check their colour vision on the Internet. Shute's fourth chapter of research, in Egyptology, took him full circle to his humanities studies at Cambridge. He applied his knowledge of both mathematics and anatomy in studying the slope of pyramids and the physical proportions of images and statues. His major work came with The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus: An Ancient Egyptian Text, co-authored with Gay Robins. In contesting mystical ideas that the dimensions of the pyramids held some mysterious codes to the secrets of the universe, Shute used the evidence on papyrus to show that the mathematics of ancient Egypt were based on a rational decimal system. Although simple and always non-theoretical in form, this system was a major contributor to the success of Egypt's elaborate architectural, engineering, and economic activities from the Old Kingdom onward. The papyrus, written in hieratic, the cursive form of hieroglyphics, is a single roll that was originally about 5.4 metres long by 32 centimetres wide, and was found in Thebes and attributed to the scribe Ahmose during the 15th dynasty reign of the Hyksos Pharaoh, Apepi I. Charles Shute was professor of histology at Cambridge between 1969 and 1984, and a fellow of Christ's College. He is survived by his third wife, Gay Robins, professor of art history at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia; and by a son and three daughters from his second marriage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jan/29/4","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-29T16:29:11Z","webTitle":"Ironsides in the nation's soul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/29/4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jan/29/4","fields":{"headline":"Ironsides in the nation's soul","bodyText":"When the restored monarch 'came into his own again' his followers wreaked vengeance on the readiest symbol of that extraordinary man who had risen by sheer force of self-belief to rule England, ravage Ireland and repress Scotland. The royalists disinterred Cromwell's body, dismembered it and set his head on a pole outside Westminster Hall, where it remained a curiosity to passers-by (Samuel Pepys tells us) for many years. The new king, Charles II, was wiser than his father, he died in his bed in his palace. Charles I had mounted the scaffold on that January day in 1649, condemned to death by a parliamentary commission cowed by Cromwell's 'vehement importunity'. His address outside the banqueting hall in Whitehall - now a fixture on the London tourist run - barely carried beyond the serried ranks Cromwell and his generals had made into a fighting force of a quality England had never seen before. (Some historians say the very point of Cromwell was to effect military modernisation, a central problem in the reign of Charles I having been England's martial inadequacies(1).) The king's words passed to posterity, explaining both the necessity and the incompleteness of the revolution which had overthrown him. As a contemporary record put it 'he did not believe the happiness of the people lay in sharing government, subject and sovereign being clean different. And if he should have given way to an arbitrary government, and to have all laws changed according to the sword, he needed not to have suffered, and so said he was a martyr for the people'(2). Those two principles emerge clear from the welter of events from the 1630s through to the Glorious Revolution in 1688 when the martyr's other son, James II, poisoned by exile and religious dogmatism, was chased to Portsmouth and exile. The happiness of the English people (and, later, the Scots and Welsh though not the Irish) did permanently lie in sharing government with executive authority. The amount of power retained by the monarchy within the system remained subject to dispute - revisionist historians tell us the Georges in the 18th century were more involved in running the country than we used to think and George VI's biographer, Robert Rhodes James, has recently chronicled his attempts to butt in during the 1940s. But the principle of power sharing was established, first within a landowner dominated cabal then more broadly with a parliament claiming to represent the property-owning nation (The name of that nation is a problem. 'Britain' was created during the 18th century, Linda Colley has argued, and may now be crumbling.) Power sharing through universal suffrage had to wait until 1948. The king's second principle, of opposition to 'arbitrary government', has also permanently lodged in the myths and sentiments of the inhabitants of the British Isles and their descendants. We know (thank you Lord Hoffmann) that the decisions of judges in courts can be arbitrary, but since the Civil War there has grown up a great faith in due process and procedure. Carried across the Atlantic the principle is being demonstrated this week in those peculiar and hollow but also impressively grave proceedings in the Senate of the United States. Here in Britain it is displayed, perhaps to excess, in the way we conduct the public business: it's OK for Jack Cunningham to ride on Concorde as long as he takes the trouble to run the trip past his permanent secretary (answerable according to procedure as accounting officer) as the unwritten rules say he should. The rules do remain unwritten. A problem Oliver Cromwell encountered when he assumed the mantle of Protector while still seeking to govern through a representative parliament was the lack of a settled constitution. His problem remains ours: at the heart of the Blair programme is a promise that things - relationships, rights, responsibilities - will have to be written down, so we all know just what the rules are. Yet it's thanks to the Stuarts and Oliver Cromwell that the English, Scots and Welsh developed (the Irish were not allowed to) an aversion to the arbitrariness represented by armed troops riding through the streets. It's the reason why the 'massacre' of Peterloo in 1819 became a Victorian radical's touchstone and why military deployment against strikers at Tonypandy before the first world war still rings somewhere in the popular consciousness. British martial spirit is highly valued as long as it is exercised abroad or confined to barracks. This season's anniversaries (it's also 400 years since the birth of Cromwell) have atttracted extra attention for two reasons. One is devolution and the focus it brings to the peculiar make-up of the United Kingdom. Some right wing commentators have ingeniously tried to blame him for the fact the Scots voted in Tony Blair's referendum for a measure of self-government, forgetting that it was the revolt of some Scots against Charles I which lit one of the powder trails to the Civil War. It's a selective memory, too, which remembers Cromwell's military campaign in Ireland, the massacre at Drogheda and all that, but fails to see the lines of continuity in English policy towards Ireland which, before Cromwell, had sent Charles I's favourite Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford across the Irish Sea to 'pacify' - one of his most successful officers was William Rainsborough, kinsman of Thomas, Tony Benn's great exemplar, the Cromwellian colonel who sided with the 17th century's proto-communist Levellers to declare that 'the poorest he in England hath a life to live as the greatest he'. Why Cromwell remains such a fascinating figure is that it is very difficult to skewer him on any contemporary left-right spectrum. God's Englishman he was but hard for would-be English nationalists to stomach because he was a regicide. He killed the king in the people's name and that should endear him to the left (as it usually did in the Victorian era when Cromwell was a significant reference point in politics). But Cromwell had left his home in Huntingdon to raise a troop of horse-soldiers partly in defence of private property, threatened by King Charles's despotic powers of taxation and confiscation - a good right wing cause. Of course Cromwell is now deeply strange for us. Britain may still vestigially be protestant. The rising against the Stuarts produced an act of succession to the crown which still excludes Roman Catholics; Prince Charles would not last night have been stepping out with Camilla if she acknowledged the Pope. But we are now light years away from the world of Christian faith in which Cromwell could say: 'One beam in a dark place hath exceeding much refreshment in it. Blessed he His name for shining upon so dark a heart as mine'(3). And yet there is still strong contemporary resonance in the continuous constitutional debate of those years in the middle of the 17th century. The other reason for attending to the anniversaries is that we, too, are in the throes of changing the way we are governed. New Labour's programme of modernisation (a word unknown in the 17th century when the talk was much more of cleaving to ancient models) embraces the House of Lords, methods of election, the institutionalisation of human rights, devolution and, potentially, monetary integration with the rest of Europe. But is there really anything to learn from that far-off era? Analogies from the 17th century are seductive. It's the attractiveness of the language of Milton, Jonson and Fox. But they are deeply foreign to us now. Their distance is marked by their sense, shown in Charles as much as Cromwell, that they walked daily in or near the company of a god whose latter-day conversation partners are few. Right-wingers and conservatives might say the lesson of history has to do with the difficulty of changing constitutional arrangements. They might cite those words of Charles on the scaffold and the paradox of a strong executive (which Tony Blair personifies) imposing new arrangements from above, running the risk of using power arbitrarily and stifling dissent. Left wingers and radicals have to be Cromwellian at least in agreeing that unless there is a large popular element in government it is destined to fall into despotism and unfreedom. A generation ago the history of the 17th century was taught almost with the constitutional bits left out. Social and economic historians were all the rage and great works such as J.R.Tanner's English Constitutional Conflicts of the 17th Century gathered dust on the shelves: everyone read Christopher Hill and Lawrence Stone and Hugh Trevor-Roper arguing about the rise of the gentry and the dissolution of the aristocracy. Recently, the political historians have made a come back and a new synthesis may be emerging. It's based on a proposition Tony Blair and colleagues should note. One reason why constitutional debate 350 years ago was injected with such passion was because it took place within a context of social change, in an opening society where a rustic squire called Cromwell could become a power in parliament. The other day Tony Blair talked of re-modelling Britain as a middle-class society, where everyone could aspire to the bourgeois version of the good life. What is missing from his constitutional proposals is a link to that social vision. Perhaps that's because the new middle classes are politically satiated. What's absent in comparison with the past is anger, the drive for changing the way we are governed because of a sense of oppression and injustice. Lord Cranborne is a lot less dangerous than the nobles around Charles I. Advocates of constitutional change don't have much sociology going for them, there's little sign of forces hungry for Lords reform or proportional representation(4). Tory eccentric William Rees-Mogg wrote the other day about our need for a new Cromwell to keep a lid on the turbulence swirling around. In fact when it comes to institutional reform Tony Blair's problem is the passivity and comfortableness of the majority - except in Scotland and Ireland. Cavalier v roundhead Charles I 1600-49, King from 1625. Born Dunfermline, Scotland. Inherited financial problems from father, James I - notably Parliament's refusal to grant funds. Resorted to selling commercial monopolies and extracting ship money (fee towns paid for building warships). Summoned and dissolved Parliament three times between 1625-29. Parliament didn't sit for next 11 years. Puritans incensed by Henrietta, his Catholic French queen and advancement of her friends and king's favourites. Failed to force a new prayer book on the Scots then failed to raise funds to quell their rebellion. Showdown with Parliament and Civil War, 1642-45. Oliver Cromwell 1599-1658, Lord Protector from 1653. Born Huntingdon. Cambridge-educated landowner came to fore as one of new leaders backed by middle class and Puritans. Parliamentary defeat by royalists at Edge Hill prompted building of New Model Army. As successful military leader, earned title 'Ironsides' after Marston Moor. By 1646, Parliament ruled alone, its source of authority Cromwell's army. Put down religious and political opposition. Successful military campaigns at home and abroad. In 1655 dissolved Parliament as aides sought to offer him the crown. Rule by appointed major generals. Succeeded briefly and ineffectively by son Richard.

But they can hardly have been prepared for the attack this week when it received a Charter Mark, the public sector's award which proclaims winners \"have got a public service that is amongst the best in the country\". That accolade sat uncomfortably with privately run Doncaster's reputation as one of Britain's worst penal establishments for suicides. The jail for young offenders has seen five inmates take their own lives over the past year. That the Charter Mark focuses on \"the outcome for the customer\" and \"the quality of service that users actually receive\" has produced hollow laughter among prison reform groups. While Home Office ministers point to other areas where Doncaster is ahead of the prison pack, its award does lead to questions about the value of accreditations such as the Charter Mark, ISO 9000, Hospitality Assured, Kitemarks, the British Excellence Model, the European Foundation for Quality Management and Investors in People. These increasingly appear on everything from corporate letterheads to job adverts and are assumed to be a good thing. But critics suggest the marks do little to improve overall service levels to customers and not much more to help employees. At best, they may rubber-stamp processes in organisations which are already good. At worst, they stand accused of stifling creativity and subordinating individuality to a manual. Now the Government has launched a taskforce to see how quality schemes work with each other and how to make them more \"effective and efficient for users\". The marks have their roots in the Total Quality Management concept. This was the corporate buzzword of the late 1980s; cynics suggested that as no one would own up to Total Mediocrity or Total Rubbish Management, the phrase rang false. But despite reservations, the UK is the world leader in logo giving. David Woolliscroft, general manager for standards at the British Standards Institution, says some 54,000 UK firms can boast an award in the ISO 9000 series, a quarter of all worldwide issues. \"We have kitemarks for everything from seat belt safety to how to fit carpets. The rules lay down technical data for products. The ISO 9000 award goes beyond the products to look at the management and its procedures,\" Woolliscroft says. ISO 9000 and the other quality marks may be a British success story which Europeans, Asians and North Americans are doing their level best to catch up with. But in many cases, the awards merely recognise standards that already exist. There is less evidence that the procedures have been taken up by companies with poor service levels. Cranfield School of Management lecturer Graham Clark believes kitemarking is most appropriate for manufacturers and the paper processing part of companies such as insurers and banks. \"They work best for companies with a product. You can lay down rules for a process such as making nuts and bolts but in almost all cases they would have to be there anyway. So any gain from working for a kitemark is marginal especially as it can cost as much as £1,000 an employee to implement.\" ISO 9000 is the direct successor to British Standard 5750 which can find its own distant parentage in a series of standards laid down by the Ministry of Defence for military contractors. Many companies won BS 5750 and its more up-to-date International Standards Organisation counterpart not so much to emphasise quality gains but to act as a comfort cushion for prospective customers. \"It was a prop for many poor quality purchasers who could not be blamed if they bought 'quality accredited' so companies went for it. But buyers have become more competent and the number of award holders has grown so its value as an advertising and marketing advantage has diminished,\" Clark adds. ICAS, a Hemel Hempstead public relations company, is one of the few PR outfits to have been ISO accredited. Managing director Carl Courtney says: \"In itself, the ISO which we have had for five years does not necessarily provide clients with a better service. But it does give them the confidence of a guaranteed and consistently high level of professionalism which is monitored externally by independent auditors.\" Gaining these awards involves a mix of self-assessment and external moderation by one of a number of specialist accreditation companies under the umbrella of the United Kingdom Accreditation Service. But certificates can reflect the personality and experience of assessors who may be judging companies in areas outside their immediate expertise. Lawrie Reavill, a systems science expert at City University, believes accreditation can be useful in industry as it assures customers that the supplier's systems are coherent. But there is a danger: \"The standards encourage consistency and that is great if you are producing an order of 1 million identical parts for a car factory, although any successful operation in this form of production will already have good procedures. \"In other areas, it can be less sure. Accreditation examiners like to see books of rules and procedures. These can be rigid and stifle innovation. Small and medium-sized companies often find it difficult to create these documents and it can also be pointless for a fast growing concern.\" Courtney at ICAS PR agrees that having to publish a quality manual might not be suitable for some media organisations. \"We only had to make small changes to gain accreditation because we had procedures in place already. And organisations that gain awards are often those whose systems are geared to winning these qualifications.\" He believes that more haphazard organisations do not attempt accreditations so there is little overall gain in quality. \"Non-accredited competitors say creativity is their forte and quality systems strangle originality but we can give customers the comfort of knowing we produce a correct reaction when things go wrong.\" But chasing quality awards can aid both staff and customers in government monopolies, many of which start from low service levels to customers and poor staff self-esteem. The Insolvency Service won its first Charter Mark this week. With \"customers\" such as bankrupts, bent company directors and creditors chasing hopeless debts, it admits customer service can be difficult. Part of its Charter Mark work was creating a reliable appointments system to replace waits of an hour or so; it has also introduced plain English leaflets; and the Charter Mark has provided the confidence to \"show customers we care\". Cardiff-based Companies House, which polices company accounts in England and Wales, this week had its Charter Mark reaffirmed for the second time. It now claims to file documents within four days of receipt compared with five days in 1996 and up to 21 days in 1990. It believes staff have an incentive for improvement, their work is more appreciated and that these morale boosters make it easier to recruit. Staff will not receive a Charter Mark salary bonus. But they will get an extra half day's leave in recognition. Later this month Companies House will announce an Investors In People award joining tens of thousands of organisations ranging from major banks to village schools. IIP is regarded as the most difficult accreditation to pin down, being based largely on training direction and expenditure. It is of little interest to consumers. Skipton Building Society has the IIP accolade. However, the \"high performance, high support culture\" found by examiners would surely have been present already as the Skipton has long been a successful organisation. IIP fans suggest companies with the award have a better profits performance than non-involved organisations. But with over a third of all employees now in IIP companies, academics counter that it is generally the more successful company that has the procedures and the inclination to sign up for the scheme."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"books/1999/jan/30/books.guardianreview2","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-30T04:26:16Z","webTitle":"Our invisible friend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jan/30/books.guardianreview2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/jan/30/books.guardianreview2","fields":{"headline":"Our invisible friend","bodyText":"The well-oiled hack tells the switchboard operator, 'Put me on to copy', dictates a florid intro and, as he sinks to the floor, just manages, while sounding ridiculously magisterial, to utter his final command, 'Take in PA.' This is, of course, a scene from long ago. Nothing like it would happen today. Journalists, and perhaps their prose too, have become a little more sober. Guardian journalists have always been sober. In one respect however, it is still true. The Press Association, the PA, still performs, among its many other functions, that of providing a safety net for journalists, not only on the Guardian, but on practically every national and regional newspaper throughout the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. It does much more than that. Every day, deploying a staff a little larger than our 260-odd, it feeds into the Guardian, on its main news wire alone, some 80,000 words, equivalent to a chunky paperback. It provides us with roughly the same volume on its sports wire. It provides parliamentary news, and on its website, the only regular opportunity there is to watch, live, the proceedings of Parliament. PA has always had a reputation for reliability. Today, in the new electronic medium, it is also even faster and more efficient. As a subscriber to its services we make what use we wish to of all this material. The PA is a significant, and usually completely unacknowledged, presence in the Guardian every day. Its relationship with its customers, a senior PA journalist suggested, is like that of the people who make the trousers for Marks &amp; Spencer. The quality is admired but rarely attributed to the source. I was prompted to think about our relationship with the PA this week after looking into a complaint from Bruce George, the MP for Walsall South. He pointed out that we had failed to report the conclusion of an industrial tribunal, the opening of which we had carried prominently, in which his former constituency secretary had made a number of accusations in support of her claim that he had wrongfully dismissed her. Mr George was unanimously exonerated by the members of the tribunal, who declared he had done no such thing. We quickly made that clear in our Corrections and Clarifications column. The original report had appeared in the paper under the byline of one of our staff reporters. However, when I went to tell her about Mr George's complaint, she said she couldn't really answer any questions about it because the whole report had come from PA, her function had simply been to touch the structure and style of it in a limited way and her input into the actual content had been absolutely nil. I hasten to say that there was nothing wrong with this report, either before or after she had had it. Neither was there anything unusual in a staff reporter being asked to do this, nor in the report then being carried under a staff byline with no acknowledgment to PA. It is a common practice on the Guardian, as on many other newspapers. But, we have been asking ourselves this week, with a certain amount of unease, is it right? Some senior journalists on the Guardian will not touch reports of courts or tribunals when they have not been present themselves. This is respected by the news desk. PA itself is happy to see its customers using the material it provides, whether or not they acknowledge the source. Some papers will occasionally use a PA reporter's byline without crediting PA itself. That is all right, too. We do not know exactly how much use we make of PA beyond the fact that we use it a lot. One of the electronic systems we rejected in choosing the one we now use would have marked indelibly all bits of agency copy lifted into staff pieces. Thus, for example, a quotation that our reporter had not obtained but which appeared in the PA report would be ineradicably highlighted in the electronic version of our account (not in the printed version, of course). This would be useful for quick sourcing in the event of queries. It may be that our reluctance to credit PA on individual stories is as much to do with the appearance of things, a combination of aesthetics and branding, as anything else. We move in a world of anomalies. Our foreign desk will often use the byline of an agency reporter, the person on the ground and perhaps in some personal danger, at the latest calamitous event, and credit the agency in a tag at the end of the report. Even foreign briefs are sourced to agencies. We should, you might think, have a special relationship with PA. Its acknowledged father at its birth in 1868 was, after all, the editor of the Manchester Guardian, John Edward Taylor. In fact, we do. We just don't say so very often. \u0095 See Reporter Anonymous: The Story Of The Press Association by George Scott, Hutchinson (1968).

The Agriculture Minister, Nick Brown, said the scheme, which could be implemented within weeks, was important because it defended the consumer's right not to eat such produce. The department has indicated that the new regulations will apply \"from the Savoy Grill to the chip van on the A34\". Mr Brown has been considering ways of enforcing a European Union directive passed last September which called on caterers and food suppliers to tell customers which of their foods contained GM soya and maize. The directive was largely ignored in the UK because it was self-regulating. Last week, Worcestershire Trading Standards Services published a survey showing that, of 200 items sampled at random, one third contained GM soya or maize. But only one of the foods carried a warning label. Now the Government is poised to introduce penalties for companies which refuse to label properly. Food suppliers and restaurateurs have been warned that new laws could be passed \"within weeks rather than months\" and that menus may have to be changed accordingly. Mr Brown said during an interview on ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: \"There are regulations under consideration now and labelling has a very important part to play in that. \"There is a European Union directive under consideration and we are currently framing it so that it works in United Kingdom law.\" The department added: \"We have been consulting caterers and other organisations for many weeks over the best way to introduce the scheme. \"There are practical difficulties... some restaurants change their menus from day to day, and we don't want to put them to too much trouble. But consumers must be told what they are eating. \"We will be announcing our final proposals shortly.\" Friends of the Earth criticised the scheme as inadequate and unenforceable. \"The Government needs to introduce a sophisticated tracing scheme to monitor a crop from the moment it is harvested. \"How will restaurateurs really know where the produce has come from?\" The group called for an immediate five-year ban on genetically modified ingredients. \"All food outlets will be forced to go to enormous trouble and expense because of the greed of the big biotech companies who are forcing their unwanted genetically modified produce on to the British people. \"The Government shouldn't allow this ridiculous situation to happen. Rather than pushing ahead with this expensive and inadequate labelling scheme, the Government should ban GM ingredients for at least five years.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/feb/01/2","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-01T12:33:15Z","webTitle":"House of Commons debates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/feb/01/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/feb/01/2","fields":{"headline":"House of Commons debates","bodyText":"On the Euro Francis Maude, Shadow Chancellor: \"The Amsterdam treaty, formerly the Maastricht treaty requires not membership of the ERM, but observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the ERM for at least two years. That obligation is in the treaty, and the Government will be obliged to follow it if they wish to keep that option open. Does he agree that it is a serious requirement for any country that aspires to join the single currency? Gordon Brown, Chancellor: \"The right hon. Gentleman should read what was said at Amsterdam. The Amsterdam European Council resolution of June 1997 said: 'Participation in the exchange-rate mechanism will be voluntary for the Member States outside the euro area.'\" Mr. Maude: \"That provision is still in the treaty, and it is there for a serious purpose: to ensure that, before an economy joins the single currency, it shows the right degree of exchange rate stability. Therefore, at some stage the Government will have to change the Bank of England Act 1998 in order for the Monetary Policy Committee to shadow the euro rather than pursue a domestic inflation target. [Mr. Brown indicated dissent.] \"The Chancellor shakes his head in a complacent and dismissive way. Does he agree with Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs, who said that, at some point if they insist on railroading the country towards a single currency. Gavyn Davies said: 'at some point the Bank of England will have to be told to 'shadow' the euro (instead of inflation) for a two-year period to stabilise exchange rates ahead of joining'. Does the Chancellor agree with that? Mr. Brown: The shadow Chancellor is right on one thing: it will be the Labour party that has to deal with those matters right into the next century, because we shall be in government and the Conservatives will be out of government. As for the resolution of Amsterdam, let me repeat: 'Participation in the exchange-rate mechanism will be voluntary for the Member States'. I have said clearly to the right hon.

Would you say a word about the question put to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) about his being referred to a parliamentary answer on the internet?

The parliamentary answer given to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is historically significant in beginning a process of opening up the House of Commons. I recognise that the Library has an important function for us, but the answer opens out information in a way that many of us would wish to welcome. Madam Speaker: It is of course good to put answers to questions on the internet so that they may be available to a much wider audience. However, I take the view that answers should be printed in Hansard for us all to see. By all means, put information on the internet, but when a Member asks a question, I like to see the answer in Hansard.

Yet on the evidence of the past few weeks the opposite is true. Never in history has so much wealth been created from so much ignorance. The exuberance of American stocks has been difficult to justify. But the stratospheric rises of anything connected to the Internet - or anything that rhymes with it - have been unfathomable. The 300 per cent rise in Internet stocks since the start of last year reached a fresh level of unreality last week when Yahoo!, the modestly profitable American Internet indexer, took over GeoCities for $3.6 billion (£2.2 billion). Yet GeoCities loses money and is unlikely to be profitable in the foreseeable future. Two months ago I visited Microsoft in Seattle, where top executives were concerned that the company's shares were so overvalued that they would deter ambitious recruits because salaries, geared to stock options, depend on future share price-rises. During the two months since then Microsoft's price has risen by another 60 per cent and - wait for it - the increase in the value of Bill Gates's holding in those two months is $36 billion. That is the fastest creation of wealth since Big Bang. Mr Gates is on the verge of becoming the first $100 billion man on the planet. Wealth like that is so unreal that it is beyond envy. At least Microsoft is highly successful in its own right, and makes big profits. Over time it may justify its inflated share price, especially if it is allowed to use its market dominance to establish bridgeheads in other growth areas of the information revolution. But the others? The exploding prices of companies such as Amazon, the on-line bookseller, is based on ignorance of the World Wide Web. It is about cutting out the middleman and, in normal competitive conditions, reducing profit margins to ultra-slim levels. It has become part of world deflation. Amazon is already the biggest global one-stop bookseller. But the whole point of the Web is that there are a million other stops only a mouse-click away. People will be able to look at the price Amazon is charging for a book and search the Web for anyone selling it at a lower price. On the Web, the customer is king. So unless firms such as Amazon force suppliers to sell books cheaper than they do to others - which might interest the anti-trust authorities - it is difficult to see how it will make the profits to justify its ludicrous share price. But if the Web ought to lead to low profit margins, how is Microsoft so valuable? Behind this question lies the unsolved problem of the digital revolution: what to do about intellectual property rights. Microsoft has the intellectual rights to the operating system installed in 90 per cent of the world's personal computers. If that system had been an open standard and free to all, like its rival Linux - which is being refined on a voluntary basis by programmers around the world via the Web - computer history would have been different. Not only would the main source of Microsoft's wealth be negated but also the software attached to it would have been different. But who should have the intellectual property rights? The man who devised the first spreadsheet, which created the market for PCs, did not get a cent from it. Yet Microsoft's Excell, with over 80 per cent of the spreadsheet market, is a highly protected revenue source. Even if a standard is open and free, it can still have undesirable economic consequences. Thanks to Microsoft, the world does have a common, if not open, standard to which software writers can work. Imagine the confusion if there were 20 different and incompatible operating systems in the market. The biggest free open standard is the English language. If the United Kingdom received a small charge every time it was used, we could become a rentier economy and not worry about the decline of manufacturing. But the free availability of the nation's most successful export is not without adverse consequences. In a paper for the Centre for Economic Policy Research, Jacques Melitz argues that although globally free English may be good for business it is bad for literature. The reason? Those wanting to reach a world audience will increasingly write in English in order to be commercially viable. World literature, he says, will be an English literature, with the rest demoted to a poorer provincial status. Another fascinating question arises when intellectual property is stolen. Microsoft bosses constantly complain about pirating of its operating system and other software in China, depriving it of revenues and reducing its incentives. Yet if you ask whether they would have preferred it to happen to a rival like Apple, conversation quickly dries up. They know that the user base in China is a vast market awaiting lucrative upgrades when intellectual property rights are sorted out. It is like Netscape giving Web browsers away free and GeoCities doing the same with its home pages. Both are aiming to create a captive market. If a new company were launched consisting only of Microsoft's negative assets in China, it would soar above many an Icarus on the Web - and with reason. The future of the knowledge revolution may depend on a debate about intellectual property rights that is only just beginning. Meanwhile, the Web stocks are raging on, and ignorance is bliss. vic.keegan@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/feb/02/lordreform.constitution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-02T03:06:38Z","webTitle":"Lords reform debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/02/lordreform.constitution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/feb/02/lordreform.constitution","fields":{"headline":"Lords reform debate","bodyText":"Labour leftwingers broke ranks yesterday to urge the Government to end the practice of appointing peers as ministers, arguing that elected politicians should wield power. As a debate on the Lords reform bill opened yesterday, Labour MPs signed an early day motion noting that, since 1974, 140 government posts had been held by unelected members of the House of Lords. Peers hold many key ministerial jobs in the present Government, including Lord Falconer, Cabinet Office minister and friend of Tony Blair, and Lord Sainsbury, junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry. Bob Marshall-Andrews, Labour MP for Medway, who has constantly created difficulty for the Government since unexpectedly being elected in 1997, put down the motion, which has attracted the support so far of 17 other Labour backbenchers. The MPs urged \"that as part of the wider reform of the House of Lords, such appointments should cease and that the terms of reference of the Royal Commission should be enlarged to enable such a recommendation to be made\". The Government, which is almost certain to ignore the demand, is setting up a Royal Commission to report by the end of the year on the next stage of Lords reform after the hereditary peers lose their rights. The sentiment of the leftwingers' motion was unexpectedly echoed in the chamber during the second reading debate on Lords reform.

As a debate on the Lords reform bill opened yesterday, Labour MPs signed an early day motion noting that, since 1974, 140 government posts had been held by unelected members of the House of Lords. Peers hold many key ministerial jobs in the present Government, including Lord Falconer, Cabinet Office minister and friend of Tony Blair, and Lord Sainsbury, junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry. Bob Marshall-Andrews, Labour MP for Medway, who has constantly created difficulty for the Government since unexpectedly being elected in 1997, put down the motion, which has attracted the support so far of 17 other Labour backbenchers. The MPs urged \"that as part of the wider reform of the House of Lords, such appointments should cease and that the terms of reference of the Royal Commission should be enlarged to enable such a recommendation to be made\". The Government, which is almost certain to ignore the demand, is setting up a Royal Commission to report by the end of the year on the next stage of Lords reform after the hereditary peers lose their rights. The sentiment of the leftwingers' motion was unexpectedly echoed in the chamber during the second reading debate on Lords reform. The Leader of the House, Margaret Beckett, opening the debate, was interrupted by Andrew Robathan, Conservative MP for Blaby, who accused her of \"revelling in class warfare\".

Western governments, this time supported by Russia, have summoned both sides to talks in Paris this weekend. They are looking for a compromise which will give the Albanians of Kosovo substantial autonomy while preserving enough links with Belgrade to satisfy the Serbs. Behind it lies the notion that anything more radical, particularly the secession of Kosovo from Serbia, would lead to wider instability in the southern Balkans as well as the expulsion of the 200,000 Serbs remaining in Kosovo. The fate of Kosovo would, it is argued, affect neighbouring Macedonia, where Albanians form around a third of the population. It might prompt the Bosnian Serbs in their rump entity called Republika Srpska to demand integration with Serbia, which could in turn lead to the collapse of the fragile Bosnian state. Behind the regional considerations, there is a feeling that the West must take a stand against any further erosion of the ideal of multi-culturalism. If western European states are slowly accepting that their societies have become multi-ethnic - most recently symbolised by Germany's willingness to give citizenship to its large Turkish minority - shouldn't the same values be promoted everywhere in Europe? For laudable reasons people are unwilling to tolerate the new fault-line dividing Europe 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It separates north from south, rather than west from east, and unlike the Iron Curtain it does not prevent free movement nor does it cross the continent's entire width. The new barrier runs from Trieste on the Adriatic to the plains of Hungary, and the Europeans who live to its south have in the last decade of this century witnessed bloodshed and horror on a scale which the communist states behind the Iron Curtain never matched. The line seems to divide those countries which have been able to accept peaceful co-existence between ethnic groups from those which have not. In Bosnia, notoriously, an estimated 300,000 people died in the name of the argument that there can be no political stability without ethnic homogeneity. Purveyed by nationalist politicians, buttressed by one-sided propaganda on state-run television, and based on a selective recollection of history, it became a lethal engine which turned neighbours against each other and caused the brutal relocation of populations known as ethnic cleansing. Similar transfers have happened elsewhere in Europe. The first years after Hitler's defeat saw a mass relocation of people in Central Europe, as hundreds of thousands of Germans who had lived there for centuries were forced to leave Poland and Czechoslovakia (1). For the next 45 years the concept of communal peace in Europe remained largely intact. When it snapped, people were relieved that it was mainly on the geographical outer edges - in Northern Ireland and the Basque country. But when Yugoslavia started to fall apart, the shock reverberated round Europe. Yugoslavia seemed such an ethnic success story until 1991. To explain it, people turned to stereotypes about the Balkans' special factors, using phrases like 'ancient hatreds were bound to break out again' or 'they were killing each other for centuries until communism put a lid on it'. Even some Western liberal analysts have recently begun to argue that mono-ethnic states may be the best solution for the Balkans(2). While the rest of Europe moves towards some form of integration, the states south of the fault-line may need to divide for a long time before they can think of eventually coming together. Two of Yugoslavia's six former republics are indeed mono-ethnic, or at least 90 per cent so. Slovenia always was; Croatia has become so after the expulsion of its once-large Serb communities at the point of President Tudjman's guns. Bosnia also suggests that mono-ethnicity is the only way forward. Three years after the Dayton agreement, which paid lip service to unity and put some of the building blocks of a unified state into place, Bosnia is still split into Serb, Croat and Bosniac (largely Muslim) subdivisions. There is little political momentum towards bringing them together, whatever the Dayton constitution says on paper. The Bosnian case is hotly contested. Some Western analysts, most notably the International Crisis Group(3), argue that the West has caused the problem in post-Dayton Bosnia by imposing a winner-takes-all voting system. If it had chosen a proportional representation system with multiple transferable votes, it could have discouraged people from voting ethnically. It also points out that many Bosnians would go back to their old homes across the new ethnic boundaries if the international forces in Bosnia gave them better protection. The strongest evidence that multiculturalism can work in the Balkans comes from the other three republics of former Yugoslavia. Experience there runs counter to the arguments that mono-ethnic states are inevitable or that they have a better chance of producing stability. Montenegro is largely Serb, though with an Albanian minority of some 15 per cent, thanks largely to the influx of refugees from Kosovo. Yet Montenegro's current tension is not between Serbs and Albanians but among the Serbs themselves. Two former Communist officials who now lead rival parties are in a bitter struggle and in the wings stands Slobodan Milosevic, a man whose worst enemies describe him as a highly skilled opportunist more than a nationalist. He is pitting two Montenegrins against each other, largely for fear that the more reformist of the two may lead the republic to secession. The issue has nothing to do with ethnicity. It is largely concerned with economics. In Macedonia recent elections produced a government which also challenges the Balkan stereotypes. Although most people voted ethnically for 'one of us', the politicians who won power last autumn are showing great tolerance and skill. On the ethnic Macedonian side victory went to an electoral alliance, headed by VMRO, previously known as a radical nationalist party. Although it could have put together a majority government of Macedonian MPs, it decided to invite the more radical of Macedonia's two Albanian parties into coalition. It has also begun to concede some of the Albanians' demands for greater use of the Albanian language and symbols. There is plenty of cunning about it, since VMRO wants to keep the two Albanian parties apart rather than inviting both of them into government. But in its first weeks of power the government has significantly reduced ethnic tensions. What then of Serbia, the largest of the former Yugoslav republics? Even without Kosovo, it is the most multi-ethnic Balkan state. Its various ethnic groups enjoy a harmony comparable to that of most of western Europe. Discrimination and prejudice, sometimes; violence and persecution, hardly ever. The exception in Serbia is the once-autonomous province of Kosovo. Looked at as a case of failed ethnic tolerance, it appears to be a classic Balkan tragedy. But Kosovo should more accurately be seen as a case of colonialism, a concept with which Europeans north of Yugoslavia are easily familiar. For centuries until 1912 it was run neither by Serbs nor Albanians. It was part of the Ottoman empire of the Turks. Serbs argue with passionate conviction that Kosovo is ancient Serbian land, full of religious monuments sacred to Serbs, but of themselves they do not confer contemporary rights. The more relevant historical issue is who lived in the territory when Serbian rule was re-imposed in 1912. According to the most recent history of Kosovo, Austrian statistics put the area's Serb population at 25 per cent in 1903, while Ottoman figures of 1912 put it at 21 per cent(4). The Serbs would have had a higher proportion, had it not been for the forced expulsion of Albanians from the Morava valley in southern Serbia in 1877-78. The Albanian refugees fled into Kosovo. Thousands of Serbs then voluntarily emigrated from Kosovo. When the Yugoslav state was formed in 1918 as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (it also included Montenegro), it was a voluntary arrangement among Slavs. But Kosovo with its Albanian population, ethnically different and speaking a totally distinct language, had already come under Serbian rule six years earlier as the result of military invasion as the Ottoman empire declined. Serbs called this a restoration. Albanians still describe it as an occupation. The exact words do not matter. The main point it that it was not union by consent. Tension between Serbs and Albanians has always been high in Kosovo since 1912. The Yugoslav government encouraged Serbs to settle in Kosovo, while in the war the Italian Fascist invaders drove tens of thousands of them out. After the war Tito restored Serb control though, being a realist, he eventually came to recognise the weight of Albanian population and their claims to self-government. In 1974 he gave Kosovo wide-ranging autonomy, including its own self-defence units and police as well as a local parliament. It was the revocation of that autonomy in 1989 by Milosevic which reversed the tide of history, led to the eventual need to use force to maintain an unpopular policy, and over the past 12 months has forfeited Serbia's remaining claims to govern. Under international pressure Milosevic came forward recently with a plan to restore Kosovo's 'self-governance'. His proposal is an extraordinary attempt to create complicated vetoes on majority rule, what the British tried with their 'blocking mechanisms' in the various constitutions for Rhodesia. Although Albanians form 90 per cent of Kosovo's population, the proposal defines seven nationalities in Kosovo. They are the Turks, the Muslims (mainly Bosniacs), the Gorancies (Muslim Slavs originally from the Prizren area), the Roma, the Egyptians (another Roma group centred on Pec), the Serbs, and the Albanians. Each community would have veto rights. To make it more bizarre, Milosevic's draft proposes an ethnic measure which did not even exist in apartheid South Africa. No policeman would be allowed to arrest someone of another nationality. If this plan is aimed at enhancing ethnic harmony, one wonders why it is not introduced in Belgrade and the rest of Serbia. Protecting minority rights if Kosovo becomes independent is of course a serious issue. Some Serb analysts have wondered whether partition is feasible. There are suggestions that Milosevic may play this card at the Paris peace talks. Geographically, it is impossible with the Serbs' present position. Most live in towns rather than villages and are scattered around the territory. In any case, with only 10 per cent of the population, they would end up with a tiny part of the territory. Many thousands of Serbs are already moving because of Milosevic's war and the heightened sense of hatred and fear that it has caused. If they can, they leave Kosovo altogether. What holds them back is the difficulty of finding work or land in central Serbia. If, under Albanian rule, the last Serbs emigrated it would not necessarily be proof that bi-ethnic states are doomed in the Balkans. It would show the power of the media to manipulate. Serbian TV and the main newspapers have created an overwhelming image of terrorism and Muslim primitivism, as well as using the example of post-communist Albania to say that Albanians cannot run an efficient state. To discourage the exodus, the international community should insist on strong guarantees for Kosovo's Serbs and other minorities, with full rights of redress against arbitrary police or government actions. For a transitional period there may have to be certain special rights of self-government at local level in villages or suburbs where non-Albanians are a majority. But the basic paradigm should not be that Kosovo is a typical 'Balkan' issue. It is colonialism in the heart of Europe. While political independence is never a sufficient condition for prosperity or democracy, it is an essential part.

It could also form a bridge between the European Parliament and Westminster. Both Labour and Conservative MPs, who rushed into the Commons chamber to see how Mr Mandelson would perform, gave him a warm response afterwards.

If, under Albanian rule, the last Serbs emigrated it would not necessarily be proof that bi-ethnic states are doomed in the Balkans. It would show the power of the media to manipulate. Serbian TV and the main newspapers have created an overwhelming image of terrorism and Muslim primitivism, as well as using the example of post-communist Albania to say that Albanians cannot run an efficient state. To discourage the exodus, the international community should insist on strong guarantees for Kosovo's Serbs and other minorities, with full rights of redress against arbitrary police or government actions. For a transitional period there may have to be certain special rights of self-government at local level in villages or suburbs where non-Albanians are a majority. But the basic paradigm should not be that Kosovo is a typical 'Balkan' issue. It is colonialism in the heart of Europe. While political independence is never a sufficient condition for prosperity or democracy, it is an essential part.

The imminent passing of the world's longest serving executive head of state is like a wake-up call to the regimes of the Arab world, where perhaps more than anywhere else on the globe the fate of nations rests on the shoulders of individual leaders. In Cairo there is the 71-year-old President Hosni Mubarak, who is wrestling with Muslim dissenters and a fractured 'cold peace' with Israel. In Syria the 70-year-old President Hafez Assad is to be elected to a fifth term next week but is busily grooming his second son, Bashir, to take over. In the United States the 69-year-old Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, was shaking the hand of President Clinton, his trembling lip and hands, not to mention the lapses in his attention span, betraying his failing health. One of the four Arab pillars of the region is falling; the other three may not be far behind. And King Hussein, despite his diminutive frame and fraught relationships with his larger neighbours, has long been regarded as the sturdiest of them all. To the south, Saudi Arabia's 77-year-old King Fahd has been undergoing long spells of surgery after suffering a stroke two years ago. The eventual ascent to the Saudi throne of Crown Prince Abdullah cannot be relied upon. He may be challenged by his half-brothers and as events in Jordan have proved, absolute rulers can change their minds at the eleventh hour. The dumping of his brother Prince Hassan as his chosen heir by King Hussein stunned not just Jordanians but the region and Western powers, an act perhaps of a man whose mental faculties were impaired by his chronic illness. Hassan was king-in-waiting for 34 years and the country was ready for him, as were international leaders. But King Hussein's sudden change of mind in favour of his eldest son Abdullah caught the world napping. A career soldier who never imagined that he would one day rule, Abdullah is an unknown political quantity, who some enraged members of Jordan's elite describe as a non-entity. The king has provided a stabilising, moderate influence in a volatile region for most of his life, leading by example in his early detente with Israel and forever seeking to forge peaceful alliances with his neighbours. Perhaps he was fated to do so by the nature of Jordan's borders, drawn by the British to serve principally as a buffer zone between Israel and the Arab world. The country has no natural resources and little political or military muscle. It has been King Hussein's ability to mediate which has won him the accolade of the region's senior statesman. But his passing will be a timely reminder of the domino effect which could engulf the Middle East and tear up all the familiar rules. Last summer, when the king began his chemotherapy treatment at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota, the veteran Israeli columnist Ze'ev Schiff wrote that the sudden departure of the current generation of Arab leaders 'may cause chain reactions that could lead to historic turning points in their countries. 'If there is one conclusion to be drawn from the condition of the region's leaders it is that it is better for Israel to reach a final agreement with the Palestinians and also with Syria while King Hussein is still around.' Coupled with a severe economic downturn in the region - in part itself due to the near-collapse of the Middle East peace process - the widening gap between the rulers and the ruled is another factor of potentially grave instability. The only regional chief who does not look less than immortal today is the other Hussein - Saddam of Iraq. When the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, arrived in Amman this week to show strong support for Crown Prince Abdullah, she had with her Washington's de facto co-ordinator for the toppling of the West's favourite bogeyman. It would be ironic if President Saddam survives them all. But nations who fought the 1991 Gulf war against Iraq - including Syria and Egypt - may reflect on the reasons why King Hussein chose to support the Baghdad tyrant rather than join them as allies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/05/davidsharrock","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-05T04:02:09Z","webTitle":"Hussein flies home to die","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/05/davidsharrock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/05/davidsharrock","fields":{"headline":"Hussein flies home to die","bodyText":"King Hussein of Jordan, the Middle East's symbol of stability and the world's longest serving executive head of state, was flying home from the United States last night to die in his desert kingdom after losing his battle against cancer. The struggle to survive was abandoned yesterday when the 63-year-old king suffered internal organ failure. 'His Majesty King Hussein's private physician has announced that His Majesty's condition has become critical due to the failure of the functions of the internal organs,' an official statement from his doctors said. 'Based on that, members of the Royal Hashemite family have decided to return home.' A senior government official said last night 'He wants to die in his own country.' On hearing the news President Bill Clinton, speaking before a gathering at the US National Prayer Breakfast, said: 'I ask you to pray for our King Hussein, a wonderful human being, a champion of peace who, I promise you today, is fighting for his life - mostly so he can continue to fight for peace.' Less than a month ago King Hussein returned in triumph from lengthy chemotherapy treatment at the Mayo Clinic in the United States and declared himself cured of non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Within a week he was rushed back to the clinic, where doctors gave him further chemotherapy and two bone marrow transfusions. In the few days he spent back in his capital Amman the king stunned his subjects by sacking his younger brother Hassan as crown prince and replacing him with his eldest son, Abdullah, a 37-year-old career soldier with little political experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/feb/05/derekbrown","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-05T12:59:54Z","webTitle":"The end of empire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/feb/05/derekbrown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/feb/05/derekbrown","fields":{"headline":"The end of empire","bodyText":"King Hussein is dying. That much is clear. What will happen next to Jordan and its neighbours is shrouded in uncertainty. For nearly 50 years, we have been accustomed to seeing the diminutive Hashemite monarch as a stabilising force in a turbulent region. Older British people will remember him as a staunch ally and a plucky survivor; a man who, with the reassuring background of Harrow and Sandhurst, eschewed the wild anti-Western rhetoric of the Nasserites, the Baathists, and the more fanatical anti-Zionists. All of that is true, but it only partly explains King Hussein's remarkable achievement in remaining on his throne for 47 years. For although the dynasty claims descent from the Prophet, there is nothing ancient about the kingdom of Jordan. It was created in the last throes of British imperial expansion in 1921, when the then Colonial Secretary, Winston Churchill, talked King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah into becoming the Amir of Transjordan. He didn't need much persuasion: Churchill later bragged that he had created Transjordan in a day, and still had time to paint a scene of Jerusalem before the sun set. Full independence came in 1946. In 1948 Abdullah joined the Arab invasion of Palestine, and took control of the West Bank. He was assassinated by a Palestinian in Jerusalem in 1951. A year later, following the forced abdication of his feeble-minded father Talal, 17-year-old Hussein became the third king of Jordan. For nearly four decades, King Hussein has survived the sordid politics and plotting of the region. He leaned on the British and then abandoned them. He opposed and then appeased Egypt's Nasser. He quietly courted the Americans and then the Soviets. Disastrously, he was talked into joining the Egyptian and Syrian assault on Israel in 1967, and lost the West Bank. He kept out of the Yom Kippur war of 1973 - he sent an armoured brigade to the aid of Syria but it arrived late. In 1970 King Hussein unleashed his Bedouin army on the PLO, who threatened to topple his throne. They destroyed the Palestinian military base in Jordan and killed thousands of civilians. In 1990-91 he incurred the wrath of the USA - and once again saved his crown - by siding with Iraq's Saddam Hussain, who was and remains enormously popular in Jordan. In more recent years, King Hussein became Washington's darling, with his whole-hearted embrace of the Oslo peace deal between Israel and the PLO. Throughout this extraordinary story, with its 18 (at least) assassination attempts, King Hussein assiduously cultivated his image as a man of moderation and decency, who did his best to improve the lot of his four million impoverished subjects (more than half of whom are Palestinian refugees), while guiding his country to modernity. The first bit is, on the whole, true. The second is nonsense. King Hussein's motivation was that of dynasts everywhere. He wanted to consolidate his family's rule. He shared the vision of his grandfather Abdullah, whom he idolised, of Hashemite rule throughout the region. Abdullah's own father was the last Sharif of Mecca, who allied himself with the British in the first world war. He dreamed of presiding over a confederation of kingdoms in Syria, Iraq, and Arabia, but that fantasy evaporated in the cynical aftermath of victory. One Hashemite brother was chased out of Damascus by the French, another was installed in Baghdad by the British but his shortlived dynasty ended with a coup in 1958. Even Mecca, the focus of the Hashemite kingdom of Hijaz, was lost to the fierce Wahhabi warriors of what became Saudi Arabia. Jordan became the last remaining shard of a great empire that shattered even as it took shape. King Hussein may not be the last of the Hashemite, but he is the last living link to that imperial past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/feb/05/derekbrown1","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-05T17:06:10Z","webTitle":"The Hashemite kingdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/feb/05/derekbrown1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/feb/05/derekbrown1","fields":{"headline":"The Hashemite kingdom","bodyText":"The great survivor is no more. King Hussein of Jordan, who has ducked and weaved through half a century of assassination plots, coup attempts, wars and dangerous liaisons, is clinically dead of cancer. At any moment, doctors will switch off his life support system, and an era will end. What will happen next in the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan and in the Middle East is shrouded in uncertainty. The successor, chosen by King Hussein only 10 days ago, is his 37-year-old half-British son, Abdullah. He is an unknown quantity, politically inexperienced and burdened, in a deeply conservative land, by his mixed birth. Abdullah's main asset is that he is a military man by training and descent. He is a career soldier, a major-general who commands Jordan's fiercely loyal special forces. His mother, born Toni Gardiner, was the daughter of an English colonel. His father, the King, was trained at Sandhurst and tempered by war. The new King will need wise advisers if he is to avoid the dangers which pursued his father. For although Hussein brought genuine stability to Jordan, the country is still beset by perils both internal and external. More than half its four million people are Palestinian refugees and their descendants. Many have prospered, but many also remember the grisly events of 1970 - Black September - when Hussein unleashed his Bedouin army on the PLO bases and refugee camps. Thousands died. To the north of Jordan, in Damascus, there are many who dream of a Greater Syria encompassing Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan. To the east lies Iraq, where Saddam Hussein is no doubt calculating his chances of extending his baleful regional influence. There is even danger to the south, where Saudia Arabia is ruled by the descendants of the Wahhabi warriors who drove King Hussein's great-grandfather from the original Hashemite kingdom of the Hijaz. That bloody quarrel lives on in Arab consciousness, and takes flesh in the claims of the Hashemites to be directly descended from the Prophet himself. They are an extraordinary clan. Once they dreamed of establishing Hashemite hegemony throughout Arabia. Even King Hussein, an arch-pragmatist who swayed with every political and ideological wind, never quite lost sight of that family vision. For 47 years, the diminutive monarch dodged assassins and faced down coup plotters. He leaned on the British who created his country, and then abandoned them. He opposed and than appeased Egypt's Nasser. He courted the Americans and the Soviets. Disastrously, he was talked into joining the Egyptian and Syrian assault on Israel in 1967, and lost the West Bank. He kept out of the Yom Kippur sequel war of 1973. Throughout his soap opera of a life, he assiduously polished his image as a man of moderation and decency, who did his best to improve the lot of his impoverished people. In his reign Amman became a sophisticated capital of a country with modest but steady economic growth. But a dyed-in-the-wool dynast like Hussein could never truly be a moderniser. The civilian institutions of state, the parliament and the civil service, remain little more than Hashemite cyphers. The key to a peaceful transition remains the army, and with Abdullah on the throne the loyalty of the military is probably assured."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/feb/06/weekend7.weekend1","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-06T03:25:12Z","webTitle":"The show must go on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/06/weekend7.weekend1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/feb/06/weekend7.weekend1","fields":{"headline":"The show must go on","bodyText":"Once upon a time, a little girl saw the circus parade past the end of her street. Within hours, the park where she played was transformed into a world of wondrous, exotic people and beasts. She saw men walking on stilts and wobbling on a high wire, clowns squelching, white horses teetering on their hind legs, and an elephant strolling around a sawdust ring. She longed to run her hand over the deep ridges of its trunk, to feel the rhythm of its stride, to be transformed into the shimmering lady who smiled down from its back. Then, the next day, the magical world was gone. There was nothing but swings and slides in the park. I was that little girl, and as I grew older fewer and fewer elephants paraded past the end of my road. Soon, there was no magical kingdom springing up overnight in our park. The rhythm of suburban life was no longer interrupted by fantastical eruptions. The circus had left our town forever. There are now fewer than half-a-dozen circuses with animals left in Britain. In less than 20 years, an extraordinary two-century-old art form has been near-obliterated. Animal-rights groups have waged a war against circus in Britain, and circus people have been indiscriminately denounced as animal abusers. The opponents of circus have clearly won the propaganda war. Now, the most common image of circus is not the magic, but the misery. Instead of fabulous feats by human and animal, we imagine elephants chained to pallets, incarcerated big cats and horses trapped in tiny stalls. It has become accepted wisdom that all animals in circuses are treated cruelly. A whole art form is condemned and threatened with extinction because no one has effectively challenged this assumption. More than two hundred councils in Britain now ban circuses with animals from their parks. Horse shows and dog trials still pay annual visits to commons where circuses are banned. The Olympics and the Horse Of The Year Show hold a number of highly publicised competitions for performing horses. Pet owners may train their dogs to do tricks, but a labrador scampering around a sawdust ring is considered an outrage. Diane Westwood is a press officer for the Captive Animal Protection Society, which vigorously campaigns against circuses with animals - any animals at all. \"We don't differentiate, and are totally opposed to [the use of] all animals,\" she says. \"We never get to see training in circuses. We don't know exactly how animals are transported. We don't know how they live.\" I asked Westwood whether she'd be content if circuses opened their doors and showed how their animals were trained and transported. \"No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't. Nothing they do will convince me that there is any place in a circus for animal acts.\" There is no negotiating, no appeasing the protesters. Everywhere circus people pitch their caravans, they are met by protests, bans, obstruc-tive officialdom, and even violence. Incendiary devices have even been sent to circus proprietors' homes. The small circus community has no supporters. No politician, no artistic director, no prominent personality speaks out in defence of circus people. A cultural icon has been transformed into a cultural pariah. When animal trainer Mary Chipperfield was convicted last week on 12 counts of cruelty against a baby chimp, Trudy, including beating her with a riding crop, the most famous name in British circus was irrevocably tainted. To a public already steeped in tales of whip-wielding lion tamers, this case seemed to show the true face of circus in Britain. The cry to outlaw circuses - every and any circus - was renewed. The All Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare came under pressure to take action. A little over two years ago, the group had established the Circus Working Group to examine the management of circus animals. Initially, there was not a single member of the circus community on the working group, and the secretariat was provided by the RSPCA, which agitates for a total ban on animals in circuses. Other organisations represented included the Born Free Foundation. In February last year, the group finally invited David Hibling, artistic director of Zippo's Circus, to join them, but by then the majority of circus visits had already taken place. The group could not reach agreement. In December last year, it published its divided report. There were three alternative recommendations: that existing legislation, in particular the 1925 Performing Animals Act, is adequate and nothing be done; that new legislation should be introduced specifically to cover the operation of circuses with animals; that there should be a total ban on animals in circuses. Parliament has yet to act upon the report. Operating a circus that uses performing animals is a perfectly legal profession. And, despite 20 years under fire, circus people refuse to lie down and die. Perhaps their strongest asset is the dream - that vision of a magical world mushrooming at the end of your street. The circus is an unquenchable fantasy. Many stores have china, sheets and curtains celebrating the circus coming to town. My daughter's schoolbooks still have sea lions balancing striped balloons on their noses, although she has never watched such a spectacle. There are no sea lions left in Britain, no balancing balloons. We can still read and dream about the circus, but, most likely, we won't be able to see one. It was hard to find Circus Harlequin. They were several miles out of town, on a derelict building site. I had been travelling with circuses around Europe for several months before joining up with one of the few remaining circuses in Britain. Their faded blue-and-white big top was planted on the outskirts of Rotherham. Yet still they transformed this puddled ground into a glittering, magical spectacle. This vision of an exotic world was as fleeting as a dream. I followed them as they moved from building site to muddy farmer's field, and, on each pull-down, even the holes left by the giant tent pegs were filled in. We were hunted animals that left no tracks. Animal trainer Martin Lacey is Circus Harlequin's proprietor. Twice a night, he would pull on his red ringmaster's jacket and enter the ring, introducing, with a sweep of his heavily be-ringed hand, Larry Osca on the cloud swing, Miss Toni, who hangs by her hair, Tommy Pinder and his eight liberty horses, and the Mongolian contortionists. Then he'd present his own bactarian camels. Called Ralph, Winston and Clifford - as if they were golfing chums from the Home Counties - these two-humped beasts trotted around the ring, lay down and answered to their pedestrian names. Between the acts, because of a bad knee, Lacey sat at the edge of his circular kingdom on an old school chair, surveying the ring and the sparse audience. He is old, overweight, crushed but unconquerable - a lion in winter on his plastic throne. The big top seated 400. But, on some nights, the trapeze artist risked his life for a wide-eyed audience of fewer than 50. It's impossible for a circus to attract the crowds it once did when relegated to such eyesores of sites. Most circuses still rely on traditional methods - putting posters up around town, and asking shops and factories to display them in return for free tickets. But billing has become a Sisyphean task. It takes only two or three animal-rights protesters to clear a town of posters, pasting cancelled stickers over them or simply pulling them down. Lacey says that one day is a good street life for each poster he puts up. Protesters realise that if people don't know the circus has come to town, the circus will die. In his trailer, Lacey keeps scrapbooks of Circus Harlequin cuttings going back over the past ten years. The earlier books are stuffed with amusing stories from the local papers - Auditions For Knife Thrower's Assistant, Army Searches For Mine Lost Inside Hippo. But, in the later books, the cuttings are not so funny. One Peterborough paper tells of the circus's arrival in town: Lacey had had a special poster printed, boasting \"First Ever Visit\"; the Animal Liberation Front sent shopkeepers a message made out of letters cut from newspapers. The message read: Take down the circus posters or we will take your windows out, signed, ALF. The speed of Lacey's fall from respected artiste to persecuted pariah is startling. Less than ten years ago, he was presenting his big-cat act in the centre of Britain's major towns, billed as the King Of The Cage. I remember going to see \"The One And Only Mr Martin Lacey\", and being entranced by the bow-tied, be-whiskered tamer. Lacey and his big cats appeared on television shows and made TV commercials. His trailer, where he spends nine months of the year, is hung with photographs, not of his sons, but of his lions and tigers - his former glory. The King Of The Cage's favourite feline companion was a lion called Kasanga. \"Kass was quite a character,\" says Lacey. \"He was always interested in anything that was going on. Nosey is probably a good way of describing it.\" Kass and Martin were a team, a partnership. Martin has a heavy gold casting of Kasanga hanging around his neck. Together, they attracted audiences in their thousands. Martin rode on Kasanga's back, kissed him with puckered lips, and put his head in his mouth, earning himself a new nickname - The Man That Fear Forgot. For the few winter months when the circus is off the road, Lacey stays at home in Kasanga Manor in Lincolnshire, where Kasanga, who lived to 19, is buried in the garden. When I visited Circus Harlequin, there were no more lions. As circuses were driven off central sites, there seemed no point in investing in an industry under siege. Some of the biggest names in British circus tossed out their top hats and gave up. Gerry Cottle stopped presenting animal acts. Circus was dying in Britain. But circus, like Harlequin, was born in Britain. Two hundred years ago, in the centre of London, Major Philip Astley rode a horse around a sawdust ring. He discovered that, if the ring was exactly 42 feet in diameter, the centrifugal forces allowed the rider to stand upon the horse's back. Now, every circus ring, anywhere in the world, is 42 feet across. Ironically, the Greatest Show On Earth has proved one of Britain's most enduring cultural exports. In Germany, circuses Roncalli and Krone, with a full complement of animals, are huge, flourishing businesses. In Switzerland, Circus Knie is as important a cultural phenomenon as our Royal Opera. In France, there is a national circus archive, library and magazine; French television regularly broadcasts acts, and the Centre National des Artes du Cirque is an established part of the French educational system. Charlie Holland, programme director of Circus Space, a London circus school, has had a struggle to establish the first circus arts degree, to be launched in September in conjunction with the Central School of Speech and Drama. The British artistic establishment ostracises and looks down on circus. Less than 0.05 per cent of the Art Council's capital Lottery awards - £500,000 out of nearly £1 billion - goes to circus projects. \"Circus here is seen as the Entry Of The Gladiators, a ringmaster and a leaky big top, something sad and pathetic,\" says Holland. \"It's a shame it isn't respected as a part of our culture, as a living art form, rather than a pickled one.\" Circus people may appear relics of the past. They're a nomadic people, who live in conditions that would appal the protesters who want to eradicate them. And, growing accustomed to being attacked, they've become defensive. Tommy Pinder, a softly-spoken 28-year-old who presented liberty horses for Circus Harlequin, was born into the circus. \"When I go to the hairdressers, I say I'm a truck driver, or a bricklayer, or some sort of labourer, something like that,\" he says. \"You're frightened that they're going to start, \u0091Oh, I don't believe in circuses with animals', and all that sort of stuff, and stick the scissors in the back of your neck. So, I just say I'm a truck driver.\" As their traditions came under attack, so circus people became more entrenched. In Britain's few remaining circuses, you see the same red ringmaster's jacket, hear the same stirring music, see the same pedestals for the few remaining animals to stand and twirl about on. Innovation in the ring is rare. The old traditions were all the circus had to hold on to. David Hibling is an animal trainer who dared to act differently. Once, he skated with chimps, and trained hippos, giraffes and even storks to do tricks. Today, he heads Zippo's Academy Of Circus Arts, which trains new talent, as well as acting as artistic director of Zippo's, an all-human circus that three years ago introduced horses. Now, he regrets that elephants were once painted pink. \"Circus in this country failed to re-invent the animal act,\" he says. \"Bears in tutus and dogs in knickers walking tightropes lingered too long. The moustachioed lion tamer cracking the whip, being all macho and brave - it didn't have to be like that. At Zippo's, we aim to present our horses as naturally as possible.\" It still took years of protracted negotiations and repeated lobbying of individual local councils before Zippo's horses were allowed to perform on their commons - the same councils that unquestioningly welcomed dog shows and horse trials. Yet audiences clearly want animals: since introducing horses three years ago, Zippo's business has increased by 25 per cent. It is near-impossible for circuses without animals to be commercially successful. So-called New Circus is restricted to a few large operations, such as the internationally-renowned Cirque du Soleil, which performs in major theatres. It does not come in a tent to your small town. Archaos, which replaced horses with motorbikes and cars, did well but has now closed. Traditional touring circuses - with the exception of the Moscow State Circus - seem to flourish only with an animal content. At Zippo's, the crowd roars when the huge palomino rears up on its hind legs, towering above them. Animal-rights protesters claim that such tricks are demeaning. \"You're controlling the animal and reducing them to just pathetic caricatures,\" says Diane Westwood. But there is nothing unnatural about a horse standing on its hind legs. Outside in their paddocks, Tommy Pinder's eight Welsh cobs, young stallions, continually toss their dark, messy manes like teenagers and rear up in play. The only difference is, in the ring, they do it for Tommy. When he is all dressed up in his sequinned tuxedo, it's as if he's dancing with his horses, as if they were partners in an intricate pattern of steps. When Tommy moves, however slightly, they move. Their eyes lock. \"You got a bond,\" he says. \"There's a connection. It's hard to explain unless you're there with them. You feel and breathe the same as they do.\" Tommy is bewildered by the blanket attacks on his gentle art. \"People can't identify different circuses. They say, \u0091The cruel circus'. But why can't they say, \u0091That circus is cruel, but this one isn't'? They don't realise that it's all individual families who run these different businesses.\" The business rivalries and generational feuds among circus people are legendary. Such splits make them poor advocates in their own defence. When Animal Defenders, a \"youth\" wing of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, produced a report and video last year entitled The Ugliest Show On Earth - on which evidence Mary Chipperfield was convicted - there was no vocal opposition, no suggestion that other animal trainers might behave differently. Circuses throughout Britain were indiscriminately condemned. It was like condemning dog owners nationwide because a man in Aberdeen hits his Alsatian. \"Circus is full of sensationally caring, very creative people - and it's got a handful of cowboys,\" says Charlie Holland. \"To judge the majority on the actions of a few is not helpful.\" Even the Association of Circus Proprietors of Great Britain, which represents a dozen circuses with and without animals, did not issue a statement in defence of their trade. Martin Lacey is a lone warrior. Most circus people simply hoped the furore would blow over. The enemies of the art of circus are powerful in comparison with the divided, unconventional circus people. The greatest opponent is a huge, £54-million charity, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, that has devoted a great deal of its considerable resources to dispossessing Britain's last nomads. \"The RSPCA has had a policy of opposition to use of animals in circuses for a very long time now,\" says a senior figure in the RSPCA. \"There are a number of factors which cause us great concern, and many of them are things which we can't see can ever be corrected within the circus environment. As far as we can see, there's no way that they can ever achieve the kind of standards that we think are needed for these animals.\" On most opening nights, protesters distribute RSPCA leaflets outside the circus gates, and the local RSPCA office displays posters, \"DON'T GO TO THE CIRCUS\". The local press is fed stories about the cruel conditions in which circus animals are kept. These stories are almost always generic to any circus. Martin Lacey recognises the picture in the RSPCA leaflet as his tigers, even though they don't name him and have never brought a complaint against Circus Harlequin. Despite its call for a boycott, the RSPCA inspects (or \"visits\", in its words) Harlequin - and every other circus with animals - when it arrives at a new town. Lacey permits RSPCA inspectors to assess his animals and check their exercise pens, food and water, and beast wagons, even though they have no legal right to do so. He collects and displays their visiting cards in his programme, calling them his head-hunting trophies - Inspector Scott, Inspector Groake, Inspector Trickey and, his most prized, Inspector Nice. \"And he was nice!\" says Martin. \"The inspectors on the ground are usually very sensible people. They come along, look at the animals and compliment us on the way we care for them. And they go away saying, \u0091Well, you know, our policy is that we don't like the circus.' It's head office that's the problem.\" Circus has been singled out by the RSPCA. An uncompromising clarion call to abolish circuses with animals is a guaranteed fund-raiser. Other forms of animal husbandry remain free from such censure. The RSPCA's response to last year's Grand National, when four horses died as a result of the race, was to talk to and advise the Jockey Club. The RSPCA has no policy to outlaw horse racing; instead, it negotiates for better conditions with those responsible for the horses' welfare. Its position on circuses, however, is non-negotiable. \"It's ludicrous. They're hypocrites,\" says Tommy Pinder, in uncharacteristically strong language. \"If I took my horses and - God forbid - just one died in the ring, there'd be an outcry. I'd probably be sent to prison. But because a big event like the Grand National, or steeple chasing, or the Derbies and all this sort of stuff, is sponsored by the upper class and royalty and all that, nothing's said about it. But we're easy targets, we're very easy targets for the RSPCA.\" The RSPCA's attack on circus has been conducted on the streets, in the press and through academic research. In 1989, it commissioned animal behaviourist Dr Marte Kiley-Worthington to write a report into the conditions of animals in circuses. \"They thought that I would support their case,\" says Dr Kiley-Worthington, \"but, of course, I'm a scientist, so I went and measured everything I could think of that might give me some clue as to whether or not animals in circuses should be banned because there was no way they could have a good life.\" After 3,000 hours of scientific observations, she did not conclude that circuses are, by their nature, cruel. \"There is no more reason to ban animals in circuses than there is [to ban] people [from] having pets, or horses in stables, gymkhanas, racing, zoos. All of them need improvement within what they are,\" she says. But Dr Kiley-Worthington went further: she found positive benefits in circus for the animals themselves. \"I think we're doing a great disservice to these animals by believing that they're robotic creatures which only behave in instinctively natural ways, and that's all they should ever do,\" she says. \"All animals learn. And just as education enriches lives for humans, so it can for animals. They can have more exciting lives as a result of learning different things and having different experiences. And one of the things they can have experiences of is interacting with humans in circus.\" Dr Kiley-Worthington's findings were not what the RSPCA's leadership wanted to hear. \"If I were the RSPCA and wanted to ban animals doing something so I could get a high profile, I would choose some minority group who everyone else thought were a bit iffy. The circus fulfils that, because they don't have mortgages and they don't always stay in one spot. They don't necessarily want bigger motor cars and good schools for their children. Their first and central thing is - the show must go on. Even if your father's been killed that morning, you'll go on and do the show. It's dramatic how important and central that is.\" Outside Britain, the show does go on. In France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Spain and all over Scandinavia, circus flourishes. Sweden's flagship circus, Cirkus Scott, was founded in 1932. With almost 300 people working for it, and dozens of animals - from goats and chickens to elephants - it still parades from town to town on one-night stands. Adjoining the big top, in a smaller tent, is their Internet cafe, sponsored by IBM. Robert and Henry Bronett, inheriting the circus from their father, run this mighty enterprise and act as ringmasters. Born in the continental circus, they are national stars, feted by royalty. Henry had a leading role in the Swedish equivalent of EastEnders. Ironically, for Cirkus Scott, finding suitable sites is a problem, too. \"It gets harder and harder,\" says Robert. \"We seat 3,500 people, so need a very big site. But we get a lot of help from towns, because they like it when we come. We're a big attraction, we bring people to their hotels, so it's money for the town.\" Circus - real, vibrant, living circus such as Scott - assaults your senses. It has not only a look, but a sound, a touch, even a smell. The scent of human and animal sweat is intoxicating. Sawdust, that essential ingredient in this heady brew, thickens the air. You literally breathe in circus. It has a sensuality shared by no other form of performance. And it stirs every emotion. Circus makes you cry, laugh, feel anxious, be awed. \"The most stubborn old man, forced to come to the circus by his grandchildren, can't help but smile. It makes him feel alive again,\" says Henry. There is no shame in being an artiste and animal-trainer for Cirkus Scott. Marco Althoff, from a family as old as circus itself, presents four African elephants for the Bronetts. In the ring, bedecked in black-and-white studded leather, he is a fairytale elephant-trainer. In his trailer, with its brass elephant-head knocker and fake zebra-skin cushions, he was soft and self-deprecating. Each morning, he rehearses with his elephants in the ring, talking to them, bribing them with nothing harsher than chunks of stale bread, and boasting that they are, \"closer to me than my wife! My elephants don't like women, because they were brought up by me. They're jealous.\" As the Ukrainian tent team rhythmically brushes the sawdust, he told me I could ride one of his elephants. Mounting Kitty was like clambering on to a mountain swaying in the wind. Then she began to walk, throwing her weight from side to side. It was as if I was in a small boat in a storm. Fight the movement, and you suffer; go with it, and you feel like a partner in an exquisite dance. The thrill of riding her made me speechless. I just gasped, continually catching my breath. That night, smothered in sequins, I entered the ring. The crowd roared. Eventually, faraway, the little girl's dream came true. The circus people I met were not elephant-beating barbarians. They were a small, disenfranchised people, struggling to survive against odds that would have defeated almost anyone else. Animal-rights groups - including the RSPCA - should negotiate with people who travel, live and work with their animals. Instead of shouting outside the circus gates, instead of leaning on councils, they should sit down and talk. They should argue for better conditions in circuses. They should treat circus people as they treat all other people who keep animals - not as freaks, but with respect. Our last travelling players should be cherished. Once upon a time, at the end of my road, there was a parade of elephants. Today, I imagine holding my daughter's hand as we stand on the pavement outside our home, staring up at these fabulous beasts. It happens all over Europe. It can happen here. \u0095 Circus Days Circus Nights, written and presented by Dea Birkett, will be broadcast at 11.35pm, February 9, on Channel 4.

On a cold, dark night last January, 13-year-old Allan Harper climbed a flight of stairs to a flat on Startpoint Street. From the top steps, you can see the whole of Glasgow - the city centre, with its fine municipal buildings, the concert halls, the university spire - but all that was another world to Allan. He would never come to know those places. He would never come to anything. By the end of the night, he would be dead: the youngest person to die of a drugs overdose in the United Kingdom. It is now a year later, and Allan's mother, Jacqueline, says that she still doesn't know what happened to her son that night; that she doesn't have a clue how he got hold of the heroin that killed him, though she is convinced he had never taken it before. Earlier that night, she remembers, they had all been in the living room of her flat at Bellrock Court - Allan, his younger brother, Ricky, his grandmother, Margaret, and Jacqueline's former boyfriend, Stephen Young, who, Jacqueline says, was still in the habit of hanging around the place, even though their relationship was over. \"Everyone was just sitting around. Allan was going on about his hair, about how he wanted it cut that night,\" she says. \"Stephen Young kept falling asleep, and Allan kept waking him up.\" Allan was a bit hyper that night, says Jacqueline, a bit fidgety; but then, he was always like that. \"He was just the normal Allan,\" says his grandmother, Margaret. \"He got changed that night - he put on a different trackie suit. He changed out of his blue one and into a white one.\" Allan told them that he wanted to go with Young to his nearby flat on Startpoint Street, to help him lay a carpet and then watch Highlander on satellite TV. It was about two in the morning, and Jacqueline was none too pleased at Allan's wanting to go. Eventually, though, she let him, and she, her mother and Ricky all went to bed. Recounting the events of that early morning, Jacqueline is sitting on the edge of a grey Draylon sofa in that same Bellrock Court living room. Beside her, Buddy the parrot is jumping about in his cage, squawking \"Buddy\" and \"Jackie\", and the dog is running around, throwing itself at the door, whining and barking like a mad thing. Little has changed since the night Allan died, and Jacqueline can still picture her son, badgering her to let him go. On the walls, large gilt-framed photographs show the two brothers together, cheeky but happy. Sometimes, says Jacqueline, she comes into the room and it just hits her, what has happened - she can see it all over again. \"I was arguing with Allan, but then the phone went,\" she says. \"He was like, \u0091Mum, don't treat me like a kid.' I was arguing with him; I didn't want him to go. But Stephen had offered him a tenner to help him lay a carpet. I ended up giving in. I didn't think for one minute that that was going to happen.\" The way Jacqueline remembers it, Young was saying, \"What can happen to him, Jackie?\" Young was around the house a lot. Sometimes, for a laugh, Allan and Ricky would call him Dad, but mostly he was just Steph. Just the week before, he had taken the whole family to the Moat House Hotel for Christmas dinner, but they had turned up late and ended up having to eat salad: it was lovely, but it wasn't traditional, and they usually had traditional. They made up for it by staying the night and getting some drinks from the mini-bar. Young had paid for it all. He was good to the boys, too, often buying them things. He was generous that way: he had given Ricky an Alsatian called Raja, and he was planning to give the boy a cockatiel he had at his flat. There were always gifts, even though Young was unemployed. People said that he was a big-time drugs dealer - he was certainly a dealer of some kind - but Jacqueline says she didn't know anything about that. Allan wanted to go with him, and she gave in. The 13-year-old and the 35-year-old man left the flat at 2.30am. The next afternoon, Young telephoned Jacqueline at her flat. He told her that his two pit-bull terriers had been chewing at Allan's arm. He did not tell her that the teenager, wrapped up in a sleeping bag, was dead. At some time during the night, Allan had taken twice the amount of heroin needed to kill a grown man. His body had been left lying there and had been mauled by the dogs. \"He said Allan's arm was hanging off and he wasn't responding,\" says Jacqueline. \"I just threw the phone down, grabbed my jacket and went out the door. I didn't reply to him, or say anything to him. I was right round there within seconds. That was before the police or anybody was there. I told Stephen to phone 999.\" Jacqueline says she still cannot fathom why Young didn't call an ambulance, but she has her suspicions. There are only two people who know what went on that night, she says, and one of them is dead. \"He was right beside Allan, that's what confuses me. He was in the same room, lying asleep on a chair next to him. How he didn't wake up and hear any of it, I don't know.\" Jacqueline still finds it hard to go into detail about what she saw that afternoon, but she remembers shouting at Allan to come back, and crying \"No, no, no.\" When the paramedics arrived, she could do nothing but stand there. \"I was looking at him, and thinking, \u0091How are they no' touching him?' He had obviously been like that for a while. They couldn't give me a time of death, or anything. He was in a sleeping bag when I found him, but the way I found him was not the way my son died. [Young] says that Allan fell asleep watching the TV. When I found him, Allan was poker-straight, wrapped up in this mad sleeping bag with a green, woolly hat on top of his head, facing away from the TV, next to the electric fire. Allan was a big boy. When he used to lie on the floor, he'd be all over the place. Somebody is lying. \"[Young] says the reason for the sleeping bag, especially this mad woolly hat, was that he was trying to put Allan in the recovery position and that he was trying to keep him warm. That's what gets to me. Why didn't he phone an ambulance? He denies taking any drugs. At one point, he tried to make out that Allan must have got them off the ice-cream van, but how the hell Allan went to the ice-cream van at 2.30am I don't know.\" Three months later, the police's original suspicions were confirmed, and Jacqueline learned from the pathologist's report that morphine had been found in her son's blood, probably from heroin. She was told that he had not taken it intravenously, as there were no needlemarks on his body, so must have smoked it. The way Jacqueline sees it, someone had obviously shown Allan how to chase the dragon. She stops for a minute, then says that she hates Young, that she has thought about killing him. She just thinks about Ricky, she says, about how he has lost his brother, and feels sick. In November 1998, Stephen Young was convicted of dealing heroin and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, but even before his conviction he said little, if anything, about how Allan came to die. Jacqueline says that she once asked him a load of questions, but he refused to give her any answers: he would not tell her whether he had given Allan the heroin, or even if he had taken some himself. As far as Young is concerned, she says, he hasn't been charged with anything, so that means he's done nothing wrong. The case is likely never to be closed, because there is no evidence one way or the other. Jacqueline and her mother have their own ideas about what happened. They think that Young cleared up the flat before he phoned - there certainly wasn't any heroin there by the time the police and ambulance crew got there. Both say they are puzzled as to why a boy like Allan would take drugs in the first place. \"To me, Stephen Young's given him it,\" says Jacqueline, \"because Allan wasn't full of drugs when I seen him. He was normal. If he was on something, I would have known it straight away.\" Allan McFarlane Harper was born on April 19, 1984, in Glasgow's Rottenrow Hospital. He was ten weeks premature, and so small that his 17-year-old mother dressed him in doll's clothes. He soon shot up, though; he became so big that Jacqueline's worst fear was that he'd be taken as being older, and end up getting hurt in a street fight, or something like that. It worried her, she says, because Allan was a mouthy boy, though never violent. Allan, young Allan and Ricky's father, was around for a few years after the boy's birth, but he and Jacqueline slowly grew apart. They had met when both were very young, and soon found that they wanted different things: he liked going dancing; she was happy to stay in with the boys. But they had been in love, and stayed together for ten years before he finally left. When he was at home in the flat, young Allan watched television, graduating from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Thundercats to ice hockey and martial arts as he got older. Sometimes, if the mood took him, he would draw: he was so good at it that his mother thought he might become an architect, or something. Then there were computers, which he was good at, too. You always knew if he was in the flat, says Jacqueline, because either the television would be on, or the stereo would be blaring out techno or Meatloaf or Queen. That last Christmas, she says, his favourite had been R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. When he was out, Allan liked rollerblading; Cranhill's stone-slabbed courtyards make it an ideal rink. The other boys didn't rollerblade, but Allan enjoyed doing his own thing; always had done. He was a bit of a loner, though he did have friends; it was just that he was choosy. He was a sensitive, thoughtful boy - he would often give his mother flowers; if he couldn't afford them, he'd pinch them from the park - and was good at school, though he often got into fights. Jacqueline had to go up there sometimes, because he had been shouting or had been cheeky. He was still a little boy in many ways, says Jacqueline, but he was changing. He had started to say that he didn't want to do this, didn't want to do that. He was becoming a teenager, and had started to go gangly. He was 5ft 8in, and took a size-nine shoe. He was also a good-looking boy, with an outgoing personality and lots of girlfriends: after his death, six different girls claimed to have been going out with him. What was really unusual about Allan, however, was that he was very religious. He'd been going to mass with his grandmother, and had decided he wanted to become a Catholic. He just loved the atmosphere, and would sit transfixed in the chapel, staring at the icons. \"He was dead religious,\" says his grandmother. \"He wanted to join the choir. He was a cracking wee singer. He just loved the church. I always thought he was going to end up a minister, or something like that.\" When Allan died, Jacqueline, Margaret and Ricky wanted him laid out at home, so they could say their own farewell. Though the toxicology report would not appear for another three months, the police consented to release the body to his family three weeks after his death. Jacqueline remembers putting his coffin under the window with the blue Austrian blinds, and dressing him in a Rangers strip. All day, people had come and gone, through the hall, with its chipped linoleum and torn wallpaper, and into the pink-Artexed living room. They all looked at the flat, and they looked at Allan's coffin, then they shook their heads. \"What chance?\" they thought as they walked away. At the funeral, the priest said that Allan's death was not just a tragedy for Cranhill, but for the whole country: \"Allan was a young boy, known only within his own family and friends, but his was one of the most significant deaths in Britain,\" said Father John Gannon. \"People turned a blind eye to the problem. They said, \u0091It is none of my business', or, \u0091I don't want to interfere', but phrases like that have led to Allan lying here today.\" There is no headstone to mark Allan's grave - the family cannot afford one. Accidental drugs deaths are the single biggest killer of young people in Glasgow. In 1998, 100 people in the city died as a result of some kind of drugs overdose; most of them were under 30. Last November, 50 wraps of heroin were found in the gym shoes of a Glasgow primary schoolboy. Later that same month, a seven-year-old boy handed over a bag of heroin to his schoolteacher, saying, \"It is killing my mummy.\" Scotland, as a whole, has the worst drugs record in Europe. And nowhere is this more apparent than in areas like Cranhill. When Allan Harper died, it was just a few days into the 100th anniversary of the launch of heroin: it was first put on to the market as a cough medicine, its name derived from the German heroisch, meaning heroic. In Cranhill, it means nothing of the kind. Once, the place had been open fields - the Cranhill Piggeries and a quarry stood here - but now it is a wasteland, all grey slabs, breeze blocks and derelict houses. Dozens of flats on Cranhill's housing schemes lie empty, their doors boarded up with perforated-steel shutters, to prevent them from being turned into drugs-shooting galleries for local users. The discarded needles in the gutters tell the story, as does the wan, distracted look on the mid-morning faces of local junkies as they set about finding their next fix. After Allan's death, a group of women on the estate began to agitate for some kind of change of attitude, and tried to persuade people that they did not have to tolerate the dealing on their doorstep: led by Gaille McCann, a local councillor who was also Jacqueline's neighbour, they formed Mothers Against Drugs, a vociferous body with a fierce Just Say No message. In the days following Allan's death, the group organised a candle-lit vigil through the streets of Cranhill, both as a mark of respect for Allan and a warning to the dozens of drug dealers in the area that they were no longer willing to keep quiet. Holding torches, candles and night-lights, the women gathered on the concrete courtyard below the Harper's flat. But Allan's mother was not allowed to join the vigil - Jacqueline Harper had a conviction for possession of heroin, and many of the mothers felt it would be hypocritical if she came on the march. \"It was done with Jacqui's best interests,\" says McCann. \"There was a lot of negative stuff about Stephen Young's role. Everybody thought he was Jacqui's boyfriend. It was a dead emotional night, and we thought it was in her best interests to stay away. She was still a mother who had lost her kid, but we were picking up really bad vibes. There could have been a flashpoint and something might have happened.\" Many also questioned Jacqueline's care of her children, saying that she had been negligent in allowing her son to go off with a man who was known throughout the community as a drugs dealer. Some locals even told the press that Allan had been a courier, who had dropped off bags of smack all around the housing scheme and who boasted to his mates that he could get them cannabis any time they wanted it. Some said that Ricky should be taken into care. Ask Jacqueline about this, and she gets angry. \"There was a lot of rubbish going around about us, especially about Allan being a courier. I have never been a dealer. I have never been an addict. I was up on a heroin charge a couple of years ago - it was my pal, and I took the blame. It wasn't found on me personally. It wasn't even in the house. It was somebody else's house, and I took the blame. The person it belonged to was taking drugs, and I wasn't, and since I had no prior convictions whatsoever, I thought I would help out. I just got probation. It was really stupid. \u0091Just because I had that conviction for a £10 bag of heroin does not mean my wee boy was an addict. I told him a lot about drugs. You had to, with him being a wean and playing out there. But I was taken aback when they told me about the drugs. If he had been a user, he'd have known he was taking too much.\" Her eyes are baggy, and lined with dark circles, but she does not seem like a typical Glasgow heroin addict - her speech is not slurred, and though her eyes are glazed, it is more with grief than oblivion. \"I was painted a junkie mother killer because of that. I am raging and angry about not getting to go on the protest.\" One senior police officer, however, claims that she was \"junked up to her eyeballs\" at the time of Allan's death. Jacqueline says that her conviction has been used against her, and that she has had no help from the council since Allan's death. In the near future, the whole block is due to be demolished, yet Jacqueline and her family have sat and watched as, one by one, their neighbours have been moved to new accommodation. The Harper family is still in the same flat, waiting for word of the day when they'll get a new home. Allan's room has been turned into a storage cupboard, because Jacqueline cannot bring herself to assemble the bedroom furniture she bought just before Christmas. But they had a proper tree, all done up, in the corner, because, says Jacqueline, it was important that Ricky, now 11, had a good Christmas. She had been hoping to be out of the flat before the anniversary of Allan's death, on January 3, but it just didn't happen. Jacqueline says that each time she's seen an empty house, she's gone to the council and asked if she could have it, but, so far, she's had no luck. All she's been offered, she says, is a flat on Startpoint Street. \"And I couldn't do that to Ricky - have him growing up in the same street where his big brother died.\" So they are stuck in the same maisonette, watching as other people are rehoused. From the kitchen, you can look out on to a tower block or sit and listen to the articulated lorries as they hurtle along the nearby M8, driving on to better places. Ricky can hear them, too, but he knows he can never go to those places. Soon, he knows, he will be in a new house, but he might never escape Cranhill. Instead, he has to hang about this awful place, watching the shadows and the junkies, and thinking about his big brother's death. On the surface, he seems to be coping fine, but the reality is that he now gets into fights at school, and whenever a teacher asks him to put his hand up, he thinks of his brother's arm being chewed by Young's dogs. Ricky misses his brother - they were really close - but doesn't like to talk about it to outsiders. Instead, he'll tell you he's had \"mair\" kisses than you'll ever have, about ten million or something, and about all the lassies he's gone out with. He doesn't believe that Allan took drugs: \"There's no way my big brother done that.\" When he sees the junkies out on the street, he's a bit frightened, which is why he usually takes Raja with him, so that they'll stay away from him. He walks along the streets named after the lighthouses, but they are only guiding him on to the rocks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/1999/feb/06/politicalnews.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-06T03:32:59Z","webTitle":"Labour taunts SNP over 'divorce'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/06/politicalnews.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/feb/06/politicalnews.politics","fields":{"headline":"Labour taunts SNP over 'divorce'","bodyText":"The Government's battle to preside over a united kingdom began in earnest yesterday as Tony Blair accused the Scottish National Party of wanting to divorce Scotland from the rest of Britain. Launching the first poster campaign of the Scottish parliamentary elections with a billboard which made no mention of his party, the Prime Minister said Scotland had to make a stark choice: devolution or divorce. Although the tactic of \"Nat bashing\" has been privately criticised by some members of the Cabinet, Mr Blair made it clear that Labour would continue to assail the SNP. Speaking in Glasgow, he accused the SNP of making its policies for social justice secondary to its desire for independence, and warned the Scots that misguided patriotism might cost them dear. \"You cannot evade choices about Scotland's future by wrapping yourself in Scotland's flag,\" he said. \"It is wrong for any political party to claim that it and it alone speaks for the nation, and that for any of its political opponents to question that party is for them to attack the nation.\" The theme continued that of the Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, at his first head-to-head debate with Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, the previous evening. Billed as a tartan version of the Kennedy versus Nixon debates, but failing to live up to the hype, the debate saw Mr Dewar press Mr Salmond on whether a nationalist administration would immediately call a referendum on independence. Mr Salmond prevaricated, and it is certain that Labour will attempt to present the May 6 election as a choice between its policies of social justice and an SNP government bickering with Westminster over the terms of separation. Labour's first poster made this clear: \"Divorce is an expensive business. It won't be a trial separation with the SNP\", it announced, making no mention of Labour. However, Scottish Labour is not as worried about the nationalist threat as it once was, the party hierarchy believing that the message of the Labour administration being one of the great reforming governments is seeping through."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/06/davidsharrock","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-06T03:36:08Z","webTitle":"Jordan weeps for its king","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/06/davidsharrock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/06/davidsharrock","fields":{"headline":"Jordan weeps for its king","bodyText":"An era in Middle Eastern history was coming to an agonising close last night as King Hussein was declared clinically dead hours after he arrived home in his desert kingdom. The news unleashed a deluge of grief among Jordanians as most struggled to comprehend the loss of the only leader they have known - and the uncertain prospect of a new Hashemite king, Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah. \"King Hussein is clinically dead and is being kept alive on a life-support machine,\" said a court official. \"The king is in agony. He is being kept alive by artificial means. There is no more hope.\" The mood in the Jordanian capital was heavy. That the country was storm-lashed brought painful reminders of his triumphant return to Amman only 18 days earlier, when Hussein piloted his jet home from six months of chemotherapy for cancer, kissed the ground and declared himself restored. On that day it was also raining and bitterly cold, and the public which thronged the route from airport to palace gaily chanted \"the rain was jailed in the sky until the king came, even the blessing of the rain stopped until the king came back\". A drought had just been declared and it seemed like a miracle. The king did not want to disappoint his people and exposed himself to the elements for an hour. He soon came down with a fever and shortly after was informed that he had suffered a relapse. Yesterday Hussein brought the rain back with him again from the United States, but this time he and his people knew he was already as good as dead. \"Rain is always a blessing but it feels as if even the sky is weeping with us today,\" said a man sheltering near the Abdullah mosque. The pain was fresh and raw: the middle-aged, those who have lived under his shelter throughout Hussein's extraordinary 46-year reign, were the most uninhibited. Ali Maher, an architect who designed the King's Bab Sala'am palace and whose father was an army former chief-of-staff who helped thwart one of several coup attempts, was sobbing. \"He means everything to me, my whole life. When my father died his majesty came to our house. In life you eventually outgrow your father but he has managed not to be outgrown,\" he whispered. Ali Kassay, a former speechwriter to the king, said his mother could recall bouncing the young king on her knee. \"She had felt maternal towards him ever since. He was extremely gentle, there was not a single meeting without him giving me praise and thanks for my efforts.\" Maybe it was the weather or that it was the Muslim day of rest, or perhaps the thought of the king lying connected to a life support machine, but there was hardly a soul on the streets of Amman. People stayed close to their radios and televisions. State broadcasters switched to mournful music, readings from the Koran and footage from the king's life. All knew they were being prepared for an announcement that, in the words of a woman already wearing black and hiding her tears behind dark glasses, would \"make four and a half million people feel like orphans\". When the king arrived in the morning he was not in a coma but mortally stricken, clasping tightly the hand of Queen Noor. Later the Hashemites came to the hospital to pay their final respects to the patriarch, whose near-mystical belief in the destiny of his Bedouin family was the furnace with which Hussein forged a nation out of sand. His sister Basha was seen leaving in tears, as was Prince Hassan, the younger brother deposed by Hussein as his successor on Monday to clear the way for Prince Abdullah. Queen Noor stayed alone praying by his bedside for a while. Then the family gathered to decide when to shut down the machines that kept a heart beating inside a broken body. According to Muslim rite the deceased must be buried within 24 hours and Hussein, a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed, was a pious believer in the Koran. Preparations were underway for a state funeral which will be attended by world leaders, most likely tomorrow. Before that, Abdullah will today be sworn in as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan's fourth monarch. His dead father's cabinet will assemble to proclaim him and parliament will convene. All that will be left will be for Abdullah to select his crown prince. This could be either his own four-year-old son, Hussein, or his half-brother, Hamza, the 18-year-old apple of the deceased king's eye. Then the Middle East will be a different, unfamiliar and more frightening place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/06/2","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-06T03:37:00Z","webTitle":"Key player or playing field for rivals?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/06/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/06/2","fields":{"headline":"Key player or playing field for rivals?","bodyText":"It was no surprise that, even as King Hussein's chances of survival faded, the Israelis began warning of Arab strategic ambitions towards the Arab country which, more than any other, has helped them to fulfil their own. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's press adviser, David Bar-Illan, expressed Israel's concern about Syria's \"designs\" on Jordanian territory, and hinted that the new ruler might need Israel's protection. A Jordanian spokesman angrily dismissed these suggestions, and charged that if anyone had designs on Arab territory, it was Israel. It could be a portent of things to come. Jordan has always been the cockpit of the Arab-Israeli struggle, and, until there is a lasting Arab-Israeli peace, always will be. It is an intrinsically vulnerable country - small, sparsely populated and lacking in natural resources - sandwiched between neighbours more naturally powerful than itself. \"It has always had,\" said the leading Jordanian columnist Tariq Massarwa,\" and continues to have, two choices: either to be a key player in the region, or to be a playing field for others.\" It is the quality of the country's leadership that can make the critical difference between those two alternatives, and ultimately, between the survival of the monarchy - even the state itself - and their destruction. King Hussein had the necessary qualities in abundance. Like Israel, Jordan's Arab neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iraq, will be watching to see if Abdullah has them too. It is not just his foreign policies that will be under scrutiny, but his domestic ones too. For in Jordan the two are intertwined. The Hashemites' oldest Arab rival is the House of Saud. When King Abdul Aziz united the Arabian Peninsula under his banner he drove King Hussein's great-grandfather, the Shieriff Hussein of Mecca, out of the Hijaz. But it is a largely quiescent rivalry now. Thanks to its size, wealth, and tradition of regional ambition combined with turbulent domestic politics, Iraq, where once a fellow-Hashemite ruled, is always a far greater potential threat. It is the only Arab country which once stationed troops in the kingdom. It still supplies it with cheap oil. King Hussein's policies towards Saddam have oscillated wildly, from outright support to helping those who seek to overthrow him. Whether Saddam survives, or chaos follows his overthrow, Jordan will be uniquely exposed to whatever happens. But the most persistent source of potential trouble for any Jordanian ruler is President Assad's Syria. As with Iraq, relations with him have veered from the hostile to the cordial, from Syrian invasion during the civil war of \"Black September\" 1970 to a modest form of \"Arab unity\" a few years later. Assad's overriding obsession is Jordan's relations with Israel. When Hussein made his \"separate peace\" in 1994, he called it heresy. That he confined himself to such verbal abuse was attributable to his own ever weakening regional position, and to the fact that he wants a peace, though what he calls an honourable one, too. But when, last year, King Hussein moved Jordan closer to a new regional alliance between Israel and Syria's second most threatening neighour, Turkey, a commentator went on Damascus television to call into question Jordan's very raison d'etre. It always was an \"artifical entity\", he said, a part of \"southern Syria, and made up of scattered Bedouin who do not have the components of statehood.\" Each periodically accuses the other of subversive intentions. Nothing would allay the Syrian danger to Jordan more than an Israeli-Syrian peace. Indeed, in making his own, Hussein was gambling that, in the end, he would encourage an ever more lonely Assad to do likewise. But it never happened. Meanwhile, the new king will be preoccupied with the dangers not from his fellow Arab rulers, but from Israel-Palestine. More than anything else, a breakdown in the Oslo peace process is liable to \"destabilise\" Jordan from within, and present Syria and other Arab powers with the kind of self-aggrandising or subversive opportunities which they last enjoyed in the early years of King Hussein's long reign. Even if Abdullah turns out to be cast in the paternal mould, his kingdom will never be secure from Arab \"designs\" until it is from Israel's."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/06/1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-06T03:37:04Z","webTitle":"Old challenges for Amman's young elite","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/06/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/06/1","fields":{"headline":"Old challenges for Amman's young elite","bodyText":"With the passing of Hussein bin Talal, the third monarch of a desert kingdom carved out of the sand by Winston Churchill with the stroke of his pen on a Sunday afternoon 80 years ago, a chapter closes on the Middle East's turbulent history. The king, long seen as an oasis of stability in a region of violent political tempest, has left his legacy with his eldest son and heir, Abdullah, the half-British career soldier who for most of his 37 years never dreamed of ascending to the Hashemite throne. It is an enormous challenge. Some 85 per cent of his 4.5 million subjects were born after Hussein took power at the age of 18 in May 1953. For them Hussein was Jordan. And in his absence a long-ignored question is again asked: what is Jordan? The capital, Amman, is a deceptive city, built originally on seven hills like Rome but now a sprawling concrete metropolis where shortages mean many neighbourhoods have running water for only a few hours a week. Books@Cafe used to be a popular haunt of Abdullah before his father plucked him from princely obscurity and deposed his uncle Hassan as next-in-line to the throne. This cyber cafe-cum-bookshop is where Jordan's young elite, upon which the fate of the country rests, chooses to hang out. \"He's cute!\" says 17-year-old Rana of the new king. \"But he doesn't speak Arabic so well. They've had to get a tutor for him after that speech on television.\" Her friend Wassim says that replacing Prince Hassan with Prince Abdullah was \"an irrational decision\". \"Everyone thinks that it's a CIA thing.\" The group of six friends is divided about the competing merits of their new ruler and Prince Hassan, the man who had been expected to take over. \"Abdullah will be more tolerant than Hassan, who doesn't like the Palestinians [70 per cent of the population]. Hassan's way too cold and intellectual. \"It was a shock when Hussein dismissed him, people were disgusted. They're saying that Abdullah's not going to last and that they're getting Hamza [the 18-year-old son of Queen Noor and King Hussein] ready. But that's Amman for you, it just runs on rumour.\" The most useful word in the kingdom, they say, is wasta, meaning connections - and of course that too is a gift of the dead king. \"Everything works on wasta here. You want a place in school, a driving licence, your electricity fixed, you have to have wasta. People here know you by your last name, not your first. Everything depends on what family you're from,\" says one. Even so, part of the mix in this stew of emotions about their identity is pride in Hussein's acheivements. \"He wasn't much older than I am now when he came to power and he created this country out of a desert,\" says another. \"The Hashemites are holding the country together now, I can't see a proper government working here because people are too corrupt. \"Sometimes we watch Jordan TV news just to laugh at the endless stories of the royal family shaking hands with important people. Maybe one day they'll become like the British royal family, but they're all we've got.\" But Prince Abdullah, whose Palestinian wife, Rania, may be a key to Jordan's future, has swapped the cafe for the court. Power flows between the palaces of Amman, not the two houses of parliament where wasta can guarantee you a seat. But opinion is divided over whether Prince Abdullah will try to democratise the system. \"He will have to delegate responsibility and give the institutions a big boost,\" says an optimist. \"It got so bad under Hussein that the place only functioned when he was around.\" Another political scientist is not so sure. \"The change in the succession makes no sense... Abdullah is politically a non-entity. He has all the ugly sides of his father - the fast cars and women - but none of his father's qualities - his charisma, cunning and shrewdness. \"People often say that Hussein was a benign dictator but he was very corrupt. The economy has deteriorated to the point that we're near breakdown. His strategy was always to corrupt his enemies, blind them with money. \"Basically it was a coup, the old power elite was afraid that Hassan would 'clean the house'. They are happier with Abdullah, because they know he too will be corrupted. He won't rock the boat. This country could be another Lebanon. But Jordan is only as stable as its neighbours want it to be, and they want things to stay as they are. Although the region is ripe for further instability, each neighbour benefits from Jordan, the kingdom derided as a British \"buffer state\" at its creation. That is why Jordanians will overlook Hussein's bizarre and rash decision to trounce his brother Hassan, the king-in-waiting for 34 years, and give Abdullah a chance to lead the nation into the new millennium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/06/8","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-06T03:37:08Z","webTitle":"A friend to  both Arabs and West bequeaths security to Jordan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/06/8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/06/8","fields":{"headline":"A friend to  both Arabs and West bequeaths security to Jordan","bodyText":"Hussein's kingdom was an unpromising inheritance when the teenage Hashemite came to the throne in 1952, and his greatest achievement is that he leaves Jordan in far better shape than anyone could have predicted then. Forty-seven years ago, Jordan was economically unviable, socially divided, and with powerful and predatory neighbours who had little to fear from its British-officered army, the Arab Legion. Other Middle Eastern monarchies have long been swept away - the fellow Hashemites in Iraq, the Senussis of Libya, Iran's Pahlavis - but Hussein's dynasty is firmly in control. And despite worries about the succession going to his untried son, Abdullah, the signs are that it will continue to be so. Haunted by the assassination of his grandfather Abdullah by a Palestinian outside a Jerusalem mosque, Hussein spent his life maneouvering through the treacherous waters of the Arab-Israeli conflict and in a region where he was often vilified as a pliant tool of the western powers which backed him. Long the \"best of enemies\" with the Jewish state, he astutely signed a formal peace treaty only in 1994, when the weak and demoralised Palestinians had already taken the plunge at Oslo. President Clinton's tribute this week was heartfelt: at critical stages in the faltering negotiating process, Hussein played a vital role and he will be badly missed. But perpetually torn between his inherited commitment to the Arab cause and his pragmatic need to to reach accommodation with a dangerous foe, Hussein made some grave errors. His worst was in 1967, when he lost the West Bank and the Muslim holy places of East Jerusalem to Israel. It was a mistake he avoided next time round in October 1973. Journalists dubbed him the PLK - \"plucky little king\" - but he enjoyed his action-man image and his personal bravery was often striking - in confronting coup attempts by Nasserists or Ba'athists during the 1950s and in the dangerous period after the Six Day War. In 1970, when the armed presence of Yasser Arafat's fedayeen threatened his kingdom, his Bedouin troops killed thousands in a bloody civil war that made the name Black September a byword for vengeful terrorism. But when that was over he was to prove an astute manager of the Jordanian-Palestinian balance, co-opting enough loyal Palestinians - today at least 60 per cent of the country's 4.2 million population - to disprove the dangerous claim of Israeli extremists like Ariel Sharon, that Jordan was Palestinian. But he had many critics: in the small world of Amman society, even with periodic crackdowns on a naturally tame press, complaints of royal corruption were often heard. And no-one forgot the embarassing old story that he received an annual payment from the CIA. Yet at home and abroad his kingly courtesy won admirers: his habit of clutching the elbow as he shook your hand was a gesture both strong and intimate; his womanising was old-fashioned and relentless. And if Alan Clark, as Margaret Thatcher's indiscreet minister for defence procurement, famously found Hussein \"an oily little runt,\" others appreciated the king's perfect manners. He was a regular visitor to Downing Street long after Britain's Middle Eastern moment had passed, though his relationship with the US became more politically important. Hussein's links with both countries were most severely tested in 1990, when he supported Saddam Hussein, albeit without enthusiasm, and stayed out of the US-led Arab coalition that helped eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Jordanians were bitter about what they saw as the different standards being applied to Kuwait and Palestine. Westerners failed to appreciate the depth of the Arab frustration that Saddam was able to tap, and to see how the king had little choice but to ride the angry tiger of Arab nationalism and anti-Americanism. Jordan's domestic front posed many challenges, too: the 1989 riots, created by the sudden removal of government subsidies to comply with IMF reforms, marked an end to the fat years of the \"Gucci kingdom.\" With explosive population growth and all the attendant infrastructure and employment problems, that shock to the system triggered a cautious process of democratisation, in which Muslim fundamentalists have been effectively co-opted or controlled. When Leith Shbeilat, one of the most articulate of them, was freed from prison, Hussein - in a classic gesture - personally drove him home. Uniquely in the Arab world, Hussein's surefooted rule has meant that there is no potentially violent organised opposition waiting in ambush. Jordan is not liable to become another Algeria or Egypt. The army and security services are loyal and effective without the brutality routine elsewhere in the region. Yet even in his dying days the king must have worried about the uncertain impact of Palestine's political future, with the probable emergence of a semi-sovereign Palestinian state complicating Jordan's longer-term stability. Seven years ago, when his long struggle against cancer was just beginning, the man who has come to so closely personify his country that it has sometimes been hard to separate the two, started to urge his anxious subjects to brace themselves for a future without him. \"The life of an enlightened people and vibrant nation cannot be measured by the life of an individual,\" he declared then. \"A successful person is one who manages to lay down a new stone, a brick that would help firm up his nation's existence.\" It was vintage Hussein, a dignified and carefully calibrated perfomance, full of comfortingly familiar references to Jordan's history, the Hashemite dynasty and the Great Arab Revolt against the Turks in the first world war. But he also looked ahead. \"L'état,\" he said, \"ce n'est pas moi.\" Hussein-watchers see this speech as one of his greatest moments. The monument to the Middle East's longest-surviving ruler is all around him, a tough little kingdom that has adapted to survive multiple crises at home and abroad, sometimes against heavy odds, and is there to stay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/07/theobserver3","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-07T18:04:52Z","webTitle":"Challenge to Abdullah as old rulers leave stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/07/theobserver3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/07/theobserver3","fields":{"headline":"Challenge to Abdullah as old rulers leave stage","bodyText":"Amid the uncertainty surrounding the transition of power from King Hussein to Abdullah, his little-known eldest son, the new king's career in the Jordanian armed forces is considered a plus for future stability. There is an assumption here about what matters most: the support of the army and security forces, the bedrock of the tribal bedouin tradition in the desert kingdom founded under British auspices half a century ago. Much less is said about Jordan's experiment with democracy over the past decade, or its efforts to restructure the economy under IMF guidelines, both considered a credit to the legacy of Hussein, but no guarantee of regime legitimacy and future prosperity. What counts is the power base of the monarch and his ability to manage internal and regional tensions. The same calculations are being made about Jordan's Arab neighbours. The stability of Egypt, Syria, Iraq and the Gulf monarchies also depends on the personalities of their rulers and the backing of the military. Most of the men at the top are in their seventies and mechanisms are not in place to ensure a smooth transition to a new generation. In the republics of Egypt, Syria and Iraq, elections will theoretically decide, but there is probably more certainty about the succession in the Gulf monarchies. Even here, though, the old guard will shortly give way to younger men, conditioned by the oil boom but with no prospect of a return to such abundance and profligacy. History provides no comfort on the subject of succession. President Mubarak of Egypt came to power after President Sadat was assassinated for making peace with Israel. Presidents Assad of Syria and Saddam Hussein of Iraq fought their way to the top in bloody coups. King Hussein rose to the throne after the shooting of his grandfather, King Abdullah, and thereafter was himself the object of repeated assassination attempts. In the Gulf the most recent succession, in Qatar, was decided by a palace coup. Whatever the manner of their arrival in power, current Arab leaders have ensured stability simply by their longevity. Under their auspices, the identities of the states carved out of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War have been consolidated. It is not likely these states will unravel, even if there are succession crises. That said, the future could be bleak because of domestic tensions. A population explosion has shifted the demographic balance and government budgets cannot meet the increasing needs for education and welfare. Unemployment is rising, but the Arab economies are only slowly adjusting to the need to restructure. Measures to end subsidies on staple goods have caused riots in Egypt and Jordan recently. Two unresolved conflicts still threaten peace in the Middle East. The future of Iraq hangs in the balance, with UN Security Council members undecided on whether to work for the overthrow of the Iraqi government. On the Arab-Israeli front, King Hussein's peace efforts have produced scant rewards for ordinary Jordanians and Palestinians. For now, the peace process is held hostage to Israeli elections in May. Ironically, even though Israel has a democratic system, electoral returns could be inconclusive and the resulting coalition hidebound, as its predecessor was, by sectional politics. More uncertain still is the succession in the Palestinian Authority. President Arafat's health is not good and, with his passing, the Israelis will have lost both their main partners in the process that produced the Oslo accords in 1993 and the treaty with Jordan in 1994. In the circumstances, it is no surprise that so much emphasis is being placed on the traditional pillars of authority in Jordan. • Dr Rosemary Hollis is head of the Middle East programmme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/feb/08/guardianobituaries.davidhirst","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-08T08:49:29Z","webTitle":"King Hussein bin Talal, King of Jordan obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/feb/08/guardianobituaries.davidhirst","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/feb/08/guardianobituaries.davidhirst","fields":{"headline":"King Hussein bin Talal, King of Jordan obituary","bodyText":"Even at the relatively early age of 63, at which, after a long struggle with lymphatic cancer, King Hussein bin Talal finally succumbed, he was the longest-serving ruler not merely in the Middle East, where leaders notoriously outlive their fitness to govern, but in the world. His nearest rivals, Fidel Castro and influential ex-leader Lee Kwan Yew, were both older, but had come to office six years after him. He knew nine American presidents, and over 90 per cent of his subjects can recall no other ruler. That illness struck him down before political upheaval was remarkable enough; even more so was that he died commanding such affection and respect, albeit reluctant in some measure, from his own people, the Arabs and the world. For when, in 1953, the 17-year-old youth ascended the throne, few thought he would last long; and the polity over which he was to preside, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, seemed liable to disappear with him. The state, Transjordan, which Winston Churchill once boasted that he had created 'on a Sunday afternoon' in 1923, had been an artificial affair from the outset. It was a legacy of the Arab Revolt which, with British aid, had driven the Ottomans from their last, Arab provinces in the first world war. The Hashemites were a princely family descended from the Prophet Muhammad (the name deriving from his great-grandfather Hashim), but the Revolt was the national struggle to which they always harked back as a more contemporary source of legitimacy. It was also the root of their tragedy. Imperial Britain had promised the Sheriff Hussein of Mecca, the late King's great-grandfather, that he would inherit a free, independent kingdom embracing all those Ottoman provinces. But Britain and France cynically carved up the area between them. France got a League of Nations 'mandate' for Syria and Lebanon. Britain got one for Transjordan, where it installed the Sheriff's son Abdullah as king, and Iraq, which became another Hashemite kingdom. In Palestine, it created a 'national home' for the Jewish people. With the conquest and dispersal of its native population in 1948, the 'national home' became the State of Israel, and it was above all that calamity which was to shape the destiny of any Jordanian ruler, furnishing him with opportunities for aggrandisement, or the traps of his own destruction. The future king had his first, brutal encounter with that inescapable reality at the age of 15. King Abdullah was murdered before his eyes. For him it was an especially poignant, personal tragedy. The extrovert Abdullah had been bitterly disappointed with Talal, his son and heir and Hussein's father, because he was not cast in his own 'brave, intrepid, Bedouin' mould. He had doted on his grandson instead. And for Hussein, his grandfather was, and remained, 'the man to whom I owe more than I can say'. Politically, Abdullah had been the dominant personality of the Arab East; he never hid his ambitions; 'nothing', he used to say, 'will prevent my accession to the throne of Damascus.' But by the 1950s, new revolutionary forces, led by the emergent Arab champion, Colonel Nasser of Egypt, were convulsing the region. They cast Abdullah, and his fellow-Hashemites in Iraq, as 'imperialist lackeys' and 'reactionaries' whom the people's wrath would sweep away. Abdullah had indeed enlarged his hitherto tranquil Transjordanian backwater; but instead of Damascus, he had acquired that part of Palestine, the West Bank, which the Zionists failed to conquer in their 1948 'war of independence'. His enemies said he had conspired with the British and the Zionists. Others contended that his Arab Legion had done more than any other Arab army to save what could be saved of Palestine. Part of the trouble was that the Legion still had a British commander, Glubb Pasha, and, in the climate of the times, such charges had a mischievous plausibility, especially for Abdullah's new subjects, the seething, destitute, resentful refugees. It was also built around the most conservative, traditionalist component of Jordanian society, its tribal Bedouins, unconcerned with doctrine. It was a Palestinian assassin who, in July 1951, put a pistol to Abdullah's ear in Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque. As Hussein rushed to his aid, he saw his 'so-called friends, those men of dignity and high estate, doubled up, scattering like bent old women'. He was so disgusted, he later confided to his autobiography, that he never wanted to be king. And he wasn't, immediately. His father Talal came straight from his Swiss sanatorium to the Basman Palace in Amman, while Hussein had to leave Victoria College in Alexandria for Harrow. There, 'a man among boys', he felt spurned and lonely; he knew no one save his cousin Faisal, uncrowned king of Iraq; his schoolmates were 'rather snobbish'; and instead of soccer, they played the strange game of rugby. But Hussein recalled his grandfather's advice: 'always do your very best, regardless of all setbacks and difficulties.' The diminutive Crown Prince made an ideal scrum half, and the privileged Englishmen finally accepted this highest-born of Arabs. Before long, the gentle, tragic, and incurably schizophrenic Talal was declared unfit to rule. His son took full powers on May 2, 1953. It was to be a long, long time, not until the early 1990s, before his subjects granted him the acceptance he had won from his Harrow schoolmates, but when they finally did, it was gratifying beyond compare. The proof of it came after an earlier, apparently successful conquest of the cancer that eventually killed him. Upon his return from treatment in the US, a full third of the Jordanian people, with once-embittered Palestinian camp-dwellers among them, came out to greet him. It was described at the time as a rapturous, spontaneous welcome unseen in the Middle East since Ayatollah Khomeini's home-coming after the fall of the Shah. The two welcomes could not be compared in scale or significance, yet they did share a landmark quality. Just as the first great triumph of Islamic fundamentalism shook all the secular modernist assumptions of the age, so Arab intellectuals puzzled over this metamorphosis in the fortunes of one of the region's numerous potentates. His people's tribute amounted to a signal victory for the erstwhile 'reactionaries' over erstwhile 'revolutionaries'. It was as a Hashemite that he did it. He insisted on that. Not that - he once told me -his noble lineage conferred an automatic right to rule. 'No, sir' - the honorific he best-owed on all with that flattering charm that was a family trait - 'no, sir, I would step down if I felt my people no longer wanted me.' Being of 'the oldest house, the oldest tribe' in the area, he believed he had a right and duty to 'help our Arab nation', that he could rise above 'differences and interests'; and that he should always strive to fulfil the trust which his grandfather had bequeathed him. He had never been an intellectual, an abstract political theoriser. It was the ordinary, human virtues he exalted; and the old Harrovian in him, the understated semi-Englishman, surely contributed to his exaltation of one above all others - the modest, homespun ambition always to 'do one's best'. That would not have sufficed without luck, though perhaps his famed baraka (charm) was really no more than the natural attribute of the natural leader. Necessary too was a sense of timing which was born of great patience in the taking of decisions, along with great resolution, courage - and occasional ruthlessness - in carrying them out. Within a year of his accession, the impetuous 18-year-old ordered his first prime minister to relax controls on political parties and newspapers, and, then, in 1956, to hold multi-party elections. That was also the year when, to the delight of his people and the outrage of the rightwing British press, he peremptorily sacked the devoted, almost saintly, but irritatingly paternalistic Glubb Pasha. The dismissal dramatised the central, personally undeserved dilemma of the earlier, more perilous, part of his reign. The only way to achieve domestic consent and popularity was to give free rein to political forces. Yet that was tantamount to ensuring, by his own hand, the dissolution of the monarchy, even the state itself. For the Kingdom's dominant political movements - Nasserist, Ba'athist, communist - all drew their strength and inspiration from the wider Arab arena, all viewed the monarchy as a British creation which did not, could not, enjoy any authentic Arab legitimacy. Thus, however genuine in themselves, royal concessions to popular sentiment were in the end but dangerous sops to the surging, Nasser-led passions of the time. Monarchs everywhere trembled on their thrones, but none was exposed like Hussein, with his small, poor, British-subsidised realm hemmed in on three sides by richer, more powerful Arab states, and an aggressive, expansionist young Israel on the fourth. The refugees hung on Cairo Radio's every word, its blood-curdling calls to rid the region of British puppets; ugly riots swept Amman; the Israelis staged murderous, wantonly provocative raids on sleeping frontier villages; neighbouring republics plotted coups with their local accessories. Would-be assassins tried to poison Hussein, once killing off most of the palace cats instead; putting acid in his sinus drops on another occasion. Once, piloting his grandfather's De Havilland Dove, he came under attack by two Syrian MiG-17s, and extracted from that ageing aircraft feats of hedge-hopping aerobatics that almost tore it asunder. His moment of maximum peril came in July 1958, when, with his cousin Faisal's murder, the other, Iraqi branch of the Hashemite dynasty was swept away in another triumph of the new, 'revolutionary' Arab order. Hussein called the British back; the paratroopers flew in from Cyprus at six hours' notice. He had survived again - but all too spectacularly demonstrated the price of doing so. Only by forfeiting domestic popularity, and the good will, or sufferance, of the republican Arab regimes, could he make himself master in his own house. Just how long could he last? The Sunday Times noted that 'when he drives out from his palace his car is escorted by 12 jeeps, each carrying four soldiers armed with Bren guns'. The Washington Post said flatly that 'Hussein will probably leave when the British do'. But last he did. With the Eisenhower Doctrine and superpower rivalry in the Middle East at its height, he strayed further from the liberalism with which he began. His opponents languished in gaol; there was torture; and a few died under it. Then, out of the blue, came another of those external upheavals to which, in the very cockpit of the Arab-Israeli struggle, Jordan was exposed. In June 1967, in his last, great reconciliation with Nasser and the 'revolutionary' camp, he joined a defence pact with Egypt - and promptly lost the Palestinian half of his kingdom in the Six-Day war. That led to the second great crisis of his reign, the rise of Yasser Arafat's fedayeen, who, despairing of Arab regimes, launched a 'popular liberation war' of their own - choosing a Jordan now reduced to its original, Trans- Jordanian dimension as the place from which to do it. In 1968, at a famous press conference, the King was obliged to declare 'we are all fedayeen'. But, two years later, in September 1970, he unleashed his faithful Bedouins, and, in 10 days of fratricidal strife, broke the back of the guerrillas' state-within-his-state; then he drove them out of their remaining bases in a campaign so remorseless that scores crossed the Jordan, surrendering to the Israelis rather than fall into the hands of his vengeful troops. To most Palestinians it seemed unforgivable, and the struggle between them and the Hashemites took new and vicious forms; Jordan became the first target of the Black September terrorist organisation. But, in due course, Hussein was induced to recognise the PLO as 'the sole legitimate representative of the Palestine people', in effect renouncing his claim to what he had lost in 1967. The conflict gradually diminished; the PLO's standing declined as the King's slowly rose. Others, such as Ba'athist Syria, were to do worse to the Palestinians, with less justification. And this became the central feature of a much larger reality. To be sure, the King owed his eventual acclaim to his own achievements, but nothing, in the measuring of them, helped like the manifest failings of others. 'Can one,' wrote the Palestinian political scientist As'ad Abdul Rahman in a study of the King's public esteem of the early 1990s, 'compare regimes which kill tens, hundreds, perhaps thousands -publicly or secretly, no matter - with a regime which always did its utmost to kill no one?' With a regime which, even in the worst of its repression, when the King really did have his back to the wall, was never as bad as its neighbours at their most lenient? Back in 1957, Hussein's friend, Ali Abu Nuwar, newly promoted commander of the Arab Legion, gave Hussein his first, bitter taste of personal betrayal. 'I could not bring myself to put him to death. I have certainly been criticised for this act of mercy. but there it is - I couldn't do it.' In the fullness of time, all his former adversaries were to pay tribute to this obdurate gift of reconciliation. 'I told him' - said Yaakoub Zeidin, the communist party leader 12 times imprisoned - 'that we were once young and very extreme, and he replied that 'we, too, were young and made mistakes'.' Under him, former plotters regularly re-emerged as ministers and even, in one remarkable case, as head of intelligence. Sheer longevity did in the end become an asset rather than the liability it usually is. Without the solid reserve of credit it conferred, he might not have risked those steps which eventually raised him, morally, far above any other regime in the region. One was the juridical and administrative 'disengagement' from the West Bank that followed the Palestinian intifada. Another, more important, one was the 'democratic experiment' that followed the 1989 food riots in the loyalist, Transjordanian half of his Kingdom and his chastened recognition that, in his aloofness, he he had been unaware of the full extent of his people's grievances. And a third was the 'independent', 'nationalist' line he took during the Gulf crisis, one that led him, for the first time, into fully-fledged opposition to the bizarre coalition of forces - including the US, fellow Arab monarchies, and one-time 'revolutionary' regimes -which drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait by force of arms. It was this accumulated capital that subsequently enabled him, with minimum risk, to take the most fateful decision of his career, one whose ultimate consequences, for better or for worse, he has not lived to see. On the issue of issues, Palestine, he had always been an advocate of peace long before others dared to think of it; where they insisted that the lost homeland must be 'liberated', he said that the Arabs must come to terms with the Zionist intruder. He had many a secret meeting with Israeli leaders. It earned him great obloquy. But he never 'sold out'; in fact those who once taxed him with 'treason' preceded him to it. In 1979 came the first of those supposedly beneficent earthquakes, the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. It was not until 1993, that, with Oslo, Yasser Arafat - Mr Palestine himself - precipitated the second, whose shockwaves, for Jordan, were so grave that the King could only contain them by doing likewise. In November 1994, he concluded the Jordan-Israeli peace treaty. It was not a popular move at home (far from it) but by now such was his prestige, and so much greater were the sins of others in the region, that he carried it off without incurring the extreme hostility which it would have in the past. By now, falling in with outside, 'imperialist', nay Zionist, designs did not bring automatic disgrace with his own people. Still, the 'King's peace' became a very lonely, a very personal venture. To be sure, for the foreseeable future, it secured his Kingdom against obvious perils. Not the least of these was an alarming new variant on an old nightmare: the fear that the Israelis and Arafat together would work to transform his Hashemite kingdom into a Republic of Palestine. At a stroke, he turned the tables on his oldest adversary. Now, he was Israel's partner, and an infinitely more natural one that the former 'terrorist' chieftain could ever be. Characteristically, having chosen his audacious course, he followed it with complete, unswerving dedication. His would be a 'warm' peace; only thus could it yield its full fruits, and thereby undermine the opposition to it that might in due course destroy it - and perhaps his kingdom with it. It was ultimately vital not only that his own people sincerely accept it, but that others, Syria especially, emulate him in their turn. Syrian-Israeli peace was, and remains, the as-yet uninserted arch of the temple without which the whole construction might eventually come crashing down. But it did not even bring the strictly material gains that might, in some measure, have made up for the historic surrender implicit in the making of it. Instead of economic prosperity, there was deepening hardship. After the opposition political parties, the ordinary man increasingly turned against it too. That, in turn, brought a withering of the 'democratic experiment' which was the King's proudest achievement. Honestly consulted, his people would have rejected it. His popularity went into sharp decline. And then, to crown it all, came Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. The King had done as much as he single-handedly could to impress the Israelis with the authenticity of the Arabs' acceptance, at last, of the alien state in their midst. In fact, to many of his subjects, he seemed to fly extravagantly in the face of natural sentiment, the ties of history, nation and culture. Invidious contrasts were drawn between the King's lamentations at the slaughter of Israelis in Hamas suicide bombings and the mildness of the reproaches he addressed to the Israelis themselves when they slaughtered villagers in South Lebanon. In a supreme gesture of symbolic penitence he knelt and prayed with Israeli families mourning the death of seven schoolgirls murdered by a Jordanian soldier who 'went crazy'. It earned no comparable magnanimity from the other side. On the contrary, the Israel of Netanyahu rewarded this most generous of former enemies with the same arrogance that it heaped on Palestinians and Arabs in general. It finally stirred even the King himself to eloquent and despairing remonstrances. All that he and his Hashemite forebears had striven for, 'final reconciliation between all the descendants of the children of Abraham', was in danger of being destroyed even as it came within reach of final accomplishment. But the warning fell on deaf ears. Ultimately, in its own conception of itself, the Hashemite destiny must be pan-Arab, or not exist at all. Hussein always hankered after a wider stage than the fragment of the Arab whole to which, for nearly 46 years, he was confined. He occasionally flirted with the larger, regional ambitions of his grandfather - though Baghdad, formerly Hashemite too, rather than Damascus, was the direction from which opportunity beckoned him. But it was not to be: the monstrous Saddam Hussein has outlived him. As a result, though the Jordan he leaves behind may look an altogether sturdier fragment than the Jordan he first inherited, it remains a fragment nonetheless, diminutive, artificial, and - in the absence of a stable Middle East with a true Arab-Israeli peace at its heart - as ultimately threatened from within and without as it ever was. Not the least of the perils it faces is the very departure - and in the additionally unfavourable circumstances of a death-bed change of heart over who should succeed him - of the King who became so indistinguishable from the kingdom he ruled. And, many fear, so indispensable to it too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/08/davidsharrock","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-08T09:46:48Z","webTitle":"Leaders flock to Hussein funeral","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/08/davidsharrock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/08/davidsharrock","fields":{"headline":"Leaders flock to Hussein funeral","bodyText":"The state funeral of King Hussein of Jordan, who died yesterday after a protracted battle against cancer, will bring together scores of heads of states and dignitaries in a procession that will test the limits of international diplomacy. World leaders were last night beginning to congregate in Amman for today's official mourning in a ceremony that will require Arab and Israeli statesmen to mingle with President Clinton, a high-level delegation from Iraq and possibly even President Yeltsin. After being sworn in as the new monarch of the Hashemite kingdom, King Abdullah in his first executive act named his 18-year-old half brother Hamza, King Hussein's favourite son, as the new crown prince. Jordan radio said the decision was taken in accordance with the late king's wishes. The crown prince's American-born mother, Queen Noor, was King Hussein's fourth wife and Hamza spent months at his father's bedside while he was treated unsuccessfully for lymphatic cancer in the United States. King Abdullah, a 37-year-old military officer with little experience of the corridors of power, was sworn in as the new monarch less than three hours after his father's death was announced to a grieving nation. In a televised address to Jordan's 4.6 million people, the new king vowed to follow his father's policies, including the course of diplomatic engagement with Israel which Jordan has pursued since 1994. \"We will preserve the course that Hussein set,\" Abdullah said. \"King Hussein was a father to every one of you, as he was my father. Today you are my brothers and sisters and you are dear to me.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/08/davidsharrock1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-08T09:46:51Z","webTitle":"Jordanians mourn king of charity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/08/davidsharrock1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/08/davidsharrock1","fields":{"headline":"Jordanians mourn king of charity","bodyText":"Now the 40 days of mourning begin. The grief in Jordan is unfathomable at the passing of King Hussein, with brave Bedouin men weeping as freely as their wives and children in the rain-lashed country, but already the Hashemite kingdom has a new monarch, King Abdullah the Second, \"Abu Hussein\". When the end came we were sitting with the mukhtar of Mukhayan al-Hussein camp, chief of 60,000 Palestinian refugees, whose fealty to the deceased Hussein is proudly emblazoned on the fading plastered walls of his simple one-floor house. Every invitation that Sheikh Ismael al-Azeh ever received from the king - to attend royal receptions, festive and solemn occasions - has been carefully framed and mounted. The sheikh had not slept since Hussein was flown home on Friday. He apologised for the lack of hospitality; in this traditional society it would be impolite to serve the thimbles of welcoming coffee while the king hovered between life and death. He served Coca-Cola instead, his coffee pot remained turned upside down. Suddenly the television programme switched to an imam singing mournful verses from the Koran. The sheikh's head slumped into his hands and his shoulders heaved in sobs. A presenter, looking as stricken as the sheikh, made the announcement in Arabic. \"Believing in God's will and with deep sorrow, the cabinet tells the Jordanian people and all our brothers in the Muslim world, and all our friends around the world, of the death of the dearest among men, His Hashemite Majesty, King Hussein Bin Talal the Great, king of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, dean of the House of the Prophet, whom God has chosen to be next to him and who passed to heaven at 11.43am. \"The cabinet asks that God will be compassionate with His Majesty and that He will give him a place among those He loves. We are from God and we go back to God.\" The sheikh, speechlessly began making the bitter coffee that every Jordanian will drink for the next 40 days. A freezing fog had descended on the Hussein Medical Centre, where the king had lain unconscious for three days. Thousands were gathered in front of its arched gates. The atmosphere was close to psychotic, with the shabab (young men of the streets) furiously chanting: \"There is only one God, and Hussein is beloved by God. \"We would give our blood and our souls for you,\" they sang, tears streaming down cheeks. Some rent their clothes while women and men fainted, the police gently shoving the surging mob back from the gates. The eerie call of the Koranic verse for the dead lingered. Mafayel Muhera, an ancient Bedouin woman from Wadi Seir, had spent the weekend outside the hospital, the least she felt she could do. Three years ago her son Ali had been in trouble, she explained, for wounding a fellow soldier during army service. He was in prison and the family had no money. Mafayel walked to the Raghadan palace and waited. When Hussein's convoy of cars drew near she began screaming and jumping to catch his attention. It worked. He ordered his drivers to stop and stepped out to meet her. \"They were trying to drag me away but His Majesty told them to leave me alone,\" she shouted above the din, tears running down her craggy tattooed face. \"Eventually he told them to take his own car and to drive me home. A day later I was reunited with my son, and two days after that word came from the royal court that I should go there.\" She arrived to find that Hussein had awarded her a monthly gift of money. \"I've killed myself as much as I've cried, he's so dear to me. I hoped to die in his place,\" said Mafayel. In Amman yesterday a joyless procession of cars bearing black flags blocked the thoroughfares in the thickening fog. Out of the gloom surged a royal entourage and for a fleeting moment we saw Hussein's sons being driven in a Range Rover to the parliament. There was Faisal, the younger brother of the newly crowned King Abdullah; Ali, son of the late Queen Alia; Hamza, Hussein's favourite, the eldest son of Queen Noor; and finally Hashem, at 16 years the youngest of Hussein's male heirs. Each one was wearing the formal red and white chequered keffiya headdress. Their faces were blank sheets; young men hurrying to crown their eldest brother, with the body of their deceased father still warm. The kingdom's Bedouin army formed an honour guard outside the parliament, whose members scurried to escape the foul weather. Inside it fell to Zaid Rifai, the speaker of the upper house and a former prime minister, to usher in the era of the new king. His face and voice betrayed the turmoil he felt. A few words for the dead monarch - \"the leader, the inspirer, the loss of the nation, of the whole world . . . we hope he is in heaven now.\" And then, \"in accordance with article 89 of the constitution, King Abdullah, son of Hussein, will take the oath.\" There was scattered applause as Abdullah marched into the chamber, pausing in front of a full-length portrait of his father, ramrod straight, his fists clenched so tight his knuckles were white. Placing a hand on the Koran, Abdullah spoke. \"I swear in God's name that I will uphold the constitution and be loyal to the nation.\" And that was it. As he marched out as smartly as he had entered, Zaid Rifai, in a stronger voice, said: \"May God take care of King Abdullah. Long live Jordan . . . free and strong beneath the flag of the Hashemite family.\" Today they come to bury the old king, from East and West. It will be a simple funeral, in keeping with his humility and piety. Last night his body was removed from the hospital to spend a final night in his palace, Bab el-Salam, the Gate of Peace, where his American-born wife, Queen Noor, was being comforted by relatives. Neither she nor his other wife, the British-born Princess Muna, mother of King Abdullah the Second, who is only the fourth Jordanian ruler, will be visible today, in accordance with Muslim custom. As tributes poured in from around the world, Jordanians were remembering the man most think of as the father of their nation. Fawaz Kreisha, an old schoolmate of Hussein, remembered his act of charity to a waiter in the royal palace who had tried to poison the king. The plot was uncovered and the waiter was jailed. A year later Hussein was returning after prayers marking the end of the annual Haj pilgrimage to Mecca when he spotted the waiter's children standing outside the palace. He turned to the chief of the royal court and asked: \"How can I spend the Eid [feast] with my children and these children are without their father? Go get their father from prison and bring the children inside so we can all eat together.\" It was a typical, extraordinary act of charity and it seems every Jordanian has a similar story to tell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/feb/08/leadersandreply.mainsection","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-08T23:54:14Z","webTitle":"From the archive: The death of Jordan's King Hussein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/feb/08/leadersandreply.mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/feb/08/leadersandreply.mainsection","fields":{"headline":"Hussein: the path to long rule","bodyText":"Even at the relatively early age of 63, at which King Hussein bin Talal finally succumbed, he was the longest-serving ruler not merely in the Middle East but in the world. That illness struck him down before political upheaval was remarkable enough; even more so was that he died commanding such respect from his own people, the Arabs and the world. For when, in 1953, the 17-year-old youth ascended the throne, few thought he would last long; and the polity over which he was to preside, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, seemed liable to disappear with him. The state Transjordan, had been an artificial affair from the outset. It was a legacy of the Arab Revolt which, with British aid, had driven the Ottomans from their last Arab provinces in the first world war. It was also the root of the [Hashemite] tragedy. Imperial Britain had promised the Sheriff Hussein of Mecca, the late King's great-grandfather, that he would inherit an independent kingdom. But Britain and France carved up the area between them. Britain got one for Transjordan, where it installed the Sheriff's son Abdullah as king, and Iraq, which became another Hashemite kingdom. In Palestine, it created a \"national home\" for the Jewish people. With the conquest and dispersal of its native population in 1948, the \"national home\" became the State of Israel, and it was above all that calamity which was to shape the destiny of any Jordanian ruler. The future king had his first, brutal encounter with that reality at the age of 15. King Abdullah was murdered before his eyes. The extrovert Abdullah had been bitterly disappointed with Talal, Hussein's father. He had doted on his grandson instead. And for Hussein, his grandfather was \"the man to whom I owe more than I can say\". A Palestinian assassin in July 1951 put a pistol to Abdullah's ear. As Hussein rushed to his aid, he saw his \"so-called friends doubled up, scattering like bent old women\". He was so disgusted, he confided to his autobiography, that he never wanted to be king. Hussein had to leave for Harrow. There, \"a man among boys\", he felt spurned and lonely. His schoolmates were \"snobbish\"; and instead of soccer, they played the strange game of rugby. But Hussein recalled his grandfather's advice: \"always do your very best, regardless of all setbacks and difficulties.\" The diminutive Crown Prince made an ideal scrum half, and the Englishmen finally accepted this highest-born of Arabs. The tragic and incurably schizophrenic Talal was declared unfit to rule. His son took power on May 2, 1953."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/feb/09/politicalnews.politics2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-09T01:24:12Z","webTitle":"Roll up, roll up, it's big and white","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/09/politicalnews.politics2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/feb/09/politicalnews.politics2","fields":{"headline":"Roll up, roll up, it's big and white","bodyText":"The fall-out from the Fall of Mandelson continues. Over in the House of Lords, the new Dome Secretary, Lord Falconer, was answering questions. Or rather, not answering questions. Like Mr Mandelson before him, Lord Falconer sees it as his absolute duty to say nothing at all about the Dome. When will it be ready? How much is it going to cost? What is inside the thing? Does it even exist? He cannot say. (I suspect that the answer to the last question is a tentative 'yes'. The other day I went to Canary Wharf and there was certainly a big white convex object visible roughly where the Dome is supposed to be. And yesterday Lord Ewing described flying over something similar on his plane from Scotland. 'My plane was half-full of Welsh rugby fans, who said it was the most wonderful sight they had seen in a very disappointing weekend,' he announced. So there is something out there, but what, we cannot know for sure.) Had Churchill in 1941 been asked to give details of what went on at Station X he would probably have been more forthcoming than Lord Falconer was yesterday. Lord Peyton had asked the original question, inquiring 'what further news' Lord Falconer might have to tell us. None, apparently though it turned out that the people of Greenwich were thrilled about the Dome, the 5,000 jobs it would bring, and the commercial regeneration of their area. Lord Falconer was happy to tell us that. Lord Harris of Greenwich stood and was greeted by a barrage of jeers. Booing is roughly as common in the House of Lords as farting at Royal Investitures, so this was surprising, until we noticed that he, having taken off his glasses, had failed to notice that the Bishop of Carlisle was also on his feet. Lay peers, even lay peers as grand as Lord Harris, who lives in the reflected glory of his friend Lord Jenkins much as the moon Titan orbits the planet Saturn, are supposed always to give way to bishops. His Grace exercised the ecclesiastical privilege and inquired if the Minister would 'put a little flesh on the content of the Spirit Zone?' Dear me, Lord Falconer wasn't going to be tricked into telling him anything about that. 'In preparing the contents of the Dome we are clear that this celebration is a Christian celebration. You may have heard of the Lambeth Group, which has approved every step.' Mmmm, right. Next Lord Luke, the Tory front bench spokesman, said that there had been too much secrecy. There should be a briefing paper on the Dome, saying 'where we were, where we are at, and where we are going to be.' Lord Falconer, faced with such a crisp and unequivocal challenge, rose superbly to the occasion. He told us nothing whatever. 'As the Dome has been built and the contents are becoming more well-known, then the contents will be known.' You couldn't argue with that, even if you understood it. He continued: 'I am not going to tell everyone what is in the Dome, because I want them to go down to see for themselves. The Government wants there to be an element of secrecy.' So, roll up, roll up, to see the marvellous something or other! Get yer tickets now for the great thingumajig! Truly the Dome resembles the Kingdom of Heaven. We have no idea what it's like, but we must take it on trust that it's worth getting to. Soon afterwards Baroness Gardner of Parkes (Con) asked about au pairs, and whether their employers will be able to afford to pay them the minimum wage. The baroness seemed terrifically grand, though I detected just a whiff of an Australian accent. It turns out that she is really a dentist from New South Wales, and the name she was born with - this is true - was Trixie McGirr."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/09/5","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-09T01:24:40Z","webTitle":"Even in death, the peacemaker king brought sworn enemies together","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/09/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/09/5","fields":{"headline":"Even in death, the peacemaker king brought sworn enemies together","bodyText":"Death gave King Hussein of Jordan one final victory yesterday as former foes of the Hashemite monarch and sworn enemies of other funeral guests rubbed shoulders on the steps of his palace and queued to pay their last respects, in one of the last great gatherings of world leaders this century. The funeral of the king, who died on Sunday of complications from cancer, held out the hope of a boost to the peaceful resolution of Middle Eastern enmities. Israel fielded a large contingent of politicians and the arrival of Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, provided the biggest surprise of an occasion that combined pomp with high-grade funeral diplomacy. The Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, roused himself from his sickbed to make his first public appearance in months, an act that clearly signalled the significance of the passing of a ruler whose diminutive and poor desert kingdom was eclipsed by his stature as a peace-broker on the international stage. Mr Yeltsin, who had to be supported as he slowly climbed the steps of the Raghadan palace, left early and was unable to attend the interment of Hussein's body in a simple Muslim ceremony at the royal cemetery. He spoke briefly with President Bill Clinton, who was accompanied by former presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and George Bush. Mr Clinton also exchanged words with the Syrian president as the world's leaders were obliged to mingle with one another, owing to the shortage of space outside the throne room, where Hussein's coffin lay in state. The day began with the departure of Hussein's coffin from his home at Bab el-Salam, where his widow, Queen Noor, and the other female members of the Hashemite family said their farewells. Prince Hassan, Hussein's younger brother whom he deposed as his successor only two weeks ago, shrugged his shoulders with finality as he was dismissed with a kiss from Queen Noor. Whatever family feuds may lurk behind the palace walls, the Hashemites were determined to put on an act of unity yesterday. Hundreds of thousands of mourners threw flowers and breached police lines in an attempt to touch the coffin as it was driven on a flower-decked open jeep through the streets of the capital where Hussein ruled for 46 years. At times the cortege was slowed to almost a halt by the press of grieving Jordanians. Their pain was made all the more acute by the memory of Hussein's triumphant return from cancer treatment only three weeks earlier, when he braved driving rain to be cheered through the same streets, declaring himself cured of the fatal disease. Bells tolled from churches of the tiny Christian community, mingling with the cries of prayer broadcast from the city's mosques. By the time the cortege reached the Raghadan palace, Israel's representatives had already sneaked in through a side door. More than 50 foreign leaders, many of them traditional rivals, filed past the flag-draped coffin. It was an extraordinary assembly. President Assad of Syria, who once tried to shoot down Hussein's private jet, and who sent his tanks into northern Jordan on more than one occasion, provided the biggest shock. He paused before the king's coffin, turned his hands palm upwards and silently recited a prayer. The presence of the 70-year-old ruler, whose health is poor, underlined the generational change in the Middle East. In the next few years the old faces will finally change and yesterday was the first step in this transition of power. The crowd was so thick that at times the ceremonial Circassian Guard - Muslim fugitives from tsarist pogroms in the Caucasus who settled here in the days of the Ottoman empire and who are among the Hashemites' most loyal followers - had to halt the flow of leaders squeezing through the palace doors. The son of Colonel Muammar Gadafy, dressed in African robes; the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, and the Iraqi vice-president, Taha Moheiddin Ma'arouf - all countries which have been the targets of US missiles - were just steps away from Mr Clinton and Tony Blair. Yasser Arafat, who was expelled by Hussein from Jordan during a bloody struggle for power in 1970, and who fought with him over the right to represent the Palestinians, saluted twice and bowed before the coffin. He was preceded and followed by an array of Israeli figures. They ranged from President Ezer Weizman; the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu; foreign minister Ariel Sharon; the Labour Party leader, Ehud Barak; the former prime minister and Oslo peace process architect, Shimon Peres; the new prime ministerial contender and former defence minister, Yitzhak Mordechai; and finally, to the amazement of most observers, the old war horse and unbending opponent of peace with the Palestinians, Yitzhak Shamir. This was funeral diplomacy on a grand scale: Moscow eager to demonstrate that it has not given up on power-play ambitions in the Middle East, Syria sending a subtle message that it too wants to make peace, and Israel's opponents in the forthcoming elections showing off their purported peace credentials. The presence of Ephraim Halevi, the chief of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, marked the fact of Israel and Jordan's close security relationship in a hostile region. But it was a family funeral too and one conducted on the lines of British military tradition. A band of pipers played a Scottish military marching tune to lead Hussein's body, now transferred to a 90mm field artillery cannon, to its final resting place in the royal cemetery. Behind him followed Amr, his favourite horse, a white charger whose stirrups were filled with Hussein's empty riding boots, pointing backwards in the old symbol of a fallen leader. Hussein's sons lifted his body, wrapped in a white winding sheet, out of the coffin and placed it in the earth, next to his father, King Talal. A 15-gun salute was preceded by the traditional recitation, 11 times, of the Muslim prayer of the Faithful. It was an impressive farewell, one which outshone even that of the murdered Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, whose widow Leah was in Amman to console Queen Noor. Certainly one to compare with the funeral of Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, or even Winston Churchill. A final crowning achievement in a remarkable life, to have brought so many world powers together in a tiny, poor country, created by strokes of a pen on a desert map as a by-product of imperial designs, but yesterday a modern Arabic state with a new king. And a day which seemed to answer the question Hussein had posed himself only a year ago: 'What does a man seek in this world? A position or a throne?... All we hope for is that a day will come, when we have all gone, when people will say that this man tried, and his family tried. This is all there is to seek in this world.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/feb/09/sarahboseley","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-09T01:25:44Z","webTitle":"Reform of nursing watchdog 'will offer greater degree of protection'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/09/sarahboseley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/feb/09/sarahboseley","fields":{"headline":"Reform of nursing watchdog 'will offer greater degree of protection'","bodyText":"The Government is to scrap the nurses' disciplinary body, the United Kingdom Central Council, and the four national boards that oversee education because they are perceived not to be safeguarding the public, the Guardian has learned. They will be replaced by a single organisation with a substantial lay membership dedicated to protecting the patient and the professional. Today the Department of Health will publish a report commissioned two years ago following an outcry over revelations that the UKCC had let convicted sex offenders return to work as nurses after being debarred for a few years from the register. More recently, there have been serious concerns about the inability of the UKCC to take any form of action against Deborah Parry, one of the two nurses accused of the murder of 55-year-old Yvonne Gilford in Saudi Arabia, who is now working in a private hospital in Surrey. Because the Saudi authorities did not provide any proof of her conviction, said the UKCC last autumn, it was powerless to act. It is now considering what to do about Lucille McLauchlan, following her conviction for stealing from a patient in Scotland. Ministers will today accept most recommendations of the report, from J M Consulting, which proposes that not only the UKCC, which regulates nurses, midwives and health visitors, but also the four national boards, which rule nursing education, be scrapped. The UKCC has 60 members at present. The new body will have up to 27, and not more than two-thirds of those will be professionals. The rest will be lay members. The report says present arrangements do not properly safeguard patients, and criticises the UKCC for being too large and unwieldy. The level of proof needed before any nurse can be struck off the register is too high, the report suggests, saying it is stacked in favour of the professional rather than the patient. At the moment, no nurse, midwife or health visitor can be struck off unless the charges against them are proved beyond reasonable doubt. Yet, as far as the test used in the civil courts - the balance of probabilities - is concerned, a nurse or doctor may be maiming their patients but still be considered fit to practise by their regulatory body. The report suggests that the criminal test should apply if it is a matter of striking a nurse off the register, but that if the case is proved on the balance of probabilities, the disciplinary body should be able to administer a reprimand. The Government wants to consult on this proposal. The new body should have a wider and more flexible range of powers than the UKCC currently possesses, says the report. It should be able to subpoena documents at the investigating stage, which it cannot do currently. It should have powers of suspension and conditional registration.
