But environmental science professor Jeff Wilson spent most of his time in a dumpster across the street. That’s where he lives: a 36 sq-foot trash container tricked out with LED lighting, non-toxic paint, an energy monitoring system, and a bucket for his bathroom waste. Wilson – aka “Professor Dumpster” – moved into his dumpster pad last February as part of a year-long experiment in living sustainably. He sleeps on a floor on a futon and did a fair amount of sweltering this summer before he got air-conditioning, but in October he enjoys the pleasant breeze. “I may live in a dumpster, but I can still enjoy a sustainable lifestyle,” he said. “I make Turkish coffee, get on my laptop and do Twitter, read and lounge out.” In the final phase of what he plans to be the über-dumpster, he’s going to add solar panels, a composting toilet, and other features to complete his revolutionary tiny home design. “We’re essentially building a space capsule inside a dumpster,” Wilson said. Wilson, who teaches at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, parked his Dumpster Project outside the sustainable business conference to make the point that happiness has little to do with materialism – and that ultimately, living well may well mean living with less stuff. In stark contrast, four floors up in the convention center was Honda’s version of a smart home: a snazzy demo of the 2,000 sq-foot model smart home, which the company recently unveiled at the University of California at Davis. The project, which includes open-sourced plans, is the brainchild of senior project engineer Michael Koenig, who aims to demonstrate how distributed solar energy and plug-in electric vehicles can join forces to provide zero-carbon living and high-efficiency mobility. From a products perspective, Honda’s gadget-laden “high-tech” model looks like it’s for people too lazy to turn their own thermostats. But from a systems standpoint, applying these plans across the residential sector could considerably reduce carbon emissions by mitigating the impact of our society’s biggest emitters: transportation and electricity. “I’m a car guy, but I was also interested in building a green home,” Koenig said. “I saw a need to fill a void and show what was possible.” Companies such as Honda see the smart home as an opportunity for growth, with plug-in electric vehicles like the Fit EV joining forces with solar panels to enable zero-carbon living. Retail pioneer Garrett Boone, co-founder of The Container Store, says he now sees the “same kind of retail opportunity for smart homes today as I saw for home organization in 1978”. To tap that market, Boone is an investor in and chairman of TreeHouse, a new Austin-based smart home retailer, for which I’m an unpaid board member. (Watch my video interview with Boone here.) The nascent smart home movement is rapidly growing into a market force. According to a study released by Juniper Research, the smart home market could reach $71bn by 2018 – up from $33bn in 2013, and $25bn in 2012. Plus, the phrase “smart home” – like the word “sustainability” – defies simple definitions. Models may succeed where words fail in conveying the essence of “smart-homeness”. But the two models also demonstrate a key disagreement about what sustainability will look like in the future: will it be high-tech with an EV in the garage, or low-tech and tiny? From smart homes to a smarter society Another essential question remains. Will all these smart homes actually make living more sustainable? Rising energy costs, both actual and unaccounted for, as well as escalating financial and climate events are putting advanced societies in a state of continual disruption. And in the developing world, people still lack basic services. For example, over 40% of the world’s population still doesn’t have a place to go to the bathroom. Adjacent to the dumpster house sat another primitive-type innovation – a double-container composting toilet from SmallSmall, a semi-finalist for the startup showcase. The new venture from a team of Dallas-based architects is based on a concept from recent University of Pennsylvania grad Gray Garmon, who came up with the idea while serving in the Peace Corps. The idea represents a micro-business opportunity to help entrepreneurs profit from providing basic human services. The dumpster-latrine combo was definitely a low-tech version of a smart home. So which is the real smart home? It comes down to context. Honda’s model still won’t work for most Americans or in a lot of developing economies. As Jigar Shah pointed out, building smart homes may not be nearly as important as building the boring yet necessary infrastructure that is still lacking. “There’s this really cool new technology called a ditch,” said Eric Klinenberg, only half joking as he displayed pictures of buried electrical wires, pointing out the absurdity of continuing to string electricity on precarious poles in disaster-prone regions. Smart homes are a starting point, but the next frontier will be smart communities, smart cities and smart regions. We won’t get there without smart people. And some luck. After all, plenty of companies that made their mark in years past are now gone. It’s still an open question how sustainability – in our homes, businesses and cities – will play out. But no matter which sustainability ventures succeed or fail, we will keep getting smarter if we retain the knowledge we accumulate along the way. Sharing the lessons we learn will give us a chance of creating more than smart homes - but also smart supply chains, smart regions and a smarter culture. This article was amended 14 October. A previous version incorrectly stated that Gray Garmon recently graduated from Penn State. In fact, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. The sustainable living hub is funded by Unilever.

While it may be an unfamiliar concept for many engaged in local grassroots businesses they can nevertheless see the potential of engaging in ventures which have a social impact. According to the Opportunity Pakistan Report – produced by i-genius, an initiative supporting social entrepreneurs worldwide – despite the country’s social and political unrest, it offers opportunities for investment and innovation. “Countries experiencing transition are fertile places for new ideas to thrive”, said Shivang Patel, commission coordinator of i-genius. “Despite media attention in the west on all things bad in the region we found a country progressing through slow but significant positive reforms. There is considerable untapped potential for social businesses”. A new wave of creative and confident young entrepreneurs has emerged developing innovative start ups in areas such as environment, health and skills. Scores of young women and men from remote areas of Pakistan are becoming social entrepreneurs. A longstanding lack of investment in Pakistan’s public sector has prompted local business leaders to invest in ideas which tackle issues such as water and sanitation problems as well as those which can address its energy and environmental concerns. Water One such example is Pharmagen Water. Established in 2007, it aims to provide poor communities in Pakistan’s second largest city, Lahore, with affordable clean and purified drinking water. It is supported by the Acumen, which invests in entrepreneurs and creates venture capital which can provide solutions to causes of poverty. “We have set up a chain of 17 shops at various less affluent areas of Lahore through which we are servicing 250,000 underprivileged people,” said the company’s CEO Parvez Sufi. “Our water is purified with balanced minerals which is made using state of the art reverse osmosis purification process on international lines in accordance with the World Health Organisation standard”. Energy Another business offering a solution to parts of Pakistan’s energy strapped areas is SRE Solutions. Established just last year with Acumen’s support it offers to harness solar energy for off-grid customers in districts of Punjab and Khayber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Sophia Ahmed, business associate of Acumen’s arm in Pakistan explains, “Its solutions range from 5W-100W, integrating imported Chinese solar panels with DC based imported bulbs and fans. They offer a viable alternative to kerosene oil based lanterns currently being used in most of the remote off grid rural communities.” Construction Similarly a low-cost engineering and construction enterprise, Ghonsla, was set up in the aftermath of Pakistan’s devastating earthquake in 2005. With 73,000 people killed and large parts of its cities and villages destroyed in the north by the disaster, the plight of 2.5 million people left homeless hung in the balance. While carrying out field work during this time Zehra Ali, the company’s founder, saw a demand for sustainable, greener insulation for the housing solutions being offered to those affected by the earthquake. “Since our product is linked directly with making people’s homes more comfortable in the winter and reducing consumption of fuel wood, it provided a part of the solution to reducing indoor smoke,” Ali explained. In the coming months she is looking into increasing production and collaborating with another insulation firm based in Germany while working locally to increase the company’s footprint in Pakistan’s northern district of Chitral, a scenic yet underdeveloped area bordering the Himalayas. Finance The initial funding for Ghonsla’s pilot project came from Seed, Social Entrepreneurship and Equity Development, a venture which supports startups and grassroots innovations. Its incubation centres in Pakistan provide opportunities for young entrepreneurs in their early years of startup. It was established by friends Faraz Khan and Khusro Ansari and runs five distinct projects, including StartUp Dosti, a business plan based competition for early stage startups in India and Pakistan. It seeks to build relationships between the next generation of entrepreneurs from the two countries and the wider South Asian diaspora. As part of this it also launched Pakistan’s first television programme closely based on the BBC’s Dragons Den format. It is to be aired in India and Pakistan in November. Meanwhile a second conference is also being hosted by i-genius next month in Lahore to explore how social enterprise can transform Pakistan’s economic prospects. Blanket foreign aid funding of development projects in Pakistan, often linked to its fortune in the world of geopolitics, does not go beyond crisis management. What is more likely to get results, as some of these initiates demonstrate, is incentivising the country’s base economies which can be run on sustainable social enterprise models and help it break away from the cycle of aid dependency.

Still, I had no idea what they were seeing. Talking to one of the festival directors, I found out this was Project 84, an Orwell-inspired show communicating with its audience via their mobile phones. Its artists are still figuring things out, but in that moment, the audience were right there with them. Crack, part of the wider festival, This Is Not Art, brings together new performance from across Australia every October long weekend. Performances are often cross-art and experimental, ranging from work in development through to finished shows. Everywhere there is a sense of the rough and ready. All events are free, catering comes in the form of toasties, drinks are BYO and the venue’s major design feature is cardboard boxes. To this roughness, artists and audiences bring passion and love. And the two highlights of this year’s program were completed works, where we could fully see and engage with the artists’ vision. Under spotlights in a dusty corner of the Crack House, Brisbane artist Scott Wings firmly grabbed his audience’s hearts and refused to let go as he ran around performing Icarus Falling. Cutting the Greek myth of Icarus through with contemporary takes on difficult families, love, heartbreak and depression, the work was raw, honest and occasionally thrilling, delicately toeing the line between humour and heartbreak. As the dirt built up on the souls of Wing’s feet, it’s hard to imagine he could find a more perfect venue, but this exciting new Australian performance deserves to be seen widely. Josephine Were’s Three Wishes won’t be experienced beyond Newcastle, at least not in this iteration. If only for 40 minutes, the audio tour took us out of our festival bubble as we walked from Hunter Street mall to Newcastle beach, engaging with the city and the people who live there. If they could have three wishes come true for Australia in three years, she had asked people on the same walk, what would they be? Answers ranged from the small and personal (“more toys” says a six-year-old boy; another woman: “It would be nice if sushi could be delivered”) to the big and political (“improved solar energy”; “Tony Abbott not to be prime minister”, “no more immigration: keep Australia Australian”). Together they painted a complex picture in a piece that managed to calm and confront by turns. A number of shows here will be developed into complete works, other artists may just pick up on the strongest strands to create something new. Although we were only given a staged reading, Will O’Mahony’s Tonsils + Tweezers is already an exciting piece of new writing exploring the long-term repercussions of personal tragedies. Read by the Perth-based writer and three young actors, the play is a serious look at the nature of grief with a playful touch to its structure. Some work, as always, was disappointing, sometimes because the artists hadn’t been fully able to achieve their vision, elsewhere because it showed a naivety we should be beyond, such as the white Australian man rapping about how rap music is now only about money. Then there was the work that was silly and messy and fun, which thrives in an environment like this: the ghost doing stand-up; a drunk artist at the microphone begging for a place to spend the night; audience members forced to trawl through a thousand matches to find a hidden toothpick. Three hours by train from Sydney, Crack can feel removed from the rest of the Australian theatre scene. For one weekend a year it pops up, consuming the lives of those who attend; perhaps overlooked by those who don’t. But its artists will return to their home cities, regroup, and send their art out into the world again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/2014/oct/06/energy-investment-british-marine-power","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-06T07:59:04Z","webTitle":"How lack of investment is holding back the progress of marine power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/2014/oct/06/energy-investment-british-marine-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/2014/oct/06/energy-investment-british-marine-power","fields":{"headline":"How lack of investment is holding back the progress of marine power","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Fraenkel has been working in the marine energy sector for almost a quarter of a century. In that time, marine energy has gone from pipe dream to potential saviour of the planet. Recent reports claim it could provide as much as 32% of the UK’s electricity, contribute £6.61bn to the UK economy by 2035 and create more than 23,000 jobs. The amount of energy the UK can derive from its oceans has increased 20-fold since 2007: the installed capacity in 2007 was 0.5MW; in 2014 it hit 10MW. And the Crown Estate, which is responsible for granting permission for any projects involving the sea or the seabed, has leased more than 40 sites for future marine energy development. The journey has not been easy, and it is far from over. Fraenkel likens the industry’s hard-fought ascent to walking in the Lake District: “You see a summit up ahead and you reach it thinking maybe that’s the top, and then you look and there’s another one, 300 metres further on, and then another one, and then another one.” There are still many summits to climb before the marine energy sector reaches its full potential in the UK. The technology to create energy from waves and tides has been proven but will enough initial investment ever be found for the sector to become commercially viable? Fraenkel got involved in tidal energy in 1990, working for a firm called IT Power. When IT Power’s board decided in 2000 that there was no future in tidal energy, he found himself in a difficult position. “I had the choice of giving it up or going ahead and doing it on my own, so I left IT Power and went full-time into my own company, Marine Current Turbines. It was a bit of a gamble, but it came off. We didn’t have any money until 2002, but in 2002 we managed to raise the money and we had a turbine in the water in 2003.” Marine Current Turbines was subsequently bought out by manufacturing giant Siemens in 2011, but Fraenkel has no regrets on that score. He says the entry of multinationals is the only way the industry will ever reach its full potential. The money needed in the next stage is big – £50m-100m per project – and so it needs bigger players to get involved. Britain is uniquely positioned to take advantage of marine energy. The world’s strongest waves are found in the temperate climates north and south of the tropics, as this is where the wind and wave and tidal streams are at their strongest. “Britain is very exposed to the waves that come in across the Atlantic and wind and waves from the west and south west. And because we are an island nation, the tidal flows scoot around our coastlines constantly, making us exceptionally well-placed from a tidal perspective,” explains Martin Murphy, managing director of Wales-based Tidal Energy Ltd. Only a few other regions – Japan and Korea , the north coast of Spain, parts of Canada – are as well-placed. There is some good news for British marine techology. The MeyGen Project in Orkney recently secured £51.3m of funding to install four 1.5MW turbines in the Pentland Firth. The 6MW that will be produced in MeyGen’s first phase will be enough to power approximately 3,000 houses. The end goal for MeyGen is to install 269 turbines, enough to provide 50% of Scotland’s electricity needs, but that goal is many funding rounds away. Dee Nunn, wave and tidal development manager for Renewables UK, says she was “elated” when she heard that MeyGen had secured funding for its initial phase. But, she adds, “We’re not out of the woods yet. It’s fantastic that MeyGen have got their project underway, but there still needs to be support for the sector to get it to the point where it is fully commercial. What the investors need to see is a really significant size for the market, and at the moment that is being constrained by the government, because we can’t see what their support will be beyond 2019.” In September, MeyGen signed a 10-year power purchase agreement worth up to £50m with independent energy firm SmartestEnergy. Each year the government announces its support for renewables for the next five years. That means today’s investors can only be sure of a return on their investment up until 2019. “Getting the money has always been the biggest problem,” says Fraenkel. “Nobody will invest £50-100m in a project which is only going to last five years. They want to invest for 25 years. If there is no confidence as to what it will earn in six years’ time, you can’t get any money. It’s as simple as that.” The marine industry is, as a result, dependent on government support. It’s only when the industry reaches a certain size that the price per kilowatt hour will come down. The price of wind energy is a quarter of what it once was, and the cost of solar energy seems to fall almost daily. Marine energy could in time be as cheap, or even cheaper, than energy from the wind and the sun, but will need help getting off ground. But why bother if wind and solar are already doing the job so well? Energy from wind and solar is intermittent: they require the wind to blow, or the sun to shine. But the tide comes and goes out twice a day. Waves, though not constant or entirely predictable, are at least regular and frequent. The other major obstacle is grid connection – the grid is not well-developed in the remote areas where marine energy is sourced. Nunn describes this as a “chicken and egg situation: the projects need the grid connection and the people responsible for the grid connection don’t want to build until the projects are in place”. And once again, it’s going to require a substantial amount of initial investment. Yet fossil fuels are already subsidised to the tune of £3.63bn a year (based on 2010 figures) while marine energy received just £180m between 2002 and 2011. As Fraenkel says: “Given what the government spends, the amount of money needed to really push marine renewables forward is peanuts. They talk about bank bailouts of £70-80bn – well, half a billion would be pretty good for marine renewables.” Siemens is a funding partner of the Big Energy Debate project.

Could we find a breakthrough that would cut 90% of the electricity required for space cooling? Air conditioners in use today work on the same principle as refrigerators, but instead of dumping the heat into the room (which is what happens at the back of a refrigerator) it is sent outdoors. Air conditioners use a lot of electricity because they involve repeated cycles of compressing a gas to a liquid, and that consumes power. In Singapore – a small, hot, developed country – about 30% of household power is used for air conditioning, and in commercial buildings it is 40%. Because much global economic development has happened, and will happen, in hot climates, the demand for air conditioning can be expected to increase markedly over the coming decade. There is a need for a much more energy efficient way to accomplish space cooling. The simplest thing to do is to refrain from excessively air conditioning a work or living space. A few degrees higher setting of the thermostat in those chilly restaurants, hotels, homes and offices would go a long way to saving energy. But what about the device itself? If the energy cost of compressing the gas back to a liquid is the critical step, is there any way to reduce or eliminate this? There is an old idea that is now being revived as a result of advances in chemical materials technology. Certain materials have a strong tendency to adsorb (that is bind to the surface) water vapour. When this happens, heat is released. Suppose that cool water vapour picks up heat from a hot room, and is then directed outside to where the adsorbing material is located. The water is trapped and the heat released to the atmosphere. To get the water back off the material, as cool vapour, only a small amount of heat needs to be applied to the solid. Ideally this would come from solar energy, or from some other source of waste heat. If neither is available, a small electric heater is required. Devices cooling air on this principle are known as adsorption chillers. The problem is that until recently the materials available at a reasonable cost, such as silica gel (the stuff in those little packets you get with various purchases, to keep them dry) do not trap very much water, so you need a lot of them to cool a space. The resulting adsorption chillers are large and heavy – and weight is a consideration for air conditioners, which are often placed on a roof. New materials are now being developed that are a step change in the amount of water they can hold. These materials are known as metal-organic framework (MOF) compounds. Some of the recent ones, developed by Dr Raya al Dadah at the University of Birmingham, at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, and at MIT in the US, will adsorb more than four times as much water as silica gel. As the name implies, these materials are made of various metals, such as zirconium or chromium, bound together with a loose web of carbon atoms, so that there is a much greater surface area with sites where water molecules can be bound. But the work of the chemists and engineers is not done. Many materials will work well for a few cycles of adsorption and its reverse, desorption. But a commercial adsorption chiller needs to keep up this performance for thousands of cycles without requiring a change of the MOF. The first materials are undergoing such tests, and if they succeed we might soon see commercial air conditioning using 10% of the energy required for today’s units.

The Charanka solar park in Gujarat is an “ultra-mega” power project – the Indian government’s phrase – and the biggest in Asia. But unlike the hundreds of coal plants and their noxious smokestacks being built in the country, the only danger linked to the solar panels are the snakes and scorpions that slink and scuttle between the sparse shrubs, posing a minor hazard to those who dust off the panels after dusk. “But today, God is doing the cleaning,” says Poojan Ghodadra, programme manager for SunEdison, as rare, intense rain bounces off the panels. SunEdison has provided about a 10th of the 221MW total in the 5,000-acre solar park. The project was the brainchild of Narendra Modi. As chief minister of Gujarat, Modi spurred companies to build more than 900MW of solar plant across the state in just a couple of years. Now, as prime minister, the question is whether he can repeat the feat across India, which receives more sunlight than any other country in the G20. The answer matters across the globe: at the heart of tackling climate change is bringing power to the world’s poorest people without choking the planet with rising carbon emissions. The UN negotiations, which must deliver a deal to beat global warming by the end of 2015, began their crucial final stage on Tuesday in New York, with the assembly of more than 120 world leaders. Boosting clean energy over dirty fossil fuels is high on the agenda and solar is booming, with new installations around the world doubling every two years. China is also aggressively pursuing the green technology, installing 12,000MW in 2013 – a record for any country in a single year. As production goes up, panel costs are plummeting – down 80% since 2008, according to the New Climate Economy report released on 15 September. This puts solar on the edge of beating coal and gas on price. Such energy choices are now on Modi’s desk: he has pledged to give electricity to every one of the 300 million Indians living in the dark, a feat he achieved on the smaller stage of Gujarat, and energy experts in India are impressed with the impetus given in his first 100 days to renewable energy, particularly solar. Three more ultra-mega solar parks were backed with cash in July, as were solar-powered irrigation pumps and canal-top solar plants. The electric fences on India’s sensitive northern borders will be solar-powered as the military installs 1,000MW of panels to replace expensive diesel generators across its posts. Another 7,000MW of solar is out for tender across the country and the rooftops of Delhi are to be bedecked with panels under a new scheme. Elsewhere, glitzy new shopping malls in India’s blackout-prone cities are turning to solar for cheaper and more reliable energy, while thirsty Chennai is experimenting with solar-powered desalination. Modi’s power minister, Piyush Goyal, says solar has a glittering future. The previous government’s target of 20,000MW of solar by 2022 will be smashed, he says. “It will be much, much larger. I think for India to add 10,000MW a year [of solar] and six, or seven or eight of wind every year is not very difficult to envisage.” But coal has not gone away. Electricity produced by coal burning between June and August 2014 jumped 21% on 2013 and, despite corruption allegations, coal mining is increasing. The state coal company aims to double production to 1bn tonnes a year by 2019. All acknowledge that coal must provide the steady power needed to underpin India’s rapid economic development: if the 360 million Indians living in poverty were a nation, it would be the third most populous on Earth. But the extent to which plummeting solar panel costs and their sometimes surprising fringe benefits help solar eat into coal’s share of the energy mix is crucial to keeping emissions down. On a 15-metre-wide (50ft) irrigation canal that cuts through the green cotton and barley fields of Gujarat, another Modi project illustrates the extra benefits. Here, 3,600 solar panels stretch more than half a mile along the waterway, but do not just produce power. With water the critical resource for the farmers, the shading of the canal by the solar array saves an estimated 9m litres of water from evaporating each year while the cooling effect of the water under the panels edges up the electricity output. Furthermore, the part of the canal in the sun is clogged with reeds but in the shade of the panels, the water flows freely. Spanning the canal, while adding cost, also avoids covering valuable farmland with panels. “The canal is the property of the government, so the cost of the land goes away too,” says Ghodadra. Modi is known to enjoy talking about the world-first canal project to the presidents and prime ministers he meets around the world and has backed a national expansion. Even using just 10% of the canals in Gujarat would give 2,200MW of solar power. Along with millions of solar water pumps, Goyal says this pushing of power into the countryside will lift the income of poor farmers and increase food security by extending growing seasons. Solar power can also reach remote villages faster and cheaper than sending pylons striding across the land, says Pranav Mehta, chair of the National Solar Energy Federation of India. “The country needs more decentralised power, like rooftop solar, to reach the large parts of the country that the grid has not reached.” India’s booming cities are another huge challenge, with many struggling with blackouts, particularly when temperatures soar and air conditioning is ramped up. Again, Modi’s 13-year tenure in Gujarat is providing the solar template. In September, it was announced that rooftop solar power projects in the state capital, Gandhinagar, will be replicated in Punjab and Delhi, where a storm at the end of May plunged its fragile grid into rolling blackouts for a week. Delhi is ever more power-hungry, but with little open land and 300-plus days of sunshine a year, rooftop solar is an attractive solution. Since businessman SN Dwivedi put solar panels on his home, the previous back-up system has been silent. “I haven’t used the diesel generator in my house for a year,” he says. Goyal says rural and urban off-grid solar are being looked at “very actively”. “Offgrid is a very viable solution, especially for small, remote villages,” he says, while new assessment for his department calculates a potential for 120,000MW of rooftop solar across India. Other assessments are even higher at 200,000MW. The minister is certainly generating enthusiasm in the industry. “We have a government that is even more bullish than the entrepreneurs,” says Rahul Munjal, scion of the Hero motorcycle family, the world’s biggest makers of two-wheelers. His new company, Hero Future Energies, will complete 280MW of solar by 2015, three years after it started. “The Modi factor is very real with solar. He recognises that not only is solar very clean, it is also very fast to build,” says Pashupathy Gopalan, SunEdison’s managing director in south Asia and Africa. He says the cost of solar versus coal – the critical immediate factor – is near a tipping point. “Grid parity”, ie equal cost, has already been achieved for commercial and industrial customers putting panels on their roofs, Gopalan says, and is coming soon for other users. Bloomberg predicts parity for solar in India by 2020, while solar consultancy Bridge to India suggests 2018. “I think the grid parity debate is history now,” says Gopalan. Grid parity would mean solar subsidies could be phased out, but Mehta notes that fossil fuels still get more than $40bn (£24bn) in subsidy every year in India: “You give me [a fraction] of that and I will make solar affordable and available everywhere.” But despite highlighting the advantages of solar power – and new incentives to close old and dirty coal plants – energy minister Goyal is unable to pledge that the proportion of electricity generated from coal will fall from its current 65% in the coming years. “I would love it to be lower,” he says. “But the ambitious plans India has to expand infrastructure, create jobs, improve the lives of people, get 24/7 power in every home, I think considering the huge magnitude of the demand shift, for renewables to meet this kind of demand will have serious challenges. So I would imagine coal also would have to expand in a very rapid way.” Even solar champion Mehta agrees, expecting the proportion to be unchanged in 2030. Goyal says a key obstacle to ensuring solar power grabs its huge opportunity in India is getting the up-front capital at affordable interest rates – coal is relatively easy to fund, he says. The provision of clean energy finance will be a central one in the UN negotiations, which must deliver a global climate change deal by the end of 2015. Developing nations will demand financial help for green power projects from the industrialised west, in return for forgoing some of the fossil fuel burning on which the west itself grew rich. But there has been little progress so far, Goyal says: “So far I have yet to see any significant offers or proposal of support from the west.”Rajendra Pachauri is an expert on India’s energy system and the challenge of global warming, as head of the Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) and chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provides the world’s governments with their most definitive assessments. He thinks coal power expansion in India is likely to choke on supply problems, boosting the attractiveness of solar and other renewables. “It is a myth that India can continue to produce more coal,” he says, noting the shortage of coal that is leaving many plants stranded even today. “We have set up power stations in this country and there is no coal to run them.” Pachauri is optimistic India under Modi can follow the cleaner energy path. “We have a prime minister who first, believes in climate change and, secondly, is a doer. It is a unique opportunity,” he says. “I believe you will see a snowballing of renewable energy developments in India in the next few years.” But while a step-change in clean energy generation is a must if global warming is to be tamed, climate change does not have to be the principle reason for change, according to Pachauri. “I don’t think India is really [expanding renewable energy] to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Here it is happening largely because renewables will turn out to be the most feasible and most attractive form of energy supply.” He then paraphrases Deng Xiaoping’s famous quote: “It doesn’t matter if a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice.” Whether the world is prepared to capture enough mice – carbon emissions – to avert catastrophic climate change is what is at stake in the next 15 months of global UN negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/28/narendra-modi-india-new-york-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-29T07:23:31Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi : US turns on charm as roadshow rolls into New York","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/28/narendra-modi-india-new-york-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/28/narendra-modi-india-new-york-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Narendra Modi : US turns on charm as roadshow rolls into New York","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"No expense had been spared by the organisers of the $1.5m event. The stage of New York’s Madison Square Garden was filled with dancers in traditional dress, while a laser show and holograms of historical Indian figures lit up the backdrop. Shots of rising skyscrapers, microchip factories and Asia’s largest solar-energy plant were framed by balloons in the colours of the Indian and US flags. When Narendra Modi, the new prime minister of India, took to the stage on Sunday night, he told the wildly enthusiastic audience that the 21st century would belong to Asia, and possibly to his own nation. “Some say, this is India’s century. India has the potential … The time has come. India is the world’s youngest country and its most ancient culture. [It] has something that other countries in the world don’t,” Modi told the sellout crowd of 20,000 at an event which many see as the highlight of the 64-year-old politician’s five-day US visit. Speaking in Hindi, and using some phrases familiar from this year’s long election campaign, Modi spoke of his ambitions for India, where economic growth has flagged in recent years. The organisers, the Indian American Community Foundation, had seized the opportunity to showcase the Indian-American community. There are 2.8 million Indian Americans, forming one of the wealthiest and best-educated diaspora communities in the US. Many became involved in Modi’s election campaign. Performers included the aspiring pop singer Anjali Ranadive, while Nina Davuluri, who became the first Indian American to win the Miss America competition in 2013, was a host. “It means a lot to me to be able to represent Indian Americans. [Modi] is the first of his generation to be the prime minister and so many changes are going to come. It is such a rich culture … Indians are so full of life.,” Ranadive told NDTV, an Indian TV channel. Modi won a crushing victory in the polls in May, gaining his Bharatiya Janata party the first clear majority in Indian politics for 30 years and raising hopes for wholesale reform in a country still troubled by poor infrastructure, red tape, deep poverty and weak governance. Since then, business confidence and the stock market have surged. A former tea seller from a poor family in the western state of Gujarat, Modi entered politics after spending years as an organiser with right wing religious organisations. He has described himself as a Hindu nationalist and a patriot. (http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/07/12/interview-with-bjp-leader-narendra-modi/) However he won power campaigning on a development agenda and focused much of his speech last night on the economic potential of India, his desire to reform government and to improve sanitation. Modi appealed directly for the diaspora to help him clean the Ganges, the heavily polluted river sacred to Hindus. Modi received rapturous applause for saying that when people asked him for a “big vision” he replied that he was only a “small man” who started out selling tea. More than 40 US congressmen were present to watch the speech, which was relayed on a giant screen in Times Square. Local authorities had laid on extra public transport for the expected crowds. Earlier in the day Modi appeared at the Global Citizen festival in Central Park, attended by an estimated 60,000 people. He said his hope was that India’s 800 million young people could transform the nation. “To put the light of hope in every eye. And the joy of belief in every heart. Lift people out of poverty. Put clean water and sanitation within the reach of all. Make healthcare available to all. A roof over every head,” he said. Last week India became the first nation to put a satellite into the orbit of Mars on its first attempt, and the first Asian nation to do so at all. But not all were won over by Modi’s Madison Square event. Vinod Mehta, a well-known Indian commentator, described it as “over the top”. “He has only been in power for 100 days. There is a personality cult that is being built up and the fervour is quite frightening,” Mehta said. Amit Kumar, 31, a taxi driver in south Delhi, watched much of the speech in a tea stall near Nizamuddin station and disagreed. “He is a very strong man. There they are showing much respect for India. That is his achievement.” On Monday Modi will head to Washington for meetings with the heads of 17 multinationals, including Google, Boeing, IBM, PepsiCo and MasterCard, and a private dinner with Barack Obama. This will be a frugal meal as Modi will be fasting for the annual Hindu religious festival of Navratri. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this weekend Modi described the US as India’s “natural partner”. But relations have been rocky. In 2005 Modi was denied a visa to the US under a 1998 law barring entry to foreigners who have committed “particularly severe violations of religious freedom”. The decision followed accusations that he had stood by during, or even encouraged, sectarian violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed by rioters. Modi has denied all wrongdoing and India’s supreme court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to back the charges against him. On Sunday night he made an oblique, jocular reference to the affair, saying he understood when fellow Indians complained of problems obtaining a visa. The UK ended its boycott of Modi in 2012. The EU swiftly followed, with the US ambassador only meeting the prime ministerial candidate for the first time earlier this year. On the eve of Modi’s visit, an activist group in the US filed a lawsuit on behalf of three survivors of the violence that accuses the Indian leader of attempted genocide, and there were small protests outside the venue last night. After an improvement a decade ago, and a controversial nuclear deal, relations between Delhi and Washington hit a low last year when the Indian deputy consul general in the US was arrested on suspicion of visa fraud in New York, strip-searched and held in police custody. The affair prompted a vitriolic reaction in India to what was seen as disrespectful bullying, leading to accusations in the US of oversensitivity and behaviour unbecoming of an aspirant future power. Since then Washington has mounted a charm offensive, said Michael Kugelman, a south Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre in Washington. “For Washington, and for Obama specifically, it’s really about simply getting to know someone they don’t know much about. The relationship has hit rock bottom so the only way is up. Everyone is looking for some good news out of this,” Kugelman said last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2014/sep/29/iphone-6-bend-test","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-29T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Boot up: iPhone 6 bend results, LED output boost, crypto wars redux","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/sep/29/iphone-6-bend-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2014/sep/29/iphone-6-bend-test","fields":{"headline":"Boot up: iPhone 6 bend results, LED output boost, crypto wars redux","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A burst of 13 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team I turned my apartment into a smart home… and all I got was bored &gt;&gt; PandoDaily James Robinson: I guess I am better off now in some ways.

Breakthrough in LED construction increases efficiency by 57 percent This latest work was the culmination of previous research by Chou and his team where they first developed the PlaCSH structure to be used on solar cells to more efficiently focus incoming light. This increased the absorption to as high as 96% of the solar energy being received by the photovoltaic cell, which resulted in an increased efficiency of 175%. As such, the team figured that if such a device was so efficient at absorbing light then, logically, it could also be used for light extraction as well. \"From a view point of physics, a good light absorber, which we had for the solar cells, should also be a good light radiator,\" Professor Chou said. \"We wanted to experimentally demonstrate this is true in visible light range, and then use it to solve the key challenges in LEDs and displays. It is so flexible and ductile that it can be weaved into a cloth.\" The team also claims that the PlaCSH organic LEDs are exceptionally cheap to make as they are made using a system called \"nanoimprint,\" a technology Professor Chou invented to make nanostructures in a similar way to a printing press produces newspapers.

But the reality is that the pieces need to work harmoniously, tied together by software. And only after the infrastructure is in place can developers go and create cool new things. Wearables and sensors and connected devices are interesting – but much more so when tied together with killer apps. And platform history tells us that only after infrastructure is laid do developers write software. This was even true for the internet back in the 90's. It wasn't until the web browser and email and other killer apps came along that you really understood the value of the internet, even though it had connected people years earlier. These system wide network effects in mobile, together with new classes of connected devices, are helping close the divide between the digital world and the physical world. It will continue to fall away gradually as we mature technologically. In five years, it's likely that the notion of an app won't exist like it does today. iPhone 6 and 6 Plus bend test &gt;&gt; Consumer Reports News Apple applies 25 kilograms (slightly more than 55 pounds) of force to an iPhone 6 Plus to test flex. What does 55 pounds mean in context? Using our Instron, we found that it's approximately the force required to break three pencils. Consumer Reports' tests pushed the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus much further than 55 pounds. We started light, applying 10 pounds of force for 30 seconds, then releasing the force. Then we increased the force in 10-pound increments, noted when the phones first started to deform (that's what our engineers call it) and stopped the test for each phone when we saw the screen come loose from the case. The results: all the phones we tested showed themselves to be pretty tough. The iPhone 6 Plus, the more robust of the new iPhones in our testing, started to deform when we reached 90 pounds of force, and came apart with 110 pounds of force. With those numbers, it slightly outperformed the HTC One (which is largely regarded as a sturdy, solid phone), as well as the smaller iPhone 6, yet underperformed some other smart phones. Throughout most of our test, the LG G3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 bent, then recovered completely from each step up in force. But at 130 pounds, the case of the G3 fractured. At 150 pounds of force, the Note 3's screen splintered and it stopped working. The iPhone 6 turns out to be weaker under this test than the 6 Plus. And slightly stronger than the this year's HTC One M8. The Galaxy Note 3 and iPhone 5S are really strong.

As far as Phones4U was concerned, the UK was inhabited by such tribes as the iPod Babes, Top Gear Tigers, and Bingo Boilers. Yes, it's a sustained insult by a company to its potential customers - with potentially Ratneresque consequences had it ever got out. But these stereotypes also allowed a 16 year old with no prior retail experience in a phone shop to sell phones successfully - without wasting the punter's time on something that didn't really suit them. And that's successful salesmanship: everyone was happy. The UK has changed, and the phone market has changed enormously in nine years. The prepay/postpay split has reversed.

Old technopanic in new iBottles &gt;&gt; Cato @ Liberty Julian Sanchez: Gather around young'uns: Back in the antediluvean early 90s, when the digital world was young, a motley group of technologists and privacy advocates fought what are now, somewhat melodramatically, known as the Crypto Wars. There were many distinct battlefields, but the overarching question over which the Crypto Wars were fought was this: Would ordinary citizens be free to protect their communications and private files using strong, truly secure cryptography, or would governments seek to force programmers and computer makers to build in backdoors that would enable any scheme of encryption to be broken by the authorities? Sanchez's (long) post is an excellent response to all the concerns about smartphones having better default security than PCs. Why don't PCs have default security as good as smartphones? How Apple's business model burned Samsung &gt;&gt; Tech.pinions Tim Bajarin (who is the older Bajarin - consulted with Diamond Multimedia about MP3 players and Microsoft about tablets in 1991): To say there was pent up demand for an iPhone with larger screens would be an understatement. One of the things I found out when talking to people waiting in lines for the new iPhones at Apple Stores is many of those who bought the Samsung Note 3 did so because it was the only one out there with this size screen. But now that Apple had one with basically the same size screen, they were going to switch to Apple. I also talked with someone familiar with Samsung's own research on what prompted people to buy a Note 3, thinking it might be the pen or the larger screen. Interestingly, what they found is that many people, especially in Asia, believe bigger is better and that the Galaxy Note in their mind was a premium product. Now that Apple has one of their own, it too will be viewed as a premium product in all of these markets and there is no doubt Apple is going to capitalize on this fact in a big way. Apple's entering the phablet space with a premium competitor is going to have a major impact on Samsung's fortunes. \"Talking to people and finding out their motivitions\" is such a foreign concept to many.

Among this group, almost 70% own an Android phone while just 20% are using an iPhone. One-in-three Android owners who don't have a case said it's because they weren't worried about dropping their phone. A third of iPhone owners who do not use a case say a case would add too much bulk to the design of their phone. 22% of iPhone owners then were unworried about dropping their phone (v 32% Android owners). In all, 87% of iPhone owners used a case; for Android the figure was 66%. Crisis in China: Samsung fell to #4 smartphone maker in China in August &gt;&gt; BusinessKorea Chinese smartphone vendors are increasing their global market share at an alarming rate. According to sources in the financial investment industry on 24 September, four Chinese companies – Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi Tech, and ZTE – made up 25% of the global smartphone market in August, a 12% year-on-year gain, which is the highest-ever result. In particular, the upward trend of Lenovo's market share was noticeable. The Chinese Android phone manufacturer has maintained the third spot by steadily increasing its share with 7.5% in June, 8.0% in July, and 9.2% in August. On the other hand, the position of Samsung Electronics and Apple, the two prominent smartphone makers, weakened owing to Chinese firms' good performances. Last month, Samsung and Apple comprised only 33.7% of the market with Samsung at 22.3% and Apple at 11.4%. The combined market share of the two companies was 39.9% in June, hovering below 40% for the first time in 21 months. Since then, the number has further decreased, with 35.1% in July and 33.7% in August. \"Alarming\"? Samsung: learning from the PC era &gt;&gt; Tech-Thoughts Sameer Singh harks back to the 1980s and 1990s: when \"good enough\" PC clones entered the market, IBM's products were the first to be caught in their upmarket march. On the other hand, Microsoft and Intel, suppliers of the two most valuable components of the PC, saw a sharp uptick in their revenues and profits as downstream competition intensified. But, thanks to Lou Gerstner, IBM also found a way to recover from this decline. First, IBM refocused on their core competence to stabilize their business (selling mainframes to enterprises). Second, and more importantly, IBM de-emphasized highly competitive, commodity businesses and pivoted their business model to focus on layers of the value chain that were not over-served. Thanks to intense price competition and \"good enough\" products, PC penetration was skyrocketing among businesses. This created an opportunity to profit from new demand for enterprise services and systems integration. The first half of this IBM's story clearly describes Samsung's predicament today. But, he suggests, the second half suggests Samsung's path to future success.

The machines, which will be built in conjunction with the Swiss company Airlight Energy, can convert 80% of the sun’s radiation into electricity and hot water, it is claimed, with each generating 12 kilowatts of electricity and 20kW of heat on a sunny day, enough to supply several homes. At the device’s official unveiling in Zurich, executives for both companies said they hoped that by 2017, when their sunflower generators should be ready for the market, they could be manufactured for half to one-third of the cost of comparable solar converters today. According to IBM, the machine’s secret lies with the microscopic tubes that carry water through the cluster of photovoltaic chips at the heart of each device. This system has already been adopted by IBM to cool its high-performance supercomputers. “We were inspired by the branched blood supply of the human body,” said Bruno Michel, from the IBM Research laboratories in Zurich. The sunflower operates by tracking the sun so that it always points in the best direction for collecting its rays; these are then focused on to a cluster of photovoltaic cells that are mounted on a raised platform. The cells convert solar radiation into electricity. However, without the microchannel cooling system, which carries distilled water through the chips, temperatures would reach more than 1,000C. With the microcooling system, which carries water to within a few millimetres of the back of each chip, temperatures are kept down to 90C – a far safer, and far more efficient, operating level. Electricity is generated while the system also produces large amounts of hot water from the cooling system. “That hot water is a game changer,” added Michel. “Electricity is obviously vitally useful but so is the heat – for we can use it for desalinating water.” At present, about 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. However, that figure is dwarfed by the number – 2.5 billion – who have no access to proper sanitation. And according to figures supplied by Airlight Energy, that latter number is currently increasing at a rate of 9% a year. However, the IBM-Airlight sunflower is designed to tackle both problems. The electricity will have numerous uses while the hot water can be pumped through desalinators that use porous membranes to boil salt water and distil the result into pure, drinkable water. A large installation made up of several generators could provide enough fresh water for an entire town, it was claimed at last week’s launch. Apart from sites in Africa, the Middle East and Australia, it is hoped the sunflower system will be used for remote hospitals, hotels and holiday resorts. IBM says it will instal its first two devices for free in 2016 and has asked towns around the world to put their names forward to be the first to have a solar sunflower erected on their land."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/23/boris-johnson-london-mayor-air-quality-award","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-23T16:10:47Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson wins international award for London’s air quality efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/23/boris-johnson-london-mayor-air-quality-award","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/23/boris-johnson-london-mayor-air-quality-award","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson wins international award for London’s air quality efforts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson, mayor of London, surprised clean air campaigners on Tuesday night by winning a prestigious international award for his efforts to improve the city’s air quality. The city faces stiff fines from Brussels over its repeated breaches of European Union air quality standards, with air quality likely to continue to fall below standards for years to come. Johnson was recently sharply criticised by a committee of MPs for failing to tackle air quality. Earlier this year, London suffered serious smog problems that led to warnings for vulnerable people, including children, the elderly and those with respiratory illnesses, to stay indoors for days. The C40 award judges cities around the world on their efforts to tackle air quality and climate change. London won the air quality award for its work on low-emissions taxis, and separately received another award for a new carbon accounting standard, described as an international best practice benchmark. Matthew Pencharz, the mayor’s senior adviser on environmental and energy issues, told the Guardian: “This is very good for us. This is going to stimulate the low-carbon economy, and taxi drivers will benefit from energy efficiency savings. London is showing practical delivery solutions to these problems [of air pollution and climate change].” He said: “We are the first to accept that air quality is a challenge. People accuse of us not doing anything, but I think anyone reasonable would say that Boris Johnson is doing everything he can to improve air quality in the capital.” The new zero-emission capable taxis are expected to reduce emissions by more than 75% compared to the average London taxi. In central London, where they will mainly operate in zero emission mode, emissions per taxi will be reduced by almost 100%. At present, London’s iconic black cabs account for around 15% of nitrogen oxide emissions in central London, and around 35% of PM10 emissions of large particles, which the mayor said would rise to 45% without intervention. But campaigners were critical of the award, saying that Johnson has not done enough to tackle London’s growing air pollution problem and it was “laughable” for him to receive such an accolade. “What a joke. Londoners will find it breathtaking that Boris is being awarded for totally failing to get to grips with our air quality crisis,” said Maria Eagle, shadow environment secretary. Darren Johnson, London assembly member for the Green Party, said: “We are running out of time to avert a climate catastrophe and the mayor of London should be at the forefront, advocating and delivering carbon reduction programmes on the scale needed, as well as zero carbon energy generating technologies like solar energy. Instead, Boris Johnson criticises wind farms, ignores the scientific consensus on global warming and promotes climate sceptic views. His backing of aviation expansion and fracking can only lead to one thing and that is the acceleration of global warming.” Johnson has made moves to tackle the air pollution problem, for instance by announcing this summer a rise in the congestion charge on the most polluting diesel-fuelled vehicles, but these plans will not come into effect until 2020. He has also introduced the city’s first age limits on taxis, which has resulted in the retirement of more than 3,000 of the oldest vehicles. The air quality award was made for a measure that would see “low-emissions capable” taxis on London’s streets from 2018. These taxis would cut down on emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which cause breathing difficulties in vulnerable people and can cause permanent harm to children’s lung development. However, the rules would only apply to new taxis licensed from 2018, which make up a small proportion of the total number of cabs, and they would only be required to use their low-emission capabilities in the central London low emissions zone, which does not cover the whole capital. Simon Birkett, founder and director of the Clean Air in London pressure group, said: “Boris is killing the taxi industry not saving it. He should be using his Twitter account to issue smog warnings not begging people to vote for him to win this prestigious international award.” He said: “The reality of Boris’s taxi strategy is that drivers are forced to buy one of two large, relatively expensive diesel vehicles because they are the only ones meeting the anachronistic 25 foot turning circle requirement. At the stroke of a pen he should remove the turning circle requirement and allow drivers to buy mass market petrol and other low emission vehicles at a fraction of the current cost of a taxi.” London’s iconic black cabs have long been required to have a tight turning circle, because of historic concerns over their manoeuvrability on London’s narrow streets. Birkett questioned whether the new rules would make a real difference, and asked: “Will Boris deliver a successful new taxi when he says he will, with funding complying with state aid rules and at a cost that allows taxi drivers to compete with private hire vehicles?” He also suggested it could take 15 years from 2018 to replace London’s existing 23,000 strong taxi fleet. • Fiona Harvey’s travel to New York was paid for by Siemens, which is a sponsor of the C40 awards for cities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/23/theres-a-price-to-be-paid-for-gp-co-payment-and-higher-uni-fees","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-23T00:46:14Z","webTitle":"There's a price to be paid for GP co-payment and higher uni fees | Stephen Koukoulas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/theres-a-price-to-be-paid-for-gp-co-payment-and-higher-uni-fees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/23/theres-a-price-to-be-paid-for-gp-co-payment-and-higher-uni-fees","fields":{"headline":"There's a price to be paid for GP co-payment and higher uni fees","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There is no doubt that in economics, price signals work. When the price of something increases, demand falls. The evidence is in on the markets for electricity and tobacco where government-imposed price hikes have seen consumption fall sharply. There are clear implications from these economic laws with the government’s proposed Medicare co-payment and higher university fees that will mean less use of health services and fewer people going to university as those price hikes impact on demand. The price on carbon, the colloquially named “carbon tax”, saw electricity prices rise 10% when it was implemented in July 2012. One of the many objectives of the price on carbon was to give a financial incentive for consumers to curb their consumption of electricity. This was seen to be through a combination of switching to more energy-efficient appliances, self-generation (solar panels on the roof), and better insulation so that the length of time heaters and airconditioners were on was reduced. Use less electricity and the price rise will not hurt the household budget all that much. It was as simple as that. The carbon price was in place for two years; the repeal was passed by parliament in July. In those two years, the volume of energy consumed by the household sector fell sharply. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that in the June quarter 2014, the final quarter in which the carbon price was still in place, the volume of energy consumed by the household sector was 4.6% below the level of the March quarter 2012, the quarter before the carbon price took effect. On a per capita basis, the decline in those two years was more than 8%, a quite massive decline as consumers reacted to the shock of rapid price rises. In the June quarter 2014, household consumption of energy was the lowest since the September quarter 2007, over which time the population had increased by about 12.5%. It must be noted that the carbon price was only a small part of the sharp rise in electricity costs over the past five years. There was a range of other factors specific to the generation and distribution of electricity which forced prices higher. That said, the sharp price rises, whatever the cause, only reinforced the downward pressure on electricity demand. There are also some other factors that were likely to have dampened electricity demand. The global climate change debate no doubt has seen some consumers change their behaviour and consumption patterns for altruistic reasons and not just for financial concerns – people doing their bit to cut carbon emissions by using less electricity. It was a similar issue with household consumption of tobacco, where the impact of excise increases has seen demand for tobacco in the first half of 2014 fall to the lowest level ever recorded. Price signals are working as consumers turn away from smoking and spend their income on other things. Government policy helped drive the consumption of tobacco down 3.5% since the end of 2012, down 28% since 2000 and a quite remarkable 55% since 1980. As for electricity, other factors are no doubt driving that fall. The plain-packaging laws are discouraging young people from taking up smoking, and the deaths of 15,000 people a year from tobacco-related illness is also a factor behind the fall in demand as tobacco companies somewhat ironically lose their valuable customers as a direct result of the goods they are selling to them. The end point of the examples of the carbon price and tobacco excise is that price signals and well-crafted government policies work to bring about behavioural change. This means that the proposed Medicare co-payment will, without question, cut demand for GP services as people stay away from the doctor because of the higher cost. The government has noted that this is a main motivation for the co-payment. So, too, with higher university fees that result from university deregulation. Higher fees will inevitably lower demand for a university education, which has what should be obvious implications for the skills levels of the population in a decade or so. The politics over the price signals relating to the carbon price and tobacco excise yielded what most thinking people would conclude are desirable results. The economy, societal wellbeing and even government finances benefited from these changes. The doctor co-payment and higher university fees will no doubt help with the budget bottom line, at least in the short term, but the higher cost of these services will probably result in people being a little bit sicker, less skilled and a little more ignorant. • Stephen Koukoulas is a research fellow at Per Capita, a progressive thinktank"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/live/2014/sep/21/peoples-climate-march-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-21T23:07:21Z","webTitle":"People's Climate March: thousands demand action around the world  - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/sep/21/peoples-climate-march-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2014/sep/21/peoples-climate-march-live","fields":{"headline":"People's Climate March: thousands demand action around the world  - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Summary Thank you for joining The Guardian’s global live blog coverage of the People’s Climate March. Demonstrations kicked off nearly 24 hours ago in Australia. Hundreds of thousands of people in at least 150 countries took to the streets to demand that world leaders take immediate action on climate change ahead of the United Nations climate summit in New York City on Tuesday. Highlights from the day’s events: • Initial estimates pegged the amount of people at the New York City protest at more than 310,000. “It’s completely blown our expectations,” said Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, one of the groups that helped organize the march. • UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon joined the demonstration in New York City, an unusual move for a high-ranking official. He was joined on the protest line by Jane Goodall and Al Gore. • US secretary of state John Kerry issued a strong warning about the threat of climate change after the New York City demonstrations. Kerry said: “There is a long list of important issues before all of us, but the grave threat that climate change poses warrants a prominent position on that list.” • A study released on Sunday shows that the world is emitting record C02 emissions at “dangerous and irreversible” rates. • Emma Thompson effectively served as the London demonstration’s spokesperson. She told The Guardian’s James Randerson: “Unless we’re carbon-free by 2030 the world is buggered.” • Australia’s labor environment spokesman Mark Butler criticized Australian prime minister Tony Abbott at a press conference ahead of the Melbourne march. Abbott has refused to join the upcoming UN conference. • Australian Associated Press estimated that 30,000 people attended the Melbourne demonstration. The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg has the latest on US secretary of state John Kerry’s evening speech to foreign ministers. Kerry said that climate change is as grave a threat to global order as Isil or Ebola. Goldenberg reports: The strong words from Kerry and the numbers in the streets elevated climate change to the top of the international agenda – at least for a few hours. Organisers had called the day of protests in order to put pressure on world leaders gathering in New York for a United Nations summit on climate change on Tuesday. It will be the leaders’ first such meeting in five years. Kerry, in remarks to foreign ministers of major economies, said climate change should rank as a top-tier agenda despite competition from more immediate challenges. “While we are confronting [Isis], and we are confronting terrorism and we are confronting Ebola, this also has an immediacy that people have come to understand,” he said. “There is a long list of important issues before all of us, but the grave threat that climate change poses warrants a prominent position on that list.” Numbers are in for the demonstration in Montreal, Canada: Campaigners crowd New York City during the mass demonstration to pressure politicians to take action on climate change ahead of Tuesday’s UN climate summit. Tomas Hachard writes for The Guardian about how climate change is being incorporated into modern cinema. As we have begun to see the effects of climate change more severely, more frequently and closer to home, so too have film-makers been spurred to address the consequences of an irrevocably damaged environment in new ways. In both fiction and non-fiction, climate change is no longer depicted as the eventual cause of future calamity, but a reality affecting everyday life. On the heels of documentaries that hoped to raise awareness by laying out the facts about climate change have come new ones showing the consequences of our behavior through spectacular images of an increasingly inhospitable environment. The New York City march is officially over and buses are rolling out of the area after a demonstration that far exceeded organizer’s, and the New York Police Department’s, expectations. Emma Thompson, Vivienne Westwood and Peter Gabriel joined campaigners and UK flood victims at the People’s Climate Change event in London. An estimated 40,000 people were there. Here is a gallery of the day’s events. Seen on the streets of New York City: The New York City march has wrapped up, though tens of thousands of people are still roaming the streets. End-of-protest notes from The Guardian’s on-the-ground observers: An aerial view of the People’s Climate March in New York City: Archbishop Desmond Tutu writes for The Observer, calling for boycotts of activities that support companies that burn fossil fuels, much like the protests leveraged against firms that conducted business with apartheid South Africa. Reducing our carbon footprint is not just a technical scientific necessity; it has also emerged as the human rights challenge of our time. While global emissions have risen unchecked, real-world impacts have taken hold in earnest. The most devastating effects of climate change – deadly storms, heat waves, droughts, rising food prices and the advent of climate refugees – are being visited on the world’s poor. Those who have no involvement in creating the problem are the most affected, while those with the capacity to arrest the slide dither. Africans, who emit far less carbon than the people of any other continent, will pay the steepest price. It is a deep injustice. Photos Guardian reporters in London, New York, Paris and Melbourne have filed their report on today’s People’s Climate March, which has attracted hundreds of thousands of demonstrators across the world. Van Jones, an activist who briefly served as Obama’s “green jobs” tsar, said it was possible the march could, in hindsight, be viewed as an historic moment, much like the civil-rights era “March on Washington”. Sunday’s protests were at the very least an organising triumph for Avaaz, 350.organd a new breed of climate activists who are trying to reach out beyond traditional green constituencies. The day started in Melbourne, where demonstrators carried their giant Tony Abbott puppet in protest at his repeal of the carbon price. The usual call-and-response of “What do we want? Climate action. When do we want it? Now” was revised to “10 years ago”, by a crowd that felt it had already fought this battle. Here’s a look at the protests across Canada, collected by Guardian social media producer Kayla Epstein: The march’s New York City route takes demonstrators down Sixth Avenue, past the headquarters of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. Fox News is not devoting much, if any, time to cover the event. Marchers, however, still had a message for the conservative news network. The Guardian has just put together a nice gallery of the scene in New York City, one of the many cities worldwide holding gatherings ahead of the UN climate summit, where more than 120 world leaders will convene for a meeting aimed at galvanising political will for a new global climate treaty by the end of 2015 Event organizers have pegged the current New York City crowd estimate at 310,000 people. 350.org founder Bill McKibben is an event organizer: Guardian readers around the world have been submitting photos from their local climate marches. Kayla Epstein, social media producer at The Guardian, has collected some of the best photos. Contribute your own here, and be sure to tell us your location when you submit! El Palmar, Vejer, Cádiz, Spain Hong Kong Budapest People’s Climate March organizers in New York City said the crowd is much bigger than expected, reports The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg. Organizers said the crowds in New York Citywere much bigger than expected, filling 50 city blocks along the route, from 80th Street down to streets in the 30s. “It’s completely blown our expectations,” said Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, one of the groups that helped organize the march. “It’s filling the entire march route.” “This is many, many multiples of our expectations,” Patel said. He said organizers had to re-route the drone they were using for crowd estimates to take in all the people. The Guardian’s Latin America correspondent Jonathan Watts on the scene at Rio de Janeiro’s climate march, which was besieged by rainy weather. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has been spotted at the demonstration. It is slightly odd that he is participating as these protests are meant to pressure world leaders ahead of the UN climate summit in New York City on Tuesday. Alongside Ki-moon, is primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, former US vice president Al Gore and the former prime minister of France, Laurent Fabius. To kick off the march, demonstrators held a moment of silence that erupted in a loud call to world leaders to “act now” on climate change. The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino reports from the ground: People from around the country and some from around the world have descended on New York City to sound the alarm for climate change. Kids, adults and the young at heart are in the march, demanding things like reduced carbon emissions, an end to fracking, divesting from fossil fuels, all under one clear global message to world leaders: act now. At 12:58 the crowd of 250,000 or more marchers with their hands in the air went silent. After a minute of silence, they erupted in loud cheers and chants to “sound the alarm” on climate change. Three generations McDaniels are participating in Sunday’s march. “These guys deserve a better future than the one they’re destined,” said Nikki McDaniel of New Jersey. Her sister, Carla Shannon, came with her children. Shannon said her son just learned about climate change in school and was very eager to participate. A look at the New York City march from the city’s rooftops: The world emitted a record amount of greenhouse gases this year, according to a new report in Nature Geoscience. It shows that the 2014 worldwide emissions are on course for a record high of over 40bn tonnes. As recently as 2010, that number was at 32bn tonnes. The Guardian’s Fiona Harvey reports: Scientists think climate change is likely to have catastrophic and irreversible effects, including rising sea levels, polar melting, droughts, floods and increasingly extreme weather, if temperatures rise more than 2C. They have calculated that this threshold is likely to be breached if global emissions top 1,200 billion tonnes, giving a “carbon budget” to stick to in order to avoid dangerous warming. Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, said: “If this were a bank statement it would say our credit is running out. We’ve already burned through two-thirds of our global carbon allowance and avoiding dangerous climate change now requires some very difficult choices. Not least of these is how a shrinking global carbon allowance can be shared equitably between more than 7bn people and where the differences between rich and poor are so immense.” The study, by the Global Carbon Project, also found that China’s per capita emissions had surpassed those of Europe for the first time, between 2013 and 2014. The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino is in the dense, slow-moving New York City march. Three generations of McDaniels came out to demand action on climate change. “These guys deserve a better world than what they’re destined to receive,” said Nikki McDaniel, the “cool” aunt. One of the lead organizers for the People’s Climate March, activist Bill McKibben, posted an update on the New York City marches pace. The protests in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil have been plagued by bad weather. The Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, Jonathan Watts, sent in some pictures from the scene. Martin Lukacs, an environment writer for The Guardian, is in today’s crowd in New York City. He sent in this photo of a parachute created by Oakland-based migrant justice group Culture Strike. The parachute symbolizes the way climate change disproportionately impacts people in the global south, making refugees of millions, as well as species like the Monarch butterfly, disturbing their migratory patterns. Julio Salgado, a member of the group and an undocumented artist, says he is thrilled by how much art he’s seen in the streets on the march. Actor Mark Ruffalo has been a leading opponent of fracking and is marching in New York City today. The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg spoke with Ruffalo in the crowd. “The message is that we are here to demand that our leaders embrace the will of the people, and the will of the people is to make climate change a priority,” said actor Mark Ruffalo. He said it was important for people to realise the technologies to deal with climate change - such as renewable energy - were already here “The only thing they have to do is get out of the way.” The idea of the demonstration is to get UN leaders to act and Ruffalo - unlike a lot of climate watchers – is not cynical. He thinks that the UN summit would produce concrete results. “You can’t get 200 people together and not have something get out of it,” Ruffalo said. “It’s going to be huge. I don’t know exactly the effect, but I promise you one, five, 10, 15 leaders are going to come out of it, and do something. Somebody is going to be a hero.” Among the the thousands of protesters in New York City, a few signs (and a parasol and bubble) stand out: A branch of Colombia’s Ministry of the Environment is sharing images from the scene in Bogotá: Scientists met outside the American Museum of Natural History in New York City on Sunday morning to prepare for the march. Scientific American spoke with climate scientists, geologists and biologists about why they decided to join the event. “If the most well-informed citizens are not willing to act, what hope do we have of averting climate catastrophe?” says Pattanun “Ploy” Achakulwisut, a PhD student in atmospheric science. She enlisted other graduate students from Harvard University to join the march, partially with the help of a scientist / superhero poster exhorting scientists to “mobilize march [and] make history.” An organization called Science Stands rallied scientists ahead of the march and encouraged them to join. As paleoclimatologist Peter deMenocal of Columbia University puts it: the “modern climate is exceptionally warm relative to the last millennium, and future decades will be another world, unlike anything modern civilization has ever seen. This is a really sobering fact.” So he will be joining the march along with Columbia colleagues and his twin 8-year-old girls. “It’s important they witness that a lot of people care about this issue and are willing to do something about it,” he says. “This is about their future.” As the New York City march kicks off, here’s a look at today’s marches across the UK. The “small but determined” group of demonstrators in Brighton: From the town of Stroud in Gloucestershire: Neil Young just debuted a new environmentally-themed song on the Democracy Now! broadcast of the march. Click through to here an acoustic version of the track, Who’s Gonna Stand Up. CNN columnist John D Sutter is posting short profiles of New York City marchers on Twitter. People have travelled from all over the US to be a part of today’s events, with hundreds boarding buses and others taking the ‘People’s Climate Train.’ On Grist, Heather Smith writes about her experience taking the four-day journey on the People’s Climate Train from California to New York: It becomes apparent, after a while, that many of the people on this train are growing to hate us. The People’s Climate Train people make up about 80 percent of the passengers, so with their aisle-blocking, folksong-playing, Miseducation of Lauryn Hill-blasting, workshop-holding, and earth-centric arts-and-crafts making, there’s not much room for the usual pastimes of non-activist long-distance train travel — like sitting quietly and reading a book. Among the People’s Climate Train riders, opinions on this are mixed. Some worry that we are giving a bad impression of the movement. Others think that the Amtrak conductors are acting like total sticks-in-the mud. Guardian environment writer Martin Lukacs reports from the start of the demonstration: Under the banner of “frontlines of the crises, frontlines of change”, the head of the New York march will be led by a hundred youth from the communities most impacted by the root cases of climate change across the continent - including the Bronx, Jackson, Mississippi, and indigenous peoples from Canada, representing, in one spokesperson’s words, “the leadership of the future.” Hello, this is Amanda Holpuch in New York City, taking over the live blog from Adam Vaughan in London. People have gathered in Manhattan this morning ahead of the city’s march, which starts at 11:30am local time. Demonstrators hope to pressure world leaders to take more significant steps to address climate change – just before the United Nations climate summit is held here in two days. The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg is at the New York City march, along with environment writer Martin Lukacs and reporter Lauren Gambino. Nearly 500 buses have brought in demonstrators from other US states and Canada, but Guardian reporters will also be filtering in information from marches across North and South America. If you are on the ground at any of these marches, please share your thoughts with me on Twitter (@holpuch) or by email: amanda.holpuch@theguardian.com An estimated 27,000 people turned out in London. Actor Emma Thompson led the march with other celebrities and the Bishop of London gave a speech saying “of course” climate change was a moral issue and it was time to act At least 8,000 people marched in Paris, despite poor weather Marches took place in several other UK cities, including Manchester, Newcastle and Edinburgh Thousands more people took part in marches in Brussels and Berlin That’s all from me for today - I’m handing over the live blog now to Amanda Holpuch in the US, who will be blogging as the New York march gets underway in less than half an hour. Here’s a literally colourful video interview by Arthur Neslen in Brussels, with Sanjeev Kumar, 40, founder of Change Partnerships, an environmental NGO Karl Mathiesen has been talking to locals in Paris who point out that while around 8,000 people (the latest police estimate) is a respectable turnout, it’s not that high given the city’s reputation for protest. He writes: Antoine Heron, a Parisian and retired engineer said the march was big, but not compared to the social actions for which Paris is famous. “It’s not so big as if it were something about salaries and political matters.” He said Parisians were anxious to see a global agreement come from the UN conference which will take place in their city next year. “We don’t want to have the same problem that we had in Copenhagen. Nations need to make decisions,” he said. Our South America correspondent, Jonathan Watts, has been out at the march in Rio de Janeiro, where a few hundred people have been marching. He writes: Several hundred marchers in Rio have braved the rain and wind that has cleared the beaches of Ipanema. Not a bad turnout considering how allergic Cariocas usually are to even the slightest drizzle. All ages and colours. Samba drummers knocking out a good rhythm as marchers sing “Ruralista acabando com o bom senso” (the agro-lobby are finishing off good sense”). Many on this “Caminhada Pelo Clima” - which has been organised by Avaaz - are waving flags with green hearts supplied and bearing banners that read: “zero deforestation”, “100% clean energy” and “reduce, recycle and reuse”. Renata Perrone, who has a green heart painted on her cheek, said it was a good turnout considering the rain. “ This is my first march. I’m here ‘cause it’s important, something everyone should care about. The more people join, the stronger we are. Brazil is not doing enough. No country is doing enough.” Democracy Now is live-streaming from New York. They’re currently interviewing Bill McKibben of 350.org. He’s stressing the diversity of the march’s make-up, which includes a contingent of scientists: Scientists are sick of not being listened to, for 25 years they’ve been telling us what’s going on, but no one’s paying attention They’ve reached the point where ‘if they won’t read the freaking papers we’re putting out, we come out and tell you’ Journalist Tom Wills, who was at the London march, calculates there were around 27,000 people on the capital’s march, which puts it around the same size as Melbourne’s turn-out. His calculations are in this Google spreadsheet. Our US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg, has been out celeb- and politico-spotting in New York. She says that actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who was recently appointed as a UN climate envoy, is expected to join the march, along with actor Susan Sarandon. This is Suzanne pictured with what looks very much like anti-fracking campaigner, Mark Ruffalo, who this week called on Barack Obama to ban fracking ahead of Tuesday’s climate summit. Some more pics from Bibi van der Zee in central London, who’s been talking to marchers. Mother and daughter Maureen and Adaesi have come to the march together. “My children are around somewhere too,” says Adaesi. “We’ve come because something has to be done,” says Maureen firmly. “The government has to take action, and we have to take responsibility too - to buy less and live down a little.” Damian Carrington writes: Victoria Bamford, a 66-year old gardener from Wales, who left her home at 6am to join the London march. “We are on a knife edge now in every way.” She has noticed changes in the climate in her work. “You cannot rely on the seasons any more, and plants are getting stressed and ill. I’m no bloody expert, but we have to tackle the fossil fuel business. But I don’t think the government is doing anything.” Karl Mathiesen in Paris says the march is around 1.5km. Police are putting the number of marchers at around 3,000 though organisers believe it may be higher. Brussels has been busy too, albeit if not on the same scale as London. Our European environment correspondent, Arthur Neslen, has been down to a march there: About 2,000 people braved heavy rain in downtown Brussels to fire off a message for urgent climate action to world leaders at the New York summit. The protest was smaller than expected after police instructed organisers to postpone it for 24 hours because of traffic concerns. That synched it with Brussels’ annual car-free day – but also, the dramatic end to a Belgian indian summer. Even so, a mostly young and energetic crowd danced in the downpour behind a samba fanfare all the way from the Palais de Justice to the Belgian finance ministry. Here’s the audio of the Bishop of London’s speech, courtesy of James Randerson: We are living on an Earth in an interconnected world, we live on an ark... the people in the first class cabins will not long remain impervious to the impact on poorer people in steerage, it’s just one world in which we inhabit Karl Mathiesen in Paris writes: Maryk Reesink and her daughter are Parisians who are anxious to see a global agreement struck in their city next year. Reesink says action on climate change is very important but she is pessimistic. “The politics in France is not occupied with this question. That’s why I’m here. I hope it can change things. I find it a nice idea to make many manifestations around the world. That it is something global that is moving.” Speeches have begun in London, starting with the Bishop of London. In Berlin, three marches are converging on the Brandenburg Gate. Here are a couple of marchers: In Edinburgh, former Telegraph environment correspondent Louise Gray highlights this choice slogan: There’s also a small march taking place in Newcastle. One of our Australian bloggers, Alexander White, has written a post on the today’s marches and the “tipping point” that he believes climate campaigners are approaching: This global event is an amazing confluence of international civic action, a full twenty-four hours of people power calling for the de-carbonisation of our world. The fact that it can happen at all is a reason to be a climate optimist. ... It is heartening that increasingly environment groups are joining forces with other civil society groups like unions, faith groups and development agencies. Internationally, unions are building a global campaign under the banner “no jobs on a dead planet”. These alliances and campaigns in civil society, as well as ones in the business world, are the start of a positive civil society “tipping point”, guided by the optimistic hope that we can still act to stop global warming. The front of the London march has reached Parliament Square - but other marchers say they are still stuck all the way back at Temple... There are still two and a half hours until the New York march, but preparations are well underway: London is far from the only capital with impressive crowds. Karl Mathiesen, our man in Paris, says there are thousands of people out on the streets there. Wow, Thompson is having a busy day, and fast becoming the de facto spokeswoman for the London march. “Unless we’re carbon-free by 2030 the world is buggered,” she tells the Guardian’s James Randerson. Listen to the full interview here: Sky News has just been interviewing Emma Thompson as she walks the final few minutes to parliament. Whilst I’ve been aware of climate change for many years, seeing the effects of climate change written so clearly on that exquisite landscape [on my trip to the Arctic] put a rocket up my arse. I’ve been being lazy. I’ve been working in poverty reduction but this issue affects everything. Thompson didn’t realise she was live on TV and her ‘colourful’ turn of phrase prompts an apology to viewers by Sky’s journalist. Asked why climate change isn’t higher on the political and world agenda, she says: News outlets and fourth estate are very much controlled. I’m not suggesting there’s a conspiracy, but there’s a great deal of control over what kind of news goes out in what way. Those of who want to know what’s going on in the world have to explore quite carefully and forensically about what’s going on. I think what it is is we don’t make the connections. Climate change is connected to all events, in particular war. It’s quite hard to get a handle on the size of the crowds in London. A Metropolitan police spokesman couldn’t give me an estimate on numbers but said a “proportionate policing plan is in place”. Avaaz, one of the organisers, told me previously that they were expecting potentially north of 10,000. The green NGOs and Green party are out in force in London today, as you’d expect. There are also some well-known campaigners, such as gay rights activist Peter Tatchell: At the London march, Bibi van der Zee sounds the alarm at Brand’s apparent no-show (see 09.28) ‎People streaming down nearby roads to join the demo. It is going to be an extremely good turn out. No sign of Russell Brand yet though. Some concern he may have overslept. Karl Mathiesen has been talking to some of the participants at the Paris march. He writes: “We are here to push the negotiations to understand that you cannot speak about climate without speaking about the ocean,” says Catherine Chabaud, the French sailor and journalist who twice circumnavigated the globe solo twice and is now an adviser to the French government on ocean health. Chabaud will tell the crowd at today’s Paris march that the ocean’s organisms are responsible for supplying half of the world’s oxygen and that the health of the sea is vital to combatting climate change. “Of course we have to reduce emissions, but we also have to develop solutions for the oceans.” She says reducing the pollution flowing into the sea from industry and the creation of marine protected areas are important climate tools. The London march has set off from Temple towards parliament, with some of the celebrities at the front: And this from our head of environment gives a good sense of the scale of the turn-out: And here, some of the shapes being thrown on the march: “We’re calling for leaders to step up on Tuesday in New York and start making serious pledges to emissions cuts,”Alex Wilks, campaign director at Avaaz, one of the London march’s organisers, tells James Randerson. Here the full interview here: And Emma Davies, one of the marchers - “it is happening and some people are pretending it’s not happening, and that’s just not right” Elsewhere, here are the crowds in Stroud, Gloucestershire: And ‘Mr Frackhead’ has made his debut in Manchester: The marches are getting ready to set off towards parliament in London: In London, speeches are scheduled to start around 2pm. First up is the Bishop of London, and there will also be addresses by the designer Vivienne Westwood and Alice Hooker-Stroud of the Centre for Alternative Technology (which was celebrating its 50th anniversary recently, and of which we have a very nice feature on here). Some more colourful marchers and fun placards in London: And in Munich, too: Naomi Klein says she’s beginning to think the marches “are going to be huge” In Manchester, Friends of the Earth is organising an anti-fracking march outside the Labour party conference. Apparently they’ve created a huge puppet called Mr Frackhead - I’ll look out for photos later. The group’s head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, says: The UK’s environmental credibility has been sinking for years. The government has been bending over backwards to develop fracking and extract more dirty gas and oil, instead of investing in the UK’s huge renewable power potential and a cleaner future for us all. Meanwhile, in London, the Guardian’s head of environment, Damian Carrington, notes the symbolism of a high tide coinciding with the marches: Marchers are already gathering in serious numbers in London: James Randerson, the Guardian’s science and environment news editor, is down in London. He’s been talking to Oxfam’s campaign director, Ben Phillips, who says climate change is “not just about nature, it’s about human beings”. You can listen to his interview in full here: “UCL claims to be one of the greenest universities in the world yet has millions in fossil fuels,” say students, staging a demonstration in the UCL quad to demand divestment from fossil fuels by UCL and other institutions, reports Bibi van der Zee in London. “This institution is supposed to be about the future of the world but is profiting from its destruction,” they say. A large banner reads “UCL put your money where your mouth is - divest from fossil fuels”. In Paris, organisers are hoping for thousands of people to turn out, despite poor weather (which also affected Perth, Australia). The Guardian’s Karl Mathiesen reports: Avaaz campaigners in Paris expect “several thousands at least” at the march starting at 2pm local time at la Place de la République. The Facebook page for the Paris march has 5,500 people signed up to attend. “30,000 people turned up in Melbourne,” said one Avaaz employee, “so we hope it can be big here too.” But organisers say it will depend on the weather which looks like it is clearing up after heavy showers this morning. Crowds are building up in Manchester, where it looks like the march is benefiting from the decent weather forecast across most of the UK today: And the Guardian’s Bibi van der Zee has bumped into a carbon bubble. It’s a metaphor for the carbon bubble some campaigners fear is building up - read more here for an explainer. Meanwhile, in New York, where the march isn’t even due to start until 11.30am local time (4.30pm British summer time), the media have already arrived for what is expected to be by far the largest of all these global marches: On the subject of world leaders, here’s the French president, François Hollande, pictured on Saturday receiving a petition from campaigners Avaaz, which has been signed by over 2m and calls for the urgent forging of “realistic global, national and local agreements, to rapidly shift our societies and economies to 100% clean energy by 2050”. Ricken Patel, the group’s executive director, calls it “the most important petition we’ve ever done”. The BBC has more on Ban Ki-moon’s unusual step of joining the New York march later today (as our correspondent Fiona Harvey noted earlier in the week, “high-ranking officials do not normally attend mass public protests”). Mary Robinson, former UN special envoy, told the BBC: I think the Secretary General recognises that this is for everyone, and it is important that in every country civil society comes out and puts pressure on their leaders to make the changes necessary so that we will have a safe world. He doesn’t see the marchers as them and the insiders as being an us, rather he sees the two as part of building a momentum, it is civil society asking their leaders to be more ambitious. The BBC’s Matt McGrath notes that several major countries are not sending heads of state to Ban’s summit on Tuesday, but there will still be more world leaders at his meeting than were at the landmark Copenhagen climate talks in 2009. The leaders of China, India, Australia, Russia and Canada won’t be here. Observers believe the meeting can still achieve political momentum. After all, there will be more leaders in New York than in Copenhagen in 2009 when hopes of a last minute deal were dashed in confused and rancorous discussions. Protesters have recreated an oil spill in front of a BP-sponsored exhibition at London’s British Museum, the Guardian’s Bibi van der Zee tells me. She writes: Last month a US judget found BP guilt of gross negligence and bore clear responsibility for the Deepwater oil spill four years ago. The protesters, a group called ‘BP or not BP’, unrolled a long strip of black material and dressed up as dying pelicans, dolphins, turtles and out-of-work fishermen, in order, they said, to highlight the ongoing costs of the oil spill. And here’s some video from Bibi (apologies for the quality). London students: there are plenty of demonstrations taking place outside universities right now, including at LSE and UCL, calling for divestment from fossil fuels. Timings and locations here. Time for another photo roundup, from Genoa in Italy... ...to Barcelona, Spain... ...and Zurich, Switzerland, yesterday: Down under in Australia, Guardian Witness users have been sending in updates. Submit yours here. A close-up of that Blue Mountains banner from earlier: And marchers on the move in Adelaide: Naomi Klein, the activist and author whose new book is about climate change and capitalism, writes in a comment article for the Guardian that the “true leaders” on climate change are not those at the UN summit on Tuesday but those in the streets today. Is it a stunt? Well, sure, all protests are. But the mere act of expressing our collective sense of climate urgency goes beyond symbolism. What is most terrifying about the threat of climate disruption is not the unending procession of scientific reports about rapidly melting ice sheets, crop failures and rising seas. It’s the combination of trying to absorb that information while watching our so-called leaders behave as if the global emergency is no immediate concern. As if every alarm in our collective house were not going off simultaneously. She also reprises one of the themes of her book, that it is not top-down governmental approaches or business that hold the key to tackling climate change, but grassroots movements: Sunday’s climate march will serve many purposes for its many participants: meet up, boost morale, exert political pressure. But sounding the alarm together will help us bring our actions in line with our emotions. So many of us are scared of what is happening to the world around us; for one day, we will come together and show it. Yes, we will be showing that sense of existential urgency to our politicians. But we will be showing one another. By sounding this people’s alarm, we will also be saying that we are no longer waiting for politicians to declare climate disruption an emergency and respond accordingly. We are going to declare the emergency ourselves, from below, just as social movements have always done. Musician Jarvis Cocker, meanwhile, suggests people out today don’t march, but dance their way along the street in his comment for the Guardian: Can you be arsed? Do you risk being disappointed again? Or do you sit this one out? I mean, climate change is a bit old-hat now, isn’t it? And some people say it doesn’t even exist – people like ... Nigel Lawson. ... The People’s Climate March this Sunday is important. Because governments won’t put the case for action on climate change too strongly – no, that might be interpreted as being “anti-business”. It might dissuade corporations from building factories in countries that sign on to climate agreements. It might be harmful to THE ECONOMY. So once again it will be left to ordinary people to point out the blindingly obvious fact that destroying the place you live in is not a good idea. It really isn’t Finally, The Observer has Desmond Tutu writing for it, who reprises a message about fossil fuel divestment that he’s made powerfully before: As responsible citizens of the world – sisters and brothers of one family, the human family, God’s family – we have a duty to persuade our leaders to lead us in a new direction: to help us abandon our collective addiction to fossil fuels, starting this week in New York at the United Nations Climate Summit. Reducing our carbon footprint is not just a technical scientific necessity; it has also emerged as the human rights challenge of our time. In the UK, the Manchester march gets going in just under an hour at Piccadilly Gardens in the town centre. There are also marches in Edinburgh (1.30pm), Sheffield (from 1pm), in Stroud (12pm) and in Dudley (2pm). More details here. Separate to the main London march, at 2.30pm activists from the group No Dash for Gas / Reclaim the Power will be outside Conservative central office at what they perceive as the party’s problem with climate change denial. In a statement, the group’s Jo Martin said: Climate change is slipping down the agenda at an alarming rate. Today thousands of people are marching across the world and they demand that their voices are heard. By denying climate change, these MPs are denying our children their right to a safe and sustainable future. We need to see decisive action taken on climate from our representatives, rather than repeated denial and ignorance. Emma Thompson, who has recently returned from a trip to the Arctic with Greenpeace, has been talking to Andrew Marr on the BBC. Marr asks what concerns her most about climate change. “I’ll tell you exactly what it was, it’s the water marks left by the glacial mess the sides of the valleys where they were once great... You forget that glaciers retreat but they also lose mass,” she says. Marr asks her what she says to climate sceptics and people who argue the melting of the Arctic will make the world richer as natural resources are opened up. Thompson responds: It’s a very strange position to take because as we note the weather changing, all of the violent storms, the flooding, all of the very clear and concrete data that we now have... the fact the last IPCC report which was thousands of scientists from around the world has said without a shadow of a doubt a) global warming is occurring, b) it’s happening much faster than predicted and c) it’s been caused by human beings and our burning of fossil fuels. The moment for that denial is over. We’ve tipped over that point. What’s interesting is that now that the Arctic ice is melting and we are able to get to places we couldn’t get before and drill before, we’re drilling for the stuff that melted the Arctic ice in the first place...the cycle is speeding up. The Arctic is at it were the canary in the mine. What can people do, Marr asks, to which Thompson says: Go on the march, I’ll be there and speaking. Inform yourself. And understand the fact that although we’re up against huge difficulties - because fossil fuels are a very, very difficult thing to give up. But we now understand that we cannot afford to use them any more, it’s as simple as that, the day for those fuels is over. I want Cameron to very much step back away from coal, because that’s the worst one of the lot. She says David Cameron has “absolutely” abandoned the passion for the green agenda that he showed during his “vote blue, go green” years. Want to find out more about Thompson’s Arctic journey? Watch this great film by our very own Laurence Topham, who accompanied her: This weekend’s events range from huge to modest. Petra Granholm emails from the remote Åland islands in Finland with this photograph of their climate march on Saturday, where she says 80 people turned out. In the background is their local dairy’s biogas plant and a biofuel bus that apparently runs on fish trimmings. Granholm, who is chair of the Åland Society for Nature and the Environmen, says: We believe the solution to the energy crisis does not come in one single package, but in many small alternative solutions. The islands also have a good chance of becoming self.sufficient on wind energy in the near future. Celebs due down at the London march include actor Emma Thompson, musician Peter Gabriel and the comedian Russel Brand, who’s going to be down at Temple Place at 12.30. Here’s Brand on climate change, replete with reels of Fox News churning out climate change denial (read more on Fox News’ climate coverage in this post by our blogger Dana Nuccitelli). Bill McKibben, the US environmentalist and co-founder of 350.org, has been telling New Yorker magazine about the genesis of the marches. Everyone in this movement who heard Ban Ki-moon’s call for world leaders to come to New York City had the same thought: These guys are going to come and do the same thing they always do—offer a few fine speeches and head home having accomplished nothing. We figured we would invite ourselves to come along and try to press them harder than they’ve been pressed before. We don’t expect this will have immediate results here in New York, but we think building a big movement is the only way to get them off the dime. Asked if it’s too late for action, he said: I know how much carbon we can have in the atmosphere, but I don’t know the exact number we need in the streets. It strikes me that the more we have, the better our chances. In New York, march organisers have said they’re expecting more than 100,000 people to turn out today. While I’m sifting through the news coverage of the marches and Tuesday’s UN climate summit, here’s a little photo roundup to give a sense of the breadth of the Australian events. The crowds in Melbourne, Australia, where today’s rolling marches kicked off, were even bigger than the 20,000 that organisers had earlier suggested, according to the Australian Associated Press. The AAP is reporting that around 30,000 people attended the march to call for action on climate change. GetUp! campaigns chief of staff Erin McCallum told the agency: This is a clear testament that Australians want climate action regardless of what Tony Abbott and his government are doing right now. The key message today is we’re doing what he won’t, we’re standing up, we’re taking action as consumers, as citizens, as Australians around the world and all around Australia today. We’re not going to wait for our government to wake up, we’ve woken up and we’re here and we’re going to take action starting right now. Adam Vaughan here, taking over the live blog from Melissa Davey in Australia. Good morning from London, where thousands of people are expected to turn out on the streets today to lobby world leaders to take bold action on climate change. The Guardian’s reporting team will be on the ground in several European cities today, including Arthur Neslen in Brussels and Karl Mathiesen in Paris. In London, where people will be meeting at Temple Place at 12.30pm before marching on parliament, Bibi van der Zee, Damian Carrington and James Randerson will be reporting as events unfold. John Vidal will be reporting from Chester, and I’ll be doing my best to follow other marches around the UK. Meanwhile, here are the other main events on in Europe today (all times local): Amsterdam - 6pm at Kade EYE Paris - 2pm at Place de la République Istanbul - 5pm at DEPO, Tütün Deposu Lüleci Hendek Caddesi No.12 Tophane Berlin - 4pm at the Brandenburg Gate Brussels - 10.30am at Place Poelaer If you’re following along on Twitter, #PeoplesClimate is the ‘official’ tag, but #climatemarch is also worth a look. And if you’re out and about on any of the marches, I’d love to hear from you - please either email me (adam.vaughan@theguardian.com) or tweet me @adamvaughan_uk). Thanks for reading the Australian coverage of the People’s Climate March. We’ll be handing over to our colleagues in the UK and US, so keep following this blog for updates as those events begin to unfold shortly. Tens of thousands of people have attended climate change rallies across Australia, in the first leg of a global wave of protests calling for tougher action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the UN climate summit in New York next week — Oliver Milman reports. The flagship Australian event in Melbourne attracted almost 20,000 people, organisers say. Greens leader Christine Milne told attendees at the Melbourne event that the world is on a trajectory towards an an “unliveable planet”. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, will not be joining more than 120 world leaders at the UN climate summit on Monday. People’s Climate march events are set to take place throughout the UK and US over the coming hours. Watch this live blog for updates as those marches unfold. Around 200 people rallied for action on climate change in Darwin. It seems human signs are popular among climate activists. It’s a sea of umbrellas at the march in Perth. Around 4,000 people formed a human sign spelling out the message ‘Beyond Coal and Gas’ in Sydney this morning. The community group Our Land, Water, Future organised the event and captured the result using a drone. Here’s what the People’s Climate March looked like in Delhi: In a few hours, campaigners will march through central London as part of the global action there. They will be joined by celebrities including actress Emma Thompson and musician Peter Gabriel, and church bells will ring to mark the march through Westminster to parliament, where speeches and a rally will be held. Thompson said: There is little time left to prevent the worst excesses of climate change, yet our world leaders continue to stall. I’ve witnessed the impact climate change is already having on the melting Arctic and on poverty-stricken communities in the developing world. We can’t go on pretending nothing’s happening. I’ll be at the march, and I hope I see you all there. An editorial in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says the public will be watching more closely than ever when world leaders meet in New York on Monday for the UN’s emergency Climate Change Summit. [Australian prime minister Tony Abbott will not be attending] The global People’s Climate March is aimed at gathering momentum and political will in anticipation of the New York summit, and also ahead of UN talks on a binding climate protocol next year, the Post-Gazette says. Climate activists have a lot to be agitated about. The United States has yet to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, developed in 1997, which would have committed this nation to binding reductions in carbon emissions. President Barack Obama announced ahead of the climate summit that he has negotiated voluntary agreements with companies to reduce their emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent pollutant. Voluntary reductions are desirable, but they will not cut emissions deeply enough to avert the effects of climate disruption. Only binding regulations can do that. Read the full piece here. The Perth People’s Climate March is set to begin, with organisers hoping cold and wet weather won’t keep too many people away. Many people are reporting they didn’t know about the People’s Climate March events being held around Australia until today. Some said because the event seems to have been publicised largely online through social media, people not engaged with those mediums missed out. From our live blog commenters: The People’s Climate March in Canberra had more of a festival atmosphere, with musicians playing on the lawns of the Australian National University where the main event was held. On-site climate workshops were held on topics like divestment of shares in fossil fuels. Bill Ryan, a 92-year-old grandfather and WWII Kokoda veteran, addressed the crowd. He has long protested against Whitehaven Coal’s Maules Creek mine in north-west NSW. There were also giant turtles. Meanwhile in Adelaide, people met in Rundle Park before marching through the streets. Speakers at that event included Patrick Greene, who has worked in the solar energy industry for several years. He said the government was jeopardising renewable energy jobs. For myself and 13,000 other solar workers around Australia, this industry is our livelihood. We go to work each morning knowing we’re doing something to make the climate a little bit safer for our kids. With this government in power, our entire industry is at risk with this review of the renewable energy target. Thousands of people attended the People’s Climate March in Brisbane, Fairfax reports. Kirsty Albion from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition told the Brisbane Times: It’s my generation’s future on the line, that’s why we’re here in Brisbane calling on our leaders to protect our future, by moving Australia beyond coal and gas and investing in renewable energy. Professor of Public Health at the University of Melbourne, Rob Moodie, has told attendees at the People’s Climate March in Melbourne that food shortages and outbreaks of disease will increase if governments don’t act to cut carbon emissions. The impact of climate change will be universal and can’t be limited by quarantine. It will be unpredictable and if we leave it too late, we won’t be able to adapt. We won’t be able to rely on miraculous cures or a simple vaccine. Act now or pay later. We all know prevention is better than cure. Responding to climate change is the ultimate test of prevention. Effective climate control is good health. Remember there are three tiers of prevention. The first is the system. The second is the system. And the third is the system. Our politicians must act to confront the biggest public health challenge of the 21st century. In Bendigo, people are campaigning for global climate action by holding a picnic. Guardian Australia reporter Nick Evershed has stumbled across the People’s Climate March unfolding in Glebe. The police [push]bike squad in Cairns are keeping an eye on climate marchers. Back to the People’s Climate March unfolding in Melbourne. Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman is on the ground and tweeting updates here. Ben and Jerry’s — undeterred by calls from Queensland environment minister Andrew Powell to boycott the ice-cream company because he claims their calls to protect the reef had jeopardised jobs and tourism dollars — turned up at Melbourne’s rally. Jeremy Lawrence, a mechanical engineer, told reporter Oliver Milman he was attending the Melbourne event as an “economic rationalist libertarian”. Lawrence says: If you talk to a lot of conservative engineers, the older ones who plan the grid, they can say it’s not going to stay like it is now for the next 50 years. They say other countries around the world will leapfrog us, with countries like India and Africa set to leapfrog us in their renewable energy efforts. Meanwhile, deputy Greens leader Adam Bandt posed for a photo with marchers. Here are some comments from Guardian readers watching our live coverage of the People’s Climate March. Keep your thoughts coming. Meanwhile, here’s a lovely picture from the climate march on the Sunshine Coast — Gubbi Gubbi Dancers on the beach, courtesy of Reece Proudfoot. In around 12 hours time, people will take to the streets in New York for the People’s Climate March event there, with Leonardo DiCaprio, former US vice president Al Gore, UN secretary general Ban ki-moon and mayor Bill de Blasio set to take part. Organisers predict as many as 100,000 people will march through midtown Manhattan, which would make it the biggest climate rally in history. But the Wire reports that many businesses are unprepared for the mass march and had no idea it was happening until informed by journalists. Two ‘Climate Trains’ that have traveled from California to New York will make stops along the way to pick up marchers in Denver, Chicago, Reno and Omaha, the Wire reports. The event will feature giant movable art installations, a 300-foot-long banner that reads ‘Capitalism = Climate Chaos – Flood Wall Street’, and a large recreation of Noah’s ark. World leaders will meet for the UN’s emergency Climate Change Summit in New York on Monday. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott will not be attending. Here are pictures from People’s Climate March events happening around the world as people spring to action across different time zones. Jakarta Los Angeles Sydney Melbourne Kiribati Professor Tim Flannery, head of the Climate Council, motivated the Melbourne crowd, telling them they were creating positive change. He said the time for questioning the science on climate change was over. I want to remind you of what’s at stake here. This is an issue where the science is very, very clear. We know that burning fossil fuels in this country adds about $2.6bn to our health bill every year. We know that hundreds of people die from the very tiny particles that are emitted when burning fossil fuels. We know that we can do things better. Australia was leading the world in terms of solar power, he said, with 1.3m solar installations compared to half a million in the US. People want change, and we need to send a very strong message to the world that Australia does care about this and we want better action from our government. This is not a time for despairing. This is a time for determined, resolute action. I can tell you if we don’t take action this year, next year, and the year after, it may be too late. The stage has been crashed at the Melbourne rally, Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman says. Police tell him there are “easily” more than 10,000 people gathered, though numbers aren’t final. Greens leader Christine Milne told attendees at the People’s Climate March in Melbourne that the key message of the day was “action not words”. We don’t need to start a conversation, we need to take action. We want no more delays. Climate change is real, it is accelerating, we are on a trajectory for four degrees of warming which is an unliveable planet and we won’t stand for it. That is what we have to convey to Tony Abbott and leaders around the world. Australia should be net carbon zero by 2050, Milne said, and called for greater investment in renewable energy. The reign of fossil fuels is over. What we now have to do is end the reign of the fossil fools who keep it going. A strong crowd has gathered for the People’s Climate March at the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne. Victoria Marshall-Cerins and her daughter Anna told reporter Oliver Milman that they believe climate change is one of the biggest issues facing Australia. Marshall-Cerins says: We’re here because of the fact that Australia is now dragging its heels –we’ve gone from being one of the world leaders on climate change to going backwards. The ‘town-crier’ is getting in on the action too. An organiser of the march said people appeared to be more energised than at a similar rally held last November which attracted 40,000 people, but wasn’t sure that quite so many people had turned out for Sunday’s event. Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman is at a press conference being held by Labor environment spokesman Mark Butler ahead of the start of the Melbourne climate march. Butler criticised Australian prime minister Tony Abbott for refusing to join world leaders on Monday at the United Nations conference in New York, Milman reports. However, Butler would not commit Labor to a post-2020 emissions cut target. Butler told reporters: Both major parties had strong commitments to carbon pollution reduction based on a range of conditions. It’s not clear whether those conditions have been satisfied. We haven’t got a position [on post-2020] yet. That’s the serious work Australia should be doing now but instead the Abbott government is busy dismantling the good work we’ve done to date. People are already gathering in Cairns – this photograph is courtesy of Andrew Picone. And Sarah Berry has shared this picture taken at sunrise on the Sunshine Coast. That event kicked off at 5am today and will run through to sunset. Those attending will walk the length of the coast starting at Sunshine beach in the north and finishing at Kings beach in the south at sunset. Daniel Rockett, from conservation group WWF Australia, told Guardian Australia that climate change is set to make natural disasters more severe and costly in the coastal zone of south-east Queensland. Some people are going to great heights to get the climate action message out there. Online activist group GetUp! has posted this picture on Twitter of a banner strung up on the Three Sisters rock formation in the Blue Mountains of NSW. Here are the People’s Climate March events happening around Australia today. Melbourne from 11am - State Library of Victoria Sydney from 12pm - Bicentennial Park, Glebe Canberra from 10:30am - Chifley Meadows, ANU Adelaide from 11am - Rundle Park Brisbane from 11am - Queen’s Park Perth from 1pm - Russell Square Park Darwin from 10am - Nightcliff Foreshore To follow the events on Twiiter, you can use the hashtag: #peoplesclimate You can also tweet your pics to me @MelissaLDavey and you can follow reporter Oliver Milman who is covering the Melbourne event. The Adelaide event took place yesterday – here’s a pic of that march from 350.org founder and environmentalist Bill McKibben: And there are media reports that security is tight in Cairns, with parts of the city in lockdown and an extra 800 police officers, who have additional powers, patrolling the streets in preparation for the march there. The second and final day of the G20 finance meeting kicks off in Queensland’s tropical north on Sunday. Supporters of the People’s Climate March are expected to gather in the Cairns CBD on Sunday morning before making their way to the local convention centre where the meeting is being held. The flagship Australian People’s Climate March is set to begin in Melbourne at 11am. Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman will be on the ground covering it for us. Speakers will include environmentalist Professor Tim Flannery, Greens party leader Senator Christine Milne and Labor environment spokesman Mark Butler. Looks like Milne is raring to go: Similar events were held around the country in November last year for a National Day of Climate Action, with organisers GetUp saying 60,000 people participated in rallies, across capital cities and regional towns. But Sunday’s action is expected to be the biggest yet. Good morning and welcome to live blog coverage of the biggest global march for action on climate change in history – the ‘People’s Climate March’. Events are happening all over the world and we’ll bring you coverage of as many of them as we can, with our reporters covering events in Australia, London and New York. The action comes as world leaders prepare to meet for the UN’s emergency Climate Change Summit in New York on Monday. US president Barack Obama, UK prime minister David Cameron, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and 125 heads of state will attend that summit — but Australian prime minister Tony Abbott will not be there despite heading to a UN Security Council meeting in New York the next day. Abbott attracted criticism on social media following the news. You can read this piece from the Guardian on 20 high-profile personalities attending the People’s Climate March and their reasons for taking part. Ban says: Action on climate change is urgent. The more we delay, the more we will pay in lives and in money. I will link arms with those marching for climate action. We stand with them on the right side of this key issue for our common future. Event organisers hope to kick-start public action in the lead-up to the Paris climate talks in December 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/21/ret-uncertainty-threatens-further-blow-to-south-australian-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-21T04:08:23Z","webTitle":"RET uncertainty threatens further blow to South Australian industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/21/ret-uncertainty-threatens-further-blow-to-south-australian-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/21/ret-uncertainty-threatens-further-blow-to-south-australian-industry","fields":{"headline":"RET uncertainty threatens further blow to South Australian industry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The day Dick Warburton handed down his report of Australia’s Renewable Energy Target, uncertainty ripped through the clean energy industry. In one press release, Andreas Nauen, chief executive of Senvion Australia, a windfarm builder, said any change to the RET would compromise the company’s existing investments and “damage Australia’s international reputation as a safe place to invest”. “Once the trust has gone, once the knowledge has gone, once the jobs have gone, then restarting the clean energy industry takes a lot of effort,” the release said. Nauen has good reason to be irritated. In February, Senvion Australia received development permission to begin work on a new windfarm project in the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. That project should end up being worth $1.5bn and create 500 construction jobs, with 50 more sustained over the 25-year life of the project. But now the company says investment in windfarm projects has stalled, making it impossible to know when the project will be completed and come online. In economic jargon, this is called “sovereign risk” and occurs when a government’s decisions make business investment unreliable. Richard Inwood, the managing director of Tindo Solar, the country’s only domestic solar panel manufacturer, says the uncertainty created by the RET review has effectively “kneecapped” the industry and will force his company to revise its plans for growth, which is a tragedy for the renewable energy industry that once seemed to be doing everything right. Already well-established in countries such as Spain, Germany and China, clean energy offered a way to tackle climate change while setting up a new industry at a time when the manufacturing sector had been declining due to a high Australian dollar and structural changes within the economy. The Renewable Energy Target (RET) was the core mechanism in making this happen. Initiated in 2001 under the Howard government to help build Australia’s clean energy industry, the program was expanded under Labor. Under the RET, Australia is required to ensure that 41,000 gigawatt hours of the country’s energy comes from renewable sources by 2020. With a largely unexpected drop in electricity demand, that figure is likely to be nearer 26% of the country’s energy by 2020 than the 20% that was initially envisaged. The lesson from this is that the RET has largely been a huge success. When Warburton, a self-professed climate sceptic, calling for the program to be either closed to new entrants or scrapped entirely, it spelled chaos for the $20bn renewables industry – and the South Australian economy in particular. The state is expected to struggle after 2017 with the closure of the local car industry, which will shut the Elizabeth Holden factory and cause the loss of 1,700 jobs. Most of the factory’s 33 direct Australian suppliers are also expected to go, along with a good chunk of the 700-800 companies in the wider supply chain. The bad news doesn’t end there. Another recent report from the Department of Defence threw up questions about the future of the state’s defence manufacturing industry and reports that the federal government was considering buying “off the shelf” submarines from Japan instead of sourcing them locally from the Australian Submarine Corporation, which built the Collins Class submarines, have added to the state’s fears. Doing so would effectively gut the last major manufacturing industry in South Australia, potentially putting thousands out of work and increasing the risk that the state will shed its skillbase. This has prompted criticism from industry figures such as Goran Roos, chairman of the Advanced Manufacturing Council who says that the decision to let manufacturing slide is a mistake. “The statement from the prime minister about defence policy and industrial policy, and you can quote me on this, is completely ludicrous,” Roos says. “You can’t run a defence operation without industry. Who’s going to make your ammunition? Who’s going to repair your vehicles?” “Part of it is this erroneous idea about becoming a service economy. Two-thirds of all services that generate value are linked to manufacturing. You can see in Adelaide the link to Holden has an effect on lawyers, accountants and so on.” “[Adelaide] is just ahead of the curve.” Clean energy had offered a source of hope, as its expansion requires exactly the kind of “advanced manufacturing” the premier had been promising to bring to the state to fill the gap created by the end of Holden. Inwood, of Tindo Solar, says: “We were the fourth largest investor in renewables. In six months we’ve fallen to ninth.” He says when Warburton and his team visited Tindo’s factory, they treated it like a “box-ticking exercise”. The company’s factory sits on the outer edge of Technology Park in Mawson Lakes, about a 40-minute drive north of Adelaide. From here, Tindo builds, sells and delivers each system under a contract similar to those widely used across the US and EU. This creates an arrangement where a solar panel system is installed free, in return for a 15-year commitment from the client to buy power from the company. Inside, the place doesn’t look like much. Everything is compact. The entire production line fits into a room not much bigger than the average residential house. Every four minutes a brand new panel slides off the line. It takes 40 minutes for a panel to go from start to finish, overseen by a handful of workers in high-vis clothing who keep everything moving. “I’d been here three weeks when the [former] PM decided to open the company,” says Gavin Warwick who has worked for the company since October 2012. He smiles as he remembers being the one to show Julia Gillard the ropes. “Some of the guys thought it would be funny to throw me in the deep end to see how I went,” he says. Of the 18 jobs Warwick had applied for that month, he says, Tindo was the one he wanted the most. As a baby company in a new industry, Tindo promised exactly the kind of stability he had been looking for. And Tindo Solar has plans to expand, which would create more positions for people like Warwick. The company employs 30 people across one shift, but wants to put on a second and third shift, which would create 100 jobs. That number might have been even higher, Inwood says, had the rules of the game not changed so suddenly, forcing the company to rethink when and how it may be able to achieve its goal of cornering 20% of the Australian solar panel market. “We’re not going to go bankrupt,” Inwood says, but “this would have translated to 600 new jobs, five minutes down the road from Holden.” The fallout doesn’t stop there. Across town, Rhys Jacobs is in his office at the University of South Australia’s Sustainable Energy Centre. There, the 23-year-old PhD student is working on a project for use in the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) industry. CSP represents the other half of the solar energy industry from the photovoltaic solar cells made by Tindo. CSP works much the same way as traditional coal-fire power stations, but instead of burning coal to generate electricity, concentrated sunlight is used to heat a fluid, make steam and produce electricity. Jacob says his research project is on “encapsulated phase-change materials for use in thermal-energy storage”. In a word, batteries. Big ones. Jacob says initial design would halve the cost of storing electricity for the CSP industry, though it has yet to undergo a feasibility study. “In terms of cost, current ones go for around $30/kWh, which is horrible,” he says. “We’re aiming for $15/kWh.” Jacob is blunt about the state of the Australian renewable energy industry. “Australia’s a complete joke in renewable energy policy. We really are the worst country for renewable energy projects. We’re dead last. There will be a huge market, unless we call off the RET.” Asked whether he will move away to find work, Jacob is just as forthright. “South Australia doesn’t have a lot of the industry I’m looking at,” he says. “A lot of it is based in Sydney and Victoria. That’s where a lot of the work gets done. South Australia has a lot of experts in the field, but we’re very far behind when it comes to putting money in the project. “There’s a huge market overseas. Europe’s still fantastic at it. China, not so much. Dubai, surprisingly has a huge CSP industry. Which is very surprising that they are more up-to-date than we are.” And so long as the renewable energy industry is left to wonder about what comes next for the RET, the fear is investors will stay away, meaning the country will miss out on opportunities for growth. Inwood says this is the great tragedy behind the review. “We’ve directly put in $6m under a set of goal posts that were set in concrete,” he says. “All I’m saying is get out of our way and let us do it. Don’t change the goal posts when we’re just ramping up. “Let us grow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/19/south-africa-drc-grand-inga-dam","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-19T11:32:48Z","webTitle":"From Cape Town to Kinshasa: could the Great Inga dam power half of Africa?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/19/south-africa-drc-grand-inga-dam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/19/south-africa-drc-grand-inga-dam","fields":{"headline":"From Cape Town to Kinshasa: could the Great Inga dam power half of Africa?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At the end of August the South African cabinet ratified a signed treaty on the Grand Inga hydropower project with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Jeff Radebe, minister for planning, monitoring and evaluation, made the announcement at a media briefing signalling progress between the two countries. If successful, this would be the world’s biggest hydropower project with the potential to power half of Africa. But as boardroom deals are made, questions continue to linger on the viability of the project. Who stands to benefit most from it? Is it sustainable? 54 years after the ground was first broken (pdf) for project, can Kinshasa guarantee that the new phase will not become a financial burden? The site for the project is in Bas Congo, a province at the extreme south-west of DRC. It is hoped that the potential 40,000MW output will power Africa’s industrial economic development. “The Inga project capacity is almost double China’s Three Gorges dam – currently the world’s largest hydroelectric project producing 22,500 MW,” said Isaac Kalua, founder of Nairobi based environmental group Green Africa Foundation. However, the dam is not without its critics. There are questions about its financing and what’s in it for the bankrollers. The World Bank and several other financial institutions like the African Development Bank, are funding the project to completion through grants and loans. “The project will strengthen DRC’s institutional capability by establishing an autonomous and transparent Inga Development Authority. The project will also finance technical, environmental, and social studies to develop the Inga III and selected mid-size hydropower projects sustainably,” said the World Bank in a press release earlier this year. South Africa will also finance part of the project. In 2013 it was reported that R200bn has been set aside and state owned power company, Eskom, will receive 2,500MW of the 4,800MW produced by Inga III, the project’s first phase. “The project will primarily benefit SA and mines in Katanga. Only 1000MW will be sold to national power company Société Nationale d’Electricité (Snel) for consumers in Kinshasa and surrounding areas,” said Ange Asanzi, Africa programme assistant for environmental lobby group International Rivers. DRC’s prime minister Matata Ponyo Mapon has said the Grand Inga will provide the country’s blue print for a better future. But on the world’s poorest continent, where natural wealth has largely failed to catalyse development, can projects like these lift people over the energy poverty line? “[The dams] will not solve the issue of energy poverty. Africa’s poorest live in rural areas. It is not cost effective to supply grid electricity to rural populations. Grid electricity is only cost effective in areas with a population density of at least 50 people per square meter,” Asanzi said. The International Energy Agency estimates that globally over 1.3 billion people cannot access electricity and 2.6 billion people are without clean cooking facilities. More than 95% of these people are either in sub-Saharan African or developing Asia and 84% are in rural areas. Rather than cut poverty, Asanzi argues that the project could potentially have a negative effect on communities. “People affected by Inga I and Inga II have never been compensated. Most of them will again be affected by Inga III. The resettlement action plan cites only five villages to be subjected to relocation, excluding many others.” The livelihoods of local communities are also at risk as the river is a major source of income for them. Kalua suggests this fear could morph into something bigger: “Huge volumes of water will be diverted. Drying rivers can lead to political unrest, since communities living downstream face the brunt of the reduction in volumes.” But the real elephant in the room is corruption. Inga I and Inga II were put up at a time of impunity among DRC’s political elite where there was little accountability regarding state expenditure. “Many politicians in DRC are still as driven by personal interests as they were 50 years ago,” says Asanzi. In a climate of mistrust and hope, Africa’s search for solutions to its energy deficit trudges on. Kenya and Ethiopia are betting on wind energy, while Ghana is banking on solar. South Africa is looking more and more towards importation. The need is great but experts remain cautious of the means employed to achieve a sustainable energy end. “As a continent we need to interrogate all these approaches that will result in an energy gain. We have to assess the environmental and humanitarian impact that these grand projects will have,” Kalua concludes.

Malaria currently infects over 200 million people worldwide, mainly in developing countries. This new technology could allow hospitals to rapidly screen and monitor patients for malaria at a significantly lower cost per patient, and may be portable enough to be used in the field. So, how does it work? Currently malaria is diagnosed by taking a blood sample from a patient, staining it with a dye, and looking at the sample with a microscope to detect the Plasmodium parasite which causes the disease. This new technique uses magnetic resonance relaxometry (MRR) to detect a parasitic waste in the blood of infected patients. “There is real potential to make this into a field-deployable system, since you don’t need any kind of labels or dye,” says Jongyoon Han, one of the senior authors of the paper. The researchers used a small, 0.5-tesla magnet. The current device prototype is small enough to sit on a lab bench, but the team is also working on a portable version for field-based diagnoses. After taking a blood sample, the analysis takes less than a minute. Only a droplet of blood is needed, making the procedure much less invasive for patients and easier for healthcare workers. Will it be expensive? No. According to researchers the system can be built at a very low cost. “Since this technique does not rely on expensive labelling with chemical reagents, we are able to get individual diagnostic tests carried out at a cost of less than 10 cents,” says Weng Kung Peng, lead author of the paper and research scientist at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology. Is it more reliable than past tests? In the blood-smear test, the blood is stained with a dye that colours cell nuclei. As red blood cells don’t have nuclei, any marks that show up are presumed to be from the parasite. The problem is that technicians don’t always agree on the interpretation of the smears. According to Hans, there’s a lot of variation over what counts as infected red blood cells rather than dust particles stuck on the plate: “It really takes a lot of practice.” Because this new technique relies on magnetic fields to detect the presence of the parasitic waste, it may be more reliable as there is less scope for human error. Is it ready to be used in the field? Not yet. The technology is still in the early stages and will need to be tested and developed further for reliable field deployment. However, the results so far are promising. So promising in fact that researchers are launching a company to make this technology available at an affordable price. The team has also began running field tests in south-east Asia, and is exploring ways to power the device on solar energy, making it more accessible for healthcare workers in poor, rural areas.

How important is it to look at energy and water together? It is crucial; they are two sides of the same coin. We need energy to make clean water available, provide proper irrigation systems and to recycle water. At the same time you need water for cooling and for generating energy. The energy sector accounts for 25-30% of water extraction from freshwater systems and energy demand will increase 50-60% over the next 25 years. So if we are going to demand more energy it means we are going to extract more water. The reasons for joined-up thinking seem obvious, so why have the sectors remained separate for so long? Natural inertia and only thinking – and innovating – in their own narrow fields. There are only a few countries that have demonstrated successful collaboration. Israel, for example, has always looked at energy, food and water together: this is where the drip irrigation technology comes from. To a certain extent the Brazilians are also making progress, but these knowledge systems need to impact the rest of the world, especially where population will be rising the fastest. Collaboration is easy to talk about, but how do you actually make it happen? For the water and energy, what we have done in the post-2015 agenda is to propose “nexus” targets. In the case of energy, we now have goal seven: access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy services for all. It has three targets, but we originally submitted seven. Four of those targets were all nexus targets relating to water, health, women’s empowerment and food. This was intended to force global leaders to realise that they can’t treat these issues in silos anymore. In the negotiations they have adopted three; we believe that the rest will be adopted as indicators. This means we are forcing development thinking to be joined up. We also need to work at building capacity in developing countries where these issues will be most serious, but they also have the opportunity to leapfrog. How do we ensure that they build their capacity so that when they are doing urban design policy, for example, the energy minister and the water minister are sitting together? ‘Nexus’ policymaking recognises complexity. Is there a sense within those working specifically in the energy sector that this approach might slow down progress on specific issues? Yes, and it does becomes more difficult. For example, it slows down the process of design because it requires more thought. In some cases it also makes the coordination more difficult: it means you have to work among many players and many ministries with three complex issues. So, yes, it will slow down progress. However, this is why you need good technical and global institutions that can spread best practice. It is a bold choice to pursue but we have to be bold. So far we have made progress with the sustainable development goals (SDGs): we finally got a goal on energy. So we forced leaders to think about the issue. Remember there was no mention of energy in the millennium development goals – it was as if we took energy for granted. Later this month the Climate Summit will be kicking off in New York. Do you have any specific plans for it? We will be presenting a concrete plan, alongside commercial banks and some development banks, to raise $120bn (£74bn). We will share how we will do it and how it will happen within the climate finance package. How do we raise the first $120bn? We have six instruments that have been developed. One example is how we scale up green bond finance instruments, from the current $23bn a year to maybe $50bn or $60bn a year. Also, thanks to the EU and US, we will announce there that we have a plan to reduce energy poverty by half, by 2030 or 2035. The EU has committed, along with the German government, to support 600 million energy-poor people with modern energy services. The Americans will also announce another $100m in Africa. If the US and the EU fulfill their commitment, we will reduce energy poverty by half. With the SDGs and COP 2015 in Paris on the horizon, the next year will be decisive for energy. What are your hopes for the year ahead? I have high hopes for the Paris conference, I know we will get a deal. Although, whether it will be the transformative deal we all dream about – that will keep us below 2 degrees – remains to be seen. We know we need a lot of money. We estimate we need $600-800bn a year to achieve the three targets of SE4All. Remember that today other energy technologies enjoy $500bn a year of subsidies. How much went into renewables? $80bn. Can we level the playing field a little bit to give alternative energy a chance?

Work on printed solar cells has been under way since 2007 through the Victorian Organic Solar Cell Consortium, which includes CSIRO, and Melbourne and Monash universities. A printer at the CSIRO office in Clayton, Victoria, has been able to make prototypes of the solar cells in order to improve their efficiency. The technology consists of a type of “solar ink” which is designed to capture sunlight and turn it into electricity. A fine layer of this ink is then deposited onto a material, such as plastic. This allows for cells to be embedded into windows, effectively tinting them, to generate electricity. They can be printed in smaller sizes to be used to charge devices such as smartphones and laptops. The CSIRO has had the solar cells on its Clayton roof for the past 18 months, with decent results. The printed cells are 10 times less efficient than standard solar panels, which are made of silicon, but scientists hope to improve that. Fiona Scholes, the group leader of integrated systems and devices at CSIRO’s manufacturing flagship, said several companies, such as Dyesol, had expressed interest in helping commercialise the technology. “We can’t manufacture them here, but we are at the point where they can be taken up by a manufacturer,” she told Guardian Australia. “It would be wonderful if we could achieve a similar power delivery at significantly reduced cost. Silicon is falling in price, but think about how cheap plastic is. The ink is a negligible cost, so the raw materials are very cost effective. “This is a big step forward because you can put these cells anywhere you can think of. Also the consistency is better than silicon – they work well in cloudy conditions.” Funding for the project has been provided by the Victorian government and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). The federal government is attempting to abolish Arena. “Whenever I tell people about this technology, the response is so positive,” said Scholes. “People love the idea. I think there would be a good demand for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2014/sep/07/buffalo-grid-2014-new-radicals-observer-nesta","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-07T05:29:00Z","webTitle":"Buffalo Grid: 'If you need a doctor, or you've been robbed, you need a phone'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/sep/07/buffalo-grid-2014-new-radicals-observer-nesta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2014/sep/07/buffalo-grid-2014-new-radicals-observer-nesta","fields":{"headline":"Buffalo Grid: 'If you need a doctor, or you've been robbed, you need a phone'","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Over the past decade, mobile phone use in the developing world has rocketed, but in many areas it is difficult to find power to charge them. Since 2010, Buffalo Grid has been working to bring cheap electricity to rural communities in Uganda, where 80% of the population owns mobile phones but only 5% has access to power. At present, many people travel to the nearest town twice a week to charge their phones; the journey can take up to half a day and has a considerable cost. After a prototype of bicycle-powered generators failed, Daniel Becerra, Buffalo Grid's managing director and co-founder, came up with a new device: a portable, quick \"mini power station\" that charges up to 24 phones at a time using solar energy. Charging takes the same time as a wall socket. Becerra's background is in industrial design and engineering. After studying in Mexico and running his own design consultancy, he attended Imperial College, where he was part of a team that developed a substitute for air-conditioning that gave 90% of the efficiency with 5% of the consumption. Buffalo Grid, named after buffalo charges, has so far set up five machines in Uganda, given free to local entrepreneurs who guard the phones while they charge. The machines have been distributed to an existing network of coffee farmers, who have worked for decades with Becerra's co-founder, Phil Schluter, a coffee trader. Becerra says the project's main innovation lies in its distribution model: people pay by sending a text message (roughly 10p, the market rate) and then plug their phones into the nearest grid. \"This allows you to claim your revenues remotely, and have a much lower running cost that allows you to offer an affordable service.\" Mobile phones are vital for people in developing countries, whether for trading, safety or general communication. The UN, where Becerra presented the project earlier this year, identifies the mobile phone as the biggest contributor to economic growth in off-grid areas. \"Mobile phones are really changing the game: they improve quality of life and business activities. If you need a doctor or you've been robbed, you need a phone,\" Becerra says. \"You hear stories of users who would sacrifice their quality of food just to get airtime and a charge for their phones.\" Mobile phone charging is the machine's main use at the moment, but it can also be used for rechargeable lights. Buffalo Grid is about to launch a pilot in India and the ultimate goal is reaching the 1.2 billion people in the world who live without electricity. Becerra's favourite part of the project has been discovering Uganda: \"I'd never been to sub-Saharan Africa before. I was quite apprehensive – in the news you only hear bad things – but once you go you realise how magical it is. People live very pleasant lives and the environment is incredibly beautiful.

Midweek diners wolf down parmigianas and chips as an array of poker machines wink in the background. An NRL tipping competition at the bar is doing brisk business. The beer is decidedly non-craft. But this no-nonsense venue, just 10km but a world away from parliament, is the latest stop in a national pro-renewables tour that is making the Abbott government decidedly uncomfortable. Organised by the Solar Council, an industry body for the solar energy sector, the Save Solar Forum is targeting the 20 most marginal Coalition electorates in Australia. Its message, delivered via speeches to gatherings that are open to the public, is simple – retain the renewable energy target. The RET, which stipulates that 41,000GW hours – currently about 26% – of Australia’s energy should come from renewable sources by 2020, appears to be under its greatest threat since being introduced by John Howard’s government. A government-commissioned report by businessman Dick Warburton, who has expressed doubts over whether humans are influencing climate change, concedes that the RET has largely done its job. By requiring energy providers to buy renewable energy certificates it has helped expand wind, solar and other renewables, driving investment and jobs, all at a negligible cost to the taxpayer. But this success is a problem, Warburton contends, and so the RET must be wound back or scrapped. Abbott is understood to favour the latter. The clean energy sector argues this would be disastrous for the industry, imperilling about 20,000 jobs and billions of dollars of new investment. Work on new large-scale wind and solar projects has largely ground to a halt. In Queanbeyan, the solar preacher in the pulpit is John Grimes, chief executive of the Solar Council. Grimes is fresh from a bruising encounter from Greg Hunt, the environment minister who once skydived in support of solar energy subsidies, following the last solar forum in Brisbane. “There are people in this audience who will lose their jobs if this goes through and we will not just stand by and allow that to happen,” Grimes says, to whoops and applause. There is an air of confidence, the feeling that the government is rattled on this. It’s a decent turnout – about 400 people – with few spare seats. Grimes runs through a rather unflattering appraisal of the government’s record on renewables. A reminder that the treasurer, Joe Hockey, finds wind turbines “offensive” provokes derisive laughter and a few boos. Queanbeyan sits in the bellwether NSW seat of Eden-Monaro, which the Coalition holds with one of its slimmest majorities. Former Howard aide Peter Hendy won the seat in 2013 with a margin of just 1,085 votes from moustachioed Labor incumbent Mike Kelly. Kelly is lurking ominously in the audience, sensing a group of voters that may have buyer’s regret. Hendy is openly lampooned on stage, with an empty seat bearing his name. Someone in the audience calls Hendy a coward. Hendy refused an invitation from Grimes, calling the forum a “Greens branch meeting.” The leader of the Greens, Christine Milne, who is also on stage, looks bewildered when Grimes mentions this. “It’s vital we fight this campaign now, the Coalition MPs need to understand they need to change their leader’s position,” Grimes says. “This isn’t a partisan issue, but we are resolute. The government needs to know this will hurt them politically. Your local member, Peter Hendy, needs to hear loud and clear that this is just not on. We think changing enough votes on this one issue will be a cinch.” Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, isn’t impressed with Hendy. “It’s pretty weak,” Butler says. “It’s the job of a member of parliament, especially when you’re drawing a salary paid for by taxpayers, to front up to hear every message the community wants to give you, whether it’s a comfortable or uncomfortable one.” Still, given the hostility on display to the government’s position, it’s perhaps understandable that Hendy didn’t show up. The polling isn’t pretty either – recent surveys have shown support for the RET in the region of 70% and higher. Newspoll found 98% of respondents are in favour of renewable energy. “What else do 98% of Australians agree on? Is there anything?” Butler asks rhetorically. Earlier in the day, Hendy tells Guardian Australia the Solar Forum is “partisan” and unhelpfully scheduled on a parliamentary sitting day. “They are simply attacking the government and me,” he says. “The government’s policy is to deal with the issue of climate change and a key part of that is to promote alternative energy sources.” Hendy won’t comment on the Warburton report – the government has yet to officially respond – but says he appreciates that renewables need “some sort of subsidy”. “I acknowledge that there is a place for subsidies,” he says. “Climate change and environmental issues are important issues for people in Eden-Monaro. Part of that is support for renewable energy so we’ll see how that pans out.” Back in Queanbeyan, the audience certainly contains several Greens, but there are other groups. Retirees, men in high-vis vests, a few plumbers. While the stalling of large-scale wind and solar projects worries some, the meat of the opposition to the government is derived from the remarkable take-up in household solar, largely in Coalition electorates. About 1.2m Australian households have solar panels in their roofs. The demise of the RET would be bad news for anyone who would want to follow them in a bid to knock some dollars off their power bills. There are more than 17,000 solar installations in Eden-Monaro (the wind industry has taken a back seat in this campaign, perhaps due to unfounded fears of turbines) and voters who have already invested readily take to the microphone to voice their grumpiness. “I’ve installed a solar system on my house and I appreciate those savings,” says one, Hugh Howell. “Coal is the industry of the past and I don’t understand why this government is so beholden to these industries of the past. The Libs don’t seem to understand the world has changed.” Moira Nelson, who has driven from Canberra, is on a disability pension and can’t afford rooftop panels. But she’d like the opportunity, one day. “I’d really like it but the cost is a problem,” she says. “The newspapers seem to take a very political view on all this. It feels like we are losing our voice.” The question of whether renewable energy, especially household solar, is popular is a fairly easy one to answer in the affirmative. The crucial aspect, politically for the Coalition, is how deep that popularity runs. “People have wanted renewables for a long time,” says Butler afterwards. “My mum had a solar sticker on her car when I was young. But the unknown is how deeply people feel about it. “My feeling is that it has the potential to be emblematic of the fact Tony Abbott doesn’t have his eye on the future and doesn’t have regard for evidence-based policy.” The Solar Forum moves on, with its next stop in the Sydney seat of Barton. Grimes exhorts the audience to keep the faith. “I need you to help us put the pressure on,” he says. “I can’t do the phone calls and write the emails myself. I need you all to send a message, to make them feel nervous.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/02/propane-renewable-sources-ecoli-genes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-02T15:00:02Z","webTitle":"Propane made with renewable process for the first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/02/propane-renewable-sources-ecoli-genes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/02/propane-renewable-sources-ecoli-genes","fields":{"headline":"Propane made with renewable process for the first time","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A gas which can power cars and heat homes has been made using a renewable process for the first time. Propane, which makes up the bulk component of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), has previously only ever been produced from fossil fuels. But a team of scientists at Imperial College in London has successfully demonstrated that they can make propane from glucose using a genetically engineered version of bacterium E coli. “We can now make a product that until now was only available from fossil fuels and it’s chemically identical,” Patrik Jones, the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday, told the Guardian. “It should work exactly the same as normal propane.” Around 160,000 cars run on LPG in the UK, some of which have been converted from petrol or diesel engines by owners looking to save money at the pump. LPG has environmental benefits too, with greenhouse gas emissions up to 20% lower than unleaded petrol. Jones said he would eventually like to produce propane using solar energy. The new work only produced tiny quantities of propane, but is a proof of concept that it could be produced without the need for its two usual sources of production – petrol refining and natural gas processing. “It’s not something that’s going to be used by industry today, but it is important and significant,” said Jones, who added he would need to scale up the production by three magnitudes to attract investors. To make the propane, the team “hijacked the assembly line” of the biological process of fatty acid synthesis in E coli, introducing a group of enzymes (Thioesterase) into the bacterium. Two more enyzmes were then added to eventually turn the smelly fatty acid into propane. Producing petrol or diesel = would be much more complex, Jones said. The team chose propane over other fuels on the grounds that it could be liquified, making it easier to transport, and done so with 30 times as less energy than it takes to liquify hydrogen, which has been proposed as another ‘green’ fuel source. Jones said: “Fossil fuels are a finite resource and as our population continues to grow we are going to have to come up with new ways to meet increasing energy demands. It is a substantial challenge, however, to develop a renewable process that is low-cost and economically sustainable. “At the moment algae can be used to make biodiesel, but it is not commercially viable as harvesting and processing requires a lot of energy and money. So we chose propane because it can be separated from the natural process with minimal energy and it will be compatible with the existing infrastructure for easy use.” • This article was amended on 13 October 2014.

The first is an environmentalist’s dream. Rooftop gardens, pedestrian bridges with solar panels, easy access to public transit, the use of reclaimed wood and water, and other features that allow complete power generation via solar energy. This is San Francisco’s Levi’s Stadium, which is the first NFL stadium to achieve the elite LEED Gold status for new construction. The second is a bird-lover’s nightmare. Despite state regulations and immense pressure from the Audubon Society and local officials, the new Minnesota Vikings stadium, built by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, plans to utilize non-bird-safe glass, which is also less energy efficient. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Here’s how each building got to where it is. Minnesota Vikings Stadium in Minneapolis Funding was approved in May 2012 for a $1bn facility to replace Minneapolis’s aging Metrodome. Large parts of now-demolished Metrodome are in the process of being recycled, including 25 tons of precious metals and 80% of the facility’s steel and concrete. The new stadium will be LEED-certified, with one of the most efficient roof structures in the nation, efficient LED lighting and daylighting controls that will reduce energy use from lighting by nearly 30%, and water efficient irrigation systems that will cut landscape irrigation in half, according to an email from Michele Kelm-Helgen, chair of the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority. But the main issue being argued here is bird safety. In May 2013, the Audubon Society entered talks with the Minnesota Vikings and the MSFA after noticing the newly revealed stadium designs for the new stadium, set to open in 2016, didn’t use bird-safe glass. When flying, birds can’t see glass and mistake reflections in the glass for an actual destination. The result is a nasty collision that can be fatal for the bird. Bird-safe glass, such as Arnold Glas’s Ornilux, adds a patterned, UV-reflective coating. This allows the glass to remain clear to the human eye, but birds can see the pattern and avoid the building. The special glass would also help keep the building cool and save on air-conditioning energy. The Audubon Society worked the MSFA until April. On 17 July, the group was told that the glass would not be changed. Frustrated, the Audubon Society issued a scathing news release in late July condemning the MSFA for its actions, urging it and the Vikings to keep the stadium from becoming a “death trap.” The Minneapolis City Council threw its weight behind the nonprofit as well, spearheading a petition that has collected more than 76,000 signatures. MSFA deemed the glass too expensive. “And yet, the Vikings recently found a way to spend more than $1m on an upscale ‘preview center’ and $1.3m for ‘design features’ related to TVs and escalators,” Audubon Minnesota executive director Matthew Anderson said in a news release. The MSFA maintains that it does not have the $1.1m needed to install bird-safe glass, and that Minnesota guidelines regarding bird-safe glass were issued prior to the stadium’s plans being finalized. Stadium officials said they have incorporated all of the society’s other recommended measures to keep birds safe into its design, including the “Lights Out” program that keeps the lights off in the middle of the night during bird-migration periods. “The Audubon Society approached us [about the fritted glass] after our design was complete,” Kelm-Helgen wrote. “We had worked for over a year with local stakeholders to ensure our stadium was open, transparent and connected to the neighborhoods surrounding it. The transparent glass on the west side of the stadium is key to that design.” Agatha Szczepaniak with the National Audubon Society said that there hasn’t been any progress regarding bird-safe glass at the Vikings stadium since the Minneapolis City Council passed its resolution. 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium in San Francisco, California Right from the drawing board, the San Francisco 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium was designed to be sustainable as well as high-tech. The crowning feature is a solar panel-ladened “green roof” atop the suite tower. That roof, along with power generated from solar panels on three pedestrian walkways, will offset the power the team uses during home games. The owners’ suite is crafted from reclaimed wood from a nearby airfield. The stadium recycles 85% of its water. This netted LEED Gold status for the stadium (which opened in July), the announcement coming just days after the Audubon Society learned that the Minnesota Vikings wouldn’t utilize bird-safe glass in its new stadium. The 49ers join a rare group of professional sports teams committing to sustainable activities. The Baltimore Ravens have the only other NFL stadium granted LEED Gold status. It became the first last year, when the team remodeled M&amp;T Bank Stadium. The National Hockey League isn’t far behind. The NHL issued a sustainability report in late July, outlining what the league has done to help the environment and pledging to work with teams to craft sustainability goals. The New York Islanders are expected to move to Brooklyn’s Barclays Center in 2015, which has LEED Silver status. An arena under construction in Edmonton, Canada, also is expected to receive LEED Silver.

Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm Age: about five years Location: Ipswich Why it started: “The farm was very much a coming together of two questions, can we produce food and can we run a low-carbon farm?” explains founder Joanne Mudhar. “I’d had one allotment, then two allotments and then a small holding in France, so when 12 acres came available just on the edge of Ipswich, I had to go for it.” But she soon realised there was far too much to manage on her own. Her community came together to help, and the land soon developed into a community farm, with everyone buying shares and enjoying the spoils from the land: “The farm is 12 acres, so technically it’s a small holding but we call it a farm because it’s easier.” How many people are involved? There are 55 households involved in the scheme – around 150 people in total. “We get up to 30 people coming to work on the days when we do intensive farming, and it is incredible the amount of work you can get done with that number of people,” explains Mudhar. “Some of these people had no experience of farming whatsoever until recently, and now one person who worked here went on to study horticulture – it’s inspiring!” Does the group get funding? When Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm started, Mudhar paid for most of the equipment herself. The farm then received £10,000 from the Big Lottery Fund and £20,000 from the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation for running costs. “Both grants were used with the very definite aim of being able to grow membership enough to enable the farm to become financially self sufficient,” explains Joanne. The farm is now entirely self-funded by the members who pay £8 per week to receive an equal share of all the vegetables grown on the farm. This will increase to £8.50 per week from June 2015. What would they like to do next? The group are looking into solar energy. They would also like to build a low-key kitchen on the farm to run more cookery-based classes with the produce, as well as setting up a welcome centre. “At the moment we just have a polytunnel and a plastic sheet – it isn’t very welcoming to visitors!” What can you do to help? Volunteers need to be members of our Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme but friends and family of CSA members are welcome to accompany members on the farm. From 27 September 2014 the farm will be recruiting for more members to be involved in the veg box scheme. Can I set something like this up in my area? There may already be a CSA near you; ou can use the Soil Association’s map of CSAs around the country to find one in your area. The Soil Association has masses of incredibly useful information for setting up your own community supported agriculture (CSA) project: They have an action manual full of advice on CSA; from the different models and routes to take through to financial, legal and land issues. View and download it here There are also numerous short films profiling established CSA projects around the country There is a range of funding models depending on your set-up, which you can find here. If you are a rural community the Plunkett Foundation is also an excellent source of support and a good place to start “There’s an increasing amount of support available for those interested in setting up a community project and lots of great case studies for inspiration,” says Colleen McCulloch, the Soil Association’s agricultural development manager. “If you’re not lucky first time don’t be put off – use it as a chance to hone your idea and try again.” You can also visit Oak Tree Low Carbon Farm to see how it’s done. The annual farm tour will take place on Saturday 27 September (£5 per adult), or you can organise a visit on another day by visiting our website (please note there is a charge for visits). “You need as much practical experience as possible,” warns Mudhar. Her advice: “Volunteer and get involved with as many similar projects as you can find and don’t be afraid. Just don’t jump into it too quickly. Sometimes I think to myself: ‘Well this was a very daft idea, Joanne!’ but you know what ... It’s turned out OK.” The projects in this series: 1. The community supported farm 2.

The slowdown is in fact a double cherry pick – it focuses only on the 2% of global warming that heats the atmosphere (over 90% heats the oceans), and it only considers the past 10–15 years. Nevertheless, because there was so much attention paid to the surface warming slowdown, the latest IPCC report addressed it specifically, saying, The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend (very high confidence). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012). From 1998 through 2012, the Met Office estimated that global surface temperatures had warmed by about 0.06°C, whereas the average climate model projection put the value at closer to 0.3°C. This apparent discrepancy only represented a tiny fraction of overall global warming, and over a short enough period of time that the internal noise of the climate system could be having a significant influence, but it was nevertheless a challenge for climate scientists to explain the precise causes of the difference. However, research published since the release of the IPCC report has gone a long way to explain the discrepancy, and it turns out the climate models are doing a pretty good job after all. Measurement Biases Exaggerated the Discrepancy One important paper published late last year by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way found that the discrepancy wasn’t nearly as large as believed. Climate scientists have known that the surface temperature record is incomplete because of gaps between instrument stations, especially in the Arctic. The Arctic happens to be the fastest-warming region on Earth, and so if it’s excluded from the surface temperature record, the record will have a cool bias. Cowtan &amp; Way took two separate clever approaches to address this issue, using statistics and satellite measurements to fill in the gaps. Both methods yielded similar results, showing that the Met Office estimates were accurate up to 1998, but underestimated the warming since 1998 by more than half, due in large part to the particularly rapid warming in the Arctic during that time. The Cowtan &amp; Way estimates put the global surface warming from 1998 through 2012 at about 0.17°C, explaining nearly half of the apparent difference between measurements and the average climate model projections. But the other half still needed to be explained. Cooling Influences from Oceans, Volcanoes, and the Sun A great many studies published over the past two years have shown that since 1998, more heat has been funneled into the deep oceans, leaving less to warm the atmosphere. Kevin Trenberth and colleagues produced one of the best data sets measuring ocean temperatures, finding an unprecedented warming of the deep oceans since 1998. A new paper shows that while oceans around the world are warming, most of the deep layer warming is happening in the Atlantic and Southern oceans. A recent study led by Matthew England showed that unprecedented trade wind strength has invigorated the circulation of the Pacific Ocean, causing more heat from the surface to be mixed down into deeper ocean layers, while bringing cooler waters to the surface. Papers by Kosaka &amp; Xie and James Risbey and colleagues showed that when climate models accurately reflect ocean cycles, their global surface temperature simulations are also accurate. At the same time, solar activity has declined and volcanic activity risen since 1998. Volcanoes pump aerosol particulates into the atmosphere that cause short-term cooling, and a decline in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface also has a cooling effect. Another recent paper led by NASA climate modeler Gavin Schmidt showed that when incorporating the observed changes in these two factors and the Cowtan &amp; Way corrections, climate models did a good job reproducing the observed global surface warming. With these internal (ocean cycle) and external (solar and volcanic activity) explanations, we were still left with the question – how much was each responsible for the global surface warming slowdown? Huber &amp; Knutti Show it’s about Half and Half A new paper published by Huber &amp; Knutti (good explanation here) has found that from 1998 to 2012, ocean cycles caused about 0.06°C global surface cooling, the sun caused 0.04°C, and volcanoes caused 0.035°C cooling. Putting it all together, we have 0.17°C observed surface warming according to Cowtan &amp; Way, and 0.13°C cooling from natural influences. If those natural factors hadn’t caused cooling since 1998, we would have seen 0.3°C global surface warming, right in line with climate model projections. The figure below from the Huber &amp; Knutti paper illustrates the point nicely. The dotted orange and solid black lines show the unadjusted average model projection and measured global surface temperatures, respectively. The solid orange and dashed black lines show these estimates adjusted to reflect the changes in ocean cycles, solar output, volcanic activity, and surface temperature measurement biases. Huber &amp; Knutti show that when climate models account for these short-term natural changes, their temperature projections are right on the money. The bad news is that we can’t yet predict changes in ocean cycles, solar output, or volcanic activity accurately, so it’s going to be hard to improve short-term climate model projections. The good news is that these factors make little difference in long-term climate changes or predictions. Solar and volcanic activity tend to be relatively stable, and will barely make a dent in human-caused global warming. Positive and negative phases of ocean cycles cancel each other out over the long-term. What about the Future? Long-term global warming is dictated by the Earth’s climate sensitivity. Huber &amp; Knutti showed that the average climate model output (with an average climate sensitivity of about 3°C global surface warming at equilibrium from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide) produces accurate global temperature predictions. They also tweaked the sensitivity of a climate model of intermediate complexity, and again showed when the aforementioned internal and external factors are accounted for, models with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3°C do the best job reproducing global surface temperature changes. When tweaked to have equilibrium climate sensitivities of 2°C and 4°C, the model surface temperature simulations were significantly less accurate. All of the available evidence indicates that the global surface warming slowdown is temporary, and will only last as long as solar activity keeps falling, volcanic emissions keep rising, and until ocean cycles switch phases. It’s only a matter of time until global surface warming once again accelerates. And until we get our carbon pollution under control, we’ll remain on a path towards highly dangerous and costly climate changes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/aug/18/diary-julian-assange-odds-odd-bookmaker-bets-ecuadorian-embassy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-18T22:00:14Z","webTitle":"Diary: Even Julian Assange’s odds are odd | Erica Buist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/18/diary-julian-assange-odds-odd-bookmaker-bets-ecuadorian-embassy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/aug/18/diary-julian-assange-odds-odd-bookmaker-bets-ecuadorian-embassy","fields":{"headline":"Diary: Even Julian Assange’s odds are odd","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• Julian Assange’s press conference, at which he told an expectant world that he would be leaving the Ecuadorian embassy “soon”, induced yawns from the assembled hacks. And, no doubt, despair from the put-upon Ecuadorians. After all, “soon” could mean anything – next week, next month, or even Christmas, now that he’s starting to look like a middle-aged Santa Claus. But there is one organisation that loves such uncertainty – bookmakers Paddy Power, which has been taking bets on when he will finally go. The favoured option – an attractive 2:1 – is September. A man’s life hanging in the balance: the perfect opportunity for a flutter. • The Church of England’s director of communications communicated himself into a corner last week, after a well-meaning but homophobic tweet about Vicky Beeching, the gospel singer who’s just come out as gay. The Rev Arun Arora tweeted that Vicky was welcome in church because “we are all broken”. In a cringe-inducing exchange with Kelvin Holdsworth, provost of St Mary’s Cathedral in Glasgow, @RevArun defended his comparison of Vicky’s sexuality to the brokenness of humanity. Holdsworth tweeted: “It would be racist to say that black people are welcome in church because all are broken. It is homophobic to suggest same re LGBT.” The the reverend went strangely quiet. • If you want to obtain a pass to enter the House of Commons, you’ll be required to tick yes or no to some pertinent questions on the application form, not least: “Have you ever been involved in espionage, terrorism, or sabotage?” Because, presumably, even for saboteur terrorist spies, lying on a form would be a step too far into the criminal underworld. At least the House of Commons doesn’t go quite as far as the US government, which asks visitors whether they have ever been involved in genocide. Naturally. But only once. • Jeremy Paxman has the best part of a year before he can start claiming his pension, so if he must joke that old people are “bloody everywhere” and that there should be a Dignitas clinic “on every street corner”, the time, undoubtedly, is now. In his standup show at Edinburgh, he said: “You will take Auntie Doris there and drop her off, and she will say, ‘See you next Tuesday’, and you’ll say, ‘Probably’.” The upsetting thing here is not that Paxo has called for the largely indiscriminate murder of our parents, grandparents and, well, himself. It’s that he broke the golden rule of comedy: don’t take someone else’s material. Martin Amis caused a similar outcry with the exact same joke in 2010, calling for euthanasia “booths” on street corners where old people can go into the great beyond with “a martini and a medal”. • Florida likes to call itself the sunshine state, so it is with something close to incredulity that we learn pro-coal lobbying groups there are blocking solar energy, making it as hard as possible for eco-conscious Floridians to install solar panels. Lots of pioneering solar power companies won’t go near the place, finding grey and wintry New York – where solar installations are now more numerous than taxi cabs – far more accommodating. Nor is Florida the only state in the south with a blind spot where solar power is concerned. South Carolina Energy &amp; Gas thwarted a move to install 80 solar panels on local churches and schools, and Virginia charges fees for the use of solar arrays. Maybe Alaska will prove more responsive. • There have still been no complaints about people taking selfies in the National Gallery, despite the art community’s outcry at the relaxation last week of its no-photography policy. Michael Savage, who writes the Grumpy Art Historian blog, doomily announced: “The last bastion of quiet contemplation is now to become selfie central.” Not to be outdone, the US media decided to press the selfie panic button too. Vice, the self-proclaimed “online den of nefarious activities”, raised the alarm with a piece entitled “Photos of people taking selfies at an art museum”. Four days since the end of art as we know it, no one at the National Gallery seems to have noticed.

Mobisol’s solar panel systems can cost over $1,000 (£599), which is unaffordable for many sub-Saharan Africans, whose annual income is as little as $1,600. However with a business model that encourages incremental payments over 36 months, offers transparent payment through mobile banking, and encourages residents to use their panels for profit, this energy option is becoming increasingly appealing to farming communities across Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Solar energy provides a cheaper and safer alternative to diesel generators, kerosene lamps and old batteries, but a key barrier to access is cash. “A solar home system costs money that is not available in cash to the people we sell it to, so you need a microloan,” says Duveau, head of business development at Mobisol. The cheapest 10 watt solar system can power a small radio, one to three lamps and charge up to two mobile phones for $9 a month. But is that still too expensive? Deveau says there is demand for an even more espensive system. “With big systems you can charge 10 mobile phones, you can run a TV for a village cinema, you can run a fridge to sell cold beers, you can earn $75-100 a month from this – suddenly your customer can become an entrepreneur.” Along with the incremental payment and potential to make profit, it is the mobile payment aspect of the system that’s opening doors for users. “50% of our customers had never used mobile money before, so paying off the mobisol system was their entrypoint. Now they can take part in other commercial transactions or start a savings account.” Each customer has agreed for Mobisol to store their data, including a credit history, so the company knows exactly how much has been paid towards off. “Collecting payment by mobile makes the transaction more transparent. Our customers just pay the price of a text message to transfer money as we cover Vodacom’s M-Pesa fee.” The increasing adoption of mobile money across east Africa has made it easier for other start-ups such as Grundfos Lifelink (GLL) to begin to plug the gap in service provision to the poorest communities. Across rural Africa, some 50,000 water supply points have failed, representing a waste of US$215-360 million. GLL’s product helps its customers avoid the middleman at the water pump who often takes a cut for himself and triples prices in drought season, says Peter Todbjerg Hansen, managing director of this Danish provider of water management solutions. “The price has been fixed within the system and you pay cashlessly, so nobody can harass you to pay a higher price.” The company replaced water pumps with automatic dispensers, allowing families to access water usinfg a key fob to which they have transferred money via text message. GLL’s pilot project reached 75,000 people in Kenya alone (pdf). But Bill Maurer, director of the Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion at the University of California, is sceptical about how replicable and scalable businesses like GLL and Mobisol are. “For those who are in areas where mobile money hasn’t really taken off yet, people are reluctant to put all their faith in new mobile based services – they’re buying water from a local vendor, getting some from a well, and also sending a child to fetch some because they want a diversity of sources.” “From our research, we learned that if the fees on money transfers start to hurt even a little bit, they’ll turn off.” Mobile money solutions also pose ethical concerns for businesses – a previous partnership between Safaricom and Equity Bank in Kenya raised the question ‘who owns the customer’s data when you go into partnership with a mobile network?’ “The business is at the mercy of the mobile network. Networks are becoming such important carriers of all kinds of information, a wider debate is needed. At what point do we think of them as a utility? How do we ensure that businesses can earn a profit but there’s adequate consumer protection?” For now, Mobisol and GLL are looking to introduce their services to other countries in the region by 2015. Their success will depend not just on mobile phone penetration in those communities, but on how willing customers are to put their faith in a new way of making financial transactions.

That is one of the reasons I set up a solar energy company 15 years ago. Today, Putin's Russia, Islamic State's Iraq, and a host of other actual and potential fossil-fuel addiction downsides mean we would be well advised to strive hard for that vision. What is becoming clearer with each passing month, however, is that the route to delivering energy independence is not the fracking of domestic gas and oil from shale. Indeed, it could be a route to derailing the vision. Five sets of problems are emerging with the shale narrative: economic risk; local environmental cost; global environmental cost; social cost, and opportunity cost. First, the economic risk. The US \"shale boom\" looks increasingly as though it will turn into one of those bubbles that we humans seem so good at inflating and then bursting. The oil-and-gas industry has been losing cash by the tens of billions, because high drilling costs mean most companies are spending more than they are earning from low-price fracked gas, even when high-price fracked oil is added to the equation. Wider US industry may have benefited from cheap gas in the short term, but production from all shale gas regions – save the Marcellus of Pennsylvania – has peaked already, and many of us reading the detail now see little prospect of the gas industry delivering growing production for many years more. Rather, the reverse. Second, the local environmental cost. Once Dick Cheney freed fracking from scrutiny under America's Safe Drinking Water Act (the so-called \"Halliburton Loophole\"), back in the kick-off days for shale in the Bush years, bad news about contamination and health impacts should have been predictable. It has been slow to emerge, in part because of widespread use of gagging orders by the industry as part of compensation payments for wrecked farms and impaired health. But now a regular drip of bad news has started, soon likely to snowball as ever more people realise the reality behind the industry's mantras about all being well. Third, the global environmental cost. Gas industry operations can and do leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from wellhead to hob. The question is, how much? Early research on fracking-related emissions by the rare university teams not cowed by oil-industry funding are worrying. Fracked gas may well prove to be worse than coal in greenhouse terms, over the full-life-cycle. And British shale basins are far more faulted than US shale basins. Fourth, the social cost. It is likely that few British people as yet fully appreciate the tight well spacings, industrial infrastructure, water profligacy, toxic waste-disposal challenges, and lorry movements that are required for a typical US shale \"sweet spot\", and what the social cost of that would be if superimposed on rural Britain. Yet already local opposition is severe, even against single vertical unfracked test wells, which entail little waste, and few lorry movements. Planning for the first such was rejected by a council for the first time recently, in Sussex, with objectors \"weeping with relief\" in the chamber on hearing the decision. Many such objectors are Conservative voters. The prime minister says he wants to deliver sufficient shale gas to drive down the gas price so far that large-scale manufacturing returns to the UK. He has little or no chance of getting that past his own voter base without committing political suicide, even if much of that gas proves extractable by fracking – which the British Geological Survey clearly has doubts about. Fifth, the opportunity cost. There is a shovel-ready alternative to gas that can be developed surprisingly quickly, given the collective will: renewable energy and energy efficiency. Among this broad family is a star duo that the energy incumbency increasingly fears as an existential threat: solar and storage. Solar is a power source that is infinite and easy to tap, as opposed to finite and increasingly difficult to tap. Politically, the government's own opinion polls show that solar is outstandingly the most popular energy technology with the British public, year after year, miles ahead of fracking, even now, so early in the game. In the most recent poll, for DECC itself, support for fracking was down at just 24%. The opportunity cost is that many leaders in the oil and gas industry, and their supporters in government, want actively to suppress this fast-growing global industry, with its fast-falling cost base – along with all the other clean-energy industries – so as to not put investors in gas off. The fact that the oil-and-gas incumbency views solar as such a threat to their business models should tell us everything we need to know. • Jeremy Leggett is the founding chairman of Solarcentury, the UK's largest solar solutions company, and charity SolarAid.

Or, worse, picture yourself struggling for life on an oxygen machine, only for the hospital to face a power blackout. Such scenarios are part of every day life in Nepal’s rural areas, where daily power cuts can easily last nine hours or more, according to Andy Moon, co-founder of SunFarmer, a development-oriented solar energy provider. “Nepal has over 6,000 health clinics and hospitals, and every single one of them has problems with energy”, says 29-year-old Stanford economics graduate Moon, who previously worked for McKinsey Consulting and US solar energy firm, SunEdison. Together with former SunEdison colleague Jason Gray, Moon set up SunFarmer last year with the goal of enabling health facilities to “rent-to-own” affordable solar systems. The organisation’s funding model sees the up-front installation costs split 80% to 20% between SunFarmer and the local health facility. The health clinic or hospital then pays SunFarmer back in monthly instalments over an eight year-period. The solar provider has committed to plough all profits back into financing future solar energy systems. Interest on the repayments is “nominal” when the loan is in US dollars, and adjusted for inflation when in local currency. The solar start-up installed its first renewably-powered electricity systems in six health clinics in western Nepal last month. Each system costs between $8,000 and $9,000 and has a generating capacity of roughly 1.6 kilowatts. As a result, the participating health facilities are able to reduce their reliance on diesel-powered generators, which are expensive to run and damaging to the environment. “Our systems will provide power for more than just lights. We can provide power for laptops and cell phone charging, but also for medical equipment such as oxygen machines, suction machines, nebulisers and vaccine machines”, Moon states. SunFarmer hopes to install up to 20 new systems by early next year and over 250 around the world within the next five years. It is currently looking to raise a $5m fund – 25% of which is already banked. The solar provider’s early investors include Canadian social impact investment group MaRS and SunEdison’s charitable foundation. A two-month campaign on crowdfunding site Indiegogo saw it raise $25,000 earlier this year. “We’re not just a financing provider”, Moon insists. “We oversee the complete design and installation of the system to make sure the system is installed with all the right components.” The repayment approach gives SunFarmer an added incentive to ensure that the systems remain in good working order, he adds. The company has installed monitoring equipment that allows its engineers in Kathmandu to evaluate the power output of each system in real time. “If there’s any problem, we can send people out there to fix it”, says Moon. The ‘rent-to-own’ model differs from traditional philanthropic approaches, which see solar equipment donated but then either poorly installed or badly maintained. The result is “a lot of broken solar systems” across the developing world, Moon notes. SunFarmer is also working to build the sustainability of Nepal’s nascent solar industry by establishing cooperation partnerships with domestic solar providers. “We want to enable the local solar ecosystem, so we partner with three local solar companies. Instead of competing against them, we provide financing and the technical assistance … to enable them to install bigger systems that they weren’t able to do before”, says Moon. SunFarmer also works with the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), a Nepalese government-led institution that channels funding for renewable projects from international donors. AEPC’s backers include the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, UNDP and the UK development agency DFID, among others. While Moon maintains that solar is the “perfect solution” for Nepal’s remote areas, many of which remain off-grid entirely, he admits that local skill shortages represent a challenge. “It [installing solar power systems] requires the right design, the right technology and people that really have the right experience. What we found is that there’s really very little of this expertise in the world, so that’s what we’re building right now”, he says. Theoretically, there’s nothing to stop SunFarmer’s solar financing and maintenance model being applied to non-health sectors, such as schools, government buildings and other facilities providing core public service facilities. For the moment, however, the solar entrepreneur plans to remain focused on hospitals and clinics. Since the solar electricity was installed in the first six clinics, ten babies have already been born during the night. Before, it was commonplace for the midwives to work holding a torch between their teeth. Now, all ten mothers were attended to by medical team working with the benefit of artificial illumination powered by the sun. “That’s a huge transformation for the clinics, each of which delivers between 60 to 100 babies every year”, says Moon.

The hollows once housed statues of Buddha, until the Taliban infamously set dynamite to them in 2001. But within a few kilometres of these monuments to tyranny stand symbols of renewal – rows of solar panels bringing stable electricity to the homes of local people for the first time – and with them the chance of improving their lives. The United Nations Development Programme identified the lack of stable, affordable power as the largest obstacle to development in Bamiyan Province, but it is one of many. The Taliban destroyed most of the region's few schools. There is now just one sealed road and droughts are common. The deprivation \"is hard to put into words,\" says Besmellah Jahed, the director of the Rehabilitation and Social Development Organisation, a local NGO. \"They've had 30 years of disappointment, 30 years of failed hope and promises. Hospitals, roads and airports - everything you need for a community to develop, they've been waiting for it to arrive,\" says Tony Woods, a New Zealand entrepreneur whose company Sustainable Energy Services International (Sesi) built the solar power system. Before the solar installation started operating in December, locals had to rely on an expensive, haphazard system of neighbourhood generators, kerosene lamps and tiny, private solar panels to access even the most rudimentary power supply. The Taliban massacres and destruction of the Buddhas ensured the province remains deeply antagonistic toward the counter-insurgency, making it a relatively stable oasis in the fractious countryside. This security has created an environment that encourages investment in infrastructure. Sesi says the 1MW facility is central Asia's largest off-grid solar plant. It powers 2500 homes around the provincial capital, Bamiyan. During the winter months the cells are backed up for a few hours each night by a diesel generator. The New Zealand government, whose army administered the region during the western occupation, backed the installation with a US$14.1m grant. Building in a province surrounded on all sides by war and mountains, with no existing power infrastructure, was a huge logistical challenge, says Woods. Every pole, wire, panel and frame had to be imported. His team of local and foreign workers had to contest with corrupt customs officials, a supply road that sporadically fell under the control of insurgents, the closure of the Pakistani border for eight months and winters so cold their concrete would not set. The project also had to overcome local scepticism bred by bitter experiences. \"They wanted to know if we were going to steal all the money [from their power bills] and take it back to New Zealand,\" says Woods. There was also concern that electricity rates would be too high, despite the fact that residents were paying some of the highest prices in the world. Overcoming scepticism was a case of build it and they will come, says Woods. \"When this project was started, people were doubtful about how much electricity would cost,\" agrees Khalil Rahman Anwari an employee of the Agency for Assistance and Development of Afghanistan. \"After the project started, the demand increased.\" Locals still think prices are too high, pointing out that electricity in Kabul is significantly cheaper. Most people can only run a few appliances. But Anwari says the access to reliable, affordable light makes possible the most simple but important of activities, like homework during the dark winter months. The Afghan government now owns and administers Bamiyan's power supply. Local technicians, including many women, have been trained to operate it. The system uses pre-paid credit, which users buy from banks. This avoids the risk of meter readers being tempted to offer favours to neighbours in the tight-knit community. The accountancy of the project is transparent and can be audited by Sesi and the New Zealand government remotely. Woods says it was important to create a system large enough to become self-sufficient and fund its own growth. But New Zealand's aid commitments to Bamiyan have now been scaled back and only around 5% of the estimated 418,000 people in Bamiyan Province currently receive the project's electricity. Jahed, who was born in Bamiyan, says growth into other parts of the province is imperative. People have already started crowding into the areas supplied by power. The provincial government had promised those who lack power would be supplied by generators, but this has not happened. \"Bamiyan people are very kind and appreciate any minor development,\" he says. \"But this is not sufficient. We suggest the extension of this project.\" Read more stories like this: • Chile's solar market is leading the way in South America • Could renewable energy make rural electrification a reality? • Quiz: what do you know about renewable energy?

The gist is that large corporations love oil and gas because they can own and control it. They’re against renewable energy because no-one can own the sun or wind. The problem for anti-corporate green-energy campaigners is, increasingly: the meme isn’t true. As the materials for producing wind and solar energy become cheaper, tax breaks and incentives for renewable energy increase, and the prospect of finding more oil and gas becomes weaker, corporations are entering the green energy landscape to the tune of billions of dollars. Last month, NRG, one of the US’s largest energy companies with 100 power plants across the country, including plants that run on coal and natural gas, finalized details in its bid to buy Alta Wind Energy Center in California, the largest wind farm in North America, for $800m. It was the latest blockbuster renewable energy deal by a large corporation in recent years. There’s the under-construction 560 megawatt Desert Sunlight Solar Farm in California, which is owned jointly by NextEra Energy – an energy conglomerate that makes about $15bn a year mostly from gas and nuclear plants, GE, and Sumitomo – a Japanese company that gets most of its billions from mining, oil and gas production. And there’s the 550 megawatt Topaz Solar Farm, owned by MidAmerican, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s multi-billion dollar empire which is also heavily invested in coal and oil. Even Google, Microsoft and Apple are getting into the game. All three companies announced plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into wind and solar this year. Green energy: going the same way as organic food? “There’s a battle going on – and it’s not a very public battle – over who owns green energy and who benefits from it,” said Anya Schoolman, the executive director of the Community Power Network, a non-profit which helps fund and build local power networks. To some, the investment is a double-edged sword. Environmentalists fear that green energy may now be going the same way as organic food – becoming an industry that uses the language and imager
