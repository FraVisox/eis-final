And no giant is greater than Margaret Thatcher. Margaret, you took on the foolish ideas that had captured our governing classes and that had brought a once great nation to its knees. You had the courage and the vision to set the British people free. Free from trade union barons and the intimidation of the picket line. Free from planned economies and the shackles of failing nationalised industry. Free from punitive taxes and from an oppressive philosophy that told millions of people don't own your own home, don't own shares, don't aspire to create wealth. Free from a foreign policy of retreat and surrender. You set the British people free, you released the true instincts of our country that had been suppressed for too long, and you made Britain great again. For that our Party and our country will owe you the most enormous debt of thanks. And we thank you for continuing to be such an ambassador for our country and for our Party. You work as hard now as you ever have to promote across the world those values of freedom and enterprise and conviction that you have made your own. Thank you. And we owe too a debt of thanks to Denis, who loyally, and with his inimitable sense of humour, has been not just a tower of strength to you but a constant friend to our Party. Thank you. Ffion and I had dinner recently with Margaret and Denis. Denis offered to write down for Ffion his 10 tips about being married to the leader of the Conservative Party. That should be a truly historic document - but no one gets to see it but us. And let me say how delighted I am to see Ted Heath here tonight. Thank you for the years of long service at the highest level which you have given our Party and our country. Margaret, you led our country through terrorist outrages and military conflict. You never appeased the men of terror, here at home or abroad. Two weeks ago, in Crypt of the House of Commons, Margaret and I and many others gathered to commemorate quite a different 20th anniversary - the anniversary of Airey Neave's death at the hands of terrorist murderers. We will work with the Government for the peace which the people of Northern Ireland so desperately want. But everyone in this room and every Conservative believes with me that until the paramilitaries start handing in their weapons they should not be admitted to the new executive and no more terrorist prisoners should be released. As we speak tonight, in another part of Europe British pilots are risking their lives. As you, Margaret, had to do so many times, we hope and prey for their safe return. Now that we have embarked on this action in Kosovo, we must carry it through to a successful conclusion. On the basis of the Government's assurances about the military situation and what could be achieved, these air strikes have been supported by the Opposition from the start. In the coming weeks we owe our forces clear objectives and the determination to achieve them. Sometimes we talk now of the achievements of Conservative governments in the 1980s and 1990s as if they were inevitable; as if of course it was inevitable industries were going to be privatised, inevitable taxes would be cut, inevitable the trade unions would be curbed, inevitable council houses would be sold, inevitable unilateralism would be defeated, inevitable that our national pride would be restored. Inevitable? There was nothing inevitable about these achievements. It took a person of vision and courage and determination to bring them about - and we are here to honour that person tonight. And some say the achievements of the 1980s were easy, that the opposition was never strong. Easy? It didn't seem like it in the middle of the miners' strike; or on the steps of Liverpool Town Hall; or at the gates of Greenham Common; or on the night of the Brighton bomb; or the day the Falklands were invaded; or when day after day, month after month, year after year the same Labour politicians who now dream of claiming your inheritance were spending every waking moment trying to destroy it. There was nothing easy or inevitable about the victory of Conservative ideas. We fought bitter battles to overcome the defeatists, the unilateralists and the socialists. You understood instinctively those values of the British people from which our nation draws its strength. You understood you more than anyone else that the Conservative Party is uniquely British, and that the British people's values must be our values too. Now, many years later, in a country that you changed, among a people whose aspirations and ambitions you shaped, we owe it to you to make sure that the Conservative Party once again connects with those values of the British people. We must be true to our inheritance. For tonight, as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of one of our greatest election victories, we do so in the shadow of one our greatest election defeats. We changed Britain. It would be a tragedy if the one institution in Britain that didn't change was the Conservative Party. We allowed the bond of understanding between ourselves and the British people to break - a bond of understanding which you, Margaret, always instinctively knew was the Conservative Party's unique strength. We are going to re-establish that bond of understanding. We are going to reconnect with the values of the British people. We are going to rediscover the British Way. To do that, we must remember our victories but be free of old arguments. For however many times we replay the video of election night 1997 we still end being heavily defeated at the end of it. When we were last in Opposition, Margaret Thatcher and Keith Joseph, adopted a new mission. They set the Conservative Party the task of helping the cure what was called the British disease. Twenty years later, the nature of the political challenge we face has changed. Our task now is to set ourselves a new mission. We must draw inspiration from our fundamental Conservative principles. We must apply those principles to the Britain today, the Britain that you helped create. We must show why the Conservative Party is as relevant to Britain's future as it has been to Britain's past. Margaret, we share the same fundamental political principles. I learnt them from my family and from the community in which I grew up, as I suspect you did too. I have heard you speak of your childhood in the Grantham of the 1930s, living above your father's grocery shop, attending the local grammar school; a childhood which respected hard work, thrift and honesty, and where you did your duty to your community and country. Let me remind you what you said in 1981, a time when the din of the political battle was perhaps at its loudest: \"My politics are based on things I and millions like me were brought up with. An honest day's work for an honest day's pay; live within your means; put by a nest egg for a rainy day; pay your bills on time; support the police\". Those were your principles and they are fundamental Conservative principles. I grew up in a different age, in the industrial Rotherham of the 1960s and 1970s. I went to my local comprehensive. I didn't live above a shop, but our small family soft drinks business was a central part of our lives. I too learnt from my parents the value of standing on your own two feet, of putting something back into the community, of working hard and saving hard. And my up-bringing taught me my principles and they too are fundamental Conservative principles. That we should be on the side of the family that works hard, saves hard, tries to be independent of the state, supports their local community and believes in our country. These principles which we share are as relevant now, as we look to beginning of a new century, as they were when you came into politics and when you became Prime Minister in 1979. But the challenge has changed, and so the way we apply those principles must change too. The first challenge we face is the new economic challenge. In 1979, Britain was hamstrung by state planning, punitive tax rates, exchange controls, nationalised industries, prices and incomes policies and out-dated work practices. The challenge then was to just to get Britain working again. The Conservatives responded with an enterprise revolution that tore up the controls, returned industry to private hands, transformed the workplace and made us once again a nation proud of its entrepreneurs and wealth creators. And I would like to pay tribute to people here today like Norman Tebbit, David Young, George Younger and courageous businessmen who with Margaret Thatcher led that revolution. In 1999, the challenge is different. Thanks to Margaret Thatcher and John Major, Britain has a strong economy and British businesses compete all over the world. But we are not living up to our full potential. Parts of the liberal establishment still sneers at wealth creators. And parts of British business are still too timid about risk taking. Many companies cannot compete on equal terms with their foreign rivals. And global free trade remains a distant dream. That is the challenge for the new century, and far from rising to it, this Labour Government is heading in precisely the wrong direction and making it more difficult for British business to compete. In just two years, we've had stealth taxes on businesses and savings, the Working Time Directive, statutory union recognition (something not even Michael Foot dreamt of) and the Social Chapter. It amounts to what the CBI has called the \"creeping paralysis\" of business by red tape and regulation. If Labour will not respond to the new economic challenge, then Conservatives must. We are going to lead a fresh enterprise revolution that we will carry into the board-rooms and work places of British businesses. The next Conservative Government will be the first government ever to abolish more red tape and regulation than it introduces. Our Party will be the champions of global free trade, with the hard choices for some industries which that involves. We will re-establish the economic and moral case for low taxation - as in the excellent CPS pamphlet out today by Maurice Saatchi and Peter Warburton. It is through leading this fresh enterprise revolution that the Conservative Party can not only be relevant to our future but true to Margaret Thatcher's inheritance. Circumstances change. Values endure. The second challenge we face is the new challenge of prosperity and public services. Margaret Thatcher had to defend the very existence of prosperity. Our new challenge is how we as a people use the prosperity which the economic revolution of the 1980s has brought us. We have always recognised the need for funding by the taxpayer of basic public services, because Conservatives have always accepted the duty of the healthy to help the sick, the well-off to support the poor and of each generation to educate and pass on its heritage to the next. That is why we have always sought to improve education standards in our schools, the quality of care in our hospitals and the responsiveness of our public services in general. It is a tribute to the work that Conservative Governments did in helping to raise living standards in this country, that these quality of life issues are now more important than ever. As people have grown used to more choice and a greater say in their own affairs, so they have come to demand more from their public services. It is a new challenge. As Peter Lilley is arguing forcibly tonight at another Conservative gathering, it is a great mistake to think that all Conservatives have to offer is solutions based on free markets. If we think that then we would have little to say about our public services where there are limits to the role of the free market. Instead we can respond with a distinctly Conservative approach that applies our broader principles to the public services. We can offer a real transfer of power away from Whitehall to schools and hospitals, patients and parents. We can bring the voluntary sector into partnership with the state. We can promote the professional independence of our teachers and nurses and doctors to raise standards. It is a distinctively Conservative approach and very different from Labour's with their emphasis on centralisation, unaccountable bureaucracy and slavish adherence to fashionable theories. When you said, Margaret, that 'the NHS is safe in our hands' you were attacked by critics who said they did not believe you. Today we are being attacked by critics because they do believe us. Circumstances change. Values endure. The third new challenge we face today is the democratic challenge. 20 years ago the issue was who ran the country - the government or the unions. But Margaret Thatcher refused to believe that democracy should take a back seat to the picket line. You understood that the British people had had enough. Taking on the unions was, I believe, the most courageous act of British government in peacetime this century. She faced the challenge from the unions; we face the challenge to the Union. Conservatives have to make the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly work to benefit of the United Kingdom. And we are going to address head on the English question. Because we are going to bend every effort, use every fibre, fight with every ounce of our energy to keep the United Kingdom together. In the face of an ever more powerful executive, we are going to assert our belief in, and we are going to restore, the power and legitimacy of Parliament. Circumstances change. Values endure. The fourth challenge we face comes from the project of European political union. Over a decade ago Margaret Thatcher told us at Bruges that \"we have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels\". Since that great speech, the Berlin Wall has tumbled. Countries all over the world have been opened up by the light of democracy for the first time. Ted Heath and his generation struggled to bring the countries of Western Europe together after they had lived and fought through a devastating war. Margaret Thatcher and her colleagues in government fought to defend British interests in Europe while creating a Single Market. But now a new generation faces a new European challenge. The challenge for today's Conservative Party is to extend Europe's horizons; to be true internationalists; to keep Britain in Europe, but not run by Europe. And to fight at the next election to keep the pound. Tony Blair would have you believe that if you change the cash registers, change the banking systems, then it is only a small step to change your currency. He wants to make the single currency inevitable. I say it is not inevitable. I say Britain has a choice. I say the sixth largest economy in the world can make a success of its own currency if it chooses to. Since the euro's devalued, we're fast on our way to becoming the fifth largest economy. Twenty years ago they said Britain's decline was inevitable. Margaret Thatcher showed it was not. Twenty years later they say the euro is inevitable. I say it is not. In the run up to the next election, the Conservative Party will lead the national campaign to save the pound. Circumstances change. Values endure. The fifth new challenge we face is the nature of our political opponents. Margaret Thatcher defeated the old-style socialists. She consigned the donkey jacket to the dustbin of history. Now we face just as important a battle to defeat the moral emptiness and media obsession of a new Labour Party that will say anything, do anything, promise anything to seize power and hold on to it. Tony Blair likes to compare himself to Margaret Thatcher. It is like comparing a weather vane to a compass. In the storm, you need a compass. The Conservative Party will be that compass. Circumstances change. Values endure. Britain has changed a great deal since you, Margaret, first walked into Downing Street on Friday 4th May 1979. We are prosperous where once we were poor; we celebrate our wealth creators where once we denigrated them; we take our rightful place at the centre of the international stage where once we were scurrying to get off it. You more than any single other person brought about that change. You more than any single Prime Minister this century transformed the country you governed. You faced great challenges and you met each one of them. Today we face new challenges. New threats. A new Labour Government which would dearly love to claim your inheritance even while it undermines it. The Conservative Party that I lead must rise to these new challenges and this changed country by changing ourselves and by bringing forward a new policy agenda. And in shaping this agenda we will never lose sight of those enduring Conservative principles of independence and responsibility, freedom and community, nationhood and a global role, that in different generations brought both you and I into politics.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/20/thatcher.uk1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-20T15:14:34Z","webTitle":"William Hague: 'No giant is greater than Margaret Thatcher'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/20/thatcher.uk1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/20/thatcher.uk1","fields":{"headline":"William Hague: 'No giant is greater than Margaret Thatcher'","bodyText":"\"Each new leader of the Conservative Party stands on the shoulders of giants.

It would be unfair to ask how many of them can expect to find a temporary sanctuary in Britain; so let's be unfair. According to figures issued by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees at the start of this week, 16,000 have been moved out of the region. The list is headed by Germany (which has received 9,974), Turkey (3,692) and Norway (1,104). Iceland, rather sweetly, has accepted 23. And the United Kingdom? None whatever. Ah yes, says Jack Straw, but we had already admitted 10,000 Kosovars before the bombing started - though he neglects to mention that 7,000 of them are still 'stuck in the queue', awaiting a decision from the Home Office on their status. Besides, ministers add, Tony Blair has promised that we shall take in 'some thousands' of the huddled masses, and the first airlift is expected in the next few days. Many will be accommodated in open prisons, perhaps even in the Ernest Saunders Memorial Suite. What further proof is needed of the government's profoundly humanitarian instincts? The answer can be found in committee-room nine at the House of Commons, where Jack Straw's new immigration and asylum bill has been going through a special standing committee for the past month. When the bill becomes law it will remove all benefit rights from asylum-seekers and their families, as well as freeing local authorities of their statutory obligations under the national assistance and housing acts. Asylum-seekers will no longer have the chance to express a 'reasonable preference' about where they should live (near friends and family, for instance): they will be dumped wherever officialdom chooses. Many of these people will eventually be recognised as refugees, but even if they are broke and starving they have no legal right to assistance: clause 74 gives Jack Straw the power - not the obligation - to support destitute asylum-seekers, and clause 99 deprives their families of the protection offered by the 1989 children act. We should always watch how politicians treat refugees, Neal Ascherson once wrote, because that's how they would treat the rest of us if they thought they could get away with it. Luckily for the government, the standing committee's debates have gone unreported, except by my diligent friend Nick Cohen in the Observer. But if this bill had been introduced by Michael Howard there would have been howls of indignation from liberal pundits and Labour MPs. As indeed there were when the last asylum and immigration bill was furiously opposed by the shadow home secretary, a certain Jack Straw. 'The measure is unbalanced and disproportionate,' he told the Commons on February 22 1996. 'It has already led to the prospect of refugee families being left without any effective support and it could lead to a number of applicants whose applications are well founded being denied their rights under the United Nations Convention on Refugees.' The courts agreed. After hearing a test case brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants in 1996, lord justice Simon Brown ruled that the withdrawal of benefits from asylum-seekers whose appeals were still pending undermined their statutory right to claim refugee status: 'It necessarily contemplates for some a life so destitute that to my mind no civilised nation can tolerate it.' In another case, later the same year, Mr Justice Collins said that if parliament intended to remove all assistance from asylum-seekers who were lawfully here 'it would almost certainly put itself in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Geneva Convention.' The same could be said, fortissimo, of the new bill. The UN High Commission for Refugees has condemned it as 'a violation of international rights' that is 'fundamentally unacceptable.' But that has long been the British method for dealing with refugees, regardless of which party is in power. In the unlikely event that any fugitives from Kosovo have access to the internet, they should look up the website for the Home Office's Asylum Directorate (www.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/adic.htm), which advises civil servants on how to shun asylum-seekers. Someone arriving with a passport is immediately suspect, as a sample letter of refusal explains: 'The secretary of state noted that you were able to obtain a properly issued passport which you then used to leave [country] through normal immigration channels without difficulty on [date]. He concluded that this indicates that the authorities have no further interest in your activities.' (In Whitehallspeak, tyrants never persecute their subjects, they merely 'have an interest' in them.) Is it better to arrive without a passport then? Probably not: you'll then be sent the standard letter for 'undocumented passengers,' in which the home secretary rejects you 'owing to your failure to produce a passport when requested to do so on arrival.' Perhaps the answer is to forge or borrow one? No, Jack Straw has already thought of that: 'In considering your application the secretary of state has noted that you sought/gained leave to enter the United Kingdom using false documents... Your actions in doing so have seriously undermined the credibility of your claim to be a genuine asylum seeker in need of international protection.' Passports, eh? Can't get in with 'em, can't get in without 'em. Shortly before the 1997 general election, Straw accused the Tories of 'playing the race card' by trying to stop benefit payments to asylum-seekers. 'The government's denial of social security benefits to asylum-seekers is inhumane,' he wrote. 'Applicants must be allowed the means to live while their case is being considered.' So why is he now following Michael Howard's example? I fear he has fallen into the old trap of believing what he reads in the Daily Mail. What he fails to notice is that Mail readers themselves no longer believe it: in the past fortnight they have donated almost £2 million to the emergency appeal. Startled to discover that Middle England isn't as selfish and mean-spirited as he always assumed, even the Mail's editor has now done a U-turn, arguing that we should make the displaced Kosovars welcome here. If Tony Blair is sincere in his promises of succour for the refugees, he should consign Straw's nasty, brutish immigration and asylum bill to a permanent exile in the waste-paper bin. Tainted Saint In Venice last weekend, I found the news-stands festooned with souvenir brochures and posters celebrating Padre Pio, the Italian monk who is to be beatified by the pope next month as a prelude to full canonisation. Would Padre Pio be flattered by all the patriotic rejoicing? If so, this in itself ought to disqualify him, since the acceptance of flattery is sinful. It's the Catholic Catch-22: anyone who is humble enough to be a saint couldn't desire the personal exaltation that canonisation bestows. The answer to this paradox, I suppose, may be that sainthood is not a cushy sinecure but a form of purgatorial penance. After a godly and righteous life you ascend to heaven for a well-earned retirement, only to find yourself kept awake by the continuous din from supplicants begging you to let Manchester United win the treble. Meanwhile, unscrupulous marketing types are free to take your name in vain, as with the luckless St Ivel, the unofficial patron saint of margarine and low-fat yoghurt. Worse still, Padre Pio will find himself mixing with some pretty dodgy characters if he joins the communion of saints. St George, whose feast-day falls this Friday, is the patron of England, Portugal, Germany, horses, farmers and boy scouts, and can also be invoked against syphilis. How did he earn such eminence? According to Gibbon's Decline and Fall, George of Cappadocia raised himself from obscurity 'by the talents of a parasite; and the patrons whom he assiduously flattered procured for their worthless dependent a lucrative commission, or contract, to supply the army with bacon.' He then accumulated a fortune 'by the basest arts', and after becoming the primate of Egypt 'oppressed with an impartial hand the various inhabitants of his extensive diocese.' Alexandria's merchants were bankrupted by 'the unjust and almost universal monopoly, which he acquired, of nitre, salt, paper, funerals, etc.: and the spiritual father of a great people condescended to practise the vile and pernicious arts of an informer.' Yet this devious creature somehow 'assumed the mask of a martyr'. Do the London cabbies who have been flying the flag of St George this week realise that they are paying tribute to the patron saint of Mohamed Al Fayed?"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"theguardian/1999/apr/22/guardianletters3","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-22T01:51:36Z","webTitle":"Nuclear reaction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/22/guardianletters3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/apr/22/guardianletters3","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear reaction","bodyText":"I am surprised to see, on the evidence of your Leader (Bombs in Asia too, April 16) that the Guardian seems unaware of the changes to Britain's nuclear posture following last year's Strategic Defence Review (SDR). You state that the 'public and verifiable disappearance of some, at least, of the British nuclear stockpile' would qualify us to encourage disarmament in India. In fact, we have destroyed a good portion of our stockpile. The RAF gave up its nuclear role in March last year when we withdrew its freefall nuclear bomb. During the cold war we had several hundred of these weapons - all have now been destroyed. The UK now has only one remaining nuclear system, our Trident submarines, and in the SDR we decided that we would maintain fewer than 200 operationally available Trident warheads. This was a reduction of one third from the previous government's plans. We also decided that the single submarine which would be on deterrent patrol at any one time would carry just 48 warheads, compared with the previous government's celling of 96. The United Kingdom now possesses fewer nuclear warheads than when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty came into force in 1970. Your suggestion that 'racist and imperialist assumptions' lie behind our attitude to India and Pakistan's development of nuclear weapons is frankly unworthy of a newspaper of the Guardian's standing. We and Nato have now greatly reduced the prominence of nuclear deterrence in our defence thinking. Why should it be considered racist or imperialist for us to be concerned at the introduction of nuclear weapons as a new factor, with unpredictable effects, into the difficult security relationship between these two countries?

The confusion in Paris yesterday only grew further after the market regulator issued the crucial bid timetable for the ground-breaking, three-way bank merger sparked by Banque Nationale de Paris' audacious £22bn bid for its rivals Societe Generale and Paribas, spoiling plans for a more cosy tie-up. The French regulator - the CMF - said yesterday that all the bids should run concurrently. Consequently, Paribas shareholders backing the agreed SocGen bid may yet end up becoming part of BNP if SocGen's shareholders support BNP's hostile offer. Paribas and SocGen believe, however, that their shareholders will be fiercely fighting the BNP offer. Once a bastion of gentlemanly rivalry where deals were struck between old university friends, the French banking world is now witnessing a no-holds-barred battle that escalates almost every day. Such is the animosity between the heads of SocGen and Paribas and their counterparts at BNP that they refuse to speak let alone entertain the idea of dining with them, such an important feature of the French business world. Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, and Daniel Bouton, chairman at SocGen, insist there is no reason why they should speak to Baudouin Prot and Michel Pebereau, the chief executive and chairman of BNP, after the latter derailed their plan to form SG Paribas. Through puffs on his pipe, Bouton is at pains to explain why he cannot bring himself to talk to Prot, a man he has known for more than 20 years and with whom, a few months ago, he had contemplated - and rejected - a friendly merger between their two banks. Sitting in an ante-room to what is intended to be the boardroom of the com bined SG Paribas, Bouton passionately insisted: 'On two points the BNP bid is absolutely weak. Never anywhere in the world has a three-way merger between banking institutions been attempted and it doesn't create value for shareholders in terms of a retail bank as much as SG Paribas.' Levy-Lang added: 'BNP will bring in overlap and duplication everywhere. It [the combined bank] would lose revenue because of these overlaps.' Between them, Bouton and Levy-Lang have 100 advisers working on their defence against BNP. They are presenting a united public face, determined to finish their two-way marriage and determined to see off the unwelcome bid. By now Bouton and Levy-Lang had expected the boardroom - plain but with spectacular views of the Arc de Triomphe - to be their joint kingdom. SG Paribas, had the potential to be the main force in the French banking industry, where rivals such as Credit Lyonnais are only now being privatised. They thought they had covered the ground perfectly. By agreeing to be bought by SocGen, troubled Paribas was answering the siren call of critics who argued the bank was failing to meet the mark. Levy-Lang had clinched the support of his bank's most important shareholder, long-time friend Claude Bebear, the chairman of Axa. Back in January, Bebear had given him the blessing for the union with SocGen and Levy-Lang, who went to school with Bebear, could not have expected to find himself at the end of a hostile bid concocted by his one-time supporter. Bebear's role in the saga is crucial and his Machiavellian character can be seen behind BNP's bid, which caught the world's bankers on the hop on the night of March 10. Levy-Lang and Bouton remember it precisely - 8.23 pm - as they were ploughing through the finer details of the merger they had announced with pride only six weeks previously. Their friendly negotiations were interrupted by a call from Pebereau in which he told them BNP was launching a hostile bid for them both. They might have been able to brush his bid aside had Pebereau not been able to play his trump card - the support of Bebear. Without Bebear's backing, BNP could not have dreamt of such unprecedented action. According to BNP's head of strategy, Laurent Treca, Bebear was the key to the whole bid, which has already broken every unwritten rule in the French corporate books. Hostile bids are rare and the regulators have, until now, always been expected to step in to protect their charges. All this has changed, predominantly because of Bebear's role. He prompted yet more controversy earlier this week when public documents showed that he had discussed the possibility of another merger with a retail bank with Levy-Lang and Bouton only in February. Bebear said that this was the reason he could understand why they were so against a three-way merger. It is now part of French folklore that SocGen, Paribas and BNP had all discussed mergers with one another, but Bebear's version of events was too much for Levy-Lang and Bouton. They refused to agree with his comments and said so, in what appeared to be the first public rift with Bebear. According to Levy-Lang, it was Bebear who raised the possibility of a three-way merger with BNP, not once but three times in February, just after they had won his support for their two-way merger. Bebear was acting on behalf of BNP which felt concerned by the prospect of an SG Paribas. The two men refused the idea of a three-way deal but suggested to Bebear that his Axa insurance company could help BNP by increasing its stake in the bank. Bouton and Levy-Lang do not dispute that another retail bank merger was discussed with Bebear - Levy-Lang even went to his home in the fashionable eighth arrondissement of Paris. But what they cannot agree on is who raised the subject first - they claim it was Bebear - and the timescale. They admit that another merger was on their horizon but in a few years time when the merger was cemented. The dispute might seem like splitting hairs, but to the men engaged in the battle it is a crucial part of their campaign to win over shareholders. New twists are unearthed every day, such as a pact, secret for 10 years, under which Axa and Paribas agreed to protect each other from hostile takeovers. Bebear may yet not be able to sell the crucial shares Axa owns in Paribas to BNP - in which he also owns shares. The fighting could go on for months - the prey have taken to the courts to try to derail BNP's bid. They could even take yesterday's ruling by the regulators to the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/apr/23/balkans3","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-23T01:01:18Z","webTitle":"Jack's shambles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/23/balkans3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/23/balkans3","fields":{"headline":"Jack's shambles","bodyText":"Jack Straw earlier this year banned his officials from using the word 'bogus' when applied to asylum seekers. Unfortunately he couldn't see that his recommended replacement - 'abusive' - also continued to prejudge the issue of whether or not those who applied for sanctuary in Britain were genuine or not. So what is Labour's approach to asylum and immigration? The impending arrival of a further batch of Kosovar refugees in the United Kingdom next week once again throws the spot light on the ambiguities. Although some sections of the media, notably the Daily Mail, have talked in more positive terms about Britain's obligations to Kosovars, papers such as the Sun continued to greet this news as 'refugee flood for UK' and claiming that unnamed 'critics feared that those who come could claim asylum and start a new life on benefits.' Labour's Asylum and Immigration Bill was launched amidst claims that asylum seekers to Britain had reached record numbers. Home Office ministers went to Eastern Europe to warn that 'abusive asylum seekers' would in future find their access to welfare payments blocked, that they face being swiftly returned if their claim proves false, and many more will be held in detention centres to prevent absconding. At the same time far right groups were stirring up demonstrations in Dover and elsewhere over asylum seekers as local authorities in the South East were complaining bitterly about the disproportionate costs that they faced in trying to cope with their statutory duties to ensure no-one was left destitute. In this situation the more repressive aspects of the new Bill were highlighted. These included the policy of dispersal throughout Britain, food vouchers instead of cash support and no-choice accommodation - only 50 pence a day for a child's incidental living expenses such as bus fares. The illiberal reputation of this 132-clause bill was fostered when after its publication it was confirmed in a draft Home Office manual that those who tried to launch High Court actions over their treatment by the immigration authorities would face losing even the minimum level of state support on offer including food and hostel places. But Jack Straw likes to do a 'bad cop, good cop' act and and he sold the Labour party the package on the basis it would be 'firm but fair'. 'Fairer' has seen the recognition rate for asylum seekers rise from 17 to 30 per cent of claims. Mr Straw offered an amnesty in all but name to 30,000 asylum seekers who have already waited more than 18 months for an initial decision on their cases. Some 10,000 of these people have been waiting more than five years for an initial decision on their cases. This delay alone will now be regarded as sufficient reason to give indefinite leave to remain in Britain. Many of this group have been waiting since 1993 when their applications were put to one side as part of the Tory government's attempt to clear the backlog. Indeed it is the bureaucratic mountain of unresolved asylum applications that is the main engine of injustice within the entire British approach to the treatment of asylum seekers. Many asylum seekers say they would be willing to put up with the difficulties of having to live off food vouchers and in bed and breakfast hostels if it was only for a few months. The central promise at the heart of Mr Straw's complex new bill is to deliver an asylum decision within six months. Ministers have set a target of two months for the initial decision and four months to resolve any appeals. If that target is achieved it would remove the major injustice at the heart of what is currently a shambles of system and is regarded as one of the biggest bureaucratic quagmires in Whitehall. The trouble is (serving immigration officers testified to this at the special standing committee on the Bill) that the backlog of asylum applications is not being cut but is still growing. Immigration and Nationality Department staff say the new targets are wholly unrealistic. The computerisation of the IND's Croydon headquarters has compounded problems, leading to a breakdown in renewal of visas and work permits. A Commons written reply this week disclosed 139,000 cases awaiting action by the immigration authorities. There are some 22,000 people who face difficulties leaving the country because IND is holding their passports. Ministers believe that these 'transitional problems' will be resolved and the system speeded up. The alternative is difficult to contemplate. The Home Office insists that asylum seekers will not be left isolated on hard to let council estates on the edge of town but in 'reception zones' which will cluster them together so that they can provide mutual support. The HO notes its food and accommodation package is worth £90 a week for a family of two adults and two children. Britain cannot close its doors while this mess is sorted out. But the numbers actually coming bear close examination, both absolutely and in comparison with other countries. The UK is not the 'honeypot' of Europe that it is painted by the populist press. Asylum applications in Britain did reach 46,000 in 1998 but they had been as low as 29,000 and 32,000 in the previous two years. They reached the mid-40,000s in 1991 and in 1995 both years of major upheaval in the Balkans. In the European league table Britain is 11th out of 17 in terms of asylum applications per 1,000 population. Switzerland is at the top with 5.8 per 1,000. The UK at one per 1,000 population is even lower than Ireland. The plight of the Kosovar refugees has again reminded us that it will be the mass movement of people triggered by wars and famines that will be one of really big issues facing the world in the 21st century. Britain's asylum system is not yet in a fit state to cope.

And you can smell it all the way from the top of the William Wallace Monument in Stirlingshire, to Edinburgh's Royal Mile and its new Parliament, right down to the streets of what is still, but soon to be no longer, known as the nation's capital, London. The smell is the first signs of the political death of the United Kingdom. On May 6, Scots will go to the polls to elect a Scottish Parliament, a devolution Parliament. If everything goes to plan, Labour under Scottish Secretary of State Donald Dewar are going to hammer the Scots Nationalists, who have so far, according to most pundits, fought a politically inept campaign. But none of that is going to make a difference. Even as they lose, the Nationalists win simply through the existence of the Edinburgh Parliament, and the creation of a new political Scottishness. According to Margo MacDonald, a former Westminster MP and leading figure in the SNP, the plan, even in opposition, will be to destroy the Union from the platform of a Scottish Parliament. \"I want to deconstruct the current British State. I want to build something different from this place. This is pretty big stuff. I do not expect the people opposite me in that Parliament to say, \u0091Just do it, Margo, just do it.' There will be tension . . . and there will be running rows.\" The political air north of the border is already turning nasty. \"I do not like the atmosphere that nationalism creates,\" says Scottish Secretary of State Donald Dewar, and the likely future First Minister. \"I would not deny the charge of being a cultural nationalist. I am proud of Scotland's contribution. But I do protest against this political nationalism and the rather arrogant view that, because I do not go that last mile with them, then in some sort of way I am - and I have actually been called this - a \u0091quisling' and a \u0091traitor'.\" A lot of the rows are going to be about money, resources, \"Labour's London lackeys\" and the invidious English Treasury bloc grant. But the main argument is, and will become more so, \"What is Scottishness?\" How does it differ from Englishness, or political Unionism? What is the Scottish Parliament for? What is this thing, this identity, that links the £150,000-a-year Edinburgh advocate in her New Town flat and the £9,000-a-year ice-cream-van man doing the rounds on Glasgow's Castlemilk estate? It is clear already that one response the new Scottish Parliament will not give to that question is \"Britishness\". The only inexorable answer is some new Scottish national political identity - the arising of what the SNP calls its \"invisible nation\". It is fair to say that I grew up hating England and the English. Even the sound of their toffee-nosed English voices on the television was enough to define them as the enemy - limp-wristed, half-pint-drinking English poofs. I knew that, even though I had never met an English person in my life. I was Scottish. I was born in Edinburgh and lived there until I was 21. I was part of a big working-class Catholic family. We grew up in the neighbourhood of the South Clark Street: a cordon of streets between the old Irish slums of the Pleasance and the posher environs of Newington. It was a mixed commercial- residential area on the fringes of the university. We lived in a big stone tenement. Us Scots were better than the English in some not entirely expressible way, but we were. We were not impressed by all the silly baubles, titles, the Royal Family, the aristocracy and all that rubbish. We believed we lived in a more meritocratic society. We were truer, and Scotland an altogether more beautiful country. Sure, there was poverty, but it was \"good poverty\", where no neighbour ignored a hungry child and everyone was happy eating their fish suppers. Our national myth was evoked each week in the reactionary Sunday Post newspaper, in the cartoon section. The Broons were a sprawling inter-generational Glaswegian family, all living happily on top of each other in a Gorbals tenement circa 1950. The Broons battled, they argued, grandad drank, but it was like us Scots, just one big happy national family. A few Scottish things did get left out of the Broons' weekly cartoon: all the Scottish mayhem, the terrible, terrible, destructive Scottish pursuit of the bottle, the culture of alcoholism, the knife fights, the wife- beatings, the grim slums, the beaten-up weans, the bad schools and, later on, the drugs that took place all around us. But that was not the Broons' fault. All these things happened, but, under the spell of our happy national myth as Scots, they happened in another, parallel country. Our accents, working-class, were badges of our authenticity as the proletariat's true sons, who had been unjustly deprived of our place among the nations by Edward I and his like, who now ran the BBC. Nevertheless, we Scots had invented television, thanks to John Logie Baird - likewise penicillin (Sir Alexander Fleming) and the steam engine (James Watt). And even though we always got trashed at football, somehow our true destiny as winners was just over the horizon. Like the first reserve, we were warming up for our big moment in history. Not all was rosy on the reserve benches, mind you. Long before Nick Hornby wrote about it, and New Labour adopted football-supporting as a political policy, \"fitba\" was a suffocating religion in Scotland. It was socially compulsory for every male from the age of six. Every breaktime was marred by the rituals of team-picking (I was always the last) and then a limitless game of our national sport. It was impossible to dissent and say, I think fitba is boring. You had to be on the team. I did not like football. As I stood on the touchline as a seven-year-old, I longed for lessons to begin again. It was the beginning of my disenchantment. In secondary school I was forced to take up smoking, Players Number 6 in those little green packets, at the back of the science block to escape this grim, mandatory ritual of Scottish manhood. Smokers, it was widely acknowledged, were participating in our other national pastime, the self-inducement of lung cancer, and were therefore exempt from fitba. There was no otherness, we were too small, too constrained. You played football or you were one of the \"smokers\". Life's options were limited. St Augustine's RC High, like most of Scotland, was a white mono-culture divided only by Catholic-Protestant religious hatreds. At the all-Catholic St Augustine's we divided ourselves up in a separate otherness through a virulent, homophobic hatred of \"poofs\". Of course, we barely knew the meaning of the word, but that did not matter. The worst epithet was to be \"an English poof\". The nearest we got to cultural diversity was the strange Catholic schoolmate who fanatically adopted the counter-bigotry of Rangers and adorned his schoolbooks with the Red Hand of Ulster. We were working class and proud. We loathed the Scottish middle classes, who constantly betrayed Scotland by sucking up to the English, changing their accents, moving south, and generally joining in with those Sassenach bastards. Yet we held internally a minute calculus of our class calibrations through the educational apartheid league table of Edinburgh's numerous private schools. Fettes - where Prime Minster Tony Blair was educated - was for wannabe English public schoolboys. George Watson's - respectable sons and daughters of the middle class. St Augustine's, my own, a Catholic comprehensive with aspirations to play rugby - not soccer - with the private schools. Decades later - What school did you go to? - is still the first question the city's sons and daughters ask each other on their first encounter. We were not so meritocratic after all. As soon as I could, I betrayed my working-class brothers and spent my teenage years trying to mingle sexually with the middle-class girls from George Watson. Of course, I had it both ways. I was \"authentic\" - as in \"really Scottish with a Scottish working-class accent\" - but got invited to nice parties in big middle-class houses in Marchmont or Balerno in Edinburgh's extensive middle-class townships. The parties were fun, the girls more willing, and no one talked about the match. At home, in our authentic stone tenement, I gave up on tea, switched to coffee and to long-wave and listened to the Today programme on national BBC radio in the morning rather than the tailored-for-Arbroath version dished up from BBC Scotland. I wanted to hear more about the world and to silence the continual, low-level whine about how down-trodden we all were. And when I could, I left my birthland forever. According to Margo MacDonald, Scottishness is not about hating the English but about brotherly love. \"Underlying it all in Scotland is the whole idea - the Burnsian legacy. \u0091That Man to Man the warld o'er shall brothers be, for a'that.' We are brought up that there is a right thing to be. It does not matter what foot you kick with (a reference to religious division), what tradition you come from. It's a thing of the spirit much more than a constitutional arrangement. A fellowship there, an understanding.\" A few sceptics might point the finger at the roars of hatred emanating from the Rangers and Celtic terraces, and Scotland's homicide rate, and put a question mark over Scotland as the home of brotherly love. But it is rare in Scotland for this \"Scottishness of the spirit\" to be denounced. One of the few who has is Lanarkshire poet Francis Gallagher, who in his explosive poem The Barrenness Of Home pours contempt on his countrymen and their \"shabby spoor of tribal myths\" - \"Scots adore themselves but it's hard/to see why they so love themselves a bankrupt/politics predictable mediocre culture a failed sad/people pouring their soul into alcohol football/celebrations of their sentimental heart.\" If Gallagher's subversion was more widely known among his compatriots on the mean streets of his hometown, Bellshill, he would probably risk getting his head kicked in. But Gallagher's poetry, Fuck Scotland, is one of the few cultural assaults on something that is just about to get its own Parliament, its own platform, its own self-starting political power kit, and yet remains extraordinarily ill-defined. What is Scottishness? Destroying a political union that has lasted for 300 years is a serious business. Nations are never born easily. Their identity can be created only through separation, difference and at a certain cost to those on either side of the dividing line. \"There is a political wind that is shaping our ends, and the final direction is set. All we will be arguing about in Scotland is the timescale for independence. Independence for Scotland is as near inevitable as these things can be,\" says a confident SNP leader Alex Salmond. Like a wound-up clock, the new Edinburgh Parliament is going to start ticking the countdown to what the SNP hopes will be a new nation's birth, but what in reality will be the funeral of an old one, the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament election campaign is basically a straight two-handed contest between Labour and the SNP, with the Liberal Democrats, as always, a poor third. The Tories in Scotland are still in the political wilderness, and their only hope of gaining any seats at all resides in the proportional-representative electoral system for the Parliament. Apart from \"the National Question\", the economic policies of Labour and the SNP are virtually indistinguishable. Both are left-of-centre social democratic parties committed to social justice, funding public services, and taxing the middle class moderately to help the poor moderately. The campaign so far has been dominated by a fiscal agenda. In almost a re-run of the 1992 General Election, the Labour Party has dressed itself in the old Tory clothes of fiscal rectitude and cast its SNP opponents as the \"tax-and-spend\" party - who would foolishly use the Parliament's limited tax-raising powers to cripple Scottish business and rob the pound from your tartan pocket etc. Labour has put the frighteners on to scare the voters away from Nationalism. Every political debate ends in a mass and mess of bewildering figures. A secondary aim is probably to bore the voters, keeping the campaign low-key, and away from the dangerous, inflammatory ground of historic futures, new eras, the Braveheart syndrome. In contrast - a bit like the doomed 1992 Labour campaign - the SNP has occupied the moral high ground, appealing to the Scottish voters' conscience rather than to their pocket, and promising to reverse the Chancellor's one pence Budget income tax cut in Scotland, thus raising £700 million over three years to improve schools and hospitals and various other good works. Conventional political wisdom teaches that the SNP's appeal to the electorate to vote for higher taxes is suicidal, but the SNP's economic spokesman, John Swinney MP, is adamant that Scotland is another country. \"What happened in 1992 is that Labour won 50 out of the 72 Scottish seats at Westminster. Labour might have lost the election in England, but they did not lose the election in Scotland. Labour's use of the \u0091tax bombshell' might work in England, but it does not matter a whit in Scotland.\" It remains to be seen if John Swinney is right, but it will take a virtual political revolution to break Labour's hegemony in Scotland, where it currently holds 54 out of the 72 Westminster seats. Electoral polls show Labour consistently in the lead. Translated into seats, the polls would give Labour 50-60 seats in the 129-seat Parliament, the SNP would take around 40, the Liberals 20 and the Tories bring up the rear with just ten. Labour will either rule alone or in a Labour-Liberal coalition. Beneath the public confidence, Labour remains deeply divided over the poisoned devolution chalice and riven by fear that it has created a nationalist monster. \"There is a danger that the issues - jobs, education, all the things Scots care about - could be distorted or supported by an endless, embittering row about further constitutional change,\" says Dewar. \"I think that would be a great shame. But I have to say that is one of the choices that face people at this election - which way they want to go.\" And, although they are well beyond the proposed scope of the devolution Parliament, there are a few other things on the SNP shopping list: removing all British nuclear weapons from Scottish soil, opting out of Nato, bringing down the Western Alliance and getting the United Kingdom kicked out of the UN Security Council. Alex Salmond has already denounced the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia as \"an unpardonable folly\". Labour has scoured the globe for models of how the Parliament will work, settling on a good- and a bad-case example. The good devolution example is Catalonia, in Spain, where Catalan nationalist Jordi Pujol has presided over 20 years of lip service to nationalist ideals but done nothing about it. The bad example is Quebec, where the Parti Quebecois had done nothing else in the past 20 years but threaten to leave the Canadian Federation at the next available opportunity. Of course, the closest model of a state emerging from within a greater Union is right on Scotland's doorstep - Ireland. The Irish Free State was established in 1922, after civil war. For generations after, the politics of the Irish Republic were dominated by nationalist ideals. Economically, the Free State was a disaster that impoverished the majority of the population, forced millions to emigrate, and maintained a near state theocracy in power for decades and decades. But, instead of tackling these problems, Irish politics revolved around the sterile futility of the irresolution of the Irish \"National Question\". It is not a happy parallel. The profound fear of the Scots who dom-inate Blair's Cabinet is that - although they will win this election - they will lose every subsequent one as the politics of the Scottish Parliament are skewed further and further on a nationalist agenda. Their worry is that Labour in power in Edinburgh will only exacerbate the nationalist tide. How can a Unionist party such as Labour, ruled by London, be the party of Scotland? How can a Unionist party, such as Labour, even survive in a Parliament devoted to \"expressing the will of the Scottish people\"? Some nifty political footwork lies ahead, but, inevitably, political ground is going to open up between Edinburgh and London. \"The Union that was there ten years is changing,\" says Labour MP John McAllion, who is one of the few in his party to truly embrace the new Parliament. \"We have to accept that. We are in a dynamic situation now.\" In theory, the Holyrood Parliament is all about the better governance of Scotland; better schools, better hospitals, better jobs. The Scottish Parliament will enable the Scots to give expression to the distinctive Scottish systems of health, education, housing, and tackle the bread-and-butter issues in a way that was, by implication, not possible by the distant neo-colonial Westminster Parliament with its pro-English, anti-Scots bias. It is an understandable political thesis, but it is demonstrably false. Central Treasury figures show that, in every year of the Nineties, government expenditure per head of population was nearly 25 per cent higher in Scotland than in England. In absolute terms, the per capita government expenditure for 1997 for England was £3,885; the comparable figure for Scotland was £4,826. Scotland received more in virtually every category of government expenditure. But there were particularly large discrepancies in health, education and social security, where each Scottish pupil had £188 per annum more spent on their education than their English counterparts. Similarly, an extra £186 per capita was spent on health-care and an additional £188 per head was spent on social security. This is hardly the track record of a cold colonialist London regime. If you compare Scotland with an equivalent population-sized region, Yorkshire and the Humber, then by virtually every indicator Scotland comes out ahead: average wages are higher, unemployment levels the same, house prices identical. Yet government spending levels are 25 per cent higher. Scotland may be poor, but it has never been misgoverned by central government, even under Margaret Thatcher. The SNP, for understandable reasons, disputes these figures and comes up with a host of its own based on extrapolations, academic research and other props that \"prove\" Scotland was a net contributor by way of £34 billion to the Treasury in London between 1979-1994. Ergo, Scotland would be better off without England. The SNP's financial analysis is, frankly, entirely unconvincing, but so, too, is the Treasury's explanation of why it cannot collate tax revenues on a Scottish basis, including, of course, North Sea oil revenues, to give an actual figure for Scotland's contribution to the Union. In the United Kingdom, none of these figures matters; it's only when you start getting divorced that it becomes crucial. Scotland's current annual budget is around £14 billion - much of it already committed by central government to social security, health provision etc. The Scottish Parliament will obviously add a new layer of administration and bureaucracy for a significant proportion of this expenditure. But, given the limitations in its tax-raising powers, it is inconceivable that Parliament will do anything other than administer the same sums, perhaps more efficiently. In real terms, it can make little difference to either the advocate or the ice-cream man. The biggest difference, of course, will be the proceedings themselves. From nine to five, Mondays to Fridays, during Parliamentary sittings, the representatives of the Scottish people will meet in Edinburgh's Royal Mile to verbally batter each other over the state of Scottish housing, schools, Trident nuclear weapons, the English Treasury, William Wallace and the \"National Question\". These proceedings will be reported at length in the Scottish media, pored over in late-night television programmes, analysed by commentators and generally invested with significance. Scotland will begin to turn towards Edinburgh as its political capital rather than to London. The Parliament will be important in Scotland. When the drains are blocked, it will be your local MSP rather than your MP you turn to for help. But with little to separate Labour and the SNP in economic policy terms, the engine of difference in the Parliament will be nationalism, as last December's instructive little row in Scotland on the \"lost\" William Wallace letter showed. As every Mel Gibson fan knows, the 13th-century Scottish rebel, Sir William Wallace, aka Braveheart, is a Scottish national hero who defeated the cruel English King Edward I at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. In 1869, during another period of romantic nationalist revival, a National Wallace Monument was built overlooking the battlefield in Stirlingshire to commemorate Scotland's hero. Since the Hollywood Braveheart movie, the monument has become a renewed shrine to nationalist devotion, with annual attendances tripling from just 55,000 in 1994 to 184,000 in 1996, after the Australian Mel Gibson donned his Wallace war kilt. The movie was riddled with historical impossibilities, but none of that mattered. So little is actually known about the historical figure of Wallace that there is no real truth to argue over. The most celebrated so-called contemporaneous account of his deeds, by Blind Harry, was gathered a century-and-a-half after Wallace's execution in London in 1305. Wallace is a figure of myth, a focus for national legend. Even the National Wallace Monument is a grotesque Victorian piece of fakery: an obelisk whose prize exhibit - the Wallace Sword - is a 15th-century fake that has since in turn been augmented by a 1984 replica of the same fake. Truth and lies are interchangeable when it comes to national myths. Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell that to the curator of the new £54 million Museum of Scotland, which opened in Edinburgh last December. Unable to locate any artefacts about Wallace, the museum staff did not include Wallace in the National Collection. It was hardly a national crime, but it became so a few days later when a Scottish newspaper suddenly \"rediscovered\" a letter by Wallace in a German archive. And then all nationalist hell broke loose. Why had no effort been made to retrieve this national treasure, demanded an allegedly angry Alex Salmond as the full fury of Scottish tabloid outrage descended on the poor curators' heads. \"For centuries, members of the establishment have been attempting to eradicate all traces of Wallace from Scottish history - people in Scotland are no longer prepared to accept this persecution of Scotland's greatest national hero,\" said Salmond, who has often claimed that tales told to him by his grandfather about Blind Harry were the inspiration for his own nationalism. Of course, the Wallace letter was never lost in the first place, but when staff from Edinburgh University's Scottish History Department wrote to the Scotsman newspaper group pointing this out, their letter was never printed. It is also hard to see how Salmond's claim of a centuries-long conspiracy to persecute Wallace is anything other than an ugly twisting of banal facts to invoke some latent sense of historical grievance. A chastened museum director, Mark Jones, duly begged his German counterparts for the Wallace letter, written in Latin, and Scotland's national honour was assuaged with a temporary inter-museum loan. But the row over the Wallace letter is an ominous sign of how anything - past, present or future - can be manipulated for a nationalist agenda. Ironically, according to Edinburgh University's Scottish history expert on Wallace, Dr Graeme Morton, Wallace was used in the 19th century as a symbol in defence of the Union. His fight allowed Scotland to join the Union as an equal. \"Wallace is ideal myth material because we really do not know very much about him. Myth is powerful when there is some truth, but not too much. You can use Wallace any way you want: as proletarian hero, as outlaw, as romantic hero, as a martyr,\" says Morton. \"Myth is telling us who we were in the past, who we are in the present, and who we could possibly be in the future, as a nation.\" I still speak with a Scottish accent and still go to Scotland. But I have lived among English people, and others, for most of my adult life. Ironically, the English are either indifferent or actually discriminatory in favour of Scots and Scotland. In England, to describe something as Scottish is generally to suggest something positive, interesting, individualistic. But the reverse is still true in Scotland. The word \"English\" in Scotland is automatically derogatory. \"He is English\" still connotes self-centred, superficial, arrogant. Of course, Scotland is different now, says the SNP, and it has a few organisations to prove it: Asians For Independence and New Scots (the English) For Scotland. Salmond goes out of his way to denounce the occasional eruptions of anti-English prejudice that result in racist graffiti and attacks on English families. But even the SNP is at a loss to describe precisely what it is giving expression to - other than un-Englishness. When you press it to define Scottishness, it reaches for the cliché dictionary and talks about \"democratic instincts\" or \"sense of community\". Even the fundamental basis of the SNP's economic policy - joining the European Union as an independent state - one feels is grounded more in a desperate desire to flee the English pound than in a positive endorsement of the Frankfurt Euro. Nor do you really get much sense of the SNP as a political party. It is still a nationalist movement of different voices, united only by a vague dream. But all that will begin to end on May 6, when \"Scottishness\" will become a creed, a self-referential political ideology, its mutterings recorded in a Scottish Hansard and pored over for significance. There are many wonderful things about Scotland: the Highlands are beautiful, Edinburgh is magnificent, Glasgow art is great. But they are all individual things now. The enjoyment of them is not going to be enhanced by border controls and/or a Scottish passport to go with them. That drove me, and hundreds of thousands of Scots like me, out of Scotland were the very values that will be legitimised by the Scottish Parliament: the smallness of the stage, the parochialism, the turning inwards, the mono-cultural definition of Scotland as a working-class country, the denunciation of museum directors, the denial of ways of being outside the tight, familial Protestant/Catholic matrix, the forced collectivity rather than individual freedom. Perhaps the greatest value of the Union has been its containment, its sapping, of nationalism. A \"British nationalist\" is an oxymoron or a fascist. That is not a bad achievement for a nation state. Unlike other states, we do not feel the need to have our children salute the national flag every morning, to stick flag-poles in our private gardens, and to play our tribal tune at the end of the night. We do not need to remind ourselves who we are, enforce our identity upon ourselves; we just are vaguely British. But will it be the same in Scotland in ten years' time? What is Scottishness? No one, as yet, has the answer. I hope, as a Scot, that it is something more than the bundle of myths and hatred that I grew up with. I wish we had no need for it at all. In The Barrenness Of Home, the poet Francis Gallagher ends with a wonderful line denying nationalism: \"My country is me I am my people and my loyalty/is to/my instinctive intelligence that tells me all this/Scottish stuff is pure shit.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/24/otherparties.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-24T17:13:40Z","webTitle":"Scotland, the vainglorious","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/24/otherparties.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/24/otherparties.comment","fields":{"headline":"Scotland, the vainglorious","bodyText":"Something is rotting in the state of the Union. And you can smell it all the way from the top of the William Wallace Monument in Stirlingshire, to Edinburgh's Royal Mile and its new Parliament, right down to the streets of what is still, but soon to be no longer, known as the nation's capital, London. The smell is the first signs of the political death of the United Kingdom. On May 6, Scots will go to the polls to elect a Scottish Parliament, a devolution Parliament. If everything goes to plan, Labour under Scottish Secretary of State Donald Dewar are going to hammer the Scots Nationalists, who have so far, according to most pundits, fought a politically inept campaign. But none of that is going to make a difference. Even as they lose, the Nationalists win simply through the existence of the Edinburgh Parliament, and the creation of a new political Scottishness. According to Margo MacDonald, a former Westminster MP and leading figure in the SNP, the plan, even in opposition, will be to destroy the Union from the platform of a Scottish Parliament. 'I want to deconstruct the current British State. I want to build something different from this place. This is pretty big stuff. I do not expect the people opposite me in that Parliament to say, 'Just do it, Margo, just do it.' There will be tension . . . and there will be running rows.' The political air north of the border is already turning nasty. 'I do not like the atmosphere that nationalism creates,' says Scottish Secretary of State Donald Dewar, and the likely future First Minister. 'I would not deny the charge of being a cultural nationalist. I am proud of Scotland's contribution. But I do protest against this political nationalism and the rather arrogant view that, because I do not go that last mile with them, then in some sort of way I am - and I have actually been called this - a 'quisling' and a 'traitor'.' A lot of the rows are going to be about money, resources, 'Labour's London lackeys' and the invidious English Treasury bloc grant. But the main argument is, and will become more so, 'What is Scottishness?' How does it differ from Englishness, or political Unionism? What is the Scottish Parliament for? What is this thing, this identity, that links the £150,000-a-year Edinburgh advocate in her New Town flat and the £9,000-a-year ice-cream-van man doing the rounds on Glasgow's Castlemilk estate? It is clear already that one response the new Scottish Parliament will not give to that question is 'Britishness'. The only inexorable answer is some new Scottish national political identity - the arising of what the SNP calls its 'invisible nation'. It is fair to say that I grew up hating England and the English. Even the sound of their toffee-nosed English voices on the television was enough to define them as the enemy - limp-wristed, half-pint-drinking English poofs. I knew that, even though I had never met an English person in my life. I was Scottish. I was born in Edinburgh and lived there until I was 21. I was part of a big working-class Catholic family. We grew up in the neighbourhood of the South Clark Street: a cordon of streets between the old Irish slums of the Pleasance and the posher environs of Newington. It was a mixed commercial- residential area on the fringes of the university. We lived in a big stone tenement. Us Scots were better than the English in some not entirely expressible way, but we were. We were not impressed by all the silly baubles, titles, the Royal Family, the aristocracy and all that rubbish. We believed we lived in a more meritocratic society. We were truer, and Scotland an altogether more beautiful country. Sure, there was poverty, but it was 'good poverty', where no neighbour ignored a hungry child and everyone was happy eating their fish suppers. Our national myth was evoked each week in the reactionary Sunday Post newspaper, in the cartoon section.

But that was not the Broons' fault. All these things happened, but, under the spell of our happy national myth as Scots, they happened in another, parallel country. Our accents, working-class, were badges of our authenticity as the proletariat's true sons, who had been unjustly deprived of our place among the nations by Edward I and his like, who now ran the BBC.

In secondary school I was forced to take up smoking, Players Number 6 in those little green packets, at the back of the science block to escape this grim, mandatory ritual of Scottish manhood. Smokers, it was widely acknowledged, were participating in our other national pastime, the self-inducement of lung cancer, and were therefore exempt from fitba.

In almost a re-run of the 1992 General Election, the Labour Party has dressed itself in the old Tory clothes of fiscal rectitude and cast its SNP opponents as the 'tax-and-spend' party - who would foolishly use the Parliament's limited tax-raising powers to cripple Scottish business and rob the pound from your tartan pocket etc. Labour has put the frighteners on to scare the voters away from Nationalism. Every political debate ends in a mass and mess of bewildering figures. A secondary aim is probably to bore the voters, keeping the campaign low-key, and away from the dangerous, inflammatory ground of historic futures, new eras, the Braveheart syndrome. In contrast - a bit like the doomed 1992 Labour campaign - the SNP has occupied the moral high ground, appealing to the Scottish voters' conscience rather than to their pocket, and promising to reverse the Chancellor's one pence Budget income tax cut in Scotland, thus raising £700 million over three years to improve schools and hospitals and various other good works. Conventional political wisdom teaches that the SNP's appeal to the electorate to vote for higher taxes is suicidal, but the SNP's economic spokesman, John Swinney MP, is adamant that Scotland is another country. 'What happened in 1992 is that Labour won 50 out of the 72 Scottish seats at Westminster. Labour might have lost the election in England, but they did not lose the election in Scotland. Labour's use of the 'tax bombshell' might work in England, but it does not matter a whit in Scotland.' It remains to be seen if John Swinney is right, but it will take a virtual political revolution to break Labour's hegemony in Scotland, where it currently holds 54 out of the 72 Westminster seats. Electoral polls show Labour consistently in the lead. Translated into seats, the polls would give Labour 50-60 seats in the 129-seat Parliament, the SNP would take around 40, the Liberals 20 and the Tories bring up the rear with just ten. Labour will either rule alone or in a Labour-Liberal coalition. Beneath the public confidence, Labour remains deeply divided over the poisoned devolution chalice and riven by fear that it has created a nationalist monster. 'There is a danger that the issues - jobs, education, all the things Scots care about - could be distorted or supported by an endless, embittering row about further constitutional change,' says Dewar. 'I think that would be a great shame. But I have to say that is one of the choices that face people at this election - which way they want to go.' And, although they are well beyond the proposed scope of the devolution Parliament, there are a few other things on the SNP shopping list: removing all British nuclear weapons from Scottish soil, opting out of Nato, bringing down the Western Alliance and getting the United Kingdom kicked out of the UN Security Council. Alex Salmond has already denounced the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia as 'an unpardonable folly'. Labour has scoured the globe for models of how the Parliament will work, settling on a good- and a bad-case example. The good devolution example is Catalonia, in Spain, where Catalan nationalist Jordi Pujol has presided over 20 years of lip service to nationalist ideals but done nothing about it. The bad example is Quebec, where the Parti Quebecois had done nothing else in the past 20 years but threaten to leave the Canadian Federation at the next available opportunity. Of course, the closest model of a state emerging from within a greater Union is right on Scotland's doorstep - Ireland. The Irish Free State was established in 1922, after civil war. For generations after, the politics of the Irish Republic were dominated by nationalist ideals. Economically, the Free State was a disaster that impoverished the majority of the population, forced millions to emigrate, and maintained a near state theocracy in power for decades and decades. But, instead of tackling these problems, Irish politics revolved around the sterile futility of the irresolution of the Irish 'National Question'. It is not a happy parallel. The profound fear of the Scots who dominate Blair's Cabinet is that - although they will win this election - they will lose every subsequent one as the politics of the Scottish Parliament are skewed further and further on a nationalist agenda. Their worry is that Labour in power in Edinburgh will only exacerbate the nationalist tide. How can a Unionist party such as Labour, ruled by London, be the party of Scotland? How can a Unionist party, such as Labour, even survive in a Parliament devoted to 'expressing the will of the Scottish people'? Some nifty political footwork lies ahead, but, inevitably, political ground is going to open up between Edinburgh and London. 'The Union that was there ten years is changing,' says Labour MP John McAllion, who is one of the few in his party to truly embrace the new Parliament. 'We have to accept that. We are in a dynamic situation now.' In theory, the Holyrood Parliament is all about the better governance of Scotland better schools, better hospitals, better jobs. The Scottish Parliament will enable the Scots to give expression to the distinctive Scottish systems of health, education, housing, and tackle the bread-and-butter issues in a way that was, by implication, not possible by the distant neo-colonial Westminster Parliament with its pro-English, anti-Scots bias. It is an understandable political thesis, but it is demonstrably false. Central Treasury figures show that, in every year of the Nineties, government expenditure per head of population was nearly 25% higher in Scotland than in England. In absolute terms, the per capita government expenditure for 1997 for England was £3,885 the comparable figure for Scotland was £4,826. Scotland received more in virtually every category of government expenditure. But there were particularly large discrepancies in health, education and social security, where each Scottish pupil had pounds 188 per annum more spent on their education than their English counterparts. Similarly, an extra pounds 186 per capita was spent on health-care and an additional £188 per head was spent on social security. This is hardly the track record of a cold colonialist London regime. If you compare Scotland with an equivalent population-sized region, Yorkshire and the Humber, then by virtually every indicator Scotland comes out ahead: average wages are higher, unemployment levels the same, house prices identical. Yet government spending levels are 25% higher. Scotland may be poor, but it has never been misgoverned by central government, even under Margaret Thatcher. The SNP, for understandable reasons, disputes these figures and comes up with a host of its own based on extrapolations, academic research and other props that 'prove' Scotland was a net contributor by way of £34 billion to the Treasury in London between 1979-1994. Ergo, Scotland would be better off without England. The SNP's financial analysis is, frankly, entirely unconvincing, but so, too, is the Treasury's explanation of why it cannot collate tax revenues on a Scottish basis, including, of course, North Sea oil revenues, to give an actual figure for Scotland's contribution to the Union. In the United Kingdom, none of these figures matters it's only when you start getting divorced that it becomes crucial. Scotland's current annual budget is around £14 billion - much of it already committed by central government to social security, health provision etc. The Scottish Parliament will obviously add a new layer of administration and bureaucracy for a significant proportion of this expenditure. But, given the limitations in its tax-raising powers, it is inconceivable that Parliament will do anything other than administer the same sums, perhaps more efficiently. In real terms, it can make little difference to either the advocate or the ice-cream man. The biggest difference, of course, will be the proceedings themselves. From nine to five, Mondays to Fridays, during Parliamentary sittings, the representatives of the Scottish people will meet in Edinburgh's Royal Mile to verbally batter each other over the state of Scottish housing, schools, Trident nuclear weapons, the English Treasury, William Wallace and the 'National Question'. These proceedings will be reported at length in the Scottish media, pored over in late-night television programmes, analysed by commentators and generally invested with significance. Scotland will begin to turn towards Edinburgh as its political capital rather than to London. The Parliament will be important in Scotland. When the drains are blocked, it will be your local MSP rather than your MP you turn to for help. But with little to separate Labour and the SNP in economic policy terms, the engine of difference in the Parliament will be nationalism, as last December's instructive little row in Scotland on the 'lost' William Wallace letter showed. As every Mel Gibson fan knows, the 13th-century Scottish rebel, Sir William Wallace, aka Braveheart, is a Scottish national hero who defeated the cruel English King Edward I at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. In 1869, during another period of romantic nationalist revival, a National Wallace Monument was built overlooking the battlefield in Stirlingshire to commemorate Scotland's hero. Since the Hollywood Braveheart movie, the monument has become a renewed shrine to nationalist devotion, with annual attendances tripling from just 55,000 in 1994 to 184,000 in 1996, after the Australian Mel Gibson donned his Wallace war kilt. The movie was riddled with historical impossibilities, but none of that mattered. So little is actually known about the historical figure of Wallace that there is no real truth to argue over. The most celebrated so-called contemporaneous account of his deeds, by Blind Harry, was gathered a century-and-a-half after Wallace's execution in London in 1305. Wallace is a figure of myth, a focus for national legend. Even the National Wallace Monument is a grotesque Victorian piece of fakery: an obelisk whose prize exhibit - the Wallace Sword - is a 15th-century fake that has since in turn been augmented by a 1984 replica of the same fake. Truth and lies are interchangeable when it comes to national myths. Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell that to the curator of the new £54 million Museum of Scotland, which opened in Edinburgh last December. Unable to locate any artefacts about Wallace, the museum staff did not include Wallace in the National Collection. It was hardly a national crime, but it became so a few days later when a Scottish newspaper suddenly 'rediscovered' a letter by Wallace in a German archive. And then all nationalist hell broke loose. Why had no effort been made to retrieve this national treasure, demanded an allegedly angry Alex Salmond as the full fury of Scottish tabloid outrage descended on the poor curators' heads. 'For centuries, members of the establishment have been attempting to eradicate all traces of Wallace from Scottish history - people in Scotland are no longer prepared to accept this persecution of Scotland's greatest national hero,' said Salmond, who has often claimed that tales told to him by his grandfather about Blind Harry were the inspiration for his own nationalism. Of course, the Wallace letter was never lost in the first place, but when staff from Edinburgh University's Scottish History Department wrote to the Scotsman newspaper group pointing this out, their letter was never printed. It is also hard to see how Salmond's claim of a centuries-long conspiracy to persecute Wallace is anything other than an ugly twisting of banal facts to invoke some latent sense of historical grievance. A chastened museum director, Mark Jones, duly begged his German counterparts for the Wallace letter, written in Latin, and Scotland's national honour was assuaged with a temporary inter-museum loan. But the row over the Wallace letter is an ominous sign of how anything - past, present or future - can be manipulated for a nationalist agenda. Ironically, according to Edinburgh University's Scottish history expert on Wallace, Dr Graeme Morton, Wallace was used in the 19th century as a symbol in defence of the Union. His fight allowed Scotland to join the Union as an equal. 'Wallace is ideal myth material because we really do not know very much about him. Myth is powerful when there is some truth, but not too much. You can use Wallace any way you want: as proletarian hero, as outlaw, as romantic hero, as a martyr,' says Morton. 'Myth is telling us who we were in the past, who we are in the present, and who we could possibly be in the future, as a nation.' I still speak with a Scottish accent and still go to Scotland. But I have lived among English people, and others, for most of my adult life. Ironically, the English are either indifferent or actually discriminatory in favour of Scots and Scotland. In England, to describe something as Scottish is generally to suggest something positive, interesting, individualistic. But the reverse is still true in Scotland. The word 'English' in Scotland is automatically derogatory. 'He is English' still connotes self-centred, superficial, arrogant. Of course, Scotland is different now, says the SNP, and it has a few organisations to prove it: Asians For Independence and New Scots (the English) For Scotland. Salmond goes out of his way to denounce the occasional eruptions of anti-English prejudice that result in racist graffiti and attacks on English families. But even the SNP is at a loss to describe precisely what it is giving expression to - other than un-Englishness. When you press it to define Scottishness, it reaches for the cliche dictionary and talks about 'democratic instincts' or 'sense of community'. Even the fundamental basis of the SNP's economic policy - joining the European Union as an independent state - one feels is grounded more in a desperate desire to flee the English pound than in a positive endorsement of the Frankfurt Euro. Nor do you really get much sense of the SNP as a political party. It is still a nationalist movement of different voices, united only by a vague dream. But all that willbegin to end on May 6, when 'Scottishness' will become a creed, a self-referential political ideology, its mutterings recorded in a Scottish Hansard and pored over for significance. There are many wonderful things about Scotland: the Highlands are beautiful, Edinburgh is magnificent, Glasgow art is great. But they are all individual things now. The enjoyment of them is not going to be enhanced by border controls and/or a Scottish passport to go with them. What drove me, and hundreds of thousands of Scots like me, out of Scotland were the very values that will be legitimised by the Scottish Parliament: the smallness of the stage, the parochialism, the turning inwards, the mono-cultural definition of Scotland as a working-class country, the denunciation of museum directors, the denial of ways of being outside the tight, familial Protestant/Catholic matrix, the forced collectivity rather than individual freedom. Perhaps the greatest value of the Union has been its containment, its sapping, of nationalism. A 'British nationalist' is an oxymoron or a fascist. That is not a bad achievement for a nation state. Unlike other states, we do not feel the need to have our children salute the national flag every morning, to stick flag-poles in our private gardens, and to play our tribal tune at the end of the night. We do not need to remind ourselves who we are, enforce our identity upon ourselves we just are vaguely British. But will it be the same in Scotland in ten years' time? What is Scottishness? No one, as yet, has the answer. I hope, as a Scot, that it is something more than the bundle of myths and hatred that I grew up with. I wish we had no need for it at all. In The Barrenness Of Home, the poet Francis Gallagher ends with a wonderful line denying nationalism: 'My country is me I am my people and my loyalty/is to/my instinctive intelligence that tells me all this/Scottish stuff is pure shit.'"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"theobserver/1999/apr/25/featuresreview.review9","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-25T03:25:42Z","webTitle":"Peter and the wolves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/apr/25/featuresreview.review9","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/apr/25/featuresreview.review9","fields":{"headline":"Peter and the wolves","bodyText":"Mandelson: The Biography by Donald Macintyre, HarperCollins £19.99, pp486, Observer price £16.99 (Tel: 0500 500 171) The dirty secret of modern politics is hidden not because it is criminal or shameful but because it is so achingly depressing. Opinion pollsters, focus groups, Philip Goulds, Alastair Campbells, rapid rebutters and message masseurs and masseuses were sent to seduce the voters at a cost of £65 million in the 1997 election campaign because, they claimed, they knew what the public wanted. The turnout was the lowest since democracy came to Britain. The working class and the poor, attacked by all parties with varying degrees of sourness, decided, quite sensibly, to stay at home. The Clinton strategy of moving ever further to the populist right delivered power, but not support, to the élite. Only the 1935 election compares, and there was a national government in office then and little point in voting. If mass apathy undermines the stated purpose of political operators - and if you think 1997 was bad just wait until you see the effect of New Labour's stunts in Wales on the turnout in the assembly elections next month - it also presents a crisis for my trade. Professional political journalists report on professional politicians. There are hundreds of us in the lobbies of Westminster, offices of Fleet Street and television and radio studios of Millbank. Like the politicians we cover, we have our own pollsters and focus groups and pride ourselves on our slick ability to make power 'relevant'. The failure to persuade almost 30 per cent of the population to vote in what was alleged to be the most important election for 18 years was as much ours as theirs, which is why no one talks about it. Donald Macintyre has produced this year's second biography of Peter Mandelson, a political tactician both friends and enemies describe as a 'genius'. Macintyre is a political commentator on the Independent and a professional in the worst and best senses of the word. He writes from the heart of the New Labour consensus, but does not make the unprofessional acknowledgement that he has an ideology which may need explaining and defending. Fortunately, he writes very well. Most books from Westminster are a collection of cuttings stuck together in such haste you can smell the Pritt as you turn the pages. Macintyre has taken his time, and it shows. He avoids cliché and, although he will never make it into a Dictionary of Political Quotations, delivers a structured narrative in a fluent style. His facility is essential because otherwise this book would seem like the work of a man on the edge of madness. Macintyre is an obsessive fact collector. The interesting and the banal, the hilarious and the glum, are bound between his covers and unwary readers have little sense of why he wants us to know X and what point is served by presenting three pages on Y. Any fact, however spurious, is preferred over any insight, however true, as Gore Vidal nearly said. As I read, I imagined him taking his collection to the Antiques Road Show and the experts saying: 'Well, Donald, we're sorry, but that chapter on Peter Mandelson's winning of the Labour nomination in Hartlepool is pretty much worthless. There just isn't a market for hundreds of sentences on the lines of \"Mrs Mean invited a cluster of about 40 movers and shakers in Hartlepool Labour, including her husband Jimmy's friend Bill Tindall who held the engineers vote and different things, to a buffet in her conservatory\" unless you are illuminating a wider argument. 'But this, my lucky fellow, is gorgeous. This moment when the Bishop of Oxford denounces the Tories' Demon Eyes campaign against Blair as satanic after Mandelson had instructed his minions to \"Get me a fucking bishop!\". The punters will pay a lot for that - particularly if they can see the Rt Rev Richard Harries's face when he reads it.' Part of the problem is that Macintyre is immersed in the good-chappery of Westminster and does not seem to realise how esoteric his world is to outsiders. We are told, for example, that the BBC's political correspondent John Sopel had a 'lengthy froideur' with 'his old friend and golfing partner' Tim Allan, a Blair aide. The froideur is, he adds with relief, 'now at an end'. The Times runs a sensational headline on Labour's European policy, but Philip Webster, its political correspondent, was not to blame, Macintyre hastily assures us, because he produced 'a more carefully calibrated story beneath it'. Mr Macintyre is a pundit who need never lunch alone. Although he says this is not an authorised biography, it was written with the cooperation of Mandelson and can be seen as a riposte from the Right to Paul Routledge's very unauthorised life which unearthed the Robinson loan. Routledge indirectly forced Mandelson's resignation, but the value of Macintyre's work still stands. His rival supplied him with a conclusion you feel he needed and Macintyre has some interesting new facts in his hoard. The best are those that have received most attention, the 'love letters' between Mandelson, Brown and Blair. For once Fleet Street has not exaggerated. Gordon wants 'to kill me,' cries a Mandelson who storms out of rooms slamming doors. 'Why oh why can't my two best people get on?' wails a Prime Minister, who knows nothing of the thin line between love and hate and sounds disconcertingly like Paul Johnson. All ends happily. Gordon and Peter fight 'like scorpions in a bottle' and then kiss and make up after Mandelson's fall. Blair compares the feud to a classic tragedy, and so does Macintyre. But in great tragedy the audience feels that the battles of the mighty affect the humble. Lear's subjects suffer as the kingdom is reduced to anarchy; ordinary Danes realise that something is rotten. The ultimate difficulty with Macintyre and so many of his colleagues is that they do not connect. Macintyre will produce every detail of the manoeuvres which led to New Labour's decision to accept Conservative taxation policy in his court history without displaying any awareness of the consequences for those who rely on state services. Professional politics comes from Bill Clinton's America. Its populist achievement has been to produce a country where the poor don't vote, half the population ignores presidential elections and power is concentrated in the hands of the élite. Political journalists might consider this a dismal future worth opposing. But that would be unprofessional. Peter's pratfall By Kim Bunce On an MP's annual salary of £43,000 he accepted a loan from his friend and the then Paymaster-General, Geoffrey Robinson, of £373,000 to buy a £500,000 house in Notting Hill Gate. 'I wanted to live somewhere with more the feel of a neighbourhood,' he said. After his resignation, Mandelson put 'the house of death', as he refers to it, on the market for £785,000 and moved to his constituency. 'This is a great town with no-nonsense attitudes. It always seems safer and more secure in Hartlepool, where you know who your friends are.' The house, which he uses as his London residence, remains unsold. He has been advised to drop the asking price by £30,000. Before tumbling out of the political world, he observed, while defending the Dome: 'You have to remember that most people lead very humdrum lives.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/apr/25/theobserver.uknews2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-25T03:27:08Z","webTitle":"Brunel's chic little designer number","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/25/theobserver.uknews2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/apr/25/theobserver.uknews2","fields":{"headline":"Brunel's chic little designer number","bodyText":"Friday afternoon, while heading down the motorway from London towards Swindon, it soon becomes apparent that this part of Wiltshire boasts its own relentless April microclimate, with clouds leaking a particularly unpleasant April drizzle. But, none the less, the prospect of up to 50 per cent off top designer labels at the McArthur Glen Designer Outlet, a shopping mall located just off Junction 16 of the M4, beyond a Gordian knot of mini-roundabouts (they like mini-roundabouts in Swindon, but then they were invented here) ensures that the car parks are full and the food courts bustling. 'Holi-da-ay!' squeaks Madonna over the mall sound system, 'Cele-brate!'. To which the only sensible response is haddock, chips, a buttered slice and a pot of tea in Harry Ramsden's. Swindon's branch of McArthur Glen - part American-owned, part by BAA - is a mall of rare beauty: a one-storey mellow brick low-rise with windows and skylights, originally conceived by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the 1840s. Brunel was a man of considerable foresight, but even he may have failed to envision that the gigantic Great Western Railway factory hooters, which once summoned and dismissed 25,000 workers daily, would one day be on display in a branch of Jigsaw. Tomorrow, the Prince of Wales will address 300 delegates a rivet's throw from here. 'He chose the venue,' says McArthur Glen marketing director Iona Carter, 'because it's a project quite close to his heart.' In the speech Charles will speak of the fact that many of Britain's World Heritage sites, designated by UNESCO, are old mills and factories, which puts them on a par with the Pyramids (though I believe you are very hard-pressed to get such a good discount on Le Creuset cookware and Timberland boots at Giza). In his speech the Prince will come out as fan of the kind of regenerated warehouse spaces to be found in, say, London's Clerkenwell and the centre of Manchester; and even more surprisingly, perhaps, he will celebrate 'good contemporary design'. There is quite a bit of good contemporary design in this quietly unassuming mall. But then Swindon was a town built on innovation (and, more particularly, steam), a place where Brunel's GWR maintenance depot repaired Britain's locomotives for the best part of 150 years. By 1986, however, the vast industrial site, owned by Tarmac, was empty, redundant and crumbling and required an enormous leap of faith to be saved, rather than leveled. At which point McArthur Glen MD Joey Kaempfer saw the opportunity to preserve Swindon's industrial legacy alongside the late 20th century's favourite leisure activity, shopping. The mall is just the first phase of a long-term project which will see the whole GWR site transformed. Work is underway on more shops and offices. But there is also the HQ and archive for the Royal Commission on The Historical Sites of Britain and Swindon's millennium project - an interactive museum on the history of steam, scheduled to open in the spring of next year. The Prince's speech claims that he is opposed to 'a theme park Britain . . . a pastiche for the benefit of tourists,' but still, there is an undeniable sense of heritage theme park about the GWR, an inevitable sense of pathos surrounding the isolated bits of brightly-painted, highly-polished redundant heavy machinery enshrined in the mall. I can't help wondering how many of the shoppers are even aware of the Long Shop - right next door to the designer outlets - where just nine former GWR employees still work, restoring old steam trains. To walk into the Long Shop is to step straight back into a scene Brunel would have no trouble recognising, as engineers, Roy Warburton and Viv Franklin turn tools on a lathe. There are plans to build a gallery so that visitors can view the work (I wasn't immune to its grimy industrial charm, but this is a scene that would surely make steam buffs weep), which will turn Viv, Roy and their seven colleagues - taking tea breaks in a little glassed-in canteen or working amid the metallic chaos of piles of train parts - look like performers in a set piece of ye olde Englande heritage theatre. It is worth noting, however, that Viv and Roy are entirely pragmatic about both their work and their dying, specialised skills. They are not, they assure me, steam buffs, and there is no romance: 'At the end of the day this is just our job. We dream about winning the lottery all the time,' admits Roy, laughing. But they cannot entirely hide their pride in the fact that they are still here, and their skills are still needed. Back in the mall it seems wise to take advantage of the 1990s service industry skills that have largely replaced those of Viv and Roy. Inside a shop called The Designers, I succumb to the temptation of a merino wool/silk/cashmere-mix V-neck sweater by N Peal (at an unbeatable £60), after a charmingly persuasive soft sell from 66-year-old part-time assistant, Jasmine Prince ('My husband is called Charles, funnily enough!') Jasmine clearly takes quite as much pride in her work as Viv and Roy do in theirs: 'I should be retired by now, but I just got bored. When this place opened, I simply begged for a job.' I can see why. With its combination of attractive, sympathetically restored industrial buildings with exposed brickwork and skylights, the mall is a seductive, human-scale environment, the antithesis of the anonymous super-mall bunkers. And of course there is Jasper Conran, Donna Karan and Margaret Howell at up to 50 per cent off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/25/labour.labour1997to99","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-25T11:54:41Z","webTitle":"Peter and the wolves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/25/labour.labour1997to99","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/25/labour.labour1997to99","fields":{"headline":"Peter and the wolves","bodyText":"Mandelson: The Biography by Donald Macintyre, HarperCollins £19.99, pp486, Observer price £16.99 (Tel: 0500 500 171) The dirty secret of modern politics is hidden not because it is criminal or shameful but because it is so achingly depressing.

Gordon wants 'to kill me,' cries a Mandelson who storms out of rooms slamming doors. 'Why oh why can't my two best people get on?' wails a Prime Minister, who knows nothing of the thin line between love and hate and sounds disconcertingly like Paul Johnson. All ends happily. Gordon and Peter fight 'like scorpions in a bottle' and then kiss and make up after Mandelson's fall. Blair compares the feud to a classic tragedy, and so does Macintyre. But in great tragedy the audience feels that the battles of the mighty affect the humble. Lear's subjects suffer as the kingdom is reduced to anarchy; ordinary Danes realise that something is rotten. The ultimate difficulty with Macintyre and so many of his colleagues is that they do not connect. Macintyre will produce every detail of the manoeuvres which led to New Labour's decision to accept Conservative taxation policy in his court history without displaying any awareness of the consequences for those who rely on state services. Professional politics comes from Bill Clinton's America. Its populist achievement has been to produce a country where the poor don't vote, half the population ignores presidential elections and power is concentrated in the hands of the élite. Political journalists might consider this a dismal future worth opposing. But that would be unprofessional. Peter's pratfall By Kim Bunce On an MP's annual salary of £43,000 he accepted a loan from his friend and the then Paymaster-General, Geoffrey Robinson, of £373,000 to buy a £500,000 house in Notting Hill Gate. 'I wanted to live somewhere with more the feel of a neighbourhood,' he said. After his resignation, Mandelson put 'the house of death', as he refers to it, on the market for £785,000 and moved to his constituency. 'This is a great town with no-nonsense attitudes. It always seems safer and more secure in Hartlepool, where you know who your friends are.' The house, which he uses as his London residence, remains unsold. He has been advised to drop the asking price by £30,000. Before tumbling out of the political world, he observed, while defending the Dome: 'You have to remember that most people lead very humdrum lives.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/apr/26/1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-26T02:07:08Z","webTitle":"BT buys into Japan Telecom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/apr/26/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/apr/26/1","fields":{"headline":"BT buys into Japan Telecom","bodyText":"British Telecom yesterday ran up the bill for its recent spending spree in Asia to more than £1bn after announcing a deal with its global partner, the American company AT&amp;T, to acquire a 30% stake in Japan Telecom. The £1.2bn deal is the Anglo-American alliance's first significant joint venture since BT and AT&amp;T announced plans to pool their international businesses last year. It is also one of the largest investments to date by a foreign business in a Japanese company. The move fills a glaring gap for BT in the world's second largest telecoms market with a worth of £68bn and, as the home of many global corporations, growing at a rate of 4% a year despite Japan's entrenched recession. The deal, which took six months to broker, also ends many years of speculation that BT would strike an alliance with the former state-owned monopoly NTT. \"Japan is a critical market, as large as France, Germany and the United Kingdom combined, and we were determined to have an economic stake in the country,\" said BT's director of group strategy, Andy Green. \"NTT doesn't see the need for help and once that was clear it was ruled out.\" Japan Telecom is the third biggest player in the market with some 17 million fixed-line customers and turnover of £2bn, putting it behind NTT and KDD. It has six million mobile phone subscribers and BT will take a stake in its bid for a third-generation licence. One executive and one non-executive director from each company will be appointed to Japan Telecom's board. BT and AT&amp;T will each take a 15 per cent stake and are effectively selling Japan Telecom their existing local businesses. The deal, though, has been structured to accommodate local 'cultural sensitivities' with the two initially understood to have been looking for a larger share. The combined shareholding will be managed by a holding company in which BT has a 20% share and AT&amp;T 10%, reflecting the amount each is investing. BT is injecting £620m in cash and accepting around £160m for its existing Japanese operation which has been going since 1985, booking a profit of £80m. AT&amp;T is investing £400m. The arcane nature of the deal keeps BT's stake below that of the biggest shareholder, Japan Railway, which owns 15.1 per cent. Whether or not BT's caution is justified could become clear in Cable &amp; Wireless's battle with NTT for control of another Japanese firm, IDC, which has taken on immense political implications. BT has been buying assets aggressively in Asia and in the past six months alone has taken stakes in SmarTone in Hong Kong, LG Telecom in South Korea and Binariang in Malaysia. \"The largest growth in telecoms is set to come in Asia as the economic gloom lifts and those who are there first will benefit most,\" said Richard Slogrove, managing director of BT Asia Pacific. Critics, however, have questioned BT's strategy of taking minority stakes at a time when others such as Vodafone and C&amp;W are divesting investments they are unable to build to controlling stakes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/apr/26/balkans10","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-26T17:04:05Z","webTitle":"26 April: More ethnic cleansing as the last Danube bridge is destroyed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/26/balkans10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/26/balkans10","fields":{"headline":"26 April: More ethnic cleansing as the last Danube bridge is destroyed","bodyText":"What was done \u0095 Nato confirmed that it had hit the last remaining bridge over the Danube at the Serbian city of Novi Sad during the 33rd night of its campaign against Yugoslavia. \u0095 Nato also hit a fuel depot; a railway bridge and a military airfield in Yugoslavia, General Sir Charles Guthrie reported at the Ministry of Defence briefing. In Kosovo tanks, trucks, and electronic warfare site and artillery positions were attacked. \u0095 But Yugoslav forces took advantage of the bad weather - which hampered Nato air strikes - to mount fresh counter-insurgency operations against the Kosovo Liberation Army. There had also been further ethnic cleansing and looting by the Serb paramilitaries, Nato military spokesman Colonel Konrad Freytag reported. \u0095 The US government welcomed news from the Red Cross that the three US soldiers held in Serbia are in good condition. \u0095 The International Committee of the Red Cross is working on securing the release of German journalist Hans-Peter Schnitzler from the SAT-1 television network held in Yugoslavia on charges of spying, the German Foreign Ministry has said. What was said Tony Blair The Prime Minister warned today that there would be no compromise in Nato's demands on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and that air strikes would be intensified. In a Commons statement after the Nato summit in Washington, Mr Blair said the number of Nato aircraft and targets would be \"expanded\" and economic measures against Belgrade would be stepped up. \"It is our collective task now to make that victory, of justice over evil, a reality for Kosovo's long-suffering people.\" Jack Straw The Home Secretary stressed that Kosovo refugees which arrived in Britain yesterday would be returned to their homes as soon as it was safe for them to do so. But he declared: \"We have always made it clear that the United Kingdom stands ready to receive some thousands of refugees from the region on criteria agreed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\" General Klaus Naumann The head of Nato's military arm, German General Klaus Naumann, acknowledged that there may be a flaw in Nato's conviction that its air campaign can bring down Milosevic. \"Our flaw may be that we think he has at least a little bit of responsibility for his country,\" Naumann said. He said Nato has assumed that Milosevic would not be willing to allow his country to be pounded into rubble. George Robertson The Defence Secretary ruled out a \"wholesale invasion\" of Kosovo but said Nato was re-examining how ground troops could be used once the bombing of Yugoslavia ends. \"There is no intention to mount a wholesale, organised, opposed invasion of Kosovo,\" he told this morning's Ministry of Defence briefing. \"But it is sensible to re-examine our existing plans for a ground deployment in the light of changing circumstances in the region.\" William Hague Tory Leader William Hague said his party would continue to support the alliance's action over Kosovo: \"It is vital that Nato finishes what it has started.\" The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Reports that women and children are being held as human shield hostages to stop Nato bombing ammunition dumps in Kosovo have \"substantial foundation\", UNHCR Spokesman Kris Janowski said. \"Several reported that in one three-storey building in Prizren the first storey was being used to store ammunition for troops, the second storey was being used as living quarters for the military and the third and highest floor was full of young hostages, who would obviously be the first victims in any air strike.\" \"Several people came from Prizren, and some of their stories suggested that the human shield reports have substantial foundation,\" he added. Cornelio Sommaruga The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross expressed his \"serious concern, because of these humanitarian consequences, both direct and indirect, for the civilian population\" of Yugoslavia.

First, he was forced to announce appalling financial figures for the Magic Kingdom which saw a 30 per cent fall in second quarter profits. Then he had to hear himself described in court as a man who concocted 'untrue' stories'. While Wall Street may get over the figures, the court case starring himself and his former studio boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg, can only heap further embarrassment on a man who last year earned nearly $6m. The grudge match has been breathlessly anticipated in Hollywood and immediately lived up to its billing when lawyers for the two began trading insults and accusations in a Los Angeles court. Disney's Lou Meisinger accused Mr Katzenberg of setting 'a new standard for arrogance and greed in an industry that already has a high mark in this area.' Bert Fields, one of the fiercest lawyers in Hollywood, accused Mr Eisner of 'personal animosity' and of coming up with a story that was 'patently untrue'. The dispute is over an estimated $250m Mr Katzenberg claims as his promised 2 per cent bonus on his abrupt dismissal from Disney in 1994. Mr Katzenberg spent 10 years at Disney and was a former friend and colleague of Mr Eisner at Paramount. The two fell out when Mr Eisner declined to promote him to No 2 at Disney after the accidental death of the man in that position. Mr Meisinger derided Mr Katzenberg for posing as a hapless victim when he was notorious as a hard charging negotiator with an army of lawyers and accountants working on his compensation claim. He reminded the plaintiff that he earned $100m from Disney, had stock options, and owned a $5m beach house. Eisner's mood would not have been improved by Disney's poor financial performance, which was mainly due to weaker video sales and continued ratings decline at its ABC television network. 'We are definitely not satisfied with our performance,' he said. 'We are taking a number of steps, including an across the board assessment of our cost structure.' Disney said profit for the quarter to March 31 fell to $269m from $384m a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.1 per cent to $5.5bn. The creative content division saw a 52 per cent fall in operating income to $163m from $339m because of slower video sales. The company said its poor first half would not be overcome by any improvements in the second half."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/apr/30/features11.g22","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-30T00:13:10Z","webTitle":"And Jane makes three","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/30/features11.g22","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/apr/30/features11.g22","fields":{"headline":"And Jane makes three","bodyText":"Being a football reporter was to do with looking for my father. When I was little, he was away a lot. He was a sentence, uttered as he left with his briefcase: 'I'll be at the Imperial, Newcastle upon Tyne.' This, along with the George at Alfreton, and dozens of other modestly comfortable hotels in the North and Midlands, was where he based himself while doing business. His company traded in light plant: blocks and tackle, pit props, jacks. I re-created my father in my imagination, taking myself off to the football towns and cities in whose pubs and working men's clubs this navy-suited, maroon-tied, apple-cheeked god had smoked Players Navy Cut, eaten pickled onions and told risqué jokes with beefy men from the Coal Board and colliery workers. When I was four I sat on the carpet with him, helping to pack Christmas boxes for these men whose value ranged from a gift pack of 50 cigarettes to a rough wooden crate of Scotch. Even now I can be made happy and nostalgic by the smell of tobacco and wood shavings. Later, as he became richer and more important, I thought he grew away from us. The widening space between him and us was literally expressed in our big new house, where we moved when I was six years old: the office on the first floor where he shuffled papers at his desk. Sometimes I was sent up as an emissary, an object dangled in front of him to catch his attention, a glove puppet, a carrot on a string. I stood at his shoulder waiting for him to look up from his papers, at which I repeated in a monotone what mum had told me to say. When my voiceover finished he would say, 'Ah yes. Very good. Rightio.' I'd stand there for a bit and then drift off downstairs again. Actually, I don't suppose my parents' marriage was any worse than a lot of couples'. It certainly lasted a long time. They married in 1937 and their walk together only ended with my father's death in 1996. They raised two children, moved house three times, built up a business empire which at its height had dad's name emblazoned on the sides of several large lorries thundering the length and breadth of the kingdom. He was also a big wheel in local Conservative politics and in his pomp was pictured in many Gazettes, Independents and Advertisers of the day. He shared certain attributes with a man of the cloth: the delight in helping people, a tendency to be the focus of interest of the widowed, the divorced and the never married. And then there was Jane: a magnificent divorced redhead. They embarked on an interestingly triangular friendship which even now I don't think I've quite got to grips with. Mum liked Jane very much, and so did I - she was witty, cultivated and easygoing - and dad liked her best of all. She holidayed with us and we shared Christmas, as well as many ordinary family evenings. She became a director of Dad's company. During my teens, when mum and I were having all our fights, she was my confidante and source of wisdom. She was a lot taller than all of us, and seemed to spread herself over us like an oak. She was always there. When she wasn't, everyone twiddled their thumbs a bit and shut themselves away in rooms. Two years after dad's death, mum told me, 'There was a lot of talk about how dad was carrying on with Jane.' I thought for the moment of the discrepancy in size, and the rectitude of the parties concerned, and said, 'Unimaginable, I would have thought.' Mum nodded, then said, 'I only doubted him the once.' She had been on one of her trips to Australia, where my big sister was living at the time. On her return, dad and Jane met her at Heathrow. Later, a credit card bill dropped on our doormat. It was in mum's name: a hotel bill for two people, dated the night before she arrived home. Into dad's business empire in Leyton marched mum, and threw the bill onto his desk. 'I think you owe me an explanation for this,' she said. 'Of course,' said mum, 'he came up with all sorts of explanations - they'd gone to a function in town and decided to stay overnight there rather than drive home, then all the way back to Heathrow in the morning - and there were separate rooms. He tried to make it up to me for a long time. I gave him the benefit of the doubt in the end. What do you think?' I said I thought in the circumstances I would have done as she did, though for a while would probably have withdrawn certain privileges. Her eyes gleamed. 'Oh - like sex.' Actually, I hadn't meant sex so much as shepherd's pie and other favourite dinners. I wasn't sure what this said about my marriage. We were quiet for a while and then she said, 'But he was a dear.' Even as they grew old and as close of play approached, they were still a threesome, feet up in the living room, a plate of ham sandwiches on the table, playing Scrabble and collaborating on the Telegraph crossword. The last time I saw Jane was on a January day a year after my youngest son was born. When it was time for us to leave, mum and dad walked down the drive to see us out but for the first time Jane did not. Suddenly I saw her at the window. The light played tricks; her face was illuminated, the room behind her dark. She waved and smiled. I knew right away it was the final goodbye from my older friend and guardian, for whom I felt both huge affection and wistful ambivalence, and that this signified, long after it had physically finished, the end of my childhood. So it turned out; she died three days later. When Mum couldn't get Jane to answer her phone calls, she broke into her flat and found her body. She washed Jane's face and hands and prepared the bed for Jane to lie on. I still think how good and courageous Mum was, and I also feel a quiet triumph on her behalf that she had seen out her usurper. What did I think, really? Well, when I was growing up it was sometimes like being stuck in a gigantic board game, the rules of which I couldn't quite get the hang of, and even now I'm not sure if I've got them right. But I do know that betrayal in a marriage doesn't have to be sexual, or even conscious. My father felt an emotional fellowship for Jane, however he tried to disguise it, however much Jane spread her branches to cover us all. It was the way he'd light up like a bulb when he saw her, and the stubborn inclusion of her in our plans even when my mother would have preferred her not to be there. And I know, too, all about how unbearable it is when the person you want to be yours and yours alone shares out their world between you and someone else. \u0095 Extract from Julie Welch's autobiography Long Distance Information, published by Macmillan on May 7 at £12.99.

He's the man with the Midas touch; the magic man; the force is strong with this one. Considering he's carved out his reputation as a writer - normally the lowest form of pond-life in the shark-pool that is the film industry - the 42-year-old Curtis commands unprecedented respect and power. Statistics speak stridently on his behalf: two of the top three money-makers in British cinema history bear his marque - Four Weddings And A Funeral and Bean, together accounting for $482 million at the global box-office - both as a scriptwriter and executive producer. More significantly, his influence as a creative force in British film and television is strong, and getting stronger. Straight from university, Curtis joined the gag-writing team for Not The Nine O'Clock News, specialising in writing now-legendary songs like I Like Trucking and Nice Video (Shame About The Song). He created Blackadder, one of the key sitcoms of the eighties, which is shortly to be turned into a feature film for display at the Millennium Dome. His first movie, The Tall Guy, transformed Emma Thompson from a minor sketch-show performer into one of the country's leading actresses. Four Weddings delivered Hugh Grant as another bona fide movie star, as well as setting off an avalanche of British film-making in the middle of the nineties. And as the decade closes, he is waiting to find out if his new movie, Notting Hill, starring Hugh Grant, can emulate the success of its predecessor. \"I've just been the luckiest person in films,\" confesses Curtis, ensconced in his studio/office in London's Portobello Road. If nothing else, Curtis's ability to turn his private geography into successful, easy-access movie comedy is unmatched. The antiques store used as the movie location for Hugh Grant's travel-book shop is literally downstairs; 50 yards away, on Westbourne Park Road, is the former Curtis residence, whose blue front door will shortly find cinematic immortality when Notting Hill is finally released. \"If you want to write a movie that's realistic and grounded,\" he explains, \"it's much easier if you can imagine the place - for someone who's not a very pictorial writer like me, at least it gives me confidence if I can visualise the setting.\" He points out of the window at the Portobello Road view: \"The film was written up the street, but it is a coincidence that it was filmed here. Our designer, Stuart Craig, said this stretch of coloured houses was the prettiest aspect of the street; that was why we did it here. It wasn't that I insisted we shoot outside the front door.\" Even if Notting Hill wasn't conceived as a backyard enterprise, it still stands as a love letter to an area of London to which Curtis clearly feels very attached. And while critics will inevitably point out its sociological shortcomings - anybody with a passing knowledge of Notting Hill might notice that one or two black people live there - Notting Hill: The Movie is further evidence of the manner in which Curtis can absorb and assimilate workaday facets of his own experience into his elegantly-structured romantic comedy screenplays. The Tall Guy, for example, was set in another area where Curtis has lived - the north London district of Camden Town (its original title, says Curtis, was Camden Town Boy); Four Weddings, as Curtis readily acknowledges, was loosely inspired by his own frequent attendance at nuptial ceremonies, and the less-than-conventional nature of his relationship with Emma Freud, with whom he has a child but - like Hugh Grant's character - has no reported plans to marry. Indeed, along with Notting Hill, Curtis has constructed a trilogy of movies on a near-identical template that have proved enormously influential on the direction that British film-making has taken in the nineties. \"I didn't realise they were the same until I finished each of them,\" he reflects. \"I never consciously set out thinking: 'That was good, let's do that again.' But I suppose they were all about the subject of finding true love; and that's something I'm not going to write about again. Because I've now been happily married, as it were, for eight years, and I'm finding it quite hard to remember what it's like looking for a girlfriend.\" \"Four Weddings,\" Curtis continues, \"was a very lucky construction. What I'd always found frustrating in films is that you often saw a really interesting scene between two lovers; then it cuts to two weeks later and you don't know what they've been doing. So I tried to construct something where you see pretty well every minute they spent together; and because it was so broken up by the weddings, it was easy for me to use my sketch-writing and sitcom skills.\" It's those keyboard skills - honed through Not The Nine O'Clock News, Blackadder, and currently The Vicar Of Dibley - that form the bedrock of Curtis's career, and he's happy to elaborate on the tortuous process of writing and re-writing that resulted in the most studiedly casual of movies. \"Writing has always been just a slow, private process; Notting Hill was different to my previous scripts in that it took me a lot longer to get it right-ish. Four Weddings was originally called Four Weddings And A Honeymoon, and in my imagination was going to finish off with a very silly sequence a bit like 10 - it was going to be her honeymoon, and him following her on her honeymoon. My friend Helen Fielding [author of Bridget Jones' Diary] told me it was time I grew up and tried to get some profundity in my work, so we put in a funeral instead. \"Notting Hill, by contrast, was a completely different film after I'd worked on it for a year. Originally it was a story about a guy choosing whether to go out with the most famous girl in the world, or to go out with the girl who worked in the record store opposite. But as I wrote it, I realised I didn't have the heart to write two characters I really cared about, and then dismiss one of them and say, that person's not worth marrying. I couldn't bear it. So I turned the girl running the record store into the character who is Hugh Grant's sister. That would have been an interesting competition, as you can imagine, between Emma Chambers and Julia Roberts. I spent six months perfecting that film, before I scrapped it.\" Curtis's basic notion, though, that a love story based around the fantasy notion of bringing the world's biggest star to a humdrum dinner party has remained. Moreover, Notting Hill clearly reflects the aftermath of Four Weddings's enormous success: an appreciation of the nature and workings of celebrity (a thoroughly modish topic in itself). \"The fame thing that Notting Hill is about is, in a way, to do with the long-term observation of my friends in comedy and the extra pressure that's been on them. It's not in a dramatic movie star way, but a lot of the people I knew before they were famous are now famous. It slightly changes the way they think about things. Being self-conscious in the street is really the main thing, walking with their heads bowed.\" This, incidentally, is an issue that Curtis is unlikely to face personally; he's kept himself determinedly anonymous all the way along the line. \"Julia [Roberts] thought that generally the movie made a bit too much of a fuss about fame,\" he admits. \"But that's why she felt comfortable playing it - she didn't feel the movie was autobiographical; for her, fame is less of a burden than the movie portrays. She actually pointed out that while in a couple of scenes I wanted her to be wearing dark glasses, she wouldn't wear them in reality. She said that dark glasses draw attention to you, rather than distract it.\" Fortunately, Curtis's lynx-eyed observation of the media circus surrounding international movie stars meshes well with his more typical ordinary-joe approach to the way that Hollywood-inspired fantasy infects even the most everyday imaginations. \"Again, Notting Hill used to start with a discussion of which movie stars the five people round the table would most like to sleep with. I was trying to show the sort of massive, intimate disrespect that we have for famous people.\" What has remained in the movie is a scene where Roberts, playing movie star Anna Scott, gets to answer back to a restaurant tableful of business types who are loudly discussing what they'd like to do to her. As an act of cinematic wish-fulfilment in reverse, the delighted expression on Roberts's face tells its own story. Three-quarters of Curtis's feature-film output, then, has demonstrated his ability at nudging those tender spots that make the national - even global - imagination go all dewy-eyed and sensitive. The other quarter, ie the Rowan Atkinson vehicle Bean, is a different story. Although it's a hugely successful movie, it's one that's slipped by the kind of cinematic myth-making that's already put films like Shakespeare In Love, The English Patient and Trainspotting into the British cinema hall of fame. Bean (and Tall Guy) director Mel Smith has frequently railed against what he perceives as an innate snobbery against the movie by the British film establishment, after it failed to score even a single Bafta nomination. Curtis, as ever when it comes to commenting on anything involving a friend, is circumspect: \"All I'll say is that I was very glad to do Bean because I love silly films, and I could feel my capacity for writing that sort of film drifting away with middle age. I thought Bean would be my last opportunity to write a stupid funny film as opposed to a mature romance.\" The hostile critical reaction levelled at Bean shows that Curtis is far from inured to critical scorn - he permits himself a moan on the subject of the Dawn French sitcom The Vicar Of Dibley, which Curtis originally launched into as a vehicle for his views on the ordination of women clerics. \"The thing is, over the years, you receive a lot of bad reviews. Not The Nine O'Clock News got panned for two seasons before the tide turned; a lot of people hated Blackadder; and even now reviewers regularly refer to The Vicar Of Dibley as 'unfunny'. I don't really understand why, because I think it's perfectly good. If you don't get praise for something, that's about par for the course.\" What emerges, though, is that underneath the urbanity, Curtis is a ferociously focused operator, aware of his limitations (\"I'm not a pictorial writer\" he repeats) and perfectly attuned to the collaborative demands of film and TV production. One of his major assets is that he's maintained a position at the centre of a web of high-profile partnerships that can sustain his work across a variety of formats. Old Not The Nine O'Clock News colleagues Mel Smith and Rowan Atkinson feature heavily, as do behind-the-scenes fixers like Working Title co-founder Tim Bevan (who's bankrolled all of Curtis's movies) and Four Weddings/Notting Hill producer Duncan Kenworthy. Key, of course, was the unearthing of Hugh Grant as the Curtis alter ego (\"it was jolly convenient he turned up\") for Four Weddings; remarkably, however, the Notting Hill team at one point considered looking elsewhere for a lead actor. \"I am a very careful collaborator,\" explains Curtis, \"and I think that if you work with a person once and it works, it's slightly crazy not to work with them again. I felt that very strongly with Hugh. But there was a tiny question mark in our minds about casting him in the movie - because you're claiming your movie is about a very famous girl and a total nonentity, it's a bit tricky if she walks in and the total nonentity is Hugh Grant. There was an argument that we should try and find someone unknown, but in the end Hugh had done Four Weddings so perfectly, and people are willing to suspend their disbelief with him, we were in favour of repeating a really, really good working relationship. I think Hugh is particularly lovely in this film, because he's a bit bashed about; he's clearly older and sadder than he was last time.\" Curtis, by contrast, may be older, but he's proved himself considerably wiser. He's generous in his appraisal of Four Weddings's astonishing success - \"You can't underestimate the effect of Hugh in that movie; a really new movie star is a gorgeous thing when it happens\" - and sensitive to his own fallibilities - \"the moment you hand a script over to someone, you know what's wrong with it.\" Most of all, however, he's already prepared himself against the over- confidence that his meteoric success often breeds. \"It's meant to be the danger, that people stop being critical. I think it affects people who write novels, when there's no production process, as it were; but because a director knows he's eventually going to have to tell some actor to do a scene, he won't do it unless it's good. So I think - I hope - I didn't get away with more than usual. More than last time, anyway.\" ?

It was designed by Labour to lock Scotland into the Union and consign nationalist aspirations to the archives. But a harsher reality keeps intruding. As the Scottish National Party made a late recovery in a campaign that had seemed beyond repair, Tony Blair went on the stump, Gordon Brown hit the phone to brief journalists and Robin Cook paraded a group of Kosovan refugees in Glasgow. On Friday, Tony Blair launched his most sustained attack yet on the SNP, at a charity lunch in Glasgow. Just yards away sat his target, Nationalist leader Alex Salmond, sharing the top table. As Blair warned that he would not allow Scotland to walk away from the United Kingdom with a 'debt-free inheritance', and claimed that the SNP's economic plans 'cannot be taken seriously', Salmond held up a card bearing the word 'Bluff', a souvenir of his recent appearance on the BBC's Call My Bluff. It was a witty reminder that the Nationalists are back in business after a white-knuckle campaign. The party has played on discontent among Labour's core supporters, including teachers and local government workers, promising better public services rather than tax cuts and challenging the private finance initiative. But SNP fortunes began slipping after the party answered Brown's Budget with a pledge to forgo its tax cut. One Labour MP derided the spending plans as 'the longest in history'. Salmond then denounced Nato's war against Serbia as 'unpardonable folly'. Robin Cook described him as 'the toast of Belgrade' and the campaign was transformed into a khaki election. Cook returned to the fray yesterday, drafting in Kosovan exiles from the north of England for a press conference. The message was clear: If you are against the rape and murder of helpless Kosovans, vote Labour. If not, vote SNP. The SNP's lowest point came on 'Black Thursday' - 22 April. A Herald poll showed them 20 per cent behind Labour, which looked set for an overall majority. The Nationalists scrapped their daily press conferences and returned to old-fashioned 'stump politics'. The campaign switched its focus to 'swing voters', and gave new emphasis to the party's demands for a referendum on independence in the first term of the new Parliament. The 'world's most famous Scotsman', Sean Connery, arrived to promote a movie and give a lecture to an invited audience. He denounced the Scottish media and spoke of his long-held belief in Scottish independence. He also recorded a party political broadcast, to be shown tomorrow. New polls show the SNP coming back. Labour can expect to have the biggest block of seats in the 129-member Parliament, but not necessarily an outright majority. The SNP believes it could still win by a nose, according to a senior party source. 'If the election was tomorrow, we would win 44 or 45 seats, but things are moving and it's just a question of whether it moves fast enough,' said the source. 'It could be 51 SNP seats to Labour's 50. That's more than possible.' Labour's campaign has been fronted by Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar, who will be First Minister in a Labour administration, but masterminded by Gordon Brown and his aide, Douglas Alexander. The party's reliance on private finance to fund commitments for more schools and hospitals has led to growing internal dissent. The Liberal Democrats have had a quiet campaign, targeting their Westminster seats and second votes of Labour voters in the west of Scotland. The price of a coalition with Labour could be higher education spending throughout Britain. Their Scottish leader, Jim Wallace, says they will not form a coalition with the SNP if a condition is an independence referendum. Their campaign has been unexpectedly overshadowed by the Conservatives, under their feisty Scottish leader David McLetchie. The Tories have scored some hits on rural issues, where fuel tax is a hot topic. They have called for an end to the ban on beef on the bone and, like the Lib Dems and the SNP, are demanding the abolition of tuition fees. But McLetchie says his party would support Labour in any confidence vote, to prevent a referendum on independence. The Trotskyite Scottish Socialist Party has high hopes of a regional list seat in Glasgow, while the independent most likely to win a seat is Labour rebel Denis Canavan, MP for Falkirk West. For Labour, the irony is that, had the election been fought under Westminster's first-past-the-post system, it could have been plain sailing. The second vote - for a candidate from a party list or for an independent - has turned out to be the party's weak point. Donald Dewar likes to say that the voting system is an unusual example of political generosity. But he can take comfort from the fact that the Parliament, no matter what its precise composition, will contain a solid pro-Union alliance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/may/03/1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-03T02:30:41Z","webTitle":"Home news in brief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/03/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/may/03/1","fields":{"headline":"Home news in brief","bodyText":"Govan yard may get Cuban order Hope was given yesterday to Kvaerner Govan workers when the trade minister, Brian Wilson, said he had passed information about an order for 12 bulk carriers for a Cuban company to a task force trying to save 1,200 jobs under threat at the Scottish shipyard.

Barely a month after Tony Blair emerged, bleary-eyed, from the Berlin European Council to announce that the United Kingdom rebate was safe, the shine has gone from the European Union budget deal. The main advantage of the agreement was that it forestalled the prospect of EU finances plunging into chaos later this year. But the latest soundings from the European parliament suggest that it may reject the package in a vote on May 6; and in most other respects, the settlement is an example of EU deal-making at its worst. Meaningful reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has been avoided and little effort has gone into reshaping the budget for the twin demands of European monetary union and enlargement. Indeed, Cap reform will have the perverse effect of raising its cost, so that by 2006, Cap spending will be higher than it is today and still absorb 46% of the budget. Instead, the main objective of the EU leaders seems to have been to deal with the imbalances in net contributions to the budget. These had, undoubtedly, become unsustainable. France Denmark and Italy plainly contribute too little; the UK (even with the rebate) is slightly hard done by while the Germans, the Dutch, the Austrians and the Swedes are paying too much. These four countries had their demands for UK-style rebates rejected, but their net contributions will fall for three reasons. First, the 'gang of four' will, in future, only have to pay 25% of their ex-ante share of the UK rebate. On the 1998 figures, the result would be France paying an extra 263m per annum, Italy 216m, while Germany saves 411m. It is easy to see why Messrs Chirac and Jospin were so tetchy about the rebate continuing. Second, the four will benefit from specific payments under the regional aid budget. None of these special payments is based on any discernible principle. Thus, 'to take account of the particular characteristics of labour market participation in the Netherlands, an additional amount of 500 million is allocated to Objective 3'. We can only speculate on what these unique Dutch labour market characteristics might be. Third, changes in the method of financing the EU (less from customs duties and vat; more from the gnp-related 'fourth' resource) favour the four. This attempt simultaneously to rebalance net contributions while providing a workable budget for the EU confuses objectives and falls into the trap of satisfying neither. The rationale for EU spending is that there are tasks that are best fulfilled by the EU level. EU regional assistance is justified by the commitment in the treaty to pursue 'cohesion' as an aim. When, instead, payments under the structural funds are used to lower the contributions of countries that complain about their net payments, the principles go out of the window and the pork barrel comes in. What, then, are the alternatives? Raising money from national exchequers only to return some of it with strings attached (the structural funds) or in a way that seriously distorts the market (the Cap) is daft. There might as well just be straight cash transfers from richer to poorer member states in the same way as the better-off Lander in Germany cough up for poorer ones. The manifest absurdities of the Cap are allowed to continue partly because correcting them would disturb the balance of who pays for Europe. A reasonable case can, nevertheless, be made for making the EU level responsible for agricultural policy. Similarly, in an integrated economic space such as the EU, policies which give a boost to less competitive regions are in the common interest and ought, logically, to be centrally administered. There are, therefore, good reasons for clarifying what we want the EU to do and funding it accordingly. Berlin failed to do that and the unsatisfactory outcome means that Agenda 2000 will have to be succeeded by Agenda 2002 or 2003 if enlargement is to proceed. As usual, our political leaders have postponed a decision until it is urgent.

They occupied Beijing in February and crossed the Yangtze on rafts and pontoons in late April, way ahead of their timetable. On October 1 Mao proclaimed the People's Republic in Tiananmen Square: only Taiwan and Tibet remained to be 'liberated'. Fifty years later the journey south can be made on the high-speed railway completed in 1997 - 1,500 miles in 30 hours. It is a journey in time as well as space. Beijing is the place to probe China's past. The capital still guards many secrets from the Mao years- and from the post-Mao tragedy of the 1989 Beijing massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators. The vast country beyond, through the eastern provinces and across the middle reaches of the Yangtze, into the mountains of the south, is China's inescapable present. Millions of peasants living within a few miles of the railway track have gained very little from the era of economic reforms that came after Mao, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping. The journey ends in Shenzhen on the Hong Kong border, a village turned city in less than 20 years with an average of one credit card for every man, woman and child. Most Chinese believe that Shenzhen is the face of their country's future. But will the unquiet shadows of history, and the protests from the poor who have been left behind, produce a darker outcome for the next century? On Bejiing's Dongdan Street, half a mile from Tiananmen Square, hard-hatted workers building the huge Oriental Plaza complex (owned by the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing) take a lunchbreak with bowls of cheap food. They squat beneath a billboard that proclaims, 'Raise high the great flag of Deng Xiaoping Theory; Open up and Modernise the Capital for the New Century.' There are three shifts working night and day: the complex must be complete by October 1. Soon only a lozenge-shaped wedge of old Beijing, enclosing the Imperial City, will survive. The rest will be highrise towers and tinted blue glass. In 1949 there were still camel caravans. Even 20 years ago, peasant carts trotted down the Avenue of Everlasting Peace. In the new century, once the migrant workers have gone, there will be no reminders in central Beijing of the rural beyond. Dongdan is Beijing in transition. On the other side of the road from Oriental Plaza hawkers sell candied crab apples: one of them offers a novelty, candied strawberries. The traditional medicine shop survives: its range now includes a Chinese version of Viagra. Poses and poetry A row of wedding shops with English names such as Vivi Bride and Venus Wedding are doing good business. They hire out clothes not just for the day but for an elaborate set of photographs. The couples dress up in as many as a dozen sets of clothes, from cheongsams and mandarin outfits to western wedding gowns and pirate costumes. Venus offers a package deal for 888 renminbi (£70): the figure eight is an auspicious one. Vivi's catalogue boasts couplets - also in English: 'May the love we've discovered as husband and wife, grow richer and deeper each day of our life.' Chairman Mao's classical verse it isn't. Though Mao continued to write poetry after the Long March, he devastated classical Beijing. In the municipal archives special visitors are shown a memorandum, headed with a quotation from the chairman, ordering the destruction of the city's wall. It was an order impossible to refuse. The archives also possess a remarkable plan drawn up in the early 60s by techni cal experts - sent by the Soviet Union - for an elaborate subway system: eight lines, 117 stations, 150 miles. The plan was rejected during the split with Moscow because it had been devised by 'Soviet revisionists'. Beijing built a much smaller and less useful system, and continued to widen roads above ground. The idea of municipal archives open to ordinary readers is itself a small revolution for China. 'In the past,' says the director, 'we served only government organisations.' The archives are no longer regarded as state secrets - and the new building has a state-of-the-art database. But material from the 1966-76 cultural revolution is still 'too contentious' to be available. The couples having their photographs taken are more interested in the shopping revolution. Department stores have been transformed since China opened up in the 80s. Nowadays it is impossible to find a Mao cap or buy a padded jacket in the big stores. Enamelware has been replaced by Japanese china, and the huge floors are broken up into stylish boutiques, most selling foreign cosmetics and perfumes. Xidan department store prides itself on safeguarding customers' interests. 'If there is doubt about responsibility,' boasts the service manager, 'we take it. If there is doubt about the goods, we take them back.' On the top floor customers attend a free lecture on how to use food processors. Most newspapers have weekly consumer sections. A consumer law was passed in 1993. There is, as with everything in China, a broader context. Satisfying consumer demand is one way of defusing political aspirations; in 1992 Deng launched a new wave of economic reform to revive morale after the trauma of 1989. That trauma still nags for Chinese only slightly older than the Vivi Bride couples. In this year of anniversaries, the night of June 3-4 marks 10 years from the Beijing massacre, when ordinary citizens came out of the small residential lanes now being demolished. They stood at barricades to support the student democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and to stop the army (so they hoped) from entering. The square is now a huge building site, blocked by barricades while it is repaved for the October celebrations. Conveniently, this will prevent any protesters setting foot on the square in June. But last week's silent demonstration by the Falun Gong cult not far away may set a new pattern for subtle protest. The repaving signifies the official paranoia about dissent, as do the harsh sentences handed in the winter to members of the China Democracy party - giving the lie to official claims that no one in China is interested in multiparty democracy. Activists are still a tiny minority, but China's neglect of its recent history - the Middle Kingdom produced the world's first historical annals - is no longer absolute. In a Beijing bookshop the manager recommends a book of reminiscences by intellectuals sent to the countryside during the cultural revolution. The first chapter tells the tale of Wu Shichang, a gentle scholar of the classic novel, The Dream of the Red Chamber, who left Oxford to return, patriotically, to the mainland. He was labelled a bourgeois intellectual and banished to a hovel in Henan. Other books recount the persecution of intellectuals as 'rightists' in 1957 and analyse the disasters of the Great Leap Forward. The Chinese who read this material know that the Communist party still tries to play down what happened then, and that many officials clawed their way to power by promoting these mass movements. Some books tread more difficult ground by paying tribute to a former party secretary general, Hu Yaobang, for rehabilitating the rightists in the early 80s. The real point is that he was sacked by hardliners in 1987 and that his death brought the students to Tiananmen Square. Books by two controversial journalists, Ma Licheng and Ling Zhiyun, tackle delicate contemporary issues. Last year the pair upset the establishment with Crossing Swords, which satirises the polemics of party dogma. Now a new book, Crying Out, analyses the 'five voices' in Chinese politics today. These, they say, are reformism, dogmatism, nationalism, feudalism and democracy. Just mentioning democracy is stepping close to the edge. Across Beijing, staff at the institute of contemporary history are willing to discuss post-1949 politics (modern history stops at 1949, where contemporary begins). It was forbidden territory until a few years ago; the institute only opened in 1991. 'Our work is quite sensitive,' explains a senior cadre. 'This is a new discipline and it's a hard one. In the past we only studied the history of the Communist party: now we need to study all aspects of our nation.' Like all Chinese historians they spend a lot of time discussing periodisation. How many 'stages' have there been in the past 50 years - just two (before and after the Deng reforms) or five, including the cultural revolution? These scholars reject a tendency to write off the Mao period altogether. China achieved much in those decades of isolation, they insist. 'We shouldn't use today's successes to ridicule our past,' says the senior cadre. 'The last 20 years developed on the basis of the previous 30.' But many people outside the party, and quite a few within it, have written off the 30 - and they have doubts about the 20, too. There is a moment of constraint when the institute scholars are asked about June 1989. Then the chief cadre replies tightly that the matter has been 'dealt with by President Jiang Zemin'. But the academics do regret that most Chinese are ignorant about the recent past. 'A nation without a knowledge of its own history', they say, 'lacks national consciousness.' It is an encouraging admission, but in this year of historic anniversaries there are still many black holes in China's past demanding investigation. \u0095 John Gittings' new book, China Through the Sliding Door: reporting three decades of change, is published this week by Simon &amp; Schuster"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/may/04/guardianobituaries.suzannegoldenberg","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-04T00:31:56Z","webTitle":"Man Mohan Adhikari","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/04/guardianobituaries.suzannegoldenberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/may/04/guardianobituaries.suzannegoldenberg","fields":{"headline":"Man Mohan Adhikari","bodyText":"Man Mohan Adhikari, who has died aged 78, was a rare political figure in south Asia - a man who belonged to a vanished era of idealism, whose legacy was the Afno gaon, afne banawo (build your own village) programme, which allotted development funds directly to poor Nepalese villages. As chairman of the Nepal Communist party (United Marxist Leninist), and briefly prime minister, he dedicated five decades to the struggle against Nepal's authoritarian kingdom. First jailed as a science student in India during the second world war for opposing British rule, he spent more than 14 years in prison or underground for his opposition to the Nepalese monarchy. Born to a land-owning Brahmin family in eastern Nepal, Adhikari 'declassed' himself by marrying outside his caste and ethnic group and living on the outskirts of Kathmandu. Unlike many contemporaries, he made no effort to groom his son and daughter as successors. He lived a simple lifestyle and kept his family out of the public eye. Such principles did not equip him for the wheeling and dealing of public life when democracy was restored in 1990. He was unable to manage a parliament almost evenly divided between his coalition and the opposing bloc led by the Congress party, and he lasted just nine months after becoming prime minister in November 1994. His harsh experience of parliamentary politics - which saw him defeated in a confidence motion while he was in hospital - did not discourage him, or diminish the regard in which he was held by ordinary Nepalis. At the time of his death, he was still campaigning hard for the current elections. A pragmatist, his main achievement came in 1990 when he united his party with the young extremists of the Marxist-Leninist underground movement, who were preaching an armed peasant revolt. It transformed Nepal's communists at a time when communism was collapsing in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Shorn of its most respected leader, Adhikari's party faces a tough future.

In his first press interview since his life took a dramatic and unexpected change of course, Jordan's new monarch spoke yesterday of the precious little time remaining in which to secure peace and stability for the Middle East. Over lunch at the Hashemite royal court, King Abdullah demonstrated the new style of leadership he has brought to a job he never sought. He breezed in apologetically almost an hour late and, rarely pausing to fork a few morsels of chicken, spoke constantly throughout the meal of his plans to rejuvenate his kingdom. Then he departed just as rapidly for another round of meetings. Abdullah is in a hurry. He knows the time is short in which to capitalise on the international goodwill that was the last gift of his late father to his small, under-resourced country. A few flecks of grey have crept into his temples, and he has grown a beard, which makes him look more like Hussein. On the back of his left hand a note to himself is scrawled in fading ink. The impression is one of energy, commitment and a measure of bewilderment. Abdullah was a soldier; his clipped tones betray that background. Now he is learning from day to day how to run a country instead of an army. Reluctance, discomfort even, to perform the task never entered the equation. \"I was always told by my father, 'you get knocked down, you pick yourself right up again'. 'It has not sunk into me personally that his majesty is no longer with us, although I feel that, in so many difficult situations that I've been in, I don't know whether I'll be able to have the courage and determination to see some things through. But I also feel his sense of calmness and strength. 'This is not where I ever imagined I would be. To feel sorry for oneself, to say that the situation is unfair, that's not how I was brought up. There is a crisis, so much to be done. I sometimes feel that his majesty is still with us, that he's in Rochester [where he underwent cancer treatment] and we're holding the fort until he comes back.' The 'we' is telling. The presence of his brother Prince Talal - the weighty intellectual who advises on national security - and Talal's wife Princess Ghida, a formidable organiser and director of the court's beefed-up international press centre, underlines the theme of family unity which Abdullah invoked during his sudden elevation to monarch by the dying Hussein. The way Abdullah tells it, this is a team effort. He says: 'I have now maybe the role as the figurehead, but we are doing this for my father.' Already, with the official mourning period still not complete and black ties de rigeur, Jordan's relations with its Arab neighbours have improved impressively. Abdullah has just returned from an ice-breaking visit to Syria's President Hafez al-Assad, and there is talk of a joint dam to help solve the region's chronic water shortage. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states too have warmed to Abdullah, promising trade and financial support. Relations with Israel are on temporary hold - although Abdullah insists they are still 'warm' - until after its elections in a fortnight's time. The 37-year-old king is desperate for Israelis to choose peace with their Palestinian partners - although he refuses to offer an opinion as to which Israeli leader will best serve that goal - and therefore enable them to guarantee their intertwined futures. Abdullah says: 'We will see some dramatic changes throughout the Middle East in the near future. What we need to look at is what is going to be the future of Israel after the elections. 'If we are going to have peace between them and the Palestinians it will have a cascade effect throughout the region. I think it could be done in a month if people just sat down and talked to one another. I think if you solve that problem you will be amazed at what the reaction will be.' Dialogue is at the heart of his vision for the 'bright new future', a phrase which peppers his speech. Iraq needs it too. 'I think it is very difficult for the Iraqis to move in any direction with such international opposition to Saddam himself. Until Iraq and the international community resolve that issue Iraq will remain stagnant. If there was more dialogue I think the road would be clear. 'We see the suffering of the Iraqi people on a daily basis. I hope there is an end in sight. We as Jordanians feel that there should be a lifting of the sanctions, but there has to be an international consensus. We look at it from a humanitarian point of view.' He will discuss Iraqi policy with Tony Blair when he meets him next week. Tomorrow Abdullah will arrive in London for his first visit since becoming king. But his main message will be a plea for 'forgiveness' of half Jordan's £7bn debt. Interest repayments alone eat up nearly 30% of his kingdom's annual national budget. Abdullah is hoping to impress Mr Blair and the western leaders with the seriousness he is bringing to solving Jordan's ruinous economy and enlist them in the task of rebuilding a strong regional ally with a pivotal role to play in maintaining stability. He has launched a two-year plan to streamline his ministries and privatise key public sector services such as telecommunications. Democratising his kingdom must for now take second place to making it economically stable. At present his greatest asset is the compassion which he must have inherited from his father. Abdullah has achieved a quiet, smooth transition from the king everyone thought irrreplaceable, and he does not intend to lose a grain of his father's international 'credit', cutting the grace period created by the outpouring of grief and goodwill at Hussein's untimely death from two years to only six months in which to put his house in order. 'Economic recovery will dramatically change the situation, but time is short,' he said. In the end, it all comes back to the decisions made by his neighbour Israel. 'That will really tilt the balance. If there's movement in the peace process I can't tell you how that will spread through the Arab world.' It is early days, but Jordan's new king has made an impressive start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/may/07/electionspast.uk5","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-07T17:46:06Z","webTitle":"Labour forced into coalitions in Wales and Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/07/electionspast.uk5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/may/07/electionspast.uk5","fields":{"headline":"Labour forced into coalitions in Wales and Scotland","bodyText":"Coalition government returned to Britain today for the first time since the war after Labour failed to win overall control of the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly. Tony Blair put a brave face on the result and pointed to the party's strong showing in local council elections, where it took the largest share of the vote. Tory leader William Hague hailed his party's retaking of more than 1,300 town hall seats as the start of its long journey back to electoral success, though some of the gloss was taken off the result by fierce criticism of his tactics from a close aide. Prospective Scottish First Minister Donald Dewar was expected to spend the weekend after the first elections locked in talks with the Liberal Democrat's chief north of the border, Jim Wallace. Mr Wallace was expected to demand a climbdown over students' tuition fees as the price of using his 17 MSPs to shore up Labour's 56 members against the Scottish Nationalists 35 and the Tories' 18 representatives. In Wales, too, a dramatic surge by Plaid Cymru appeared set to rob Labour of overall control of the Assembly. The nationalists captured seats in Labour's traditional South Wales Valleys heartland, taking the Rhondda, defeating Wales Euro MP and leading party figure Wayne David, as well as seizing Islwyn, the area once represented in Parliament by Neil Kinnock. Labour's Wales campaign manager Peter Hain conceded the party would be denied an overall majority, and while refusing to discuss possible deals with the Liberal Democrats said the party was committed to \"partnership politics\" to make the Assembly \"work for Wales\". Welsh Secretary Alun Michael - prospective First Secretary - avoided the humiliation of being shut out of Assembly by taking a top-up seat in Mid and West Wales. Mr Blair insisted the Scottish and Welsh elections showed the success of his policy of devolution, producing in Scotland a convincing vote against the separatist Scottish nationalists. \"I believe and I hope that out of these elections the union of the United Kingdom will have been strengthened rather than weakened,\" he told reporters at Downing Street. \"We will have provided people with the real prospect of finding a way for the future that strengthens the United Kingdom and goes between the old status quo - where everything was done in Whitehall and Westminster - and separation. He said the system of proportional representation was always likely to deny any party an overall majority, adding: \"I have got no doubt at all that we will form a good, strong and stable government in Scotland.\" Mr Blair also hailed the local council polls as \"very good results for us\", with the party recording a higher share of the vote than the Tories - something not achieved by a Government mid-term since Mrs Thatcher in 1982. But the Tory leadership was tonight breathing a sigh of relief after the party made good gains in town halls across the country, powering towards 1,400 extra seats. That was seen as putting William Hague out of the danger zone for a leadership challenge, which might have loomed if the party took fewer than 1,000 seats. Mr Hague said: \"We have come within three percentage points of the Labour vote in these local government elections across England and I think that's a very good result for the Conservative Party, one of course that we have to go on to build on, and make further gains in the future, but it's pretty good.\" Visiting triumphant local party workers celebrating victory in Weston super Mare, Somerset, Mr Hague: \"This is a tremendous victory, I am absolutely delighted with these great results,\" he told councillors. \"Over 1,000 gains across the country is very impressive. It's a real victory for hardworking party workers and a testimony to what we have been doing to build up the party from the ground level. However, Mr Hague's day was marred by criticism from a close aide, shadow health minister Alan Duncan, who told him he had to \"go back to the drawing board\" in drawing up new policies. Mr Duncan's remarks will provoke speculation that despite today's poll results, many in the party are still unhappy with Mr Hague's leaderships. Mr Hague described Mr Duncan's remarks as \"a little confusing\" and promised to \"sort him out\". The Liberal Democrats in England were also jubilant, despite losing seats in a retreat from their previous high-water mark. They managed to take Labour's traditional flagship Sheffield, marking what Paddy Ashdown called their transformation from \"a party of protest to a party of power\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/1999/may/08/1","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-08T02:25:00Z","webTitle":"Is it millennium madness to drop AD and BC?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/may/08/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/may/08/1","fields":{"headline":"Is it millennium madness to drop AD and BC?","bodyText":"Dear Joanna Bogle, The recommendation this week by the Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) to change the reckoning of time from BC, Before Christ, and AD, anno Domini, to BCE and CE (Before Christian Era and Christian Era), will seem to many non-Christian and secular Britons to be an appropriate and sensitive move. Different time scales are nothing new in human history, and many alternatives preceded the Christian era identified by Dionysius exiguus, 532 years after the Incarnation; the Romans reckoned AUC, ab urbe condita, from the foundation of the city of Rome (c753 BCE) and the Jews AM, anno mundi, from the creation of the world (c3761 BCE). There is nothing to stop particular religious communities from using their own terminology internally, but a different approach must surely be taken when used by secular media. Statistics show that there are more Hindus and Muslims in the United Kingdom today than there are members of the Church of England, and one of this country's great strengths is that it enshrines the principles of pluralism. Jews in the modern world have always used BCE and CE in association with historical dates - reflecting an understanding of time that transcends religious divides rather than being a polemic against another faith. This is terminology that should be understood in a wholly positive way as an inclusive gesture that should cause nobody offence and I welcome it wholeheartedly. Yours sincerely, Rabbi Charles Middleburgh Executive director, Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues Dear Rabbi Middleburgh, Watch out when government bureaucracy attempts to impose a new language rule. Such diktats often come with luggage attached: it's crucial to challenge them. The commission has no authority to change the language of our dating system and has never been asked to do so: it should stay within its legitimate remit. There is nothing 'appropriate' or 'sensitive' about the extension of its powers. Using the initials AD has been widespread since the sixth century. They stand for Latin words not in common use, offending no one: anno Domini. Translated they mean 'the year of the Lord', a beautiful expression which holds, for Christians, a special significance but which for others carries no meaning but honours history. Historians have often struggled with government hatred of old and noble expressions reflecting faith or features of a bygone age. Hindus and Muslims have not objected to the use of AD - in these secularised days they tend, if anything, to uphold such fragments of an older and more Christian Britain. The initials are no 'polemic against another faith', but attempting to ban them certainly is - so why support it? Why enthuse about a ban so insulting to Christians? Why speak only for the 'many secular and non-Christian Britons'? Why not look at the community as a whole? With best wishes, Joanna Bogle, Association of Catholic Women Dear Joanna, I acknowledge that the commission has no authority to challenge the language of our dating system, but that is surely not what they are doing. They are simply responding to a pluralistic, multi-faith and multicultural Britain and suggesting that inclusive rather than exclusive nomenclature is used. BCE and CE can be used by anyone who lives their non-religious lives according to the Gregorian calendar, whereas BC and AD can legitimately and correctly be used only by Christians. To suggest that the Broadcasting Standards Commission is pursuing a polemic against the Christian community seems to me to be somewhat paranoid; after all, they are not preventing Christians, or any other faith group, from using their own nomenclature in their own specific context. To use a phrase like 'hatred of old and noble expressions reflecting faith or features of a bygone age' seems to me to be hugely over the top. As we approach the dawning of a new era in time, and the end of a century soaked in the blood of innocents murdered as often as not in the course of religious disputes, it surely behoves those of us who live in a society whose hallmark is tolerance to support any moves that further this trait and make inter-faith coexistence ever more comfortable. The commission's advice disenfranchises nobody and I would hope that all people, with or without faith, would understand its true motive and give it their support. Yours sincerely, Charles Dear Charles, Calling opponents paranoid does not make any argument more convincing. It is surely common ground that the initials AD have not been, and are not today, used only by Christians. The whole debate centres on the fact that the initials are and have been in general use by people whose religious convictions are largely unknown. If we want a society 'whose hallmark is tolerance' we can usefully start by accepting the things we hold in common and are part of our history - even if their origins belong to a religion we do not share. The argument that AD can only be 'legitimately and correctly used by Christians' could also be used about celebrating Christmas, or Easter, or eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. And since in recent times we have seen attempts to start precisely this sort of daft campaign - with 'Happy Holidays' instead of 'Merry Christmas' and attempts to ban Christmas cribs in public spaces - those of us who seek a gentler and more decent approach are hardly 'over the top' in voicing our concern. The 20th century in Europe has seen the wholesale abandonment of Christian traditions - with dire results. The century has truly been 'soaked in the blood of innocents', not through religious disputes but largely in concentration camps run by the two great anti-Christian ideologies of the century. Both ideologies (Nazi and communist) sought to abolish Christian references in the calendar and replace the old traditions, and ceremonies with manufactured alternatives. Let us be wise and learn. With best wishes, Joanna Dear Joanna, I am sorry that you believe we are 'opponents' - it seems to me that you are painting a differing approach to a philosophical issue in rather stark terms! I do not believe that many thinking non-Christians use or have ever used BC and AD as nomenclature for time or history, and would regard BCE and CE as an excellent compromise that could embrace everybody. Christians could, after all, always read the letter 'C' as standing for Christ if they so chose. I wholeheartedly agree with the point that you make about the sloppy appropriation - or dilution - of religious festivals by those from a different religious tradition. Therein ultimately lies the path to their secularisation, and none of us to whom religion matters should contemplate that with equanimity. As for the legacy of Nazism and communism, about that we could debate for years. Suffice it to say that, red herring though it might be in this particular debate, I would hold unshakeably to the view that the Nazi genocide was a direct result of centuries of institutionalised and church-sponsored anti-semitism and intolerance, the absolute antithesis of the tolerant approach that I believe underpins the approach of the commission. Yours sincerely, Charles Dear Charles, It's a strong part of the Christian tradition to assume personal wrongdoing before criticising others. This is a useful notion (even though I'm always being told it brings 'Catholic guilt hangups'). So I apologise if my use of the word 'opponent' made you uncomfortable. But why does it? A good debate between opponents is healthy and important. Plenty of 'thinking non-Christians' have comfortably used the initials AD, and many will actively dislike CE because of its political overtones and deliberate fracture with past usage. There is a valuable and appreciated sense of history, beauty, and spirituality associated with AD that is a precious part of a common heritage. All will be poorer for its official banning, which is why thinking people of all faiths or none should join to make a dignified protest. Please join us. An unshakeably held personal opinion about the origins of Nazi genocide does not alter historical facts about Nazi (and communist) attempts to abolish Christian customs, traditions and calendar usage. Nor can it tarnish the truth that it was allies from nations of essentially Christian tradition that destroyed both evils. Why seek to ban the 'AD' that is part of such a noble heritage?

Over 2,500 people were packed into the city's Exhibition Centre Theatre to watch it perform Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo And Juliet - one of the works in which the British dancers most reliably shine and which the Chinese (who admire Shakespeare) were most eager to see. The theatre was buzzing with pre-performance exchanges of courtesies and expectations. But part of the story to be told about the opening night in Beijing was of the jinx which threatened to wreck the entire show. It manifested itself early in act one, when a crucial blackout failed, leaving a self-conscious stagecrew shifting scenery in full view. Then it re-appeared in the Balcony pas de deux - one of the most romantic moments in the whole ballet repertoire - when the atmosphere was shattered by a large candelabra left over from the previous scene, which wobbled with comic urgency as unseen hands tried to yank it out through a door. The Chinese extras also turned out to be a constant hazard, crowding the wings to stare at the British stars. But even more distracting was the orchestra of the Central Ballet of China, which appeared unnervingly unfamiliar with certain passages of the score. The musicians played their heroic best for the Royal's conductor, Andrea Quinn, but even so, she said they were 'having to perform on state-owned instruments which were as dirty and badly maintained as school instruments'. After the show I saw several members of the string section pedalling home with their violins in their bicycle baskets. The music on that first night wasn't the score as Prokofiev wrote it, nor as the dancers were used to dancing it. A shattered-looking Jonathan Cope (Romeo) said afterwards that getting through the performance had 'felt like an out-of-body experience', while Sylvie Guillem (Juliet) admitted she'd been 'very distracted'. A fellow dancer put it more bluntly: 'Sylvie was pissing herself'. What the Chinese thought of it all was harder to gauge. Chinese audiences don't normally clap much, and as a matter of course will chatter or even use their mobile phones during a performance. 'They'll practically get out their stoves and brew up a cup of tea if they're bored,' says Martin Davidson, director of the British Council in Beijing. So I wasn't entirely surprised when the ballet's final harrowing moments were greeted by a slightly awkward smattering of applause and some people appeared ready to leave the theatre immediately. During the show, however, I had been sneaking glances at the row of elderly women behind me who had sat in rapturous silence throughout, their hands pressed with tender awe against their cheeks. During the interval, one of them spoke to me through an interpreter. 'I am from an older generation, but my heart was so touched, the dancing was so realistic and the story so sad.' Bai Shuxiang, a ballerina in 1964 with China's first model revolutionary ballet, The Red Detachment Of Women, also professed great admiration for the standard of the British dancing and for the expressive naturalism of MacMillan's choreography. And when the curtains opened for the dancers to take their bows, it was suddenly obvious that everyone agreed with her. In a startling sugar-rush of enthusiasm the auditorium rose to give the Royal a standing ovation. The same wave of appreciation greeted Darcey Bussell and Igor Zelensky on the second night. Yet, dramatic as their success was, it couldn't compete with the impact the company first made when it visited Beijing in 1983. At that point the Royal was one of the first big western companies to appear in China after the trauma of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Jiang Anxi, a film researcher who now divides her time between London and Beijing, was one of the thousands who fought to get a ticket for the Royal's performances of Sleeping Beauty. She can still recall how the lavish costumes and lush Tchaikovsky score seemed to have flown into Beijing from fairyland. 'The stage looked so magical. I almost collapsed with the beauty of it. We were like babies, the beauty of the dancing and the music was so fresh to our senses.' Jiang Anxi was a piano student at the Beijing Conservatoire in 1966 at the height of the Cultural Revolution. Like almost every other artist in China, she was severed from her career and exiled to the country for hard labour. For her the exquisite world of Sleeping Beauty, where there were no slogans, no uniforms and no marching, remains an image of a period when 'for the first time in my life I began to feel human'. For the British dancers, though, China still seemed like a cross between a third-world country and a prison. Donald MacLeary, who danced on that first 1983 trip, recalls looking out at a 'sea of Mao suits' and 'staying in a hotel where nothing worked and we were herded around like sheep by our interpreters'. His return to modern Beijing thus came as a profound shock. In the 16-year gap between the Royal's two visits, China has undergone drastic change. Mao suits are a dim memory for the generation who came of age during the 90s' economic boom and now listen to rock music, eat burgers and aspire to owning western designer labels. In terms of political timing, the Royal Ballet tour couldn't be handier, coming as it does between Tony Blair's recent visit and President Jiang Zemin's trip to Britain. Culture secretary Chris Smith, who attended the ballet's first night, readily acknowledged that the tour 'will help to oil the wheels' of the political negotiations. But even if the Royal's trip suits a larger political agenda, it's also there to serve a genuine Chinese interest in western culture - an interest that goes way beyond Prada and Pizza Hut. It comes, too, at an interesting moment in China's own debate about how it should position itself in relation to the international arts scene. Dance is typical of the arts in China, in that it has a rich indigenous tradition which has re-emerged after the Cultural Revolution, when both peasant and imperial Chinese cultures were repressed as feudal. This ranges from the physical conjuring tricks of its acrobats to the huge variety of folk forms which populate its vast territory. But dance also features in daily life. Crowds of people gather in city parks to perform their t'ai chi exercises at dawn, while others, mainly the elderly, meet to practice ballroom dancing. Also popular are spontaneous displays of lively fan dances. On my third day in Beijing, walking to the Exhibition Centre Theatre, I was drawn down a tiny alley by the sound of drums and trumpets. Around two dozen people, aged between 50 and 80, were dressed in their brightest silk pyjamas and weaving with gallant grace through complex steps and intricate fan work. The sweetness and gaiety of the dance seemed such a resplendent contrast to the dancers' recent ravaged past that I burst into soggy jet-lagged tears. One of the women was so perplexed and concerned that she offered me her fan and motioned me to join in. But dance isn't only blooming in the streets. In Beijing alone there are about 20 professional companies, although recent cuts in state subsidy are likely to diminish the number. Most ensembles specialise in folk or national dance, though there are also a tiny number of modern dance companies founded by artists trained in America. The Central Ballet of China, the country's main classical company, was heavily influenced by Soviet ballet when it was founded in the 1950s, but it is now looking with interest at western activity. Any visiting company is assiduously videoed and analysed, and several years after the Royal's first visit, dance notator Monica Parker was invited back to stage a production of Sleeping Beauty. Assisting her was choreographer William Tuckett, and while he was there, he was invited to create two new works for the company. He says that on his first visit the Chinese dancers couldn't get enough of his ideas. 'They were so hungry for anything new and they worked so hard. I still get Christmas cards saying, 'Come back and make a new ballet for us.' ' During the Royal's current tour the classes and workshops organised by the British Council and the Royal's own education department have also been attended with intense enthusiasm by both professionals and amateurs. But for all its apparent embrace of western culture, China is still China, proudly defensive of its own traditions and scared of too much outside influence - 'If you open the window too wide, you may get ugly flies coming in'. Although Tuckett's first two ballets were avidly received, his attempt to make a third was stonewalled. He had planned a much darker piece, using a score by Webern (abstract and experimental by Chinese standards) and during the five weeks he was with the Central Ballet he was given only one rehearsal. The only explanation for the lack of co-operation was that Tuckett's ideas 'weren't Chinese enough'. Chinese culture is still ruled by the Communist Party - and the official line is to ensure the spiritual health and integrity of the people. So while the establishment is happy to take on board some western art, this should ideally be classical, uplifting and tell a good story. The party is like a giant with many eyes - some all-seeing, some that sleep. It seems that if you can creep past its blind side, a reasonable degree of freedom is possible. If it catches sight of something dangerous, it attacks. The same is true of art produced in China. With the 50th anniversary of the republic falling this year, the party is anxious for Chinese artists to concentrate on traditional subject matter and national styles - so when I visited the Central Ballet it was rehearsing not only Balanchine, but a new work of unmistakable Chinese character. The Communist Party also forbids work critical of its policy. Any image that remotely suggests, for instance, Tiananmen Square, is likely to provoke an instant ban. At the same time, officials know that a limited freedom of expression offers a necessary safety valve, so they quietly ignore much of the local art which experiments with new forms and ideas. To maintain this freedom, Chinese artists like Jin Xing tend to operate in a peculiarly divided fashion. Jin Xing is one of China's first and most famous transsexuals, and as a man she has performed with the People's Liberation Army Ballet. After her operation she went to America to study modern dance, and now she runs a company of her own. With her left hand she produces work which cheerfully toes the party line; with her right she produces more controversial work, as well as running a bar for transvestites and transsexuals. The system is very, very hard for outsiders to read. China's ancient culture has barely been touched by democracy or Christianity, which means that however westernised its surface, its internal chemistry, its instincts and emotions remain mysterious. Yet as this huge, private kingdom slowly opens its doors, it is surely going to change and the west looks on, fascinated, for signs. I was struck by the fact that The Red Detachment Of Women, parts of which were banned during the long period of denial following the Cultural Revolution, has now been revived and become a family favourite. Also that the men and women whose adolescence was consumed by that revolution are beginning to return to the distant villages and army camps of their exile for holiday reunions. Groups of ex-Red Guards gather together to sing old revolutionary songs like fans at a 60s rock revival, while Mao cigarette lighters are hawked at street markets everywhere. If the god of the People's Republic has become an icon of tourist kitsch and the art of the Cultural Revolution has become the material of nostalgia, then it could signal everything in terms of a changing national consciousness - or it could mean nothing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/may/08/jonathanfreedland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-08T02:27:37Z","webTitle":"A nation that will never be the same again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/08/jonathanfreedland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/may/08/jonathanfreedland","fields":{"headline":"A nation that will never be the same again","bodyText":"The new dawn did not break in clear sunshine, but came shrouded in mist. It would take hours for the daylight to grow stronger. Only then could you see how much had changed in a single night. And so it was across Britain, the slow breaking of a new dawn to reveal a country which might never be the same again. A night of unprecedented elections in Scotland and Wales, along with a batch of local contests in England, formed a picture of a nation peeling off into distinct, increasingly separate political cultures. May 6 did not herald the instant break-up of the United Kingdom that the nationalists dream of and the doomsayers fear. But it may be remembered as the start of a quieter, but no less dramatic process the end of British politics as we know it. For what happened yesterday saw the coronation of Labour as the dominant party in all three nations of the United Kingdom facing a different opposition in each. British politics now consists of Labour versus nationalism, in its Scottish, Welsh and English forms. Now it will be hard to have a single political conversation across the UK. Rather, Labour in Westminster will have to become like a version of the US military: ready to do battle on three fronts at once. And the enemy in each case is the same: nationalism. In Edinburgh, Labour will do battle with the Scottish National party, now represented by a parliamentary bloc six times larger than any it has enjoyed before. In Cardiff, it will face the nationalists of Plaid Cymru, who triggered an earthquake in Labour's valley heartlands snatching the totemic mining seat of the Rhondda and the former Neil Kinnock stronghold of Islwyn. In England, the main force opposing Labour will still be the party that once claimed to be the voice of the entire union, but is now reduced to the status of a fringe group west and north of the border. The Conservatives bagged more than 1,300 new council seats, sufficient to keep them the official opposition of England. But as a force in UK-wide politics, the Tories are vanishing before our eyes. They are becoming, by process of elimination, the ENP the English National party. So this is the new landscape. Labour the big player all over Britain, facing nationalists of different hues in each nation. Not that Tony Blair sees it that way. Yesterday he stood in Downing Street telling reporters that the vast majority voted against nationalism and that the union was strengthened, not weakened, as a result. In the narrowest sense he's right. The parties of formal separatism, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, did not win. Plaid's spectacular gains in certain spots should not hide the fact that overall it was beaten by a whacking majority of voters backing unionist parties. The SNP, too, will be disappointed not to have crossed the 40-seat threshold. That's why Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, who ran Labour's campaign in Scotland, are urging voters to interpret these results as a defeat for old-style nationalism and a victory for their brand of looser, devolved unionism. That Labour fell short of an overall majority in both Wales and Scotland was, according to Mr Blair yesterday, nothing more than a quirk thrown up by the new, proportional voting systems. But all that is to miss the point. For here's what happened as the prime minister of the United Kingdom was speaking in Downing Street yesterday. Scottish television interrupted him mid-sentence, choosing to cut away and carry instead the words of the new first minister of Scotland, Donald Dewar. In that one gesture, you could see Britain's future. Nationalism may have come second yesterday, but it does not represent the chief threat to the unity of the United Kingdom. For what has been unleashed by devolution is a new dynamic in British life, one that puts the distinct political cultures of our constituent nations first and Britain second. It's a subtle process, but the outlines are already visible. Mr Dewar will have to form a coalition, and that's bound to mean dropping policies that are UK Labour policy. Scottish Liberal Democrats are against tuition fees for higher education: they're demanding Mr Dewar bows to them, not Tony Blair. The pressure will be to tack left in Scotland, to heal the rift with Dennis Canavan the independent whose stand against control freakery by Labour's head office at Millbank struck such a loud chord in Falkirk and to win back the disillusioned hardliners of Glasgow who sent Tommy Sheridan, a Scottish Socialist, to Holyrood. The chancellor, for one, can see the battle ahead. He knows that Scottish Labourites will start arguing that theirs is a more leftwing country than England, that it requires a more radical message. He's preparing to tell the party that its victory yesterday did not come 'because Labour in Scotland is more socially responsible and community-minded than English Labour'. He knows where such talk leads. So a process begun by Labour may well have created its greatest headache. Somehow Mr Blair and Mr Brown have to lead a UK-wide party, offering a single message palatable both to tax-averse middle England and spending-minded Scotland. At the same time, they need to loosen the centralised grip which so obviously turned off voters in Wales. They have to fight that war on three fronts. But the bigger challenge is to Britain. Distinct cultures are blossoming in these islands, each with its own media, political class and national conversation. These societies are becoming less interested in each other Wales barely made a blip on the Scottish radar yet somehow we remain citizens of the same country. Britain may well survive this change. Other countries are loose federations and do just fine. But if we are to make it, we will have to change ourselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/may/08/guardianobituaries","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-08T02:27:46Z","webTitle":"Johnny Morris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/08/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/may/08/guardianobituaries","fields":{"headline":"Johnny Morris","bodyText":"\"A grey-haired man drives in his car to a railway station. He catches the InterCity to Paddington. Takes a waiting taxi to the West End. Enters recording studio. Sits at microphone. Watches film. Waits until donkey turns. The man says 'Thistles'. Gets up, shakes hands all round. Takes taxi to Paddington. Takes InterCity to country station. Gets in car and drives home.\" That was how Johnny Morris, who has died aged 82, described his work - in this instance, lip-synching a donkey for a commercial. When Radio 4 asked him to take part in a new version of The Ladykillers in 1996, he said: \"I fancied the Alec Guinness role, but they wanted me for the parrot.\" Morris entertained millions of children for more than 40 years with his animal impersonations and storytelling skills. He was the Hot Chestnut Man for BBC-TV, holding his audience's attention with yarns and funny voices. Then, in 1960, came Animal Magic, which ran for 22 years and in which Morris mixed tips on animal care with information on wildlife and zoos. He provided the animals with quintessential English voices - the blustering retired colonel, the spinster maiden aunt, the tongue-tied suitor. The qualities he attributed to his menagerie always had an innate gentleness though, and what he was doing was child's play: anthropomorphising animals as children have always done with pets and toys. His young viewers instinctively responded with love for the dumpy, grey-haired little man. He usually closed the show with Dotty, the ring-tailed lemur, on his shoulder. \"He was as good as gold on screen because I kept a pocket full of sweets, and he knew I would give him some as long as he behaved,\" said Morris. There was no artifice. He was the real thing - a countryman and animal-lover, who stumbled into radio, and then television, almost by accident. Born in Newport, Monmouthshire, of Gloucestershire and Worcestershire stock, he left school at 14. He had several jobs before moving as a farm bailiff to Aldbourne in Wiltshire, where he soon became a local character and raconteur. Another resident of the village was Desmond Hawkins, who, impressed with Morris's stories, invited him to take small acting parts for radio in Bristol - the first on April Fools' Day, 1946. Morris eventually abandoned acting and found his metier giving country life talks in the Plug In The Wall series. He moved to the Home Service in the early 1950s with a rural-based magazine programme, Johnny Comes To Town. In 1957 he launched Johnny's Jaunts, in which he chatted to people around Britain, and, when the series transferred to television, he expanded his journeys to take in the Mediterranean. The Hot Chestnut Man and Animal Magic, based at Bristol zoo, followed, and he also continued to do idiosyncratic travelogues for adult viewers. When Johnny Morris was 26, he fell in love with a fashion model, Eileen Monro, who, separated from her husband, had been evacuated to Wiltshire in 1942 with her two small children. Morris, still working as a farm manager, looking after 600 cows and 2,000 pigs for £2.50 a week, brought her vegetables from the farm and determinedly wooed her, even though she was 10 years older and much taller than he was. She soon fell for him. Wild rabbits were a staple food during the war but, reasoned Morris, what use was a rabbit without an onion? Monro married Morris in 1944, and the union was blissfully happy for 45 years. When she died in 1989, he had her buried at the bottom of the four-acre garden they both loved, and for the rest of his life he visited her grave every evening to tell her about the day's events. He is to be buried next to her. Eileen's two sons gave him five grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. In 1982 Morris was awarded the OBE - ironically, the same year that Animal Magic was dropped by the BBC. Morris was hurt and angry. He remained in demand for ads and voice-overs because he could operate as a one-man sound effects department, his talent for mimicry extending beyond animals to noises like steam engines and squeaking signs. More recently, he condemned the proliferation of 'pet TV' shows, reserving particular ire for Pets Win Prizes, which he described as \"disgusting\". Programmes such as Animal Hospital, which he saw as exploiting animals, also upset him. \"It is enough to make you vomit,\" he said. \"They are purely sentimental, money-making things which provide vehicles for people to watch animals who have suffered or are in distress, or have been abandoned. It is a disgraceful way to entertain people.\" This was the blunt ex-farm worker talking, the man who, through long experience handling livestock, knew that no matter how funny the voice he gave it might be, each animal's dignity had to be left intact and that it always had to be quite clear that it was Johnny making an ass of himself and not the ass. It was a question of respect. In the late 1990s, Morris went into partnership with his step-grandson, Claude Monro, in the Pelican, a popular pub in Hungerford, and was disappointed when the venture collapsed. He spent a lot of time replying to all the letters he received from the children he had entertained, now grown up and with children of their own. Earlier this year, his programme views were vindicated when ITV sought to revive his particular brand of magic in a new series, Wild Things, but he fell ill as it went into production.

A few chairs are available, but only a handful are taken, all by elderly women. At 11am, there are already about a hundred people inside, and still they are coming, crossing themselves as they enter, kissing a picture of Christ next to which is a bunch of bluebells. Young men in puffa jackets with tired faces, as if they've come direct from the clubs, shake hands with each other. Old men stand in neat suits. The women are dressed smartly. Many of them have British passports, were born here, were pro-Nato - until Nato started bombing their families back in Serbia. The walls are covered with bright murals. The priest wears yellow robes and swings the silver censer. In the balcony, a choir is singing, unaccompanied by any organ. Everyone is quiet, but it's not the formal hush of a Church of England service. I close my eyes, and am startled to find that the priest's intonation reminds me of something very familiar from my childhood: a synagogue service. But these people are Serbs, so they must be genocidal fascists. Accusing fingers have been pointed at them in the aftermath of the Brixton nail-bomb attack and the murder of Jill Dando. I know all about despising other nationalities. I was brought up to hate Germans. We boycotted German products. Never set foot in Germany, was our motto. The congregation of this Serbian Orthodox Church consists of many men and women who fought for the British, often in British units, during the last world war. Demobilised at a time when Tito's Partisans were establishing a communist Yugoslavia, they chose to remain in Britain. They have lived most of their lives here, and their children and grandchildren were born here. There's a mother and daughter. When, in March 1941, the Serb generals (not the Croats, who were fascists) decided, crazily, to defy Hitler, the mother, who was then a 20-year-old student, stood waving a Union Jack outside the British Embassy in Belgrade. Today, her daughter, expressing the views of these confused and upset church-goers, says of the Nato bombing, \"One has this feeling of a terrible tragedy for all concerned. The worst thing is that those ordinary people in Serbia who are for the west are turning away from it. The western powers are doing the job for Milosevic. Next, they could alienate the youth in Russia. If there was a policy, if there was a strategy with an endgame . . . But policy is too good a word for it. I find it quite disappointing that British democracy is so frail that it has to resort to propaganda, to Clare Short on Woman's Hour comparing Tony Benn to an appeaser. The demonising of the Serbs hasn't encouraged Serbs to accept some responsibility for their actions.\" The divisions over the bombing of Serbia have cast it either as a rerun of the second world war, with Serbia playing the role of Nazi Germany, or as a rematch of the Vietnam war, with the Serbs as the Vietnamese and Milosevic, improbably, as Ho Chi Minh (on the basis, apparently, that the Americans are on the other side). But no war is like any other war, and there are not many in which the easily identifiable forces of good are ranged against the obviousness of evil My interest in the Serbs began several years ago. Early in 1993, I received a letter from a man called Jasa Almuli about an article of mine in which I had tried to find out whether the allegations of mass rape committed by Serbs in Bosnia were true, or if they were war propaganda. Ferocious figures were flying about: 50,000 women were supposed to have been violated by Serb brutes. The then-social services minister, Tim Yeo, was promising that no red tape was going to strangle the attempts by childless British couples to adopt the \"rape babies\" that were due to be born. The Daily Mail printed a picture of one of them, an adorable bundle - except that, as the doctor who had delivered her in a Zagreb maternity ward told me, she had been conceived before the war in Bosnia started. The Bosnian and Croatian authorities reported no increase in birth rates, not even much of one in the abortion figures. There was rape in Bosnia; of course there was. Rape in war was nothing new. What was new was that this was the first conflict monitored by a feminist organisation, which collected data. Jasa wanted me to know that Serb women in Bosnia had been raped, too, and that he had excellent contacts in Belgrade who could tell me about it. I went to see him because I was beginning to get curious about the point of view of the Serbs. They had, after all, been the victims of the first ethnic cleansing of the war, when 600,000 Serbs were forcibly expelled from the Krajina region of Croatia by the right-wing nationalist government, with not a peep of protest from the west. I wasn't sympathetic to the Serbs, not on their side; I just felt that there was a media black-out, that I wasn't being told everything I wanted to know. I was aware that I could easily put the Serbs into that comfortable trough of hate that had been excavated in my mind by my parents for the placing of Germans. It's hard work not having an enemy, a scapegoat to make you feel morally virtuous - whether it's greedy, powerful Americans if you're on the far left, or \"bogus asylum seekers\" if you're on the right. I went to see Jasa because he inhabited a most ironic place in the life of a nation that had been written off as genocidal thugs. Until the war in Bosnia had led him to leave Belgrade the previous year, he'd been president of that city's Jewish community - he is still honorary president of the Belgrade Holocaust survivors' organisation. He lived in a flat in Hampstead. I took him to be a man in his sixties, strong-faced, intelligent and well-informed. He was a retired journalist who had been posted to London in the Seventies as information officer for a Yugoslav investment bank. He had come back to Britain because two of his children lived here. At that time, no one much cared what the Serbs thought or who they were. I asked the editors of several papers to send me to Belgrade, but they said the story was in Bosnia, the story was war and its brutality, and the tragedy and suffering of a people terrorised by an evil enemy. Their leader, Slobodan Milosevic, spoke for them and spoke volumes about them. When Nato started bombing Serbia, I went to see Jasa again. He was now living in a sheltered housing block in north Finchley. A lifetime's commitment to liberal communism had earned him a modest, if comfortable old age. His brain was as alert as it had been at 22, when, on the first day of the German bombardment of Belgrade in 1941, understanding exactly what fascism was, he said to himself, \"I will avoid the Germans\", and set out on foot for the coast of Montenegro, where he had the extreme good fortune to fall into the hands of the Italians. Back in the summer of 1992, I had met Nebojsa, an asylum seeker here, and I had asked him to explain the war to me. \"The Serbs will never rest until they avenge the blood spilt at the battle of Kosovo, when we were defeated by the Turks and spent the next 500 years under the Ottoman Empire,\" he said, firmly. \"It was in 1389. We just had the 600th anniversary. Whatever happens in Bosnia will be nothing compared with what will happen when the war reaches Kosovo. Kosovo is everything. Bosnia is nothing.\" I contacted Nebojsa again when the Nato bombing of Serbia started. \"Why is Kosovo so important to you?\" I asked. \"It is not rational. It is not logical,\" he replied. \"It just is. This has nothing to do with Milosevic; this is about the Serb people. Every man in Serbia will die for Kosovo. If Nato sends in ground troops, I will go back to fight for Kosovo.\" But why? There is a joke the Serbs tell against themselves about the two Serb astronauts who land on the moon. One shoots the other and then plants the Serbian flag and declares, \"I claim this land for Serbia.\" Why shoot the other guy? Because, the astronaut says, wherever Serb blood has been spilt, that land becomes Serb. \"No one knows how the Serbs will react psychologically to the loss of Kosovo,\" a woman at the church had told me. Kosovo is the rock on which the Serbs have built a national identity, and a few bombs are not going to dislodge something constructed over centuries. Some years ago, Jasa asked his Serb friends if it might be possible to regard Kosovo not as their heart but as a gangrenous limb that it would be best to amputate. \"Get rid of it,\" he told them. \"It's not worth it. It's like a stone around the neck of Serbia. But the Serbs can't reason that way. It's their Jerusalem. Even smart people, intellectuals, can't reason that way. My son has schoolfriends who are now engineers in the refinery that was destroyed by Nato. My son asks his friends, \u0091Would you live in Kosovo? No. Then why don't you give it up?' But they can't.\" It is sometimes the way that those who live right inside a culture but are not quite a part of it have an understanding of that culture which is not open to those who never question or wonder at their own beliefs and values. This is why I wanted to talk to Jasa about who the Serbs are. Jasa's family arrived in Serbia in the 16th century, after one of the millennium's first great acts of ethnic cleansing, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. Unusually for that part of the world, Jasa has, in his own experience and his historical research, found very little evidence of anti-Semitism. His father, Isaac, was renamed Zarko by his customers, one of whom was the mayor of Kragujevac, where Nato recently destroyed the car factory. They became such pals that the mayor asked Jasa's father to be best man at his wedding. It is not an experience many Polish Jews could relate. Jasa is older than he looks. He was born in 1918 in Bucharest, \"by chance\", because his mother had gone to Romania as a refugee when Belgrade was under bombardment for the first of three occasions this century. What was it like to grow up among the Serbs? \"You can't be Serb if you are not born from a Serb mother and father,\" he said. \"They can accept you as a Jew, they won't persecute you as a Jew - you are welcome - but you can't become one of them. And I don't reproach them. I don't know if the British are sincere when they accept the notion that British Jews are British. \"The Serbs are nice people - not only do they have a fine sense of humour in a very difficult and tragic situation, but they are hospitable, friendly. Serbs, as all humans, have some bad traits and characteristics, but I wouldn't say they are cruel, as they are depicted now in the west.\" Jasa returned to Belgrade two months after liberation, as a journalist and liberal communist who believed in a mixed economy, and took a prominent role in the fight against Stalin's propaganda, part of Tito's attempt to preserve the nation from the control of either east or west. It is an important characteristic of the Serb's notion of individuality and independence that they chose to be non-aligned. What Tito's Yugoslavia never suppressed was the historic memory of defeat at Kosovo, which eventually led to Serbia's absorption into the Ottoman Empire and the reduction of the Serbs to an illiterate, labouring class. And anyway, how could communism eradicate what was the Serb's greatest literary achievement, an epic song cycle - transmitted orally for generations, collected by folklorists and finally written down in the 19th century during the great pan-European nationalist revival? The lullabies that mothers sang to their children had their roots in that same song cycle. It tells the story of how Prince Lazar was asked by the Prophet Elijah (in the guise of a hawk and, implausibly, delivering a message from the Virgin Mary, thus combining the Old and New Testaments) to choose between the kingdoms of Earth and Heaven. If they chose the latter, then Serbia would be lost, but a parallel Serbia would be built in heaven, the real and perfect nation. In his book, The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia (Yale University Press), Tim Judah argues that the story of Prince Lazar \"provided an explanation for the Serbs for their oppression under the Ottomans. It also identified the whole nation with the central guiding raison d'être of Christianity: resurrection. In other words, Lazar opted for the empire of heaven, that is to say truth and justice, so that the state would be one day resurrected. An earthly kingdom was rejected in favour of nobler ideals - victimhood and sacrifice - and this choice is to be compared with the temptations of Christ.\" Judah shows how the metaphor came to mean that, just as Christ was resurrected, so the Serbs couldn't lose. The sacred soil of Kosovo would be returned to them as Jerusalem was returned to the Jews. Nebojsa, who left Belgrade in 1989, tried to explain to me how, even for his atheistic generation brought up under Tito's communism, the Serbian Orthodox faith saturates the national character, and acts as an oppositional force to the western materialism and global economy that many feel Nato is attempting to impose by bombardment from the air. \"Religion is not just religion for us,\" he said. \"Above the material world is what you really are. Even during 500 years under the Turks, this feeling never went away.\" The sense of a mystical life, a parallel reality, is what sustains the Serbs now in a war with barely an ally, allows them to take refuge in a sense of the justice of their cause and of their resistance. They may be defeated, but in the heavenly realm they will be the victors. The oral transmission of the epic song cycle has knitted Kosovo into the fabric of society; it's far more than a boring exercise for sleepy schoolchildren. And, perhaps, the Serbs are scarcely aware that these poems contain the seeds of the hatred that leads to the current perception of them as fascists. Judah points out that one epic poem, The Mountain Wreath, gives an account of the revenge the Serbs took on Montenegrins who had converted to Islam: \"We put fire to the Turkish houses/That there might be neither stick nor trace/Of these true servants of the devil/. . . And all their houses we did set ablaze;/Of all their mosques both great and small/We left but one accursed heap,/For passing folk to cast their glance of scorn.\" And this, Judah writes, was a standard text throughout the former Yugoslavia, and was therefore routinely taught even to Bosnian Muslim schoolchildren. Not a single Serb I met spoke of the Albanians in Kosovo as if they were anything but an undifferentiated mass, the enemy. Repeatedly, and from sophisticated people, I heard about their \"over-breeding\". The ethnic Albanians and the Serbs may have lived side by side for centuries, but the Albanians are regarded as squatters. The tone many Serbs adopt when they speak of the Albanians reminds me of that used by some Israelis towards the Palestinians: that they are backward, alien, that there are too many of them and that they are in the wrong place. Their response to the ethnic cleansing is various, but ultimately amounts to a collective state of denial. Jasa, for instance, says, \"Where is the evidence of atrocities? It's Nato propaganda.\" In any case, to get rid of the KLA (funded by the CIA in much the same way as it funded Nicaragua's Contras, in his view), you have to shift the whole population. The war itself, Jasa continues, has nothing to do with humanitarianism but is a plot for US dominance of the world. \"Those people aren't real Kosovars, they are all illegal immigrants from Albania - they should go back where they came from,\" said one Serb asylum seeker. \"When I was doing my national service in Kosovo in the Eighties, my best friend was murdered by an Albanian. When they had autonomy, they were oppressing us. Now the Serbs are only protecting themselves.\" What unites all the Serbs I spoke to is the view that the Albanians are not being expelled or escaping ethnic cleansing, they're running away from the bombing, and they're lying to journalists. When I suggest that ethnic Albanians were fleeing Kosovo before the bombing, I was told that they were not real refugees but draft dodgers and deserters from the Yugoslav army. What keeps Milosevic in power is that he understands this Serb mentality, can push its buttons. His rise began in a famous speech in 1987 when, as leader of the League of Communists, he visited Kosovo and was met by angry members of the Serb minority, complaining of persecution. \"No one should dare to beat you,\" he cried. \"Yugoslavia does not exist without Kosovo! Yugoslavia would disintegrate without Kosovo! Yugoslavia and Serbia are not going to give up Kosovo!\" This speech ignited the dormant feelings of Serb nationalism that began to try to repel the break-up of Yugoslavia into separate countries. The disintegration of Yugoslavia had the deepest impact on the Serbs, for they were represented in large numbers in all of the regions that were clamouring for independence. Their future became insecure, as the Serbs' expulsion from Croatia would quickly prove. But Milosevic, a communist apparatchik, was telling them that the Serb sense of self was born in the monasteries and battlefields of Kosovo, that without it they were nothing, nobodies. To the Serbs, it is impossible to contemplate that their religious heritage could be located in a foreign land, conveniently forgetting that the birthplace of Christianity lies in a country that is not Christian. Ironically, the people who actually live in those monasteries have consistently refused to be manipulated by Milosevic's propaganda. Father Sava, deputy abbot of the Visoki Decani monastery in Kosovo, has consistently spoken out against the oppression of the ethnic Albanians in the name of saving the spiritual heritage of the Serbs. The monastery has taken in both Serb and Albanian refugees. It is openly opposed to the Milosevic regime. \"I dare say that the essence of our misunderstanding with the Belgrade regime is the fact that we care more about our people, while they seem to care more about their political interests,\" Father Sava has said in an on-line interview on the monastery's website www.decani.yunet. \"Several years ago, we said that their policy towards Kosovo and Metohija was wrong, and that it would it would inevitably lead to bloodshed - what happened eventually. For years, the policy of Belgrade towards Kosovo was based on unrealistic ideas and repression, which only strengthened the separatist feelings.\" One of the great surprises to the Americans of the Nato campaign was the realisation that a little light bombing would not cause the people of Serbia to turn against their leader. So why didn't they? Only two years ago, there were several months of mass demonstrations in Serbia and Milosevic was nearly overthrown. The demonstrations were sparked by attempts by Milosevic's party to tamper with the results of municipal elections. The attempts failed, but the coalition of opposition parties that had hoped to take power broke up amid quarrelling between its leaders. One of them, Vuk Draskovic, was co-opted into the Milosevic regime as deputy prime minister, until his sacking last week. That the Serbs didn't manage to get rid of their leader makes them even more guilty in the eyes of the world. If Milosevic is a fascist practitioner of genocide, why have they not got rid of him? Because they are fascists themselves? Or because they are so oppressed by fascism that they need Nato to help them? In comparing the war against the Serbs with the war against the Nazis, many people have become so accustomed to regarding the Belgrade regime as fascist that they fail to ask whether this is actually true. Those who live in Belgrade, who go to the rock concerts, who watch CNN on satellite TV, who talk on the phone to their friends and family abroad, who email them, don't seem to feel that they are living under fascism, and many of them are opponents of the regime. I asked Mark Mazower, reader in history at Sussex University and author of Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century (Penguin), if Serbia is fascist. \"In inter-war Europe, fascists were right-wingers, mostly anti-conservative, and certainly anti-communist and anti-capitalist, at least rhetorically,\" he says. \"Some were anti-Semitic, others not. All this was happening amid the collapse of democracy and the rise of self-confident, one-party states of left and right. So far as I can tell, Milosevic is not particularly anti-conservative, as there aren't any conservatives, in a west European sense, to be against. He is not anti-communist - that would be hard in his case - and not especially anti-capitalist, either. So what is left? \"Extreme nationalism, using very violent means to nationalist ends. And even there you have to be careful, since you have to explain the continued presence of ethnic Hungarians in Voyvodina and Muslims in the Sanjak. In other words, this is not so much about ethnic purity in a racial sense, like the Nazis, but about preserving the political predominance of the Serbs: neither the Hungarians of the Voyvodina nor the Sanjak Muslims threaten this. The Kosovar Albanians obviously do, especially once they fought back. So, I guess, he is not accurately described as a fascist, though I still can't stand him.\" The difficulty confronting those who wish to overthrow Milosevic is that the very people who might do so have left the country - an estimated 100,000 in the past decade, living in exile in Britain, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. They abandoned Serbia initially for economic reasons, then to escape the Balkan wars and, as it went on, the Milosevic regime. I met a group of six young men in Nebojsa's flat above a shop near Marble Arch. None of them would be identified. They came here seeking political asylum, and now we're at war with the country they're seeking asylum from. Dragon, a former economics lecturer at a Serbian university, came here two years ago, having been part of the anti-Milosevic demonstrations every day. Here, he works a night shift at Sainsbury's. Of the exodus from Yugoslavia, he says: \"The tragedy is that we tend to solve our problems as individuals. We wanted to be part of the world rather than make the world in our own country. But no country can stand having the youngest, most educated people leave. I stood there on the streets, day after day, during those demonstrations. What happened? We expected Milosevic to be reasonable, to resign, but he doesn't care. He doesn't care if people like him or not. The greatest punishment for us is to have to live with him.\" As we now know, instead of Nato's bombing turning the Serbs against Milosevic, it has turned them against the west. And these men, who now live here, who see the TV footage of the expulsion of the Albanians, who aren't exposed to Belgrade's propaganda, are no exception. As the evening goes on, these young men, who are drinking Bacardi and coke, get more and more angry, and more and more frustrating to listen to. They find it difficult to believe that the majority of the population of Britain support the air strikes simply because they are moved by the plight of the ethnic Albanian refugees, rather than because they are complicit in some over-arching Nato plan to dominate the world. Having grown up with censored media, they say, they are used to reading between the lines in press reports. They argue, with some justification, I think, that the Serb people have been poorly represented and understood by the western media, but when I ask why they do not form themselves into organisations that would demand air time, they reply, helplessly, \"They would not let us.\" Who wouldn't? The media wouldn't. All of this distorted thinking is directly a consequence of being a generation that is adrift between communism and capitalism. They are people without bearings, without any experience of how one might decide one's own future without resorting to the age-old Serb habit of fighting to the death against bitter odds with no particular end in sight except to resist. Their proudest claim is their victimhood. In this conflict, they regard themselves as the Jews, the victims of history, and are finding it bizarre and uncomfortable that another side, the Albanians, have been awarded that role. They lack the 20th-century Jewish determination to shape their own future, to say enough of the past. To do so would be to organise themselves into an alternative system to the present one, says Nebojsa, and, because of communism, \"system\" is now a dirty word. Nebojsa scorns the idea of Americans, who have a mere 200 years of history, telling the Serbs, with more than 1,000, what to do and what to think. All the men speak repeatedly of the dismemberment of Yugoslavia but only the Serbs continue to call their rump state by that name. They are like those Palestinians known as Rejectionists, who believe that one day the Israelis will leave or be driven out, and they will get their country back. But they also resemble those Israelis who know - but do not want to admit that they know - what is being committed against the Palestinians in their name. No one can live without a sense of self larger than the self. That is why national identities exist. In the solitude of the Decani Monastery, it is Father Sava who has understood the task facing the Serbs: not the abandonment of their national identity, but its reinvention. \"The fate of the Serbian people in all territories inhabited by Serbs and first of all in [Kosovo] depends on the ability of us to become aware of new political realities in Europe and the world, and at the same time to preserve the living link to our tradition, religion and culture. The maturity of one people is reflected in its capacity to overcome its past and understand its historical experience as a means to live better in the present time.\" You do not reinvent yourself while you are being bombed, but, one day, when this bloody war is over, the Serbs are going to have to chose between the sustaining memory of the radiant past or the rather more difficult business of planning the tomorrow. It can be done. I grew up from being a child who hated Germans into an adult who had German friends; part of the student generation of the Sixties that had faced the past and moved on from it, sought to construct a new national identity for Germany, built the Green movement, built post-war German pacifism and feminism. I was a child in the land of Rule Britannia, and I'm an adult in a land where there are British who do not obsess over our glorious defeat of the evil Hun in two world wars, but take their place in the European Community; British who concede that we are no longer a world power but a multi-ethnic state; English people who are allowing the peaceable break-up of their sovereign power. To live in the present or in the future - beyond the bombing, beyond the war: that is the choice the Serbs will have to make for themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/may/08/electionspast.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-08T02:30:29Z","webTitle":"A nation that will never be the same again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/08/electionspast.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/may/08/electionspast.uk","fields":{"headline":"A nation that will never be the same again","bodyText":"The new dawn did not break in clear sunshine, but came shrouded in mist. It would take hours for the daylight to grow stronger. Only then could you see how much had changed in a single night. And so it was across Britain, the slow breaking of a new dawn to reveal a country which might never be the same again. A night of unprecedented elections in Scotland and Wales, along with a batch of local contests in England, formed a picture of a nation peeling off into distinct, increasingly separate political cultures. May 6 did not herald the instant break-up of the United Kingdom that the nationalists dream of and the doomsayers fear. But it may be remembered as the start of a quieter, but no less dramatic process the end of British politics as we know it. For what happened yesterday saw the coronation of Labour as the dominant party in all three nations of the United Kingdom facing a different opposition in each. British politics now consists of Labour versus nationalism, in its Scottish, Welsh and English forms. Now it will be hard to have a single political conversation across the UK. Rather, Labour in Westminster will have to become like a version of the US military: ready to do battle on three fronts at once. And the enemy in each case is the same: nationalism. In Edinburgh, Labour will do battle with the Scottish National party, now represented by a parliamentary bloc six times larger than any it has enjoyed before. In Cardiff, it will face the nationalists of Plaid Cymru, who triggered an earthquake in Labour's valley heartlands snatching the totemic mining seat of the Rhondda and the former Neil Kinnock stronghold of Islwyn. In England, the main force opposing Labour will still be the party that once claimed to be the voice of the entire union, but is now reduced to the status of a fringe group west and north of the border. The Conservatives bagged more than 1,300 new council seats, sufficient to keep them the official opposition of England. But as a force in UK-wide politics, the Tories are vanishing before our eyes. They are becoming, by process of elimination, the ENP the English National party. So this is the new landscape. Labour the big player all over Britain, facing nationalists of different hues in each nation. Not that Tony Blair sees it that way. Yesterday he stood in Downing Street telling reporters that the vast majority voted against nationalism and that the union was strengthened, not weakened, as a result. In the narrowest sense he's right. The parties of formal separatism, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, did not win. Plaid's spectacular gains in certain spots should not hide the fact that overall it was beaten by a whacking majority of voters backing unionist parties. The SNP, too, will be disappointed not to have crossed the 40-seat threshold. That's why Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, who ran Labour's campaign in Scotland, are urging voters to interpret these results as a defeat for old-style nationalism and a victory for their brand of looser, devolved unionism. That Labour fell short of an overall majority in both Wales and Scotland was, according to Mr Blair yesterday, nothing more than a quirk thrown up by the new, proportional voting systems. But all that is to miss the point. For here's what happened as the prime minister of the United Kingdom was speaking in Downing Street yesterday. Scottish television interrupted him mid-sentence, choosing to cut away and carry instead the words of the new first minister of Scotland, Donald Dewar. In that one gesture, you could see Britain's future. Nationalism may have come second yesterday, but it does not represent the chief threat to the unity of the United Kingdom. For what has been unleashed by devolution is a new dynamic in British life, one that puts the distinct political cultures of our constituent nations first and Britain second. It's a subtle process, but the outlines are already visible. Mr Dewar will have to form a coalition, and that's bound to mean dropping policies that are UK Labour policy. Scottish Liberal Democrats are against tuition fees for higher education: they're demanding Mr Dewar bows to them, not Tony Blair. The pressure will be to tack left in Scotland, to heal the rift with Dennis Canavan the independent whose stand against control freakery by Labour's head office at Millbank struck such a loud chord in Falkirk and to win back the disillusioned hardliners of Glasgow who sent Tommy Sheridan, a Scottish Socialist, to Holyrood. The chancellor, for one, can see the battle ahead. He knows that Scottish Labourites will start arguing that theirs is a more leftwing country than England, that it requires a more radical message. He's preparing to tell the party that its victory yesterday did not come 'because Labour in Scotland is more socially responsible and community-minded than English Labour'. He knows where such talk leads. So a process begun by Labour may well have created its greatest headache. Somehow Mr Blair and Mr Brown have to lead a UK-wide party, offering a single message palatable both to tax-averse middle England and spending-minded Scotland. At the same time, they need to loosen the centralised grip which so obviously turned off voters in Wales. They have to fight that war on three fronts. But the bigger challenge is to Britain. Distinct cultures are blossoming in these islands, each with its own media, political class and national conversation. These societies are becoming less interested in each other Wales barely made a blip on the Scottish radar yet somehow we remain citizens of the same country. Britain may well survive this change. Other countries are loose federations and do just fine. But if we are to make it, we will have to change ourselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/may/08/religion.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-08T15:21:49Z","webTitle":"Is it millennium madness to drop AD and BC?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/08/religion.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/may/08/religion.uk","fields":{"headline":"Is it millennium madness to drop AD and BC?","bodyText":"Dear Joanna Bogle, The recommendation this week by the Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) to change the reckoning of time from BC, Before Christ, and AD, anno Domini, to BCE and CE (Before Christian Era and Christian Era), will seem to many non-Christian and secular Britons to be an appropriate and sensitive move. Different time scales are nothing new in human history, and many alternatives preceded the Christian era identified by Dionysius exiguus, 532 years after the Incarnation; the Romans reckoned AUC, ab urbe condita, from the foundation of the city of Rome (c753 BCE) and the Jews AM, anno mundi, from the creation of the world (c3761 BCE). There is nothing to stop particular religious communities from using their own terminology internally, but a different approach must surely be taken when used by secular media. Statistics show that there are more Hindus and Muslims in the United Kingdom today than there are members of the Church of England, and one of this country's great strengths is that it enshrines the principles of pluralism. Jews in the modern world have always used BCE and CE in association with historical dates - reflecting an understanding of time that transcends religious divides rather than being a polemic against another faith. This is terminology that should be understood in a wholly positive way as an inclusive gesture that should cause nobody offence and I welcome it wholeheartedly. Yours sincerely, Rabbi Charles Middleburgh Executive director, Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues Dear Rabbi Middleburgh, Watch out when government bureaucracy attempts to impose a new language rule. Such diktats often come with luggage attached: it's crucial to challenge them. The commission has no authority to change the language of our dating system and has never been asked to do so: it should stay within its legitimate remit. There is nothing 'appropriate' or 'sensitive' about the extension of its powers. Using the initials AD has been widespread since the sixth century. They stand for Latin words not in common use, offending no one: anno Domini. Translated they mean 'the year of the Lord', a beautiful expression which holds, for Christians, a special significance but which for others carries no meaning but honours history. Historians have often struggled with government hatred of old and noble expressions reflecting faith or features of a bygone age. Hindus and Muslims have not objected to the use of AD - in these secularised days they tend, if anything, to uphold such fragments of an older and more Christian Britain. The initials are no 'polemic against another faith', but attempting to ban them certainly is - so why support it? Why enthuse about a ban so insulting to Christians? Why speak only for the 'many secular and non-Christian Britons'? Why not look at the community as a whole? With best wishes, Joanna Bogle, Association of Catholic Women Dear Joanna, I acknowledge that the commission has no authority to challenge the language of our dating system, but that is surely not what they are doing. They are simply responding to a pluralistic, multi-faith and multicultural Britain and suggesting that inclusive rather than exclusive nomenclature is used. BCE and CE can be used by anyone who lives their non-religious lives according to the Gregorian calendar, whereas BC and AD can legitimately and correctly be used only by Christians. To suggest that the Broadcasting Standards Commission is pursuing a polemic against the Christian community seems to me to be somewhat paranoid; after all, they are not preventing Christians, or any other faith group, from using their own nomenclature in their own specific context. To use a phrase like 'hatred of old and noble expressions reflecting faith or features of a bygone age' seems to me to be hugely over the top. As we approach the dawning of a new era in time, and the end of a century soaked in the blood of innocents murdered as often as not in the course of religious disputes, it surely behoves those of us who live in a society whose hallmark is tolerance to support any moves that further this trait and make inter-faith coexistence ever more comfortable. The commission's advice disenfranchises nobody and I would hope that all people, with or without faith, would understand its true motive and give it their support. Yours sincerely, Charles Dear Charles, Calling opponents paranoid does not make any argument more convincing. It is surely common ground that the initials AD have not been, and are not today, used only by Christians. The whole debate centres on the fact that the initials are and have been in general use by people whose religious convictions are largely unknown. If we want a society 'whose hallmark is tolerance' we can usefully start by accepting the things we hold in common and are part of our history - even if their origins belong to a religion we do not share. The argument that AD can only be 'legitimately and correctly used by Christians' could also be used about celebrating Christmas, or Easter, or eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. And since in recent times we have seen attempts to start precisely this sort of daft campaign - with 'Happy Holidays' instead of 'Merry Christmas' and attempts to ban Christmas cribs in public spaces - those of us who seek a gentler and more decent approach are hardly 'over the top' in voicing our concern. The 20th century in Europe has seen the wholesale abandonment of Christian traditions - with dire results. The century has truly been 'soaked in the blood of innocents', not through religious disputes but largely in concentration camps run by the two great anti-Christian ideologies of the century. Both ideologies (Nazi and communist) sought to abolish Christian references in the calendar and replace the old traditions, and ceremonies with manufactured alternatives. Let us be wise and learn. With best wishes, Joanna Dear Joanna, I am sorry that you believe we are 'opponents' - it seems to me that you are painting a differing approach to a philosophical issue in rather stark terms! I do not believe that many thinking non-Christians use or have ever used BC and AD as nomenclature for time or history, and would regard BCE and CE as an excellent compromise that could embrace everybody. Christians could, after all, always read the letter 'C' as standing for Christ if they so chose. I wholeheartedly agree with the point that you make about the sloppy appropriation - or dilution - of religious festivals by those from a different religious tradition. Therein ultimately lies the path to their secularisation, and none of us to whom religion matters should contemplate that with equanimity. As for the legacy of Nazism and communism, about that we could debate for years. Suffice it to say that, red herring though it might be in this particular debate, I would hold unshakeably to the view that the Nazi genocide was a direct result of centuries of institutionalised and church-sponsored anti-semitism and intolerance, the absolute antithesis of the tolerant approach that I believe underpins the approach of the commission. Yours sincerely, Charles Dear Charles, It's a strong part of the Christian tradition to assume personal wrongdoing before criticising others. This is a useful notion (even though I'm always being told it brings 'Catholic guilt hangups'). So I apologise if my use of the word 'opponent' made you uncomfortable. But why does it? A good debate between opponents is healthy and important. Plenty of 'thinking non-Christians' have comfortably used the initials AD, and many will actively dislike CE because of its political overtones and deliberate fracture with past usage. There is a valuable and appreciated sense of history, beauty, and spirituality associated with AD that is a precious part of a common heritage. All will be poorer for its official banning, which is why thinking people of all faiths or none should join to make a dignified protest. Please join us. An unshakeably held personal opinion about the origins of Nazi genocide does not alter historical facts about Nazi (and communist) attempts to abolish Christian customs, traditions and calendar usage. Nor can it tarnish the truth that it was allies from nations of essentially Christian tradition that destroyed both evils. Why seek to ban the 'AD' that is part of such a noble heritage?

A few chairs are available, but only a handful are taken, all by elderly women. At 11am, there are already about a hundred people inside, and still they are coming, crossing themselves as they enter, kissing a picture of Christ next to which is a bunch of bluebells. Young men in puffa jackets with tired faces, as if they've come direct from the clubs, shake hands with each other. Old men stand in neat suits. The women are dressed smartly. Many of them have British passports, were born here, were pro-Nato - until Nato started bombing their families back in Serbia. The walls are covered with bright murals. The priest wears yellow robes and swings the silver censer. In the balcony, a choir is singing, unaccompanied by any organ. Everyone is quiet, but it's not the formal hush of a Church of England service. I close my eyes, and am startled to find that the priest's intonation reminds me of something very familiar from my childhood: a synagogue service. But these people are Serbs, so they must be genocidal fascists. Accusing fingers have been pointed at them in the aftermath of the Brixton nail-bomb attack and the murder of Jill Dando. I know all about despising other nationalities. I was brought up to hate Germans. We boycotted German products. Never set foot in Germany, was our motto. The congregation of this Serbian Orthodox Church consists of many men and women who fought for the British, often in British units, during the last world war. Demobilised at a time when Tito's Partisans were establishing a communist Yugoslavia, they chose to remain in Britain. They have lived most of their lives here, and their children and grandchildren were born here. There's a mother and daughter. When, in March 1941, the Serb generals (not the Croats, who were fascists) decided, crazily, to defy Hitler, the mother, who was then a 20-year-old student, stood waving a Union Jack outside the British Embassy in Belgrade. Today, her daughter, expressing the views of these confused and upset church-goers, says of the Nato bombing, \"One has this feeling of a terrible tragedy for all concerned. The worst thing is that those ordinary people in Serbia who are for the west are turning away from it. The western powers are doing the job for Milosevic. Next, they could alienate the youth in Russia. If there was a policy, if there was a strategy with an endgame . . . But policy is too good a word for it. I find it quite disappointing that British democracy is so frail that it has to resort to propaganda, to Clare Short on Woman's Hour comparing Tony Benn to an appeaser. The demonising of the Serbs hasn't encouraged Serbs to accept some responsibility for their actions.\" The divisions over the bombing of Serbia have cast it either as a rerun of the second world war, with Serbia playing the role of Nazi Germany, or as a rematch of the Vietnam war, with the Serbs as the Vietnamese and Milosevic, improbably, as Ho Chi Minh (on the basis, apparently, that the Americans are on the other side). But no war is like any other war, and there are not many in which the easily identifiable forces of good are ranged against the obviousness of evil My interest in the Serbs began several years ago. Early in 1993, I received a letter from a man called Jasa Almuli about an article of mine in which I had tried to find out whether the allegations of mass rape committed by Serbs in Bosnia were true, or if they were war propaganda. Ferocious figures were flying about: 50,000 women were supposed to have been violated by Serb brutes. The then-social services minister, Tim Yeo, was promising that no red tape was going to strangle the attempts by childless British couples to adopt the \"rape babies\" that were due to be born. The Daily Mail printed a picture of one of them, an adorable bundle - except that, as the doctor who had delivered her in a Zagreb maternity ward told me, she had been conceived before the war in Bosnia started. The Bosnian and Croatian authorities reported no increase in birth rates, not even much of one in the abortion figures. There was rape in Bosnia; of course there was. Rape in war was nothing new. What was new was that this was the first conflict monitored by a feminist organisation, which collected data. Jasa wanted me to know that Serb women in Bosnia had been raped, too, and that he had excellent contacts in Belgrade who could tell me about it. I went to see him because I was beginning to get curious about the point of view of the Serbs. They had, after all, been the victims of the first ethnic cleansing of the war, when 600,000 Serbs were forcibly expelled from the Krajina region of Croatia by the right-wing nationalist government, with not a peep of protest from the west. I wasn't sympathetic to the Serbs, not on their side; I just felt that there was a media black-out, that I wasn't being told everything I wanted to know. I was aware that I could easily put the Serbs into that comfortable trough of hate that had been excavated in my mind by my parents for the placing of Germans. It's hard work not having an enemy, a scapegoat to make you feel morally virtuous - whether it's greedy, powerful Americans if you're on the far left, or \"bogus asylum seekers\" if you're on the right. I went to see Jasa because he inhabited a most ironic place in the life of a nation that had been written off as genocidal thugs. Until the war in Bosnia had led him to leave Belgrade the previous year, he'd been president of that city's Jewish community - he is still honorary president of the Belgrade Holocaust survivors' organisation. He lived in a flat in Hampstead. I took him to be a man in his sixties, strong-faced, intelligent and well-informed. He was a retired journalist who had been posted to London in the Seventies as information officer for a Yugoslav investment bank. He had come back to Britain because two of his children lived here. At that time, no one much cared what the Serbs thought or who they were. I asked the editors of several papers to send me to Belgrade, but they said the story was in Bosnia, the story was war and its brutality, and the tragedy and suffering of a people terrorised by an evil enemy. Their leader, Slobodan Milosevic, spoke for them and spoke volumes about them. When Nato started bombing Serbia, I went to see Jasa again. He was now living in a sheltered housing block in north Finchley. A lifetime's commitment to liberal communism had earned him a modest, if comfortable old age. His brain was as alert as it had been at 22, when, on the first day of the German bombardment of Belgrade in 1941, understanding exactly what fascism was, he said to himself, \"I will avoid the Germans\", and set out on foot for the coast of Montenegro, where he had the extreme good fortune to fall into the hands of the Italians. Back in the summer of 1992, I had met Nebojsa, an asylum seeker here, and I had asked him to explain the war to me. \"The Serbs will never rest until they avenge the blood spilt at the battle of Kosovo, when we were defeated by the Turks and spent the next 500 years under the Ottoman Empire,\" he said, firmly. \"It was in 1389. We just had the 600th anniversary. Whatever happens in Bosnia will be nothing compared with what will happen when the war reaches Kosovo. Kosovo is everything. Bosnia is nothing.\" I contacted Nebojsa again when the Nato bombing of Serbia started. \"Why is Kosovo so important to you?\" I asked. \"It is not rational. It is not logical,\" he replied. \"It just is. This has nothing to do with Milosevic; this is about the Serb people. Every man in Serbia will die for Kosovo. If Nato sends in ground troops, I will go back to fight for Kosovo.\" But why? There is a joke the Serbs tell against themselves about the two Serb astronauts who land on the moon. One shoots the other and then plants the Serbian flag and declares, \"I claim this land for Serbia.\" Why shoot the other guy? Because, the astronaut says, wherever Serb blood has been spilt, that land becomes Serb. \"No one knows how the Serbs will react psychologically to the loss of Kosovo,\" a woman at the church had told me. Kosovo is the rock on which the Serbs have built a national identity, and a few bombs are not going to dislodge something constructed over centuries. Some years ago, Jasa asked his Serb friends if it might be possible to regard Kosovo not as their heart but as a gangrenous limb that it would be best to amputate. \"Get rid of it,\" he told them. \"It's not worth it. It's like a stone around the neck of Serbia. But the Serbs can't reason that way. It's their Jerusalem. Even smart people, intellectuals, can't reason that way. My son has schoolfriends who are now engineers in the refinery that was destroyed by Nato. My son asks his friends, \u0091Would you live in Kosovo? No. Then why don't you give it up?' But they can't.\" It is sometimes the way that those who live right inside a culture but are not quite a part of it have an understanding of that culture which is not open to those who never question or wonder at their own beliefs and values. This is why I wanted to talk to Jasa about who the Serbs are. Jasa's family arrived in Serbia in the 16th century, after one of the millennium's first great acts of ethnic cleansing, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. Unusually for that part of the world, Jasa has, in his own experience and his historical research, found very little evidence of anti-Semitism. His father, Isaac, was renamed Zarko by his customers, one of whom was the mayor of Kragujevac, where Nato recently destroyed the car factory. They became such pals that the mayor asked Jasa's father to be best man at his wedding. It is not an experience many Polish Jews could relate. Jasa is older than he looks. He was born in 1918 in Bucharest, \"by chance\", because his mother had gone to Romania as a refugee when Belgrade was under bombardment for the first of three occasions this century. What was it like to grow up among the Serbs? \"You can't be Serb if you are not born from a Serb mother and father,\" he said. \"They can accept you as a Jew, they won't persecute you as a Jew - you are welcome - but you can't become one of them. And I don't reproach them. I don't know if the British are sincere when they accept the notion that British Jews are British. \"The Serbs are nice people - not only do they have a fine sense of humour in a very difficult and tragic situation, but they are hospitable, friendly. Serbs, as all humans, have some bad traits and characteristics, but I wouldn't say they are cruel, as they are depicted now in the west.\" Jasa returned to Belgrade two months after liberation, as a journalist and liberal communist who believed in a mixed economy, and took a prominent role in the fight against Stalin's propaganda, part of Tito's attempt to preserve the nation from the control of either east or west. It is an important characteristic of the Serb's notion of individuality and independence that they chose to be non-aligned. What Tito's Yugoslavia never suppressed was the historic memory of defeat at Kosovo, which eventually led to Serbia's absorption into the Ottoman Empire and the reduction of the Serbs to an illiterate, labouring class. And anyway, how could communism eradicate what was the Serb's greatest literary achievement, an epic song cycle - transmitted orally for generations, collected by folklorists and finally written down in the 19th century during the great pan-European nationalist revival? The lullabies that mothers sang to their children had their roots in that same song cycle. It tells the story of how Prince Lazar was asked by the Prophet Elijah (in the guise of a hawk and, implausibly, delivering a message from the Virgin Mary, thus combining the Old and New Testaments) to choose between the kingdoms of Earth and Heaven. If they chose the latter, then Serbia would be lost, but a parallel Serbia would be built in heaven, the real and perfect nation. In his book, The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia (Yale University Press), Tim Judah argues that the story of Prince Lazar \"provided an explanation for the Serbs for their oppression under the Ottomans. It also identified the whole nation with the central guiding raison d'être of Christianity: resurrection. In other words, Lazar opted for the empire of heaven, that is to say truth and justice, so that the state would be one day resurrected. An earthly kingdom was rejected in favour of nobler ideals - victimhood and sacrifice - and this choice is to be compared with the temptations of Christ.\" Judah shows how the metaphor came to mean that, just as Christ was resurrected, so the Serbs couldn't lose. The sacred soil of Kosovo would be returned to them as Jerusalem was returned to the Jews. Nebojsa, who left Belgrade in 1989, tried to explain to me how, even for his atheistic generation brought up under Tito's communism, the Serbian Orthodox faith saturates the national character, and acts as an oppositional force to the western materialism and global economy that many feel Nato is attempting to impose by bombardment from the air. \"Religion is not just religion for us,\" he said. \"Above the material world is what you really are. Even during 500 years under the Turks, this feeling never went away.\" The sense of a mystical life, a parallel reality, is what sustains the Serbs now in a war with barely an ally, allows them to take refuge in a sense of the justice of their cause and of their resistance. They may be defeated, but in the heavenly realm they will be the victors. The oral transmission of the epic song cycle has knitted Kosovo into the fabric of society; it's far more than a boring exercise for sleepy schoolchildren. And, perhaps, the Serbs are scarcely aware that these poems contain the seeds of the hatred that leads to the current perception of them as fascists. Judah points out that one epic poem, The Mountain Wreath, gives an account of the revenge the Serbs took on Montenegrins who had converted to Islam: \"We put fire to the Turkish houses/That there might be neither stick nor trace/Of these true servants of the devil/. . . And all their houses we did set ablaze;/Of all their mosques both great and small/We left but one accursed heap,/For passing folk to cast their glance of scorn.\" And this, Judah writes, was a standard text throughout the former Yugoslavia, and was therefore routinely taught even to Bosnian Muslim schoolchildren. Not a single Serb I met spoke of the Albanians in Kosovo as if they were anything but an undifferentiated mass, the enemy. Repeatedly, and from sophisticated people, I heard about their \"over-breeding\". The ethnic Albanians and the Serbs may have lived side by side for centuries, but the Albanians are regarded as squatters. The tone many Serbs adopt when they speak of the Albanians reminds me of that used by some Israelis towards the Palestinians: that they are backward, alien, that there are too many of them and that they are in the wrong place. Their response to the ethnic cleansing is various, but ultimately amounts to a collective state of denial. Jasa, for instance, says, \"Where is the evidence of atrocities? It's Nato propaganda.\" In any case, to get rid of the KLA (funded by the CIA in much the same way as it funded Nicaragua's Contras, in his view), you have to shift the whole population. The war itself, Jasa continues, has nothing to do with humanitarianism but is a plot for US dominance of the world. \"Those people aren't real Kosovars, they are all illegal immigrants from Albania - they should go back where they came from,\" said one Serb asylum seeker. \"When I was doing my national service in Kosovo in the Eighties, my best friend was murdered by an Albanian. When they had autonomy, they were oppressing us. Now the Serbs are only protecting themselves.\" What unites all the Serbs I spoke to is the view that the Albanians are not being expelled or escaping ethnic cleansing, they're running away from the bombing, and they're lying to journalists. When I suggest that ethnic Albanians were fleeing Kosovo before the bombing, I was told that they were not real refugees but draft dodgers and deserters from the Yugoslav army. What keeps Milosevic in power is that he understands this Serb mentality, can push its buttons. His rise began in a famous speech in 1987 when, as leader of the League of Communists, he visited Kosovo and was met by angry members of the Serb minority, complaining of persecution. \"No one should dare to beat you,\" he cried. \"Yugoslavia does not exist without Kosovo! Yugoslavia would disintegrate without Kosovo! Yugoslavia and Serbia are not going to give up Kosovo!\" This speech ignited the dormant feelings of Serb nationalism that began to try to repel the break-up of Yugoslavia into separate countries. The disintegration of Yugoslavia had the deepest impact on the Serbs, for they were represented in large numbers in all of the regions that were clamouring for independence. Their future became insecure, as the Serbs' expulsion from Croatia would quickly prove. But Milosevic, a communist apparatchik, was telling them that the Serb sense of self was born in the monasteries and battlefields of Kosovo, that without it they were nothing, nobodies. To the Serbs, it is impossible to contemplate that their religious heritage could be located in a foreign land, conveniently forgetting that the birthplace of Christianity lies in a country that is not Christian. Ironically, the people who actually live in those monasteries have consistently refused to be manipulated by Milosevic's propaganda. Father Sava, deputy abbot of the Visoki Decani monastery in Kosovo, has consistently spoken out against the oppression of the ethnic Albanians in the name of saving the spiritual heritage of the Serbs. The monastery has taken in both Serb and Albanian refugees. It is openly opposed to the Milosevic regime. \"I dare say that the essence of our misunderstanding with the Belgrade regime is the fact that we care more about our people, while they seem to care more about their political interests,\" Father Sava has said in an on-line interview on the monastery's website www.decani.yunet. \"Several years ago, we said that their policy towards Kosovo and Metohija was wrong, and that it would it would inevitably lead to bloodshed - what happened eventually. For years, the policy of Belgrade towards Kosovo was based on unrealistic ideas and repression, which only strengthened the separatist feelings.\" One of the great surprises to the Americans of the Nato campaign was the realisation that a little light bombing would not cause the people of Serbia to turn against their leader. So why didn't they? Only two years ago, there were several months of mass demonstrations in Serbia and Milosevic was nearly overthrown. The demonstrations were sparked by attempts by Milosevic's party to tamper with the results of municipal elections. The attempts failed, but the coalition of opposition parties that had hoped to take power broke up amid quarrelling between its leaders. One of them, Vuk Draskovic, was co-opted into the Milosevic regime as deputy prime minister, until his sacking last week. That the Serbs didn't manage to get rid of their leader makes them even more guilty in the eyes of the world. If Milosevic is a fascist practitioner of genocide, why have they not got rid of him? Because they are fascists themselves? Or because they are so oppressed by fascism that they need Nato to help them? In comparing the war against the Serbs with the war against the Nazis, many people have become so accustomed to regarding the Belgrade regime as fascist that they fail to ask whether this is actually true. Those who live in Belgrade, who go to the rock concerts, who watch CNN on satellite TV, who talk on the phone to their friends and family abroad, who email them, don't seem to feel that they are living under fascism, and many of them are opponents of the regime. I asked Mark Mazower, reader in history at Sussex University and author of Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century (Penguin), if Serbia is fascist. \"In inter-war Europe, fascists were right-wingers, mostly anti-conservative, and certainly anti-communist and anti-capitalist, at least rhetorically,\" he says. \"Some were anti-Semitic, others not. All this was happening amid the collapse of democracy and the rise of self-confident, one-party states of left and right. So far as I can tell, Milosevic is not particularly anti-conservative, as there aren't any conservatives, in a west European sense, to be against. He is not anti-communist - that would be hard in his case - and not especially anti-capitalist, either. So what is left? \"Extreme nationalism, using very violent means to nationalist ends. And even there you have to be careful, since you have to explain the continued presence of ethnic Hungarians in Voyvodina and Muslims in the Sanjak. In other words, this is not so much about ethnic purity in a racial sense, like the Nazis, but about preserving the political predominance of the Serbs: neither the Hungarians of the Voyvodina nor the Sanjak Muslims threaten this. The Kosovar Albanians obviously do, especially once they fought back. So, I guess, he is not accurately described as a fascist, though I still can't stand him.\" The difficulty confronting those who wish to overthrow Milosevic is that the very people who might do so have left the country - an estimated 100,000 in the past decade, living in exile in Britain, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. They abandoned Serbia initially for economic reasons, then to escape the Balkan wars and, as it went on, the Milosevic regime. I met a group of six young men in Nebojsa's flat above a shop near Marble Arch. None of them would be identified. They came here seeking political asylum, and now we're at war with the country they're seeking asylum from. Dragon, a former economics lecturer at a Serbian university, came here two years ago, having been part of the anti-Milosevic demonstrations every day. Here, he works a night shift at Sainsbury's. Of the exodus from Yugoslavia, he says: \"The tragedy is that we tend to solve our problems as individuals. We wanted to be part of the world rather than make the world in our own country. But no country can stand having the youngest, most educated people leave. I stood there on the streets, day after day, during those demonstrations. What happened? We expected Milosevic to be reasonable, to resign, but he doesn't care. He doesn't care if people like him or not. The greatest punishment for us is to have to live with him.\" As we now know, instead of Nato's bombing turning the Serbs against Milosevic, it has turned them against the west. And these men, who now live here, who see the TV footage of the expulsion of the Albanians, who aren't exposed to Belgrade's propaganda, are no exception. As the evening goes on, these young men, who are drinking Bacardi and coke, get more and more angry, and more and more frustrating to listen to. They find it difficult to believe that the majority of the population of Britain support the air strikes simply because they are moved by the plight of the ethnic Albanian refugees, rather than because they are complicit in some over-arching Nato plan to dominate the world. Having grown up with censored media, they say, they are used to reading between the lines in press reports. They argue, with some justification, I think, that the Serb people have been poorly represented and understood by the western media, but when I ask why they do not form themselves into organisations that would demand air time, they reply, helplessly, \"They would not let us.\" Who wouldn't? The media wouldn't. All of this distorted thinking is directly a consequence of being a generation that is adrift between communism and capitalism. They are people without bearings, without any experience of how one might decide one's own future without resorting to the age-old Serb habit of fighting to the death against bitter odds with no particular end in sight except to resist. Their proudest claim is their victimhood. In this conflict, they regard themselves as the Jews, the victims of history, and are finding it bizarre and uncomfortable that another side, the Albanians, have been awarded that role. They lack the 20th-century Jewish determination to shape their own future, to say enough of the past. To do so would be to organise themselves into an alternative system to the present one, says Nebojsa, and, because of communism, \"system\" is now a dirty word. Nebojsa scorns the idea of Americans, who have a mere 200 years of history, telling the Serbs, with more than 1,000, what to do and what to think. All the men speak repeatedly of the dismemberment of Yugoslavia but only the Serbs continue to call their rump state by that name. They are like those Palestinians known as Rejectionists, who believe that one day the Israelis will leave or be driven out, and they will get their country back. But they also resemble those Israelis who know - but do not want to admit that they know - what is being committed against the Palestinians in their name. No one can live without a sense of self larger than the self. That is why national identities exist. In the solitude of the Decani Monastery, it is Father Sava who has understood the task facing the Serbs: not the abandonment of their national identity, but its reinvention. \"The fate of the Serbian people in all territories inhabited by Serbs and first of all in [Kosovo] depends on the ability of us to become aware of new political realities in Europe and the world, and at the same time to preserve the living link to our tradition, religion and culture. The maturity of one people is reflected in its capacity to overcome its past and understand its historical experience as a means to live better in the present time.\" You do not reinvent yourself while you are being bombed, but, one day, when this bloody war is over, the Serbs are going to have to chose between the sustaining memory of the radiant past or the rather more difficult business of planning the tomorrow. It can be done. I grew up from being a child who hated Germans into an adult who had German friends; part of the student generation of the Sixties that had faced the past and moved on from it, sought to construct a new national identity for Germany, built the Green movement, built post-war German pacifism and feminism. I was a child in the land of Rule Britannia, and I'm an adult in a land where there are British who do not obsess over our glorious defeat of the evil Hun in two world wars, but take their place in the European Community; British who concede that we are no longer a world power but a multi-ethnic state; English people who are allowing the peaceable break-up of their sovereign power. To live in the present or in the future - beyond the bombing, beyond the war: that is the choice the Serbs will have to make for themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/may/08/weekend7.weekend5","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-08T21:05:33Z","webTitle":"Exiles in the enemy camp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/08/weekend7.weekend5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/may/08/weekend7.weekend5","fields":{"headline":"Exiles in the enemy camp","bodyText":"It is a large church, and everyone is standing. A few chairs are available, but only a handful are taken, all by elderly women. At 11am, there are already about a hundred people inside, and still they are coming, crossing themselves as they enter, kissing a picture of Christ next to which is a bunch of bluebells. Young men in puffa jackets with tired faces, as if they've come direct from the clubs, shake hands with each other. Old men stand in neat suits. The women are dressed smartly. Many of them have British passports, were born here, were pro-Nato - until Nato started bombing their families back in Serbia. The walls are covered with bright murals. The priest wears yellow robes and swings the silver censer. In the balcony, a choir is singing, unaccompanied by any organ. Everyone is quiet, but it's not the formal hush of a Church of England service. I close my eyes, and am startled to find that the priest's intonation reminds me of something very familiar from my childhood: a synagogue service. But these people are Serbs, so they must be genocidal fascists. Accusing fingers have been pointed at them in the aftermath of the Brixton nail-bomb attack and the murder of Jill Dando. I know all about despising other nationalities. I was brought up to hate Germans. We boycotted German products. Never set foot in Germany, was our motto. The congregation of this Serbian Orthodox Church consists of many men and women who fought for the British, often in British units, during the last world war. Demobilised at a time when Tito's Partisans were establishing a communist Yugoslavia, they chose to remain in Britain. They have lived most of their lives here, and their children and grandchildren were born here. There's a mother and daughter. When, in March 1941, the Serb generals (not the Croats, who were fascists) decided, crazily, to defy Hitler, the mother, who was then a 20-year-old student, stood waving a Union Jack outside the British Embassy in Belgrade. Today, her daughter, expressing the views of these confused and upset church-goers, says of the Nato bombing, \"One has this feeling of a terrible tragedy for all concerned. The worst thing is that those ordinary people in Serbia who are for the west are turning away from it. The western powers are doing the job for Milosevic. Next, they could alienate the youth in Russia. If there was a policy, if there was a strategy with an endgame . . . But policy is too good a word for it. I find it quite disappointing that British democracy is so frail that it has to resort to propaganda, to Clare Short on Woman's Hour comparing Tony Benn to an appeaser. The demonising of the Serbs hasn't encouraged Serbs to accept some responsibility for their actions.\" The divisions over the bombing of Serbia have cast it either as a rerun of the second world war, with Serbia playing the role of Nazi Germany, or as a rematch of the Vietnam war, with the Serbs as the Vietnamese and Milosevic, improbably, as Ho Chi Minh (on the basis, apparently, that the Americans are on the other side). But no war is like any other war, and there are not many in which the easily identifiable forces of good are ranged against the obviousness of evil My interest in the Serbs began several years ago. Early in 1993, I received a letter from a man called Jasa Almuli about an article of mine in which I had tried to find out whether the allegations of mass rape committed by Serbs in Bosnia were true, or if they were war propaganda. Ferocious figures were flying about: 50,000 women were supposed to have been violated by Serb brutes. The then-social services minister, Tim Yeo, was promising that no red tape was going to strangle the attempts by childless British couples to adopt the \"rape babies\" that were due to be born. The Daily Mail printed a picture of one of them, an adorable bundle - except that, as the doctor who had delivered her in a Zagreb maternity ward told me, she had been conceived before the war in Bosnia started. The Bosnian and Croatian authorities reported no increase in birth rates, not even much of one in the abortion figures. There was rape in Bosnia; of course there was. Rape in war was nothing new. What was new was that this was the first conflict monitored by a feminist organisation, which collected data. Jasa wanted me to know that Serb women in Bosnia had been raped, too, and that he had excellent contacts in Belgrade who could tell me about it. I went to see him because I was beginning to get curious about the point of view of the Serbs. They had, after all, been the victims of the first ethnic cleansing of the war, when 600,000 Serbs were forcibly expelled from the Krajina region of Croatia by the right-wing nationalist government, with not a peep of protest from the west. I wasn't sympathetic to the Serbs, not on their side; I just felt that there was a media black-out, that I wasn't being told everything I wanted to know. I was aware that I could easily put the Serbs into that comfortable trough of hate that had been excavated in my mind by my parents for the placing of Germans. It's hard work not having an enemy, a scapegoat to make you feel morally virtuous - whether it's greedy, powerful Americans if you're on the far left, or \"bogus asylum seekers\" if you're on the right. I went to see Jasa because he inhabited a most ironic place in the life of a nation that had been written off as genocidal thugs. Until the war in Bosnia had led him to leave Belgrade the previous year, he'd been president of that city's Jewish community - he is still honorary president of the Belgrade Holocaust survivors' organisation. He lived in a flat in Hampstead. I took him to be a man in his sixties, strong-faced, intelligent and well-informed. He was a retired journalist who had been posted to London in the Seventies as information officer for a Yugoslav investment bank. He had come back to Britain because two of his children lived here. At that time, no one much cared what the Serbs thought or who they were. I asked the editors of several papers to send me to Belgrade, but they said the story was in Bosnia, the story was war and its brutality, and the tragedy and suffering of a people terrorised by an evil enemy. Their leader, Slobodan Milosevic, spoke for them and spoke volumes about them. When Nato started bombing Serbia, I went to see Jasa again. He was now living in a sheltered housing block in north Finchley. A lifetime's commitment to liberal communism had earned him a modest, if comfortable old age. His brain was as alert as it had been at 22, when, on the first day of the German bombardment of Belgrade in 1941, understanding exactly what fascism was, he said to himself, \"I will avoid the Germans\", and set out on foot for the coast of Montenegro, where he had the extreme good fortune to fall into the hands of the Italians. Back in the summer of 1992, I had met Nebojsa, an asylum seeker here, and I had asked him to explain the war to me. \"The Serbs will never rest until they avenge the blood spilt at the battle of Kosovo, when we were defeated by the Turks and spent the next 500 years under the Ottoman Empire,\" he said, firmly. \"It was in 1389. We just had the 600th anniversary. Whatever happens in Bosnia will be nothing compared with what will happen when the war reaches Kosovo. Kosovo is everything. Bosnia is nothing.\" I contacted Nebojsa again when the Nato bombing of Serbia started. \"Why is Kosovo so important to you?\" I asked. \"It is not rational. It is not logical,\" he replied. \"It just is. This has nothing to do with Milosevic; this is about the Serb people. Every man in Serbia will die for Kosovo. If Nato sends in ground troops, I will go back to fight for Kosovo.\" But why? There is a joke the Serbs tell against themselves about the two Serb astronauts who land on the moon. One shoots the other and then plants the Serbian flag and declares, \"I claim this land for Serbia.\" Why shoot the other guy? Because, the astronaut says, wherever Serb blood has been spilt, that land becomes Serb. \"No one knows how the Serbs will react psychologically to the loss of Kosovo,\" a woman at the church had told me. Kosovo is the rock on which the Serbs have built a national identity, and a few bombs are not going to dislodge something constructed over centuries. Some years ago, Jasa asked his Serb friends if it might be possible to regard Kosovo not as their heart but as a gangrenous limb that it would be best to amputate. \"Get rid of it,\" he told them. \"It's not worth it. It's like a stone around the neck of Serbia. But the Serbs can't reason that way. It's their Jerusalem. Even smart people, intellectuals, can't reason that way. My son has schoolfriends who are now engineers in the refinery that was destroyed by Nato. My son asks his friends, \u0091Would you live in Kosovo? No. Then why don't you give it up?' But they can't.\" It is sometimes the way that those who live right inside a culture but are not quite a part of it have an understanding of that culture which is not open to those who never question or wonder at their own beliefs and values. This is why I wanted to talk to Jasa about who the Serbs are. Jasa's family arrived in Serbia in the 16th century, after one of the millennium's first great acts of ethnic cleansing, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. Unusually for that part of the world, Jasa has, in his own experience and his historical research, found very little evidence of anti-Semitism. His father, Isaac, was renamed Zarko by his customers, one of whom was the mayor of Kragujevac, where Nato recently destroyed the car factory. They became such pals that the mayor asked Jasa's father to be best man at his wedding. It is not an experience many Polish Jews could relate. Jasa is older than he looks. He was born in 1918 in Bucharest, \"by chance\", because his mother had gone to Romania as a refugee when Belgrade was under bombardment for the first of three occasions this century. What was it like to grow up among the Serbs? \"You can't be Serb if you are not born from a Serb mother and father,\" he said. \"They can accept you as a Jew, they won't persecute you as a Jew - you are welcome - but you can't become one of them. And I don't reproach them. I don't know if the British are sincere when they accept the notion that British Jews are British. \"The Serbs are nice people - not only do they have a fine sense of humour in a very difficult and tragic situation, but they are hospitable, friendly. Serbs, as all humans, have some bad traits and characteristics, but I wouldn't say they are cruel, as they are depicted now in the west.\" Jasa returned to Belgrade two months after liberation, as a journalist and liberal communist who believed in a mixed economy, and took a prominent role in the fight against Stalin's propaganda, part of Tito's attempt to preserve the nation from the control of either east or west. It is an important characteristic of the Serb's notion of individuality and independence that they chose to be non-aligned. What Tito's Yugoslavia never suppressed was the historic memory of defeat at Kosovo, which eventually led to Serbia's absorption into the Ottoman Empire and the reduction of the Serbs to an illiterate, labouring class. And anyway, how could communism eradicate what was the Serb's greatest literary achievement, an epic song cycle - transmitted orally for generations, collected by folklorists and finally written down in the 19th century during the great pan-European nationalist revival? The lullabies that mothers sang to their children had their roots in that same song cycle. It tells the story of how Prince Lazar was asked by the Prophet Elijah (in the guise of a hawk and, implausibly, delivering a message from the Virgin Mary, thus combining the Old and New Testaments) to choose between the kingdoms of Earth and Heaven. If they chose the latter, then Serbia would be lost, but a parallel Serbia would be built in heaven, the real and perfect nation. In his book, The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia (Yale University Press), Tim Judah argues that the story of Prince Lazar \"provided an explanation for the Serbs for their oppression under the Ottomans. It also identified the whole nation with the central guiding raison d'être of Christianity: resurrection. In other words, Lazar opted for the empire of heaven, that is to say truth and justice, so that the state would be one day resurrected. An earthly kingdom was rejected in favour of nobler ideals - victimhood and sacrifice - and this choice is to be compared with the temptations of Christ.\" Judah shows how the metaphor came to mean that, just as Christ was resurrected, so the Serbs couldn't lose. The sacred soil of Kosovo would be returned to them as Jerusalem was returned to the Jews. Nebojsa, who left Belgrade in 1989, tried to explain to me how, even for his atheistic generation brought up under Tito's communism, the Serbian Orthodox faith saturates the national character, and acts as an oppositional force to the western materialism and global economy that many feel Nato is attempting to impose by bombardment from the air. \"Religion is not just religion for us,\" he said. \"Above the material world is what you really are. Even during 500 years under the Turks, this feeling never went away.\" The sense of a mystical life, a parallel reality, is what sustains the Serbs now in a war with barely an ally, allows them to take refuge in a sense of the justice of their cause and of their resistance. They may be defeated, but in the heavenly realm they will be the victors. The oral transmission of the epic song cycle has knitted Kosovo into the fabric of society; it's far more than a boring exercise for sleepy schoolchildren. And, perhaps, the Serbs are scarcely aware that these poems contain the seeds of the hatred that leads to the current perception of them as fascists. Judah points out that one epic poem, The Mountain Wreath, gives an account of the revenge the Serbs took on Montenegrins who had converted to Islam: \"We put fire to the Turkish houses/That there might be neither stick nor trace/Of these true servants of the devil/. . . And all their houses we did set ablaze;/Of all their mosques both great and small/We left but one accursed heap,/For passing folk to cast their glance of scorn.\" And this, Judah writes, was a standard text throughout the former Yugoslavia, and was therefore routinely taught even to Bosnian Muslim schoolchildren. Not a single Serb I met spoke of the Albanians in Kosovo as if they were anything but an undifferentiated mass, the enemy. Repeatedly, and from sophisticated people, I heard about their \"over-breeding\". The ethnic Albanians and the Serbs may have lived side by side for centuries, but the Albanians are regarded as squatters. The tone many Serbs adopt when they speak of the Albanians reminds me of that used by some Israelis towards the Palestinians: that they are backward, alien, that there are too many of them and that they are in the wrong place. Their response to the ethnic cleansing is various, but ultimately amounts to a collective state of denial. Jasa, for instance, says, \"Where is the evidence of atrocities? It's Nato propaganda.\" In any case, to get rid of the KLA (funded by the CIA in much the same way as it funded Nicaragua's Contras, in his view), you have to shift the whole population. The war itself, Jasa continues, has nothing to do with humanitarianism but is a plot for US dominance of the world. \"Those people aren't real Kosovars, they are all illegal immigrants from Albania - they should go back where they came from,\" said one Serb asylum seeker. \"When I was doing my national service in Kosovo in the Eighties, my best friend was murdered by an Albanian. When they had autonomy, they were oppressing us. Now the Serbs are only protecting themselves.\" What unites all the Serbs I spoke to is the view that the Albanians are not being expelled or escaping ethnic cleansing, they're running away from the bombing, and they're lying to journalists. When I suggest that ethnic Albanians were fleeing Kosovo before the bombing, I was told that they were not real refugees but draft dodgers and deserters from the Yugoslav army. What keeps Milosevic in power is that he understands this Serb mentality, can push its buttons. His rise began in a famous speech in 1987 when, as leader of the League of Communists, he visited Kosovo and was met by angry members of the Serb minority, complaining of persecution. \"No one should dare to beat you,\" he cried. \"Yugoslavia does not exist without Kosovo! Yugoslavia would disintegrate without Kosovo! Yugoslavia and Serbia are not going to give up Kosovo!\" This speech ignited the dormant feelings of Serb nationalism that began to try to repel the break-up of Yugoslavia into separate countries. The disintegration of Yugoslavia had the deepest impact on the Serbs, for they were represented in large numbers in all of the regions that were clamouring for independence. Their future became insecure, as the Serbs' expulsion from Croatia would quickly prove. But Milosevic, a communist apparatchik, was telling them that the Serb sense of self was born in the monasteries and battlefields of Kosovo, that without it they were nothing, nobodies. To the Serbs, it is impossible to contemplate that their religious heritage could be located in a foreign land, conveniently forgetting that the birthplace of Christianity lies in a country that is not Christian. Ironically, the people who actually live in those monasteries have consistently refused to be manipulated by Milosevic's propaganda. Father Sava, deputy abbot of the Visoki Decani monastery in Kosovo, has consistently spoken out against the oppression of the ethnic Albanians in the name of saving the spiritual heritage of the Serbs. The monastery has taken in both Serb and Albanian refugees. It is openly opposed to the Milosevic regime. \"I dare say that the essence of our misunderstanding with the Belgrade regime is the fact that we care more about our people, while they seem to care more about their political interests,\" Father Sava has said in an on-line interview on the monastery's website www.decani.yunet. \"Several years ago, we said that their policy towards Kosovo and Metohija was wrong, and that it would it would inevitably lead to bloodshed - what happened eventually. For years, the policy of Belgrade towards Kosovo was based on unrealistic ideas and repression, which only strengthened the separatist feelings.\" One of the great surprises to the Americans of the Nato campaign was the realisation that a little light bombing would not cause the people of Serbia to turn against their leader. So why didn't they? Only two years ago, there were several months of mass demonstrations in Serbia and Milosevic was nearly overthrown. The demonstrations were sparked by attempts by Milosevic's party to tamper with the results of municipal elections. The attempts failed, but the coalition of opposition parties that had hoped to take power broke up amid quarrelling between its leaders. One of them, Vuk Draskovic, was co-opted into the Milosevic regime as deputy prime minister, until his sacking last week. That the Serbs didn't manage to get rid of their leader makes them even more guilty in the eyes of the world. If Milosevic is a fascist practitioner of genocide, why have they not got rid of him? Because they are fascists themselves? Or because they are so oppressed by fascism that they need Nato to help them? In comparing the war against the Serbs with the war against the Nazis, many people have become so accustomed to regarding the Belgrade regime as fascist that they fail to ask whether this is actually true. Those who live in Belgrade, who go to the rock concerts, who watch CNN on satellite TV, who talk on the phone to their friends and family abroad, who email them, don't seem to feel that they are living under fascism, and many of them are opponents of the regime. I asked Mark Mazower, reader in history at Sussex University and author of Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century (Penguin), if Serbia is fascist. \"In inter-war Europe, fascists were right-wingers, mostly anti-conservative, and certainly anti-communist and anti-capitalist, at least rhetorically,\" he says. \"Some were anti-Semitic, others not.

Thoroughly decent he undoubtedly is. But he is also thoroughly clever, thoroughly resolute and thoroughly consistent in his beliefs. The older I get the more I admire the humble rather than the heroic virtues. However, Dewar would be in desperate trouble if there were not some steel in his character. Governing Scotland is going to produce interesting problems for its new first minister. Donald Dewar takes office in Edinburgh weighed down by three burdens. He believes in Scotland, devolution and an honest expression of beliefs. My guess - I have never thought it necessary to discuss the matter with him - is that he will not ever consider being a viceroy who implements Whitehall's policies north of the border. Yet that is undoubtedly the role Tony Blair wishes him to occupy. In Wales, Alun Michael - a willing satrap to the visors of Westminster - has gone out of his way to stress the need not to antagonise the United Kingdom Government. Looking for trouble would be foolish. But there will be moments when disputes are inevitable - otherwise the purpose of devolution is to be wholly vitiated. All the signs suggest that Scotland wants to be different - not simply in flags, anthems, ceremonies and the trappings of nationhood, but also in a huge variety of practical policies. Scotland remains Labour. That must bring the people's wishes into direct conflict with the Blair cabinet. During the summer I asked Donald Dewar if the worst excesses of Woodheadism had infected Scottish education policy - naming and shaming and that sort of absurdity. The Secretary of State for Scotland was too loyal to his cabinet colleagues to discuss the subject. He simply replied: 'We don't do that sort of thing up here'. There is no doubt that it was suggested that they should - indeed, that they should fall in with what passes for a Blair ideology over a whole range of policies. The decision on Scottish income tax (complicated by the economic illiteracy of the SNP), was taken more than a year before the Labour members of the Edinburgh parliament were even selected to fight their seats. And Westminster - or to put it more accurately Millbank Tower - will attempt to impose its will on the Scottish administration just as it attempts to impose its will on everything. No doubt Donald Dewar will resist the pressure - out of both personal conviction and political necessity. But he is in for a tough old time. Fortunately he is now his own man, not only in spirit but in constitutional fact. He is the first Labour politician since the election who can say with certainty that he does not owe his job to the Prime Minister. It would be a mistake to believe that - because he was John Smith's closest friend and will be 62 in August - Donald Dewar is unredeemed Old Labour. He was Tony Blair's personal choice for chief whip. It is impossible to imagine him displaying orthodox Blairite reverence for focus group findings, marketing techniques and thrusting businessmen with buttoned-down shirts and contempt for the trade unions. The party he leads - inside and outside the Scottish parliament - will be similarly sceptical of the apostasy called modernisation. We are facing the intriguing prospect of a Blairite government in London and a Labour government in Edinburgh. Paradoxically, a coalition will strengthen Dewar's ability to resist Millbank tyranny and ensure that policies north of the border remain a good deal more progressive that those to the south. Over a substantial part of the domestic programme, the liberals are to the left of New Labour - as witness the pre-election rumblings about not supporting a Dewar administration unless it changes its policy on university tuition fees. A conflict across the border is unavoidable. Enthusiasts for devolution have always believed that once the process started, the demand for its extension would be irresistible. It is at least possible that the same process of centrifugal political force will spin progressive policies south. The Scottish people have voted for real Labour. They can demonstrate that real Labour works and provides better health, better housing and better education. Dewar, with a place in the history books secure, might feature in future political texts. He could preside over the beginning of the counter revolution. Not bad for a thoroughly decent man."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/may/10/sarahboseley","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-10T02:13:00Z","webTitle":"Top midwife in discipline case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/10/sarahboseley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/may/10/sarahboseley","fields":{"headline":"Top midwife in discipline case","bodyText":"Caroline Flint, the radical independent midwife who became the first elected president of the Royal College of Midwives, is facing a disciplinary body today on seven charges of professional misconduct relating to a baby girl she delivered who died. The parents had wanted a home birth, but because of the breech position of the baby the mother had to be transferred to hospital. Ms Flint is accused of failing to give the parents sufficient information that might have led the mother to have extra scans during the pregnancy and possibly opt for a caesarian delivery, failing to monitor mother and child properly, failing to get the help of a doctor when it was needed, and keeping inadequate notes. The baby girl died soon after she was born at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in west London in 1995. It is believed she was starved of oxygen, probably even before the mother, herself a midwife, went into labour. The mother, who will be referred to as Mrs A during the hearings brought by the United Kingdom Central Council for nurses, health visitors and midwives, required emergency surgery. Ms Flint, who founded the first private birth centre in this country, where women can have babies as if at home, links the case against her to two well-publicised cases against prominent independent midwives in Ireland and in France, which are coincidentally to be heard today and tomorrow. She and high-profile supporters, such as the childbirth specialist Sheila Kitzinger, point to persistent opposition to home births. Ms Flint claims that she, Ann Kelly in Dublin and Suzanne de Bearn in the Dordogne are all under attack by a medical establishment that refuses to believe birth can be safe unless it is in a medical setting where obstetricians and hi-tech equipment are at the ready. In neither the Kelly nor the De Bearn cases is it alleged that babies were harmed, only that they might have been. The claim is that both women, senior independent midwives, effectively take risks by not working in a medical setting. Ms Kelly, 65, is accused by senior maternity hospital officials of delaying the transfer to hospital of women in labour when complications set in. She has been suspended from practising by the Irish high court for two years pending the fitness to practice hearing beginning today. Ms de Bearn, 84, is fighting the closure of the Ste-Therese maternity centre in Sarlat, which she founded and which is the only non-hospital birth centre in France. French law dictates that any maternity unit requires facilities for surgery and a full-time pediatrician, anaesthetist and obstetrician as well as midwife. Ms Flint, 57, argues that she has been cleared by two investigations, although reprimanded over record-keeping. This week, she alleges, 'threatens to be the night of the long knives for pioneers within the profession'. The three women 'are all being tried by their own profession as dangers to the public'. At the hearing, the couple will allege that Ms Flint did not check on the baby's heartbeat often enough. It is understood they will say they realised only after the successful birth of their second child, also a breech delivery, that there should have been far more checks during the first pregnancy and continuous monitoring during labour. It is understood they believe the care was not good enough. The baby might have died anyway, but they do not know. Friends said the couple were worried about being portrayed as out for vengeance, which was not the case. For a long time they believed Ms Flint 'was wonderful', and only the birth of the second child persuaded them to complain. Ms Flint, who has been an inspiration to many, points to her exemplary record, but she is a controversial figure. During her year as president of the royal college, there were serious clashes and a failed attempt to oust her. She believes that some in the establishment are out to get her, but the difference between her case and those of Ms Kelly and Ms de Bearn is that a baby died and there are serious charges to answer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/may/10/guardianletters1","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-10T02:14:20Z","webTitle":"Talking to ourselves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/10/guardianletters1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/may/10/guardianletters1","fields":{"headline":"Talking to ourselves","bodyText":"Jonathan Freedland says: 'British politics now consists of Labour versus nationalism, in its Scottish, Welsh and English forms.' (We may never be the same again, May 8). And adds: 'Now it will be impossible to have a single political conversation across the UK.' How sad. But it never has been a single conversation except in London, error or arrogance. For the United Kingdom is a multi-national state, not a nation state with a common culture. Labour, indeed all unionists, should attack separatism not nationalism and be careful not to feed the SNP delusion or deceit that they alone represent Scottish nationalism. Nearly all Scots are strongly and proudly conscious of being a nation, but a majority are not separatists. Some of the SNP vote is obviously, a protest vote. To attack nationalism rather than separatism has been a frequent political mistake. Of course it is possible to have a 'political conversation across the UK', but it is a more complicated, nuanced and interesting dialogue than you will allow. Bernard Crick Edinburgh So Labour will govern north of the border with the help of the Lib Dems (Scotland heads for coalition government, May 7). It surely is an insult to the Scottish people for the largest party to ignore the second (or even the third) largest party and go to the fourth largest to do a deal. We now have the unedifying prospect of the least popular party in Scotland having a share of power as a result of English New Labour's paranoia. Mick Williams Stoke-on-Trent There were three ballot papers not two (Scots begin to celebrate, May 7). One for a Scottish Parliament candidate to represent the voters' local constituency. Another for the regional additional members list, and a third for the local authority election. Each paper was a different colour. What's so difficult about that? Some people might need to resort to pencil and paper to work out the top-up figures. It is not necessary to know anything about this to vote, although an understanding of the consequence - that in most regions, 5.8 per cent of the vote guarantees a seat - might help those thinking of voting tactically.

A city which has succeeded in acquiring its own Prada outlet is congratulated for its go-getting triumph, while a city lacking an elegant new Absinthe bar an object of delicious pity. If the average inhabitant can afford to buy a reasonably nice house, all is clearly not well. There has been some optimistic speculation in recent weeks about what the post-devolution Scotland and Wales will come to look like, and some bleak pessimism, but both sides share a general idea that success will be measured by the number of rich people who cheer the countries up. A rejuvenated Glasgow would be one bustling with consumption and Gucci and fashionable returnees, as if the thing that makes poor people better off is rich people. In almost all the commentary from London, there is a shared assumption that if devolution fails to deliver more expensive restaurants, devolution will have failed. The poverty facing the new leaders of Scotland and Wales reaches depths difficult for much of the United Kingdom to countenance, and if devolution does nothing to lift people from it, all the fine justice of home rule will be a lame consolation. But if Scots and Welsh cities merely succeed in winning the approval of lifestyle arbiters by becoming more like London, the prize will have been a disappointment. We all know that poverty is a relative term, but do not always follow the logic that this implies - which is that poverty is a meaningless enemy unless it is fought within an understanding of the effects of inequality. In the past month alone, we have learned the following about inequality. Friends of the Earth have informed us that families with incomes of less than £5,000 are twice as likely to suffer from industrial pollution as those with over £60,000; in London, 90 per cent of the dirtiest factories are in badly-off communities. Less than 1 per cent of polluting factories in Britain are based in areas averaging a household income of £30,000 or more. The total number of people dying of heart disease is rising, but a report found that among under-64's in social class one, the number is in such steep decline that the disease will soon be almost negligible. Another study found that the difference in survival rates of cancer between the most deprived and most affluent is as high as 16 per cent; if everyone diagnosed with cancer between 1986 and 1990 had enjoyed the same chance of survival as the most affluent patients, 12,745 lives would have been saved. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that the number of children living in poverty has risen from one in 10, 30 years ago, to one in three. At just 22 months, children from social classes one and two are already 14 percentage points higher up the educational development distribution than those in four and five, and if their father is in the top quarter of earners, their chances of ending up likewise are four times greater. Where only one in five pupils from a workless household get five good GCSEs', four out of five from professional families do so, and this gap is widening every year. The gulf between successful and struggling schools is also growing wider - and the significance of the social class of intake grows more pronounced every year. It is one thing to be the kind of person who thinks it inevitable, and probably right and proper, that not everyone can afford a digital camcorder. It is even one thing to sniff and wonder how come, if the poor are so poor, they've got Sky TV - but it is quite another to feel relaxed about an economic arrangement which consigns children to poverty before they are out of nappies, and their parents to a needlessly early death. Whatever your views on people's entitlement to luxury goods, an entitlement to opportunity and health is not up for debate. It is Scotland and Wales which bear a disproportionately high burden of the UK's poor - a third of the population of Strathclyde and Central Clydeside live in workless households - and which face the biggest challenge when trying to fulfil Labour's 1997 promise to make Britain 'a more equal society'. The mistake would be to imagine that this can be achieved by plumping up the numbers and wealth of the higher end of the income spectrum. When we talk about inequality, what we overlook is that inequality is not just a disaster for the hapless who find themselves at the raw end of the deal, but that it damages us all. All research indicates that the more equal a society, the healthier, more stable, cohesive and happy it is. In the US, levels of homicide, violence and domestic conflict are all directly related to income inequality. Accidents and alcohol-related deaths correlate likewise - but all the differences in health we know about have less to do with inequalities in available health care, or exposure to material dangers, but to the psychological effects of living in a social hierarchy structured around acute income inequality. The greater the culture of inequality, the lower the levels of social trust and support, and the higher the levels of aggression. 'I have yet,' said a prison psychiatrist, writing about violence, 'to see a serious act of violence that was not provoked by the experience of feeling shamed and humiliated, disrespected and ridiculed, and that did not represent the attempt to prevent or undo this loss of face - no matter how severe the punishment.' If you compare a violent society with a relatively peaceful one, the single biggest difference is income inequality. This all seems so transparently obvious that it is strange for us still to be thinking of the poor in Scotland and Wales as a problem to solved by dangling wealth in their city centres. If a devolved nation's greatest achievement is to expand and upgrade its affluent class, its poorest people do not become literally more poor - but their sense of their relative status is impoverished, and this is not an achievement. The new Scotland and Wales are physical evidence of a new political era, and London likes to think its attitudes have changed - the political culture in Westminster no longer buys the trickle-down fantasies of Thatcherism, still less the crude lie that inequality is virtuous and healthy. And yet, the way in which London discusses the future of England and Wales suggests that an imaginative leap is yet to be made. One of the distinctive qualities of Scots and Welsh politics has always been their egalitarian tradition. The success of devolution ought not be measured by the extent to which these nations overcome their egalitarian ideals, in favour of judging their success by the price of a nice apartment - but, quite the opposite, the extent to which they can establish their own measure of success by fulfilling them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/may/10/scotlanddevolution.devolution3","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-10T02:15:34Z","webTitle":"Tony versus Donald","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/10/scotlanddevolution.devolution3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/may/10/scotlanddevolution.devolution3","fields":{"headline":"Tony versus Donald","bodyText":"I wish that political commentators would stop calling Donald Dewar 'thoroughly decent'.

Possibly the wrong target","bodyText":"Even by the standards of HSBC, the absorption of Republic New York Corporation and its private banking offshoots, in some of the world's richest marketplaces, is a substantial purchase. In fact there is so much goodwill involved that HSBC feels the need to improve its capital base by placing up to $3bn of new shares. There is much talk from HSBC about the cost savings it can engineer by integrating Republic with its existing American operations, namely Marine Midland, and the deal will allow it to bulk up in treasury and global markets business as well as US domestic and commercial banking. This will significantly improve HSBC's North American profile at a time when other European banks such as Deutsche are doing much the same. The jewel in the Republic crown, however, is not the regular banking business - which caught a chill in last year's Russian meltdown - but its private banking franchise. By dint of his special skills in private banking, Edmond Safra has created a network from Switzerland to Monaco, servicing some 30,000 clients with assets in excess of $50bn. HSBC, with its strong global franchise, stretching from Hong Kong to Latin America, is buying into a skills base at Safra which knows how to manage assets soundly and collect the fees which richer investors are prepared to pay. Clearly, now that Asia is on the way back there will be wealthy investors in the region very interested in what HSBC can now offer. But there are some risks in all of this. The Safra private banking network is a very personal creation built around a particular diaspora of Middle Eastern exiles. The concern for HSBC must be that this client base will go walkabout, as was the case when American Express bought a previous Safra bank in 1986. HSBC chairman John Bond may have chosen the right market by expanding in New York. But it may be the wrong target. Hipic cash-call The progress made on the debt initiative for the world's poorest countries at the recent Washington meetings of the IMF/World Bank was impressive. Finance ministers from the richer countries effectively agreed to broaden the initiative to up to 40 poor nations, to deepen the scale of relief available and speed up disbursement wherever possible. But all this comes at a substantial cost. The IMF share of a broader and deeper, highly indebted poor country initiative (Hipic), is to be met from sales of gold. Opinion at the spring meetings appeared to be settling around a figure of 10m ounces, twice what was originally proposed, to create a hipic trust fund with some $3bn. But while this solved the problem of what to do about the IMF's share of debt relief, it did not address the World Bank role. At present, hipic funds are found directly from the bank's income stream, the profit it earns on its loans to better off emerging market economies. However, that income stream - even if there were to be a World Bank capital increase which would allow higher lending levels - can only be stretched so far. If there is to be an improved hipic in place before year end, as is the target, then other sources of cash will have to be found. Gordon Brown, who has been among those leading the charge in this area, proposed at the Church of Scotland General Assembly that the world's richer countries put together a new trust fund of $1bn to supplement the World Bank's internally generated resources. By all accounts, the United Kingdom will come up with its commitment in the next few weeks, ahead of the Cologne summit, in the hope of galvanising others into action. Given the current competition among the richer countries to do more rather than less, it will be fascinating to see just who else comes through with the new cash. Cable threat The suggestion by Granada chief executive Charles Allen that the group might seek an international partnership for its media interests - as part of an effort to crystalise their value - seems a sensible enough approach. Within the Granada group, with its range of interests from service stations to food outlets and hotels, it is quite difficult for investors to place a full value of the media interests. In the last week there has been a tendency to see Granada as a company under threat: the price-cutting war opened up by Rupert Murdoch having cast a shadow over ONdigital. But the reality is that ONdigital's system is simpler, does not involve satellites and requires much less intrusive installation. The real threat to ONdigital is not so much BSkyB but the possibility that cable may finally get its act together, now that there are more aggressive investors, AT&amp;T and Bill Gates's Microsoft, in the business. It is when measured against such giants that it would seem good sense for Granada to seek a more global partner. But when assessing Granada it would be a mistake to see the group as simply a distributor or carrier. It is a distinguished programme maker which over the decades has shown an ability to produce a consistently popular stream of content. Marks sparks There seems to be a near obsession at present with the very modest Marks &amp; Spencer rationalisation programme. Slimming down the layers of management and refocusing the business obviously is a useful way forward but it will produce relatively modest savings (perhaps £20m a year) and will not by itself turn around the business. That will be largely dependent on restoring sales growth. Judging from the sales figures of rivals, such as John Lewis, the high street remains sluggish. But there are signs that some of the old elan is returning to the St Michael brand. This can be seen from the more aggressive approach to advertising, focusing on quality and flexibility, and the better reception accorded to the summer lines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/may/11/scotlanddevolution.devolution1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-11T01:15:06Z","webTitle":"They have to toe the Labour line","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/11/scotlanddevolution.devolution1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/may/11/scotlanddevolution.devolution1","fields":{"headline":"They have to toe the Labour line","bodyText":"Ever since the referenda in 1997 made devolution to Scotland and Wales a reality, the Labour Party has studiously avoided the central question it raises. The question is simply: should a political party devolve as much autonomy to its members in Scotland and Wales as Westminster has done to the Scottish and Welsh people? For many in Scotland the answer is obvious. Labour MSP Malcolm Chisholm responded to the possibility of the Labour leadership intervening in negotiations between its Scottish leader, Donald Dewar, and the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Jim Wallace, by saying: 'Devolution is about people in Scotland making the decisions.' This view was echoed by Paddy Ashdown: 'Devolution is about leaving things to the Scots. It's about time London Labour realised this.' But this is to confuse national devolution with internal party decision-making. There is another view, which I suspect is held widely among senior Labour politicians.It sees membership of a party as indicating acceptance of its core political identity. Of course devolution means negotiation over the degree to which Scottish and Welsh Labour can adopt different policies. But this debate is not about the fundamental right of Scottish Labour to exercise devolved powers versus the control-freak tendencies of London. It is between two equally legitimate positions: the expectation that governmental devolution implies some party devolution; and the principle that a party's integrity depends upon it embodying a single set of values, principles and core policies regardless of where it operates. Devolution gave the people of Scotland and Wales the right to elect their own government, not to redesign the political platform of each party. The fact that Labour in London has not expressed the latter view more widely in recent months does not indicate a lack of conviction. Rather it reflects sensitivity to the SNP's tactic of portraying Donald Dewar as a poodle of Millbank. With Dewar's position as first minister apparently secure and the nationalist threat beaten back, this constraint has been lifted. The principle of one party, one policy is already accepted in relation to local government. Regardless of the devolved powers of councils, the NEC provides strong guidance on the policies of local Labour groups. Ever since Neil Kinnock's assault on the Militant-dominated Liverpool Labour group at the 1985 annual conference, there has been a recognition that local Labour must toe the national line in politically sensitive areas. Even if Labour had a more relaxed view of local difference, the Conservatives and the media have sought to damage the party's national image by exposing the alleged excesses of Labour councillors. The British Labour Party has every reason to have a stake in the policies and practices of Scottish and Welsh Labour. It is a question of branding. The emergence of a Scottish Labour brand very different to that of Wales and England would undermine the credibility and coherence of British Labour as a whole. And this is the brand that will be on offer to the electorate in the next general election. None of this is to deny the significance of devolution. The next few years will see four public policy laboratories spring up side by side in the United Kingdom. The issue of tuition fees is politically charged and concessions may be too much for Labour's leaders to accept. But on issues that arouse less partisan feelings, real differences are bound to emerge. English critics of the A level are expressing interest in a Welsh baccalaureate. Equal-opportunities campaigners envy the requirement on Northern Irish public authorities actively to promote equality. Campaigners in devolved policy areas may make the tactical choice to take their battle to Cardiff or Edinburgh, using success there as a bridgehead back into Westminster. But to suggest that devolution to the Scottish parliament means that Scottish Labour politicians have free rein to redesign the party's values and core policies is to deny the very definition of a political party. Devolution is one of the proudest achievements of - note every word - British New Labour. Some in Labour's Scottish ranks appear to feel that having been carried to power on the shoulders of the British party, they can now dispense with its services. Their argument threatens not just the integrity of the union but denies one hundred years of Labour history. Matthew Taylor is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research.

Having opened Paul McCartney's childhood home in Liverpool last summer, the National Trust has moved back several musical decades and opened its first Jazz Age house the 1920s home of the D'Oyly Carte family, owners of the opera company and the Savoy and Claridge's hotels. Alan Powers, the 20th century architectural historian who has worked with the trust on the house, has a theory that the stark interiors of Coleton Fishacre and other houses of the period are due to the cocktails. The inhabitants were permanently unsteady on their pins and didn't want too much furniture to bump into. The trust has accepted his theory with enthusiasm. Almost every room has its tray of cocktail glasses and shaker except the bathrooms, which instead offer sumptuously hand-blown crystal sponge and soap dishes, recreated for the house by Dartington glass. Real surviving buildings and interiors of the art deco twenties and thirties are rare, but next month English Heritage opens the restored Courtauld Wing of Eltham Palace in London. The work cost £2.5m, with specially made carpets, textiles and furniture. The National Trust achieved its restoration of Coleton Fishacre for £20,000, by begging and borrowing. More offerings are coming in daily, including a 1920s nightdress case found in a charity shop by a volunteer guide. The British Council is lending back a painting of Venice by Sickert, which has been in Rome since 1948 but was originally intended as the focus of the imposing oak staircase. The trust has owned Coleton Fishacre, on a headland near Dartmouth, since 1982, but it has never been open to the public. The estate was mainly acquired for the sake of the coastal path passing the garden gate, as the trust sought to acquire hundreds of miles of coastline. The house has been restored partly in response to 15 years of visitors to the spectacular garden pressing noses to the windows trying to see in. 'The whole point of this house was to look out and admire the views of the garden and the sea,' said Ceri Johnson, the trust's historic buildings officer, who has spent two years researching the history of the house. It was built in 1926 for Rupert D'Oyly Carte whose father, Richard, founded the opera company and forged the partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan and Lady Dorothy Gathorne-Hardy, daughter of the Earl of Cranbrook. The architect was Rupert Milne, who also designed the ballroom wing for Claridge's. A painted map shows a little sunlit kingdom full of escapist happiness, Rupert seated on the headland with his dalmatian. In fact the marriage did not survive the death of their only son in a car accident. Lady Dorothy left in 1936, and Rupert remained until his death in 1948, when the house was sold by his daughter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/may/14/guardianletters4","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-14T01:40:00Z","webTitle":"Burchill's breastbeating","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/14/guardianletters4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/may/14/guardianletters4","fields":{"headline":"Burchill's breastbeating","bodyText":"Julie Burchill's writing is beautiful. She knows when I joined the NME not long after her that I plagiarised her style and agreed with everything she said to the point of absurdity. But her latest tirade (Breastfeeding. It sucks, May 12) is a contrary position purely for effect. It is ludicrous to suggest mainly wealthy middle-class women breast-feed. My partner, who Julie would call a 'prole chick', selflessly decided to breast-feed our baby daughter Eve for six months - to ensure she didn't suffer the debilitating asthma and eczema I had as a bottle-fed baby. Now, at 14 months, Eve is a healthy toddler while at the same age I was on an oxygen mask in hospital covered in coal tar bandages. Also Julie might like to know that, as a baby, our daughter recognised Tinky-Winky as clearly as her mother's breast. As for me I'm still on the tit at 38! Paul Wellings Colchester, Essex Thank you, Julie Burchill, for taking on the tyranny of the breastfeeding lobby. My baby wanted to breastfeed constantly and I sat feeding hour after hour. I needed physiotherapy for the resulting back problem. The only break I got was when my partner gave the baby a bottle of formula. No instruction was given in hospital on how to sterilise bottles or prepare a feed, and I didn't feel able to ask the midwife, who made it clear that she disapproved of giving the baby formula. I finally got some proper assistance from the health visitor, who was non-judgmental and actually considered my needs. The advice given by different professionals in hospital can be conflicting. I know of instances where babies have been admitted to the special baby unit with dehydration, after their mothers followed the advice of the breastfeeding advocates, rather than the doctors who advised supplementing breastmilk with formula. Breastfeeding delayed my recovery from an extremely traumatic birth, and was one of a number of factors con tributing to my developing post-natal depression. I developed mastitis four times in the three months that I breastfed, as my immune system was so low. A woman should be helped to find the most appropriate feeding method(s) for her and the baby, within the context of her physical, psychological, social and economic situation. She should not be made to feel punished and guilty at a time when she can already be highly vulnerable, and is often trying to manage feelings of incompetence and inadequacy in coping with a new baby. Alison Hunt London How dare Julie Burchill have a go at breastfeeding? Overworked midwives spend a lot of time educating people to the advantages of breastfeeding and helping women to establish it. The National Childbirth Trust advert will be trying to reach young girls who might not even have thought of doing it. Breastfeeding is mostly very rewarding and a lot easier than messing about with bottles. What's the 'male medical establishment'? Most midwives are women. As are more than a few GPs and obstetricians. Liz Warrington (Midwife) Chester While I, and I am sure the vast majority of people would agree with Working Class Spice on the right to breastfeed or not, the vituperative tone of her article was astonishing. Is she all right? Dr Arthur Gould Loughborough Was Julie Burchill bottlefed? Her article read like it was written by a silly cow. Ann Marie Legge Oxford ...and other outrages Home birth was phased out in the 1960s because of the strongly held beliefs of senior obstetricians that hospital birth was safer. In fact there is no hard evidence for this. In the 1990s, as the NHS moves towards the practice of evidence-based medicine, the Royal College of Gynaecologists recommended that 'Home birth is an acceptable option and appropriate information should be provided.' Catherine Bennett (Natural born backlash, G2, May 13) criticises Ms Flint and other midwives whose practice has been attacked, for seeing underlying medico-political motives. She underestimates the importance of such a context. Dr Marsden Wagner, the former director of maternal and child health for WHO Europe, wrote in the Lancet of 'a global witch-hunt', referring to the persecution of doctors and midwives who were attempting to give women real choice. To make a choice, women need clear information and that includes what we do not know. The sad truth is that 50 per cent of 600 mature babies who died during labour in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 1995-95 might have survived if care had been different. Almost all these babies (one in 1,000) died in hospital under obstetric and midwifery care. In 75 per cent of these, care was described as 'sub-optimal'. The United Kingdom Central Council for Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors found that Ms Flint's care amounted to professional misconduct on the basis of poor record-keeping, failure to record post-delivery observations and that she was slow to hand over care. With hindsight, one can often find areas of care which are imperfect. Human beings, despite professional training and striving for high standards, are fallible. Setting disciplinary standards too high can ultimately be to the detriment of mothers and babies. We need to accept that life is uncertain and sometimes babies die when no mistakes have been made.

News of the unlikely marriage between BBC costume drama and the world's richest pop diva emerged yesterday from the Cannes offices of BBC Films. In this new BBC version of Hardy's West Country story, scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce who wrote Hilary and Jackie, the action would be transposed to the 1860s Californian gold rush. Madonna would play 'a substantial part which would be perfect for her', said a spokesman. The Hardy novel tells the story of a man who drunkenly sells his wife and child at a fair and, filled with remorse, attempts to lead an exemplary life. He goes on to become the respected mayor of the title, but his past returns to haunt him. 'This is going to be an amazing project,' said David Thompson, Head of BBC Films. 'It looks likely that Madonna will begin filming with us in this Western-style version of Hardy's story.' The £20m film, called Kingdom Come, is to be directed by Michael Winterbottom, the hottest young British director at Cannes this year. Winterbottom, who directed the harrowing Welcome To Sarajevo, was hailed last week at the festival, where his latest feature film Wonderland, has won critical acclaim. Madonna, better known at Cannes for one year throwing off her cloak on the red carpet runway to reveal her underwear, has had a chequered history as an actress. But her involvement with this project is a major coup for BBC Films who have developed the screenplay with Revolution Films. 'We have a long association with Michael Winterbottom who made another Hardy story, Jude, with us. His producer will once again be Andrew Beaton who worked with him on Wonderland,' said Thompson. So far Madonna's film work has been most successful when she has been cast to type - for instance, as the eponymous Susan in Desperately Seeking Susan, or as Warren Beatty's pouting nemesis in Dick Tracy. Her more recent performance as the Argentine First Lady in Alan Parker's Evita has helped erase the memory of her film debut Shanghai Surprise - a critical fiasco which co-starred her then husband, Sean Penn. BBC Films sees the project as part of an effort to modernise and move away from stage costume drama. The success of the recent television film A Rather English Marriage, starring Albert Finney, Tom Courteney and Joanna Lumley, has given them the confidence to follow the path to the silver screen mapped out by Channel Four. The promising negotiations with Madonna are not the only coup that BBC films are toasting on the Cote d'Azur this weekend. They have also secured, at an undisclosed price, the rights to film The Tesserat, the competitively fought for latest book by Alex Garland. • Ten years ago today, Cannes was dominated by the dark presence of a former Russian spy ship, the largest vessel ever hired to entertain guests at the festival. Those who attended the party held on board still refer to it with wonder. But the almost complete boycott of major American independent production companies and their money has marked the end of such conspicuous consumption. Main casualties of the US absence are the town's yacht brokers. Claude Nick, manager of one firm, said: 'The sea was full of moored yachts when we started. People don't want to hire for the full two weeks now.' The hire of a 90-100ft luxury yacht for one day can cost between $5,000 and $10,000 with harbour charges of $400 plus taxes. Europe's biggest pay television company Canal Plus is hiring a tent for the first time, and not a yacht. There are only three or four British yachts with berths at the quay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/may/16/nicoleveash.theobserver1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-15T23:48:14Z","webTitle":"Our trauma, by baby death couple","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/16/nicoleveash.theobserver1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/may/16/nicoleveash.theobserver1","fields":{"headline":"Our trauma, by baby death couple","bodyText":"The couple whose baby died during a delivery by one of Britain's most high-profile midwives told last night of their anger at having to wait nearly four years to discover the truth. Speaking for the first time about the day when baby Alicia died following an alleged lack of midwifery care, Antony and Nyree Wright relived the anguish of losing their firstborn child. Last week, the United Kingdom Central Council for Nurses, Midwifery and Health Visiting brought seven charges of professional misconduct against the midwife, Caroline Flint, who delivered baby Alicia. A former president of the Royal College of Midwives, Flint was a pioneer of natural childbirth and has delivered babies for Paula Yates and model Stella Tennant. The UKCC found Caroline Flint guilty of failing to keep adequate or accurate notes and of failing to carry out any maternal observations at all and failing to notice that Nyree had collapsed after giving birth. The living room of the Wrights' home in Islington, north London, is covered in toys and photos of their sons, Prentice and Oscar. They have a family now, but neither will ever get over their daughter's death. Sitting on her sofa, feeding baby Oscar, 30-year-old Nyree describes the past week's events. 'As with Alicia, Prentice was born in a breech position. The midwife knew this was going to happen and had asked in advance for my birth notes from Alicia,' she says. 'Neither myself or Antony had ever read them. 'When the midwife read them she said we should look at them after the birth of my son, because things weren't as clear as we thought. That was the first time any doubts were raised.' On her advice, after Prentice was born in 1997, the couple sent a letter of complaint to the UKCC, who decided that charges of professional misconduct could be brought against Flint. As a newly-qualified midwife herself, with just five weeks on the labour ward before going on maternity leave, Nyree had chosen to have a home birth. The couple opted to pay for midwife care and chose Flint's Special Delivery service. The evening before the birth, Flint's midwife business partner did a final check-up at the couple's home. Realising the baby was probably going to be a breech birth, the Wrights were advised, and readily agreed, to have Alicia in hospital. After Nyree's waters broke at 9am the next day, the couple went to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. As soon as they arrived, the expectant mother was sent for a scan. 'A junior doctor checked over the scan,' explains Nyree, 'to see whether the baby was breech. I think that at that stage, Caroline Flint should have asked for a more senior doctor to check the baby's health and find out whether her head was in the right position for a vaginal birth. 'I asked her whether I should have a Caesarean and she said there was no need. She claims that I was screaming that I didn't want a Caesarean, but in my birth plan I had already expressed a preference for an epidural Caesarean.' The Wrights maintain that Flint failed to carry out sufficient monitoring checks on mother and baby. 'Not once during the birth did she check my blood pressure, temperature or pulse,' says Nyree. 'When Alicia finally came out, she was rushed to a resuscitation unit. We didn't think anything was wrong because we had been warned that breech babies can get quite stressed. 'Only when we looked at Caroline's face and watched as more and more medical staff came into the room did we realise there were complications.' It was just after 5pm when the couple were told their daughter was dead. The post-mortem established that Alicia had suffered a period of hypoxia - lack of oxygen - 24 hours before the birth. Although she had been born alive, her lungs soon failed her because, according to Alicia's bereaved parents, inadequate midwifery care meant her weak condition was never anticipated. An investigation carried out by a senior midwife immediately after Alicia's death found that Flint's conduct was correct and proper and there was no case of misconduct to answer. This was not, however, the UKCC's findings. Unfortunately, the Wrights were never told the first investigation took place, nor its outcome. Had they been, they might have thought to take up a complaint sooner. Antony and Nyree Wright wanted Caroline Flint to be struck off. They wanted the charge about her conduct towards their baby daughter upheld. But neither happened. The UKCC found Caroline Flint guilty of failing to keep adequate or accurate notes and of failing to carry out any maternal observations at all and failing to notice that Nyree had collapsed after giving birth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/1999/may/17/artsfeatures1","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-17T00:17:36Z","webTitle":"It's amazing what you can build with a good pair of mandibles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/may/17/artsfeatures1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/may/17/artsfeatures1","fields":{"headline":"It's amazing what you can build with a good pair of mandibles","bodyText":"A long-running cartoon strip in the Architect's Journal once turned the Royal Institute of British Architects into the Royal Institute of British Animals. The president of the day, the small but perfectly formed Michael Manser, became Michael Mouser. Owen Luder, a talkative predecessor, was depicted as a big, clucking hen called Owen Brooder. And the growly, leftwing former GLC architect Jake Brown was Brown Bear. What a wag that cartoonist was. We all know British architects to be pukka types - decent tweedy chaps who never put a foot wrong, or pipe-smoking chapesses in twin-sets, sworn enemies of beastliness. The youngsters - ie, those under 45 - are an earnest, polo-necked bunch with important haircuts, Bauhaus goatees, difficult specs and big shoes. But animals? Perish the thought. Our dumb friends, however, are often superb architects, as an exhibition at the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum makes clear. The Animal Construction Company, which in many ways deserves to be bigger and bolder, displays astounding structures designed and made by animals, as well as photographs and videos of beasties making their homes. There are also tests of visitors' own building skills, which make you realise just how hard it is to shape a home with hands, let alone beaks or mandibles. You emerge with a new respect for badgers, fine and and fastidious builders whose setts may comprise up to a kilometre of tunnels with as many as 150 entrances and 50 bedrooms. As few as 10 animals might live in such a palace, each with five bedrooms; they move from one to another frequently to escape build-ups of fleas and to replace old bedding. These setts, farmers willing, can be occupied for hundreds of years. Today's Riba members might be humbled to realise you don't need training or even intellect to be an architect. Mike Hansell of Glasgow's Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences, and one of the show's organisers, points out that some kinds of microscopic amoeba have no brain, yet design and build houses from sand, 'with fine architectural features'. The exhibition highlights the extent to which human architects, as well as engineers and designers, have been influenced by animals - and how much we still have to learn. As the curators point out, 'the scientific investigation of animal building is a country road compared with the motorway of molecular biology'. Animals are masters and mistresses of lightweight, recyclable, ecologically sound design. Which human ever had such light and pliable building material as the Asian cave swiftlet? This bird uses its solidified spittle to form nests under the eaves of buildings that can carry the weight of several flapping chicks. Even more remarkable are the social bees, which secrete wax from their bodies and mix this with saliva to create strong, lightweight, waterproof honeycombs in which to store nectar and rear grubs. One Australian caterpillar extrudes regular rod-like faeces, which it weaves together with its silk to make a beautiful tubular shelter. A strand of caterpillar silk, by the way, can stretch for 500 metres and, weight for weight, this natural protein polymer has greater tensile strength than steel cable. So has the silk that spiders weave into some of the most magnificent of all animal structures. Human engineers do their best to make suspension and cable-stay bridges that can sway with shifts in the earth's surface and in high winds, yet these have little of the flexibility of the spider's web. When it comes to geometry, too, the animal kingdom has little to learn from humanity: one type of caddis larva cuts perfect circles from autumn leaves falling into lakes to make the roof and floor of its elegant home. The key to most animal architecture is its efficiency and simplicity. In a dangerous world animals need to build quickly, using materials that can be readily repaired and, ideally, blend in with their surroundings. Many use jaws, teeth or mandibles to cut leaves, mould mud, shape wax or spin sugar into regularly-sized building components - rather like our bricks, rolled steel-joists or glass panes - that can be pieced together rapidly. But not all animals are functionalists and minimalists: some appear to delight in colour and decoration. The male satin bowerbird makes a glorious colourful home with as many blue ornaments as possible to impress its fussy female mate. Actually, she is generally more impressed with the symmetry of her would-be mate's design than with the volume of blue ornaments: nature, said the saintly Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, 'abhors a straight line', but is clearly a fan of mirror images. Even though they can decorate, animals are most impressive when in engineering mode. The leafcutter ant creates nests the size of small houses. As for the Australian amitermes termites, their mounds are anything up to 22ft tall and boast air-conditioning so effective that human architects have only recently caught up with it. These nests are as high as 800 insects standing upright one on top of the other. As the curators of The Animal Construction Company point out, the world's tallest building, The Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, is 451 metres high. That is the height of only 246 humans standing on each others' heads. 'In round numbers, the Twin Towers house 20,000 humans; a big amitermes mound perhaps five million termites. No termite living in the darkened interior of a structure that big can be equipped with more than a fragmentary conception of what it and its colleagues have created.' It all sounds awfully like Mervyn Peake's imaginary Gormenghast, or the all too real Canary Wharf tower. So perhaps there is one crumb of comfort for human architects: animals, too, can be dwarfed by their own creations.

That is, I know, a less than perfect translation from James Duport's Latin. But it is a truth which all politicians would do well to accept. Unfortunately Matthew Taylor - so New Labour that he is almost pre-natal - does not believe that humility is a virtue. Writing in last Tuesday's Guardian he announced: 'Devolution is one of the proudest achievements - note every word - of British New Labour.' The emphasis is mine. The hubris belongs exclusively to Mr Taylor. Although he is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, Mr Taylor's real importance is his spare time occupation as the prime minister's stalking horse. Tony Blair was instrumental in his appointment. And nothing he says intentionally conflicts with Downing Street opinion. So we can at least rejoice that the Labour leader is now so fully committed to the idea of a Scottish parliament that he is anxious to take credit for what some people may believe was the triumph of the Scots themselves. However, the 'official' view of devolution - as revealed by Mr Taylor - turns out to be something of a constitutional innovation. Mr Taylor asserts - quite rightly in my opinion - that 'membership of a political party requires acceptance of its political identity'. I pass lightly over the question whether or not Tony Blair subscribed to that view when he created 'new' Labour in 1994 and consciously dissociated himself from much of the party's past. But endorsing the political identity is not the same as accepting every item of policy - an obligation which Mr Taylor wants to impose on members of the Scottish parliament. Lest he should argue with that interpretation of the demands, I quote him exactly: 'Devolution gave the people of Scotland and Wales the right to elect their own parliament, not to redesign the political platform of their own party.' A moment's thought demonstrates the inherent absurdity of that obiter dictum's implication. If there is both a Labour government in Westminster and Edinburgh, each one constrained by exactly the same party policy and determined to apply it in every detail, devolution becomes meaningless. If, on the other hand, Labour only becomes the senior partner in a coalition, the opportunity to impose United Kingdom Labour policy, without amendment, does not arise. Suspicions that Mr Taylor, and those on whose behalf he writes, do not understand devolution, are confirmed by the example he gives to prove that London's writ has always run in distant countries of which Millbank Tower knows nothing. The language of his justification is as offensive as his notion is absurd. 'Ever since Neil Kinnock's assaults on the Militant dominated Liverpool Labour Group... there has been acceptance that local Labour must toe the national party line in sensitive areas.' Is that how we are supposed to think of the party's MSPs - 'local Labour'? The comparison between the Scottish parliament and a parish council was said to be a slip of the tongue which the prime minister later regretted. In any case, the assault on Militant did not concern individual items of policy - much as the then Labour leadership deplored some of Liverpool council's decisions. Militant was expelled because its basic political philosophy was fundamentally different from Labour's. The same can hardly be said of Donald Dewar's MSPs? The extent of Mr Taylor's misunderstanding is emphasised by the phrase 'even if Labour had a more relaxed view of local differences'. It is inappropriate for London Labour to be either relaxed or taut as a drum about what - within the powers devolved to them - Labour MSPs decide. I believe that it would be absurd to abolish tuition fees north of the border, while they remained to the south. And David Blunkett has every right to point out the chaos which different grant systems would create. But devolution, by its nature, is likely to create inconvenient differences. That is the price we pay for its huge democratic benefits. True to form, the New Labour fears about genuine Scottish democracy are prompted by fears of unfriendly headlines. 'The media have sought to damage the party's national image by exposing the alleged excesses of Labour's councillors.' Exercising devolved powers is not an excess. Far more damage is being done to the government's reputation by the increasing evidence that, like the Thatcher administration, it talks of greater freedom but seeks to exercise more control. Fortunately Donald Dewar - not being Derek Hatton - will deal with the modernising tendency both firmly and moderately.

It's kind of fun in a slightly unreal sort of way. Louis, tall and a bit awkward in jeans, Nike Air Zooms, and a Paul Smith T-shirt, does the introductions: 'Say hello to Maria, say hello to Leanne.' Hello Maria, hello Leanne. Do I want tea? Coffee? I'll have coffee. But there isn't really any coffee, so tea it is. Louis does the tea. Sorry to have brought myself into this, but that's sort of what Louis Theroux does in his Weird Weekends programmes, he brings himself into them so I figured it would be all right this time. If you haven't seen them, they're these little journeys he does, dipping in to strange American subcultures. No, maybe diving in is better than dipping in; when he did one about the porn industry he got some full frontal Polaroid shots done, took them to a casting agent, and got himself a part in a porn film. OK, so he didn't actually do sex scenes, but hats off anyway. He's hung out with people who talk to aliens, extreme-right survivalists, Christian revivalists, all sorts of weirdists. The current series started last week with a programme about infomercials (Louis got to sell The Achiever Wood Grain Five Page Shredder on the Home Shopping Network), and tomorrow he goes swinging. Louis Theroux is 28, he's got a famous dad, and 3.5m people watch his show. He used to work for Michael Moore, and although he has clearly learned from the master of guerilla tactics, confrontation journalism, his own approach is much less aggressive. All that hard-edged irony is so nineties; Louis Theroux knows about irony, but his is softer. A new, milder, millennial irony. This might be a backlash and nice could be coming back into fashion. Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends are about subcultures, but they're really about individuals within those subcultures (you might remember JJ, the diminutive porn star with the incredible hair, or Randy James, the Texan evangelist, or Troy, who wasn't gay, he was 'gay for pay'). And they're about how they get on with Louis Theroux. 'It's really about finding people with whom you have a rapport. Plus these are people who are on the fringe, so it's usually like they're just keen to tell someone their privileged information, do you know what I mean? It's almost like they're looking for someone to trust. In a sense. I suppose.' Louis does that - talks like he's really thinking about it, and discovering things as he goes along. And he says, 'Do you know what I mean?' after every sentence, so we'll leave them out from now on. Is he fascinated with the fringe because he feels an outsider himself? 'I mean, I think I would say yes, yes I do, but then doesn't everyone feel like that? You go under this illusion in life that everyone else is normal and you're not normal. I am a bit suspicious of success and of mainstream. It's not something I've really developed a theory about. But when I'm with the people I actually identify quite strongly with them.' Success and mainstream are things he's going to have to learn to deal with. He's even having to deal with people recognising him when he goes out. We're now in Louis' important-looking glassed-off bit. There are videos and books all over the place, and the odd souvenir from forays into American weirdness. Here is some sort of body armour which he will wear in a demolition derby yet to be screened. And here's the Win Gym, either a glorified bicycle pump or a global fitness revolution, depending on whether you believe your eyes or its inventor, Jim Paris, star of last week's show. Here's a present for me: a car sticker: 'I'm going to heaven, wanna come along?' And do I want to hear a message on the answer machine from JJ the porn star? Of course I do. But the message has been wiped off so Louis does it anyway, in JJ's voice. He was just saying hi, and catching up and stuff, but it's funny, Louis doing it in JJ's voice. He's good at imitating his victims... 'No, not victims, not targets. Subjects. People say to me, \"Don't people realise you're taking the piss out of them?\" and I always say, \"I don't think I realise I'm taking the piss out of them\".' There must be a certain amount of laughing going on behind those glasses, but it rarely shows. There's certainly no turning to the camera with a wink or a look that says, 'see what an idiot I've got here.' What his subjects see is his genuine enthusiasm, so they open up for him. No one's offended. So far, all his stuff has been based on America. An easy target, critics would say, a genuine fascination, he says (there's a huge map of the States above his desk). It's not that Americans are any more weird than British people, it's that they have better opportunities to realise their weirdness. 'I think it's also about them opening up to me, partly because I'm British and they're excited to tell me, as an outsider, their world view or whatever it is.' You could do a programme about eccentrics in Britain, he thinks, but we're not very good at laughing at ourselves. As an example he mentions a book about Britain by his father. 'My dad wrote a book called Kingdom by the Sea. After training his satirical sights, actually he's not a satirist is he, after writing travel books about the Asian continent and North and South America, and using the same techniques the British couldn't really handle it...' His dad, of course, is Paul Theroux, travel writer, novelist, American and one-time friend of VS Naipal. I suggest to Louis that he seems to get along with and like people on his trips much better than his father does on his travels. Louis checks to see if I've actually read any of his dad's travel books (only one, admittedly The Old Patagonian Express). 'It's not conscious. It's harder to get away with not liking someone on TV. Conflict is good, but if you're going to not like somebody, you've got to not like them vocally. You don't want that thing where you're very nice on camera and afterwards you do that thing, 'I didn't like him. He was horrible.' That's what makes the pen so frightening.' His dad is very proud he says. He sends off tapes of the shows and Paul likes them. 'He has quite a dominating personality, which he's conscious of as well, so it's not as though I share every aspect of the production with him.' His mum, who used to be in charge of arts and features at the World Service, likes the shows too. Does he have a girlfriend? 'Yup. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't talk about that very much unfortunately. She's fantastic, I can say that. She does web design.' Hang about though. About half an hour into our interview I find we're talking about how I get on with my family. How did that happen? Who's interviewing whom here? What is it about this gangling guy that makes people tell him stuff? Interviewing Theroux isn't much like an interview. He asks almost as many questions as he's asked. And he giggles a lot, and goes off on tangents, promising to get back to the point later (he doesn't). When he says something off the record, he whispers, like it's our little secret. And again he whispers when he's deciding whether to tell me about a possible new project: 'Can I tell, can I tell, can I tell? Yes I can.' And he moves some papers on his desk to reveal a book on... Jimmy Savile. Yes, he's thinking of doing something with Jimmy Savile. There is just one moment when he looks very slightly ruffled. I ask him where he went to school, and there's a tiny hesitation, a little I've-been-rumbled-as-a-public-school-toff pause before he admits, with a slightly resigned look, that it was Westminster. Oxford followed. Louis Theroux is very laid-back, and smiley and easy to get along with, but you get the impression that underneath all that, he might be more in control than he's letting on. A journalist who just interviewed him for another paper made a mistake, writing that Theroux had said he thought his one-off Christmas show was a failure. Not so, says Louis. He might have said it was tough to justify morally, but he never said it was a failure. And it's not just me he's telling: the following day there's a letter in that paper, from Louis Theroux, clearing the point up. Wacky and fun he might be, but he's no slacker.

While that merits congratulation, it is also tempting to say that he's welcome to it. Those who think otherwise should ask themselves how they might feel if required - as he will be now - to write congratulatory verses for the forthcoming wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones. The office has also sometimes been used not so much to ensure a flow of verse for famous occasions as simply to mark the nation's reverence for the chosen poet. Yet poets ought anyway to be honoured for what they write, not for the titles bestowed on them. Ted Hughes was revered, but revered for being Ted Hughes rather than for being poet laureate. We may never be told what was in the prime minister's mind when he made the appointment. We shall certainly not be told if Carol Ann Duffy was, as some have reported, rejected for being a lesbian. If so, that would be shameful. But at least it seems that Motion, with a finite term of office and a salary rather than the traditional ration of sack, has plans to make the laureateship something better: to use it, he says, to help establish a sense of what it means to be English. The English may welcome that, even if the rest of the kingdom may be tempted to question what it is paying for. But without some sense of purpose, this appointment, like that of Master of the Queen's Music, scarcely belongs in the present day. A young man from Northampton was recently appointed poet laureate of Kiribati, with a grass hut and a salary, on the strength of verse he had written lauding that group of islands; but finding his talents neglected, he resigned. That may sound bizarre; but no more so than our own previous treatment of the office of poet laureate probably sounds to the people of Kiribati."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/may/20/jamiewilson1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-20T02:03:23Z","webTitle":"Laird who deluded himself with an action for libel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/20/jamiewilson1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/may/20/jamiewilson1","fields":{"headline":"Laird who deluded himself with an action for libel","bodyText":"Last night islanders of Eigg were planning a huge party on the remote Scottish outcrop to celebrate the final victory over the former owner who plagued their lives for more than 20 years. Throughout the five week trial a picture emerged of Keith Schellenberg as a 'Toad of Toad Hall' character. It was an apt analogy: racing around the island in his Rolls Royce, wearing a tweed jacket and goggles, his scarf flapping in the wind and with little regard for anybody else. No doubt in his own mind the islanders of Eigg are the weasels and stoats who drove him from the Lodge, Eigg's version of Toad Hall. But yesterday there was no kindly Mole or Badger to save Mr Schellenberg from the ignomy of his high court defeat. A millionaire playboy who made his money in the motor industry, shipbuilding, livestock feed and agricultural chemicals, Mr Schellenberg is a larger than life character. He bobsleighed in the winter olympics, regularly careered down the Cresta Run, and raced powerboats. For Mr Schellenberg buying the island of Eigg must have felt like buying his own little kingdom in the Hebrides. But as the islanders who made the two day journey from Eigg to court 13 of the high court testified, Scotland's feudal landlord system granted the laird power over virtually all aspects of their lives. Employment, housing, maintenance, transport, the island's communal buildings: nothing could be done on the estate without Mr Schellenberg's say-so. It was clear from the first day of the libel case that he was, at best, self-deluded about the regime he lorded over on Eigg. Autocratic, capricious and insensitive, said the Guardian. Not so, said Mr Schellenberg. He has been no stranger to litigation in the past when displeased about something written about him, regardless of its accuracy. The 'gruesome' picture of his ownership of the island portrayed in the Guardian in July 1996 was no exception. But as the weight of evidence stacked against him in the high court became apparent, he must have felt like a man looking into a mirror and seeing his true reflection for the first time. Each day he would arrive in court wearing his trademark tweed jacket, corduroy trousers and tan coloured shoes. With his booming cut-glass voice which belied his Yorkshire roots, he appeared the picture of confidence throughout the days of the trial. Mr Justice Morland, the trial judge, was certainly in no doubt about the strength of Mr Schellenberg's case. On three occasions he suggested to the wealthy businessman that he should speak to his QC about the status of his case, as well as ruling the Guardian had shown no malice in the article. 'If I were trying this case on my own, without a jury, it is likely I would already have come to the conclusion that sufficient facts had been proved to be true to justify the comments made about you,' he informed the plaintiff at the end of last week. But back in 1975, when Keith Schellenberg became the ninth laird of Eigg in 140 years, a feeling of euphoria swept the tiny island. He came promising the earth. A grant application to the Highlands and Islands re-development board set out a raft of measures that would re-generate the island. He let it be known far and wide that he wanted young able families to settle on Eigg. Buoyed up by promises of secure employment and long leases on their houses if things worked out, they arrived, Simon and Karen Helliwell among them, to start a new life on the idyllic island. The Helliwells uprooted from their home near Norwich, but it was not long before the dream turned into a nightmare. Mr Helliwell was to be employed as the boatman and to repair cottages. But the promised lease never materialised and the boatman work was a disaster. He claimed in court that he was expected to take the boats out when he judged that they were overloaded and when conditions were dangerous. After less than two years he resigned from Mr Schellenberg's employment, eventually building his own house on land bought from a crofter. The Helliwells' was not an isolated case. Lesley Gowan, a New Zealander who lived on Eigg between 1969 and 1984, told the court how numerous families had visited her house in tears about the way they had been treated. The promises Mr Schellenberg made to refurbish the cottages never materialised either. Throughout the trial a picture was painted of islanders living in rat-infested hovels with leaking roofs and damp filled walls. Anne Campbell, an old lady who lived on the island, described how she used to drown the rats she had caught in her house in the sink. His insensitivity towards the islanders and their needs manifested itself in other ways. In the winter Mr Schellenberg was a passionate member of Les Avants Bobsleigh and Toboggan Club. Within a few years of buying the island Mr Schellenberg had turned the Eigg Games, traditionally an inter-island activity, into the tobogganing club's summer excursion for his chums. The local islanders stopped taking part as more and more of more of Mr Schellenberg's friends hijacked the event. The campaign games, a mock up of the conflict between the Hanoverians and the Jacobites but played out with tennis balls, was particular anathema to the islanders. The guests treated the locals with 'utter contempt', the court was told. Under questioning from Nicholas Stadlen QC, for the Guardian, Mr Schellenberg dismissed as a joke an incident when one of his relatives draped a Nazi flag from the lodge balcony to welcome a German guest to the games. Then there was Mr Schellenberg's personal mode of transport around the island. A 1927 Phantom 1 Rolls Royce, with an estate body seating 10 and 1930s straight eight engine of the type fitted to armoured cars in the second world war. But when in January 1994 the vintage car met a fiery end, burned to a blackened shell under mysterious circumstances, it signalled the beginning of the end of Mr Schellenberg's reign over Eigg. A police investigation drew a unanimous response from the locals: they would not say who started the fire even if they knew. The laird was furious. In a press release he described the islanders as 'dangerous' before heaping insult on to injury when, in a series of interviews with journalists, he called them 'rotten' and 'barmy revolutionaries'. He decided to sell the island, but was determined not to sell to a trust run by islanders. 'He saw that as a surrender of principle and giving way to violence,' his QC, Patrick Milmo, told the court. But the spurned laird had a few more tricks up his sleeve. An eviction notice was served against Colin and Marie Carr and their five children. Mr Schellenberg had been trying to get them out of Kildonan farmhouse since long before the Rolls Royce fire, even going so far as to consider threatening to evict Mrs Carr's elderly mother as a bargaining tool. He wanted the secluded farmhouse as a bolthole for himself and his family. John Chester, a warden with the Scottish Wildlife Trust and a trusted member of the community who had lived on Eigg since 1986, was also served with a notice to quit. But Mr Schellenberg had little regard for the pain and anxiety he was causing. A few months after the eviction orders were served he sent out Christmas cards inscribed with the legend 'Isle of Eigg Bailiffs Plc' on the front, accompanied by a picture of Mr Schellenberg positioned between two burly men wearing Father Christmas costumes and wielding croquet mallets. Inside the card was the message: 'We specialise in recalcitrant tenants, squatters, junkies, weirdos, hippies, new age travellers and reds.' 'Just trying to make fun' was Mr Schellenberg's justification for the card in court. In 1995 the island was finally sold for £1.5 million to a German artist called Maruma. Hugely in debt, Maruma turned out to be an even more disastrous landlord than Mr Schellenberg. Many, but not all, of the locals saw the sale as a final act of revenge by the spurned laird against the islanders of Eigg. Mr Schellenberg's eventual departure from the island was a less than friendly affair. The population got wind of his intention to take a valuable 1805 map of the island with him. It had traditionally been passed from owner to owner, but Mr Schellenberg wanted to give it to his close friend, Ranald MacDonald, chief of the clan Ranald . They were furious and barricaded the map inside the craft shop using a derelict bus. It was a short lived victory: although he left the island empty handed with the jeers of the locals ringing in his ears, Mr Schellenberg eventually retrieved the map and it was given to Mr MacDonald. In 1996 the islanders finally got what they wanted. With Maruma's creditors knocking at his door they purchased the island for £1.5 million. Today Eigg is run by the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust. 'You wouldn't believe how happy we are now,' one islander said outside the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/may/21/chrismcgreal1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-21T01:02:49Z","webTitle":"The politician who sells absolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/21/chrismcgreal1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/may/21/chrismcgreal1","fields":{"headline":"The politician who sells absolution","bodyText":"Probably the most recognisable, and easily the most controversial, poster of South Africa's general election campaign says simply: 'Fight Back.' The largely white Democratic party insists that its pervasive placard is merely encouraging South Africans to vote against maladministration and authoritarian government on June 2. But the ruling African National Congress summed up the widespread suspicion that the DP is directing its appeal to whites unhappy with post-apartheid South Africa when it hit back with its own poster saying: 'Don't Fight Blacks.' There is no doubt the ANC will win the election, so the fight is to become the official opposition. White votes will decide who this will be. The 'liberal' DP is rapidly emerging as a serious contender, as the National party - which ruled South Africa for nearly 50 years and led the opposition in the last parliament - flounders between its apartheid past and its search for a new identity. In 1994 the NP picked up two-thirds of the white vote; the DP 10%. Opinion polls now put the two parties neck and neck, and the NP increasingly reliant on 'coloured' (mixed-race) voters to bolster its support while the DP laps up the whites. Pik Botha, the long serving foreign minister in the last white government, has already declared the NP beyond saving. 'The election will be the end of the NP, there's not the slightest doubt about it,' he said. While the shift between the parties may be seen as a triumph of liberalism, it is more likely a reflection of the DP's effective but race-tinged campaign against the government. Tens of thousands of South Africans, many with British passports, have left the country for lucrative jobs if less opulent lifestyles in the US, Australia and Britain. But that is not an option for the majority of whites, who hold only South African passports and have no skills in demand abroad. Many regard themselves as victims of the new South Africa, with its surging crime and affirmative action programmes. They say the government resembles the corrupt, authoritarian regimes which dominated Africa - and white views of the continent - for decades. The DP leader, Tony Leon, has tapped into the vein of discontent by portraying affirmative action as another form of apartheid. His Thatcherite attacks on the minimum wage for domestic servants and 'job crushing' labour legislation protecting millions of poorly paid black workers are applauded by many whites . But the DP also offers what the NP cannot: absolution. Few whites care to admit that they supported apartheid. A vote for the NP harks back to an era for which many would rather not take responsibility. Casting a ballot for the DP is a different matter. When Mr Leon took his campaign to the small KwaZulu-Natal village of Currys Post he told an audience of about 80 people - all white, and mostly middle-aged landowners - that they had nothing to feel guilty about. 'You weren't part of a conspiracy of apartheid just because you happen to be white,' he said. 'You have got to go out there and assert yourself as an equal. That's what you are.' The criticism of the DP's tactics has been reinforced by its alliance with the openly racist Freedom Front and the rightwing Federal Alliance in provincial elections, and its choice of candidates. Among the party's prospective MPs is a financial journalist, Nigel Bruce, who once famously wrote a column singing the praises of white students as waiters compared with the service of 'some surly tribesman with his thumb in the soup and eye on the clock'. Mr Bruce apologised, but complained: 'Sensitivities to any reference to race are nowadays so great that irony is neither understood nor accepted.' Mr Leon said the crack was 'tasteless' but kept Mr Bruce on the candidates' list. It has apparently done the party no harm among disgruntled whites. He argues that who votes for his party is less important than building a strong opposition to resist what he portrays as the ANC's increasingly authoritarian rule. 'Politics is also about numbers,' he said. 'It's about a critical mass. I don't think there's anything disreputable or dishonest about maximising your support. 'The fact that there might be gatvol [fed-up] whites among our supporters, so be it. It's only in the kingdom of the extremely politically correct that the opposition should spend the 28 days of the election campaign saying good things about the government.' But the DP's tactics are dividing some of South Africa's most prominent liberals. Helen Suzman, a former leader of the DP's predecessor, the Progressive Federal party, defended Mr Leon. 'What Tony Leon is doing is what every sensible politician is aspiring to do: to get as many votes as possible,' Ms Suzman said. But another former PFP leader, Van Zyl Slabbert, said it was 'extremely dangerous to gather votes at any cost'. 'If the means used to mobilise white votes, or black votes for that matter, creates a parliamentary tradition of racial intolerance, it will be difficult to play a constructive role later because the pattern will have been entrenched,' he said. While the DP surges, the new National party is struggling to cope with the defection of several MPs and senior officials to rival parties. The NP leader, Martinus van Schalkwyk, faces the same problems as William Hague in being taken seriously as a political leader and reformer of an outdated party. He is derided even in his own party as 'short pants', because of his youth and lack of gravitas. But his attempts to hang on to white voters have not been helped by his seemingly sincere efforts towards reconciliation. He has called on whites to recognise the legitimacy of the black liberation struggle and to honour its heroes. That is more than some wanted to hear. They prefer Mr Leon's call to fight back. Both parties are determined to prevent the ANC winning two-thirds of the seats in parliament, which would give it a free hand to amend the constitution. Mr Leon reminded his audience in Currys Post - as if they needed reminding - that the property clauses in the constitution prevented the government from seizing and redistributing their sprawling farms. 'No government anywhere in the world - least of all in South Africa, with our background, our history - should ever have too much power,' he said. His listeners were appreciative. Afterwards a woman who declined to give her name summed up the mood: 'The blacks are holding this place hostage. 'It's so easy to sit back and say there's nothing I can do. We have to fight back.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/may/22/monarchy.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-22T00:16:11Z","webTitle":"The blessing of royal irrelevancy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/22/monarchy.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/may/22/monarchy.comment","fields":{"headline":"The blessing of royal irrelevancy","bodyText":"In a time in which almost every event or position - funeral, election, dead television presenter, poet laureate - is claimed as the people's, presumably even this government would not be reckless enough to declare that the marriage of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones next month will be the people's wedding. For, even in hidebound traditional times like 1981, nuptials in the House of Windsor were seen as ours. Charles and Diana had a people's wedding - complete with closed schools and offices and street parties - and look where it got them and us. So, against the fashion of the times, the last royal marriage of the century needs in many ways to be less of a people's wedding. The challenge for royals, media and public alike is to construct a ceremony which makes sense in a kingdom slowly disuniting through devolution and in which a large part of the public is as cynical about both the royals and their weddings as they were reverential 18 years ago. Edward and Sophie's ceremony will especially test the media. Reading the newspaper coverage of the 1981 event now, it is hard to believe the level of wishful thinking. Although divorce was already becoming a social commonplace - and the newspaper profession had specialised in bad marriages long before they become generally popular - the acres of romantic prose are almost Soviet in their loyalty to the state. The f-word - fairytale - makes numerous unblushing appearances despite an age-gap between the partners which was surely considered ominous in private conversations at the time. The television coverage has been rendered even more embarrassing and indeed is suppressed wherever possible by broadcasters and the palace. Commentator Tom Fleming, a Scottish actor of the old school, boomed his personal brand of sub-poetry, including a final injunction to viewers to 'pluck a handful of good wishes to throw after them as they go'. It is my horrified recollection that at one point, over a shot of birds on the royal roof, he intoned: 'And there are the loyal, royal palace pigeons. What, I wonder, might they say if they could speak?\" The date was 1981 but the time was a hundred years before, as it would be again at Andrew and Fergie's wedding a few years later. Less than two decades on, even the decision by BBC1 to cover the Edward-Sophie event live seems questionable, given not just the humiliating refutation by events of the earlier coverage but the relative historical insignificance of the participants. Tony Blair talks of a modern Britain but live television coverage of the wedding of the monarch's fourth child seems the mark of an antiquated state. It might be thought bad form for the presenter and commentators to speculate about the family's unfortunate record of divorce but we must at least hope for no syrupy drivel and a tone appropriate to the minor news event this is. But Edward and Sophie at least have the blessing of irrelevancy. Although their wedding, and the coverage of it, may tell us something about the position of the royal family within Britain, the newlyweds are unlikely to have much influence on the outcome of the story. Even a divorce, were it unfortunately to happen, would merely be melancholy recognition of a trend. We are going into this with our eyes glazed. The real pressure is on a guest at the ceremony. This will be the first wedding since that of Claudius and Gertrude at which the most significant figure on stage is the groom's nephew. The groom's oldest brother has already been largely written off. Crazed monarchists will be looking at Prince William and imagining another shadow wedding, some time next century, which, in their sentimental predictions, will solve the problems of the institution they wish to see secured. Even Republicans should feel, at a simple human level, sympathy for this haunted teenager. The coverage this week of the cocaine habit of his friend and common-law step-brother Tom Parker Bowles was an awful warning to the prince. The tabloid sting which captured Camilla's son was a rehearsal for - perhaps, in the worst case, even a spin-off from - the set-up of which all tabloid editors dream. William Windsor will hopefully never try cocaine. Perhaps he will never make a bad choice of sexual partner. But adolescents do and so he may. And each of his mistakes will be in public. The prince is now in the position where he would be sensible to assume that anyone who shows an interest in him socially is in the pay of the tabloid press or may later choose to contact them. No one in Britain has ever grown up with such a need for paranoia because his father grew up before kiss-and-tell and tabloid stings - the worst he suffered was a report of ordering cherry brandy in a pub - and even his media-beleaguered mother at least made it to 19 in anonymity. Biographers and other analysts of Princess Margaret have made much of the tragedy of her redundancy, her knowledge from a young age that she, ambition and achievement were emotions closed off to her merely through the accident of having an older sister. But Edward and Sophie, as they stand at the altar, may glance back at the world's most unfortunate adolescent and give thanks that they don't matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/may/22/books.guardianreview16","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-22T01:47:00Z","webTitle":"A view from Planet Vulcan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/may/22/books.guardianreview16","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/may/22/books.guardianreview16","fields":{"headline":"A view from Planet Vulcan","bodyText":"The detachment from reality is confirmed by the cover. Only a man who lives in a world of his own would accept a jacket design which asked, immediately below his photograph, \u0093John Redwood \u0097 The Death of Britain?\u0094. But the hackneyed joke about Vulcans having landed is entirely inappropriate. Redwood\u0092s analysis of \u0093The UK Constitutional Crisis\u0094 reads as if it has been written in anticipation of their arrival and on the assumption that they would land totally ignorant of life on earth. Redwood describes British democracy in language which, were it to appear in a child\u0092s guide, would be assumed to be designed for infant schools. \u0093The monarch today carries out a number of important functions. The most important is to represent the United Kingdom abroad . . . The state banquets at Buckingham Palace and at Windsor Castle are important events . . .\u0094. What bliss to have been a Fellow of All Souls. In defence of the Redwood style, it must be explained that as soon as the book breaks out into grown-up language, the intellectual problems begin to show. Even at the end of The Death of Britain, Redwood is still not sure if he is writing a serious work on the constitution or a knock-about party polemic. The chapter entitled \u0093House of Lords Reform\u0094 tells readers \u0097 with justifiable certainty \u0097 that \u0093The House of Lords still contains hereditary Peers and life Peers created by the present or recent administration.\u0094 But the author does not have enough confidence in his own ideas to set out exactly how he would like to see it develop. He describes possible changes and records their disadvantages. Then he comes to the stunning conclusion that \u0093The House of Lords will survive and flourish if the present generation of Peers, in conjunction with the Commons on the day, defines and strengthens its important role in our constitutional settlement.\u0094 He does not, however, confide in his readers how that process could be brought about or what its results should be. The chapter which Redwood devotes to his well known antipathy to the European Union is not so much inadequate as intentionally misleading. The first 16 pages describe what the author believes to be the insidious federalist character of the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty. While parliament slept, \u0093people glossed over the fact that the European Community had a flag and anthem, common institutions and a common destiny\u0094. He does not, however, mention who those people were \u0097 the people who were in power during the time that Britain sleep-walked into \u0093all the requirements for a single economic policy, a single budgetary policy and a single currency\u0094. It was, of course, the Tory Party, and the drift towards integration took place while Redwood was a member of the Conservative Government. But politics is only mentioned in the chapter\u0092s last two pages. \u0093Labour\u0092s Third Way will increasingly emerge as a European way\u0094. Followed by the injunction \u0093discuss\u0094, that might make a decent examination question. As a serious political analysis, it fails abysmally. European Union being Redwood\u0092s obsession, references to its allegedly damaging consequences appear in every chapter. The House of Lords \u0093could carve a niche for itself\u0094 by scrutinising ministers whose conduct, at Brussels meetings, is now unchecked. The devolved parliaments in Cardiff and Edinburgh will soon contribute to the break-up of the United Kingdom by demanding direct representation on the Council of Ministers. Proportional representation \u0097 a denial of democratic choice \u0097 is favoured by politicians who \u0093want to bring us into line with Europe\u0094. The House of Commons \u0097 \u0093marginalised rather than modernised\u0094 \u0097 is swamped by secondary legislation which does no more than rubber-stamp decisions taken by the Europeans. The Death of Britain deals with constitutional reform only as a prelude to its assault on European integration. The proposals for \u0093Britain\u0092s Future\u0094 consider, in detail, only two questions: \u0093British Business \u0097 Euro Champions or Global Players?\u0094 and \u0093The Single Currency \u0097 Why Britain Must Stay Out\u0094. Those are the only chapters that express anything like a decisive opinion. And even then the advice is almost invariably negative \u0097 descriptions of what Britain should not do rather than robust advocacy of the policies that Redwood would like to see adopted in the 21st century. It typifies the absurdity of the Eurosceptic position. The critics want Britain to be a member of a European Free Trade Area that does not exist and cannot be created. Since the option they prefer is not on offer, they have nothing positive to say. The conclusion of The Death of Britain confirms how much Redwood\u0092s whole political philosophy relies on a nostalgic fantasy. It begins with a description of an island idyll. The isles in question are the Scillies where, in 1707, \u0093Sir Cloudesley Shovell wrecked some naval ships on the rocks\u0094. But \u0093it might as well have been yesterday\u0094. The people of Scilly are \u0093at peace with their past\u0094. Conservatives, by their nature, want to build the future on the past. But Redwood\u0092s choice of example is typically bizarre. A vision of Britain buoyed up by the memory of naval disasters is complemented by a glorious Freudian misprint. Parliament opens, Redwood tells us, with the Queen\u0092s \u0093Speech from the Crown\u0094. Redwood is also talking through his hat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/1999/may/22/countrydiary.ruralaffairs","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-22T01:49:08Z","webTitle":"A Country Diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/may/22/countrydiary.ruralaffairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/1999/may/22/countrydiary.ruralaffairs","fields":{"headline":"A Country Diary","bodyText":"Rivelin Hot morning sunlight slanted through the old pines. I was traversing a steep bank above the upper reaches of this secret tributary of the Don. There's no public path across the russet carpet of needles that's such a popular home for summer ants and autumn fungi. A gay colony of kingcups lit the swirling trickle of the baby brook and so took my eye that I failed to notice a small family group directly ahead. There was a sudden burst of activity at my feet as a mother woodcock exploded into the air and turned on drooping wings and trailing legs, off through the trunks and out into sunshine. At my feet a pair of tawny, brindled babies did what they had been told to do in such an emergency - they froze and only the blinking of a beady eye gave the game away. Soon the main headwater turns at right angles, coming down off the moor in a depression now thick with rhododendron and silver birch. There were once great oaks here, sheltered from the moor-top blast, and some had trunks with record girths, but the last succumbed more than a century ago and the best trees in Oaking Clough now are groups of tall conifers planted early this century by the city water board. They give this quiet dale-head something of the spirit of a minor Cairngorm glen. High on the open heather moor in 10 minutes, I almost stepped on another busy mother. The red grouse rocketed off her nest as my shadow crossed it, revealing nine warm eggs and a couple of down feathers. That family should now be exploring the peaty tussocks under the broad Rivelin sky, sustained by the plentiful young shoots of ling and cranberry. Broken cumulus clouds were sailing in from the west by the time I gained the reedy banks of that lovely oasis-pool which is really a mini-reservoir feeding the long Redmires conduit. Here a lone Canada goose gander sailed about the tussock isles, patrolling his watery kingdom against all comers. Looking back from half a mile away, I could still see him in relaxed mode, head tucked along his back, but still Commander of the Pool."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/may/22/books.guardianreview1","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-22T10:49:42Z","webTitle":"One Labour, One Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/may/22/books.guardianreview1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/may/22/books.guardianreview1","fields":{"headline":"One Labour, One Britain","bodyText":"Smallweed was aghast to read reports this week that Ehud Barak's successful campaign for the Israeli premiership had been run on a One Israel ticket, rather than under the tattered banner of Labour. As is now well known, his camp was awash with representatives of the New Labour spin doctor and allied trades department, who've since been modestly claiming credit for his success. (Did they invent Binyamin Netanyahu? If not, I think their claims should be treated with some suspicion.) What troubles Smallweed now is the thought that some of these people might hurry back to Tony and suggest a spot of rebranding. Why not change his party's name to One Britain? That, after all, is what he's about. And he wouldn't need to call it by the much more cumbersome title One United Kingdom, since Labour - as people there often complain - doesn't organise in Northern Ireland. The notion that Sonia Gandhi should not be allowed to lead India - because she failed to take the essential precaution of being born there - set Smallweed wondering how many prime ministers we might have lost had this rule been applied. Not many, I think. In our own century, just one was born beyond our purlieus: Andrew Bonar Law, a son of New Brunswick, Canada. Most were born either in London (Attlee, Macmillan, Douglas-Home, John Major) or Scotland (Balfour, Campbell-Bannerman, Ramsay MacDonald and after a very long gap, Tony Blair). Eden, to my surprise, was born in County Durham. Two Yorkshiremen feature, the other one being Asquith; not one came from Wales, since even Lloyd George contrived to be born in Manchester. We'd have done a lot worse had this rule been the basis of a cricket test for England captains, for not only obvious cases like Tony Greig would have been disqualified, but also Colin Cowdrey, that embodiment of Roast Beef and Old England, who was born in Bangalore, and Ted Dexter, who as one might have sometimes divined while watching him, was born in Milan. Two more shovelfuls of information about Sir Cloudisley/Clowdisley, whom I mentioned here last week. The circumstances of his death: only two men survived the wreck of his ships off the Scillies in 1707, and one of these was Sir C Shovell (or Shovel) himself, who was washed up on the shore. But a local woman who came to inspect the scene spotted an emerald ring on his finger, and in her attempts to wrest it off, killed him. No one found out. She confessed the crime many years later upon her deathbed, producing the emerald as evidence. But let us not feel too sorry for Sir Clow. According to Davina Sobel's feted book, Longitude, a humble sailor aboard Sir Clow's ship, the Association had, strictly against the rules, been keeping his own account of where they were sailing, which alarmed him so much that he bravely approached the admiral to warn him of impending disaster. Sir C had him hanged on the spot for mutiny. There's a question here, however, which even Davina Sobel has failed to investigate. Did Shovell cavil? Was he the sort of man of whom fellow admirals in their clubs over post-prandial port used to say: he's a frightful old caviller, Shovel? Or even, after the decanter had been round once or twice more, he's a fearful old Shoveller, Cavill? The word cavil appears at first sight to be pretty straightforward: when a verb, it means \"to raise annoying petty objections, to quibble, to carp\"; when a noun, it means \"a captious trifling objection\". We borrowed it from the French caviller, which in turns derives from the Romans (cavillari: to jeer). You might say that Shovel cavilled at being told by a minion that he didn't known how to navigate, but the fact that he had the man hanged suggests something more than mere cavilling. None of these dictionaries tell us, though, of a second meaning (which Smallweed found in a pamphlet by my erudite colleague Martin Wainwright arguing that jobs on quangos ought to be allocated by lot). The expert on this is Professor Huw Benyon of Manchester University, who writes of a system of cavilling devised by miners in north-east England to decide the contentious question of who should work where. Some bits of the pit were much easier to work in than others. One stretch of face at Chopwell was known as the Piano Flat, because three months' work in its ideal conditions would bring you in enough money to purchase a piano. So the sites were allotted by \"cavilling\" - the original word being the Dutch kavel, meaning lot - the proceedings being superintended by the union and not the distrusted mine-owners. Some pitmen felt guilty about it, because it seemed rather like gambling. Methodist miners would pray in chapel for forgiveness for taking part. A story in the Times on Monday about Charles Haughey's connections began as follows: \"Ireland was left reeling yesterday . . .\" Where is the story in that? Ireland is always reeling. It's one of their national pastimes. They only stop reeling to start line-dancing. As a dancing people, it's time they revived the Trenchmore. What is the Trenchmore? \"The court of England is much altered. At a solemn dancing, you had the grave Measures, then the Corrantoes and the Galliards, and this is kept up with ceremony; at length to Trenchmore and the Cushion-dance, and then all the company dance. Lord and groom, Lady and kitchenmaid, no distinction. So in our court, in Queen Elizabeth's time, Gravity and State were kept up. But in King Charles's time, there has been nothing but Trenchmore, and the Cushion-dance, omnium gatherum, tolly-polly, hoity-come-toity\" (ancient text)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1999/may/24/duncancampbell","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-24T10:54:40Z","webTitle":"Murder manual publisher takes responsibility for deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/24/duncancampbell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/may/24/duncancampbell","fields":{"headline":"Murder manual publisher takes responsibility for deaths","bodyText":"The American publisher of a do-it-yourself murder manual is due to accept financial responsibility today for a triple murder carried out by one of the readers of the book. Lawyers describe the settlement as a precedent-setting case with widespread implications for providers of similar information on the internet. There is growing unease in the US about the random shootings in schools that have followed last month's murder of 12 students and a teacher in Columbine, and calls for increased control of handguns. Paladin Press of Boulder, Colorado, a mail-order publishing house, has sold more than 10,000 copies of Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Inde pendent Contractors. The book is described as \"an instruction book on murder\". It gives tips on the most effective means of killing people and getting away with it. The case which provoked the current action occurred in 1993 in Silver Spring, Maryland. Lawrence Horn, a sound engineer then living in Hollywood, hired a contract killer, James Perry of Detroit, to kill his flight-attendant wife Mildred. She was shot in the head in her home and her disabled son and a housekeeper, who were also in the house, were both found dead. Police who raided Perry's home found a copy of Hit Man. In the subsequent trial, in which Horn and Perry were both convicted of murder, it was demonstrated that the hit man had followed the man ual's instructions. Mildred Horn's family brought a civil action against Paladin, alleging that it had aided and abetted the murder. Howard Siegel, their lawyer, said Paladin had agreed to settle the multi-million-dollar claim with the family, take Hit Man off the market, and donate funds to charities chosen by the families of the murder victims. \"Our cherished freedom - freedom of speech - does not include the freedom to assist murderers,\" Mr Siegel said. The exact sum of the settlement is not being disclosed. Lawyers acting for Paladin Press are reported to have confirmed the settlement, although Paladin Press would not comment in advance of today's final settlement. Publishers have claimed that they are protected by the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of expression, and previous civil actions against authors or film-makers whose works have been used as role models for murder have been unsuccessful. \"I think this marks an important step in combating this country's culture of violence,\" said Professor Rodney Smolla of the University of Richmond law school, who also represented the families in the claim. \"It demonstrates that if you disseminate information with the intent to assist criminals you can be held legally accountable.\" Horn organised the murders because he thought he would inherit a $2m (£1.32m) trust fund on the death of his wife and son. He was arrested after police began to doubt that the murder was a random event. The decision will be examined by those who publish on the internet information on how to make bombs and other lethal devices. Police in the United States and the United Kingdom have expressed concern that such information is being made readily available.The decision comes amid growing unhappiness at the events unfolding in American high schools. Last week the actress Sharon Stone handed over her four legally held weapons to be destroyed and said in a statement: \"I choose to surrender my right to bear arms in exchange for the peace of mind of doing the right thing.\" She urged others to surrender their weapons, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/may/25/cadburyschweppesbusiness","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-25T02:25:24Z","webTitle":"Cadbury drinks deal goes flat in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/may/25/cadburyschweppesbusiness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/may/25/cadburyschweppesbusiness","fields":{"headline":"Cadbury drinks deal goes flat in Europe","bodyText":"Regulators have taken the sparkle out of Cadbury Schweppes by forcing it to scale back a sale of its soft drinks empire which could have triggered a switch back to its confectionery roots. Cadbury Schweppes has revised down from $1.85bn (£1.15bn) to $1.1bn a deal to sell-off its non-US beverages business to Coca-Cola after hitting a \"brick wall\" with regulators on the continent. And even these arrangements could have to be rejigged if regulators in the United Kingdom, Mexico or Australia fail to give it the green light But the world's fourth largest confectionery maker said the revised agreement, effective partly from July, did not derail the group's overall strategy of gaining a premium price for beverages while broadening options for future global development. \"We would not have chosen to do it this way but you have to face reality and then move on,\" said chief executive John Sunderland. He admitted the new arrangement could be further scaled down but was confident this would not be the case. The original agreement was panned by the EU competition commissioner, Karel van Miert, who accused the two companies of trying to bypass an EU antitrust review by filing the plan with national regulators. But opposition in Belgium, Germany and Italy forced the final rethink, which also affects a separate £500m plan to dispose of European bottling interests. These assets will either be reviewed or retained. The City reacted positively to yesterday's announcement because it ended weeks of negative speculation which had driven down the share price. Last night the shares, which have just been split in two, closed down 2.5p at 429.5p. Nicola Mallard, analyst with CCF Charterhouse, said: \"It has cleared up some of the uncertainty. It was looking increasingly unlikely they would get EU approval and that would have threatened the whole deal. But they are not out of the woods yet.\" Other analysts said that the lack of a clean break with non-US soft drinks reduced the possibility of a demerger between the drinks and confectionery side. Mr Sunderland said the company would hang on to the restyled European beverages arm for the \"foreseeable future\" but he would not rule out a later sale. Pepsi Cola is one of the potential buyers. The new deal with Coca-Cola covers trademark ownership of Schweppes, Dr Pepper and Canada Dry outside the US, South Africa and continental western Europe. Cadbury Schweppes refused to say what the proceeds would be spent on but once again made clear a share buyback was one of the options."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/may/25/guardianobituaries2","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-25T02:27:48Z","webTitle":"Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/25/guardianobituaries2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/may/25/guardianobituaries2","fields":{"headline":"Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz","bodyText":"Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz, who has died of cancer aged 87, was grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, a religious leader with ministerial rank in the government. He was born into a family of traders, peasants and judges. His education was traditional religious, with intensive group tutorials led by a sheikh. His exceptional memory enabled him to learn the Koran by heart before he came of age - in spite of an eye infection which made him completely blind from the age of 16. He studied Arabic and Sharia, and said that the sheikh who influenced him most was Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, mufti of Saudi Arabia, who recommended him for his first job as judge in Al Kharj in 1938. Sheikh Ibn Baz distinguished himself as both a student and a judge. He became a teacher at the religious institute in Riyadh in 1952 and an Islamic law lecturer at Riyadh University in 1953. In 1963, he was appointed head of the council of Islamic scholars and grand mufti, and by 1975 he was vice chancellor of the Islamic university at Medina. From 1978 until his death, he was chair of the prestigious permanent board of inquiry and fatwa, which carries ministerial status in the Saudi Arabian government. The sheikh provided Islamic credentials for the policies of the custodian of the holy mosques. He made a fatwa in 1990 against the driving of cars by women - 50 working women defied the ban and drove their cars in Riyadh in June of that year. Earlier, in 1978, he had declared a fatwa that Viagra could be prescribed to Muslim men. But he also supported the west in the Gulf war. Sheikh Ibn Baz only spoke Arabic and never travelled outside the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but he supported the principle of \"peace with the Jews\" and sanctioned Muslim-Christian dialogue. His forte was the ability to confront extremists with arguments which neither royalty nor the liberal middle classes possessed, mainly because he could not be dismissed as \"secular\" or \"westernised\". Sheikh Ibn Baz is survived by two wives, four sons and several daughters, the youngest of whom is 10. The number of daughters is not revealed for traditional reasons. • Abdul Aziz Ibn Abdallah Ibn Baz, cleric, born 1912; died May 13, 1999"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/may/25/freedomofinformation.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-25T15:19:51Z","webTitle":"Straw puts key state services off-limits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/25/freedomofinformation.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/may/25/freedomofinformation.uk","fields":{"headline":"Straw puts key state services off-limits","bodyText":"The government published its long awaited draft freedom of information bill yesterday fulfilling Labour's pledge to create the first statutory right in this country for people to obtain internal documents held by public authorities. The bill replaces an existing code on access to government information introduced by John Major, the former prime minister, in 1994. The new legal right to know is however fettered by 21 separate exemptions where the public will not be allowed information that could \"prejudice\" government unless Whitehall departments or other public authorities decide to release it under discretionary powers. The 21 exemptions include national security, all the work done by MI5, MI6, and GCHQ; defence; communications with the royal family; all policy advice; international relations; relations between the parliaments and assemblies of the United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; the economy; investigations by the police and customs and excise; court records; commercial information and all personal information and information provided to government in confidence. The new draft bill also doubles the time public authorities have to reply under the present code to people seeking information from the present 20 working days to 40 working days. It allows public authorities to charge a standard fee of £10 to provide the information with a ceiling of 10% of the marginal costs of putting together information for the most detailed applications. It stipulates a new information commissioner to police the new system. It gives the new commissioner wide ranging powers of enforcement including the right to get search warrants if public authorities refuse to provide the information. Public authorities could be held in contempt of court if they still do not cooperate. It also makes the destruction or alteration of documents a criminal offence. The first information commissioner is expected to be Elizabeth France, the present privacy commissioner. Future appointments will be decided by open competition and the bill provides for a second commissioner should public demand for the new rights grow. The government estimates that the new measure will cost between £90m and £125m a year and that some 190,000 people a year will use their new rights to obtain information. Under the draft bill the commissioner will be able to overturn decisions by government departments to refuse information but both members of the public and the authority can challenge this by appealing to a new tribunal. People can appeal to the courts on a tribunal ruling but only on a point of law. The bill also says that where a public authority has a discretion to release information in the public interest and refuses to do so this cannot be challenged by the commissioner. The new draft bill is less radical than the white paper, Your Right to Know, published last year. It includes a larger number of exemptions up from seven to 21 and no longer contains the \"substantial harm\" test which would have allowed the release of information. The bill also gives the power to the home secretary to increase the number of exemptions and to repeal secrecy clauses in other bills. Laws forbidding the disclosure of information in seven areas radioactive substances, river pollution, airports, railways, civil defence, factories and shop and office premises are to be repealed. Most of the new information available to the public will affect schools, health authorities, the prison service and the administration of the police. Mr Straw has not accepted recommendations from the MacPherson inquiry following the Stephen Lawrence case that all information should be released unless it causes \"substantial\" harm. The bill now to be subject of consultation until July 20 and an investigation by the Commons public administration committee could be included in next year's Queen's Speech. Ministers have five years after that to put it on the statute book, suggesting it may not become law until the next parliament, or even as long as 2004.

Now it is going downhill as the land on which it is built slowly crumbles into a river gorge. A team from Spain's leading scientific institute have begun to study the causes of the subsidence which, they calculate, is eating into the ground at the rate of 2cm a year. The hill on which the Alhambra is perched has a high clay content and the scientists suspect that waterlogging may be to blame. Water may be leaking from a network of irrigation channels under the palace. They intend to plot the trajectory of water from \"suspicious\" fountains and waterways, using an isotope system with tiny amounts of radiation put into the water. \"There is no immediate threat,\" said Mateo Revilla, the Alhambra's director. \"The spot worst affected is 25 metres away from the Alhambra itself. But, of course, we're working to get to the root of the problem and solve it as quickly as possible.\" The possible remedies include covering the hillside with a protective net or building new water channels. \"We must keep an open mind until we've established precisely what is happening,\" Mr Reyes said. Subsidence has been a problem in the past. In 1520, soon after Spain's \"Catholic Monarchs\" Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Al-Andalus, the southern kingdom ruled by the Moors for 700 years, the base of the Alhambra hill was propped up with stones. In 1601 a landslide destroyed part of the wall around the forest below the fortress. Another landslide in 1985 ate away more of the hillside. The search for a solution could be hampered by the bitter infighting surrounding the Alhambra. Municipal, regional and central authorities of various political hues regularly fight for control of the monument - with millions of visitors each year, one of the most popular in Spain. Unesco, which included the Alhambra in its list of world heritage sites in 1994, is calling for limits on the number of visitors, after intervening to stop a discotheque, hall and car park being built at the foot of the Alhambra hill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/may/28/guardianobituaries3","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-28T00:03:15Z","webTitle":"Robert Thomas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/28/guardianobituaries3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/may/28/guardianobituaries3","fields":{"headline":"Robert Thomas","bodyText":"The history of modern Wales can be found in the bronzes of the sculptor Robert Thomas, who has died aged 72. There is the group of the miner and his family, which commemorates the scene of the 1910 Tonypandy riots, his full-length statue of Aneurin Bevan in Cardiff's city centre - one of the Welsh capital's great landmarks - the Viscount Tonypandy and Bevan at Westminster, James Griffiths at Llanelli library - Thomas's first major commission - and Diana, Princess of Wales, at St David's Hall, Cardiff, made in 1987. The Cardiff Bevan is a striking likeness. The immaculate Nye, in double-breasted suit (although with trousers somewhat creased), leans forward as if in debate, forcibly projecting his radical challenge in the direction of the Marquis of Bute's castle stronghold. Thomas was recognised as one of Britain's most successful figure sculptors. He was also admired as one of the artists who had helped to inject a new confidence into the Wales of the 1980s and 1990s. After lecturing at Ealing technical college, in west London, Thomas had returned to his native land in the 1970s. He found a society that was de-industrialising, and a confused and disgruntled community in the process of forgetting its history. He set out to identify his heroes, to celebrate them in his work and to find places for that work in public spaces. As the public became familiar with his sculptures, a new interest in history and Welsh artistic identity was becoming apparent. His bronzes and full-length studies were icons of a Wales arriving at a fuller sense of itself and he captured the physical and spiritual essence of his subjects with naturalism and realism, always streamlined into a classical, heroic formalism. Thomas was a miner's son, born in Cwm-parc, in the Rhondda, in 1926, the year of the general strike, which, together with the 1930s depression, brought the community to its knees. He remained a man of the Rhondda, a product of the country's most vibrant and radical mining community. He left Pentre grammar school in 1944 and did war service as a mining electrician before entering Cardiff College of Art in 1947. He subsequently won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, a route his wife Mary was to follow. The crucial moment in his career came, when as a result of winning a national competition, his Mother And Child was unveiled in Coalville, Leicestershire. Thomas's home at the Villa Seren in Barry, allowed magnificent views of the Bristol channel. It was a true family home and Robert and Mary, and their sons, Ceri and Derw, were a presence at any Welsh event in which young artists or performers were looking to make a mark. Thomas's last work, a statue of the Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is to be unveiled at Neyland, Pembrokeshire, in July.

The number of under-16s will drop from around 12m in 1996 to 11m by 2021. The years around 2008 will mark the first pension claims by women born during the first postwar boom, which peaked in 1947. Between 2010 and 2020 the pension age for women will rise from 60 to 65, temporarily depressing the rise in pensioner numbers and increasing the working age population, according to the study, published by the Office for National Statistics. But this will soon be overwhelmed by the retirements of those born in the second baby boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s. The over-80s will grow in number from 2.4m in 1996 to 3m in 2021, and go on rising up to a peak of around 5.5m by the middle of the next century. \"Since Mrs Thatcher removed the link between increases in earnings and uprating the basic state pension, we haven't got the problem that they were going to cost the taxpayer lots of money,\" said Mr Radley. \"It is more a worry that there are going to be significant numbers of pensioners retiring into poverty.\" The number of births fell between 1964 and 1977, although it has remained reasonably steady from about 1980. \"The most common theory is that women are having to combine careers with bringing up children,\" said Chris Shaw, a statistician with the actuary's department. \"But there are other theories: that we are a more individualistic country and probably put less stock by children than we did before. There is also the increasing instability of relationships.\" But the dip in the number of births from 1964 to 1977 has a knock-on effect on the number of children. Because there were fewer women born in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there will be fewer children produced now. The \"burden\" on the working population from non-working pensioners and children is set to ease over the next 20 years. The \"dependency ratio\" will fall from 632 dependants per 1,000 workers in 1996 to 580 to 1,000 in 2020. But thereafter it is set to rise rapidly to around 700 per 1,000 by the mid 2030s. While it was relatively easy to gauge the pensioner population, the number of children is less easy to predict, Mr Shaw said. The UK population is projected to increase gradually, from 58.8m in 1996 to 62.2m in 2021, reaching a peak of almost 63m in 2031 and gradually starting to fall. But Scotland's new parliament will legislate for a diminishing number of people as its population falls from 5.1m to just under 5m over the next two decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/may/30/robinmckie.nicoleveash","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-30T00:17:20Z","webTitle":"Fat becomes Britain's hidden killer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/30/robinmckie.nicoleveash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/may/30/robinmckie.nicoleveash","fields":{"headline":"Fat becomes Britain's hidden killer","bodyText":"Kim Oldbury knows what it is like to be really fat. Morbidly obese, the doctor called her. In danger of doing serious harm to her health, he added. But the 24-stone Staffordshire factory worker just couldn't shift her weight. 'No one else in my family is really overweight but I've been fat since I was kid. I've always loved greasy food. Savoury things like pies, chips and curries. I can take or leave chocolate but salty snacks are my favourite,' said 32-year-old Kim. An evening job in her parents' pub scarcely helped. 'I'd have around five pints a night, get peckish and have a bag of chips around 11pm. It was a disaster really.' Kim's story is important for she is a one of a swelling band of fat people who are turning Britain into a health disaster zone, a British Nutritional Foundation task force warned last week. In a stark, alarming report on the waistlines of Britain, leading academics revealed that 17 per cent of British men and 20 per cent of women are now obese. (If your waist size is more than 35 inches and you are a woman, or if you wear trousers with a waistband of 40 inches or more and you are a man, you are obese, the task force decided.) Yet in 1980 the figures were only six and eight per cent respectively. In other words, levels of obesity in the United Kingdom have grown almost three times in less than two decades. Britons, having already turned pear-shaped, are now becoming grotesquely rotund - and the implications for the nation's health are disastrous as weight-related ailments -including diabetes, back injuries, gallstones, hypertension and sleep problems - soar. In addition, levels of illnesses such as breast and cervical cancer - which are also linked to weight - are also being affected. 'Unfortunately, health authorities are unwilling to realise that obesity is overtaking cigarette smoking as the most important avoidable threat to health,' said task force chairman Professor John Garrow. And just like smoking, obesity is primarily a disease of the lower economic orders, striking harder at those with poor educational attainment and at women. The story of Kim Oldbury is being repeated a millionfold round the country, in other words. 'There is no agreed single reason for the fact that women in lower socio-economic groups are more likely to be obese than men of the same class,' says Professor Jane Wardle, of University College, London. 'However, males in this group are more likely to have manual jobs and are therefore more likely to be working off some of that excess intake.' In addition, women in upper socio-economic groups tend to be more confident than those in lower groups and are likely to take action - dieting and exercising - to lose weight. By contrast, women from lower social groups are more likely to feel powerless and accept their 'fate' without taking action. However, the problem is not so much a dietary one as an issue that reveals how lazy Britain has become. Every year, we take less and less exercise and rely on technology - TV remote controls, dishwashers, cars, and e-mail - to do the work that once helped us gently sweat off our excess calories. Amanda Wynne, a nutrition scientist and editor of the British Nutrition Foundation's report, said: 'People think they are being healthy because they are eating low-fat food, but low fat doesn't necessarily mean low energy. Often there are the same number of calories in the low-fat biscuit as an ordinary one.' Failing to take exercise, eating poor foods, and assailed by bad nutritional advice, the state of the nation's stomachs is now close to scandalous. As a result, the task force recommends that local authorities be empowered to close down poorly run slimming clubs and that 'charalatans in the weight loss field' be forced to substantiate the claims they make for their products. In addition, the group urges that there should be 'a change in national lifestyle to involve a higher level of physical activity'. Governments and local authorities need to provide 'recreational facilities and public highways that are safe and convenient places in which to take more physical activity'. In other words, we need to be encouraged, if not coerced, into walking or cycling to work rather than taking our cars or going by bus or train. At the same time, action needs to be taken to halt the eating of fat-laden foods by children. 'It seems quite unnecessary to have Mars Bars dispensers in schools,' said Wardle. The real trouble is more basic than that, however, for time is out of joint for Homo Sapiens. We are physiologically identical to the hunter-gatherers from whom we are descended, and we still react to foods as they did, gorging on sweet products - chocolate bars, ice creams and sweet drinks - that are the latter-day equivalents of the rare meals of ripe fruit and honey they would have occasionally stumbled on. Our ancestors made the most of those sugary lunches because they were infrequent and they provided energy that we would have badly needed. Today we no longer need that energy input, we live such sedentary lives - yet we are still programmed to consume the equivalent of dozens of sugar binges in a single day. But there is little sign that the penny has dropped among health authorities. For example, in 1991, the then Health Minister, William Waldegrave, published the Health of the Nation Green Paper pledging to reverse the trend of rising obesity back to 1980 levels. He failed spectacularly, because he could convince neither the public nor politicians of the gravity of the problem. Nor is there much evidence that matters have improved. 'In Tessa Jowell's Our Healthier Nation report, obesity is mentioned only once - on page 128 - in the middle of a sentence about heart disease,' a nutrition expert told The Observer. 'When I questioned an official about this omission, he said the Government's concern was for underfed people. Overfed ones had to sort themselves out.' Obese people can help themselves, but giving them some support would not go amiss, for their problems are likely to cause serious drains on health service resources as bones and joints crack under our body weights and more and more days off work are lost through obesity. However, it can be fought - though it requires discipline. Kim Oldbury has tried the weight loss drug, Xenical. More importantly, she has changed her eating habits - grilled meat and fish, and no booze and no fat - and now weighs 17 stone 11 lbs. She insists more weight will come off yet. 'I'm going to lose another four stone. I've got this far, I can't give up now.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/may/30/theobserver6","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-30T14:08:09Z","webTitle":"Messiah on the make in Sun City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/30/theobserver6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/may/30/theobserver6","fields":{"headline":"Messiah on the make in Sun City","bodyText":"Sergei Torop, a 38-year-old former traffic warden from Siberia, sighed and smiled when asked to confirm his divinity. When you know you are Jesus, being asked for proof gets tiresome. 'Am I the Messiah? Even more than you consider yourselves human,' he answered. 'I know my father, who gave me life for your good. I know myself and I know you, and that's why I came to tell you the truth about God our father.' Torop, who calls himself Vissarion, looks the part. With his benign smile, gaunt features and wispy beard, he resembles an Orthodox icon. Despite being married with five children, believing in reincarnation and recognising pagan religions, he has convinced thousands of followers he is Jesus Christ. A former colonel of Russia's strategic missile forces acts as his foremost priest. His flock Ð the 'Vissariontsi' Ð are mainly disenchanted Soviet intellectuals and idealists who have turned their backs on Boris Yeltsin's Russia and given Torop all their money. In return, they get an entry ticket to his 'City of the Sun', a thriving town built and sustained with their income on top of a large hill in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. 'To accept me, people need to give up everything they own. The rich will find it very difficult to enter the kingdom of heaven, very difficult,' he said with satisfaction. Though poverty is not a direct route to heaven, Vissarion does promise to have a word in his father's ear. 'I can't guarantee someone's salvation. I can only set it up for them.' He spends little time with his flock, preferring to stay in his lavish home on top of the hill, where he paints. Priests and assistants Ð his 'angels' Ð take care of followers on a day-to-day basis. They keep to a strict regime: fixed sleeping hours, a vegan diet, no solitude and constant prayer and celebration. Dissent is not tolerated. 'If someone says to me that he knows better than me, how can they? How can they know anything at all if it is I who make the rules? The rules need to be made by me before they can exist,' he said. Is he a harmless nutter exposing the failure of Russia's Orthodox Church to fill post-Communist Russia's spiritual vacuum? Or is he another cult leader guiding his followers to mass suicide? Some Orthodox priests see him as an evil pyramid schemer. They in turn stand accused of paranoia and envy. 'He may not be the Messiah, but he is not a charlatan. He believes in what he says,' said Andrei Zhigalov, a film-maker who lived with Vissarion while making a documentary about him for the BBC. 'I can't imagine the people who live with him committing suicide, because they are so happy, healthy and optimistic.' The authorities in Minusinsk, the nearest town to 'Sun City', generally leave Vissarion alone. The influx of Vissariontsi into the region has revived a flagging economy. The fruit and vegetables they cultivate and sell to neighbouring communities are welcome. Alexander Lebed, Governor of the huge Krasnoyarsk region, does not interfere. The gruff paratroop general and presidential hopeful Ð heralded by some as Russia's political messiah Ð has spoken out against the Moonies, but seems happy to leave Vissarion alone. But Alexander Dvorkin, the director of a special department set up by the Orthodox Church to monitor sects' influence, thinks Vissarion must be stopped. 'I see many striking resemblances between what Vissarion is doing today and what Jim Jones did with his People's Temple just over 20 years ago,' he warned. 'More than 900 people died in a mass suicide in Guyana. Why must we wait for 5,000 to do the same thing in Siberia?' Dvorkin claims Vissarion is being manipulated by mafia-style businessmen who take most of the money. If the number of new followers tails off, the cult will collapse like a pyramid scheme. Since the passage of a new law restricting the operation of minority faiths and churches, including the Baptists and Jehovah's Witnesses, the Orthodox Church's motives in condemning Vissarion have been questioned. 'The Orthodox Church exaggerates the problem of sects because they want to limit competition from other churches,' said Sergei Filatov of the Keston Institute, which monitors religious freedom in Russia. The religious fervour that came in the wake of glasnost and the Soviet collapse has died down and there are far fewer proselytisers on the streets than in the early Nineties. Vissarion's appearances in Moscow and St Petersburg to rally recruits are getting less frequent. He lets the growing reputation of 'City of the Sun' spread the word, alongside publications distributed by Vissariontsi in major cities. Very few of Vissarion's followers return from his Siberian outpost. Having handed over all their money, they generally have no route back. Father Oleg Sinyaev, an Orthodox priest who counsels former sect members at Moscow's Church of Sorrowful Joy, admits their appeal. 'Vissarion's community is very similar to communism. You don't have to think and everything is provided for you,' he said. 'It will all end in tears.' But will it end in suicide? Vissarion's stress on the need to prepare his followers for their ultimate 'bloody battle', when humanity will reach its 'last stage', could be interpreted as a cry for compulsory Armageddon. But at least he is free from any millennial pressures. According to Vissarion, we are only in year 38 Ð his age. · Andrei Zhigalov's film about Vissarion is part of BBC2's series 'Return to Wonderland', starting on Tuesday at 11.15pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/may/31/guardianleaders","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-31T00:55:03Z","webTitle":"Don't yawn for Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/31/guardianleaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/may/31/guardianleaders","fields":{"headline":"Don't yawn for Europe","bodyText":"Tomorrow campaigning will begin in earnest for yet another election on these islands. After last month's contests in Scotland and Wales, the voters of the entire United Kingdom will have their say: on June 10 we will choose our members of the European parliament. For many Britons, perhaps most, this fact has barely registered. Among the few who have noticed, the response has been a polite yawn. European elections are the political equivalent of football's Vauxhall Conference: they're the contest no one cares about. Perhaps that's why Labour is reportedly seeking to enlist the premiership-size talents of Manchester United's Alex Ferguson. After topping the polls in Wales and Scotland, Labour's clearly looking for the treble. The trouble is, the experts are already warning of a turnout figure below 34%, our previous average in European elections. If the predictions are right, it should have at least two effects. First, a low turnout figure should puncture forever the old British complacency on turnout, the sentiment which makes us think voter apathy is an exclusively American problem. Second, poor turnout might oblige us to accept a change in our political reality. We may have to get used to voter fatigue: the habit that says when voters are asked to vote often, fewer of them will. Still, we shouldn't merely grin and bear this process. There are things to be done. The easiest solution is to take up the variety of bright ideas that exist to make voting more convenient - more like other everyday tasks. Polling booths at supermarkets, extending postal and even electronic voting are all possibilities. More importantly, it would help if the competing parties used these elections as a chance to debate the most obvious issue at stake: our relationship with Europe, and with the common European currency. Labour, in particular, has shown every sign of wanting to sneak its way past these elections - hoping to win them on the quiet, without having to argue the central question of the euro. This is weak, if not cowardly, politics. Finally, for apathy to recede the European parliament itself has to change. It needs to persuade voters that it matters and is worth paying attention to. Its disciplining of the Brussels Commission was a start, but it has not done much to advance on that. When the parliament finally shows its worth, voters will come. Until then, too many will stay away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/jun/01/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-01T00:42:40Z","webTitle":"In the line of fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jun/01/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/jun/01/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"In the line of fire","bodyText":"Hiro's on a rampage. He's a vaguely Asian crusader with giant muscles bursting through an armoured torso, but since you're watching the world through his eyes, all you see is his Ion Blaster gun and dungeon floors and walls hurtling by so fast your stomach somersaults into your throat. Whoa, look out! It's Superfly Johnson Hiro's gargantuan bald and black nemesis streaking by, blasting away with his Sidewinder gun. Hiro leaps to avoid the rocket-powered missiles, then pivots and fires. Green laser beams ricochet off the fortress walls, exploding like fireworks. Superfly's fragged! Body parts drop from the sky like bloody rain, gibs splattering the walls and if you don't know that's short for \"giblets\", slang for chunks of flesh, then you're a llama, a newbie loser, and shouldn't be hanging around Kyoto 2455 AD in the first place. \"Ha! Take that, dude!\" John Romero sits at his computer, chortling. A colleague curses from another room. It's early March, before anyone has ever heard of Littleton, Colorado, and the co-creator of the computer games Doom and Quake is showing off his new gorefest, Daikatana. As Hiro, he has just fragged a co-worker playing Superfly Johnson in a \"death match\", a battle via linked computers. \"That's cool, huh?\" Romero says. \"You can see how much more visceral this game is.\" Romero is 31, with long, silky black hair. He wears tight designer jeans and a black T-shirt. It was Romero, along with a programming genius, John Carmack, who revolutionised the computer games industry in the mid-90s with the seminal shoot-'em-ups Doom and Quake, two of the biggest sellers of all time. The pair made millions, bought several Ferraris each and turned Dallas into the blood-and-guts capital of their industry. Though they have since broken up in a spat over precisely what makes a computer game cool, to hard-core fans they are still gods \"the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of our business,\" says a Dallas game developer who insists on being identified only as Levelord. Then the United States was suddenly confronted with the image of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, both avid Doom fans, rampaging through the halls of Columbine High with an arsenal of deadly weapons and laughing at the \"gibs\". For the mass-market audience that developers like Romero have always coveted, the connection was hard to miss. Video and computer games had been criticised for violent content before, but what happened at Columbine High instantly gave the industry term for this relatively small game genre \"first-person shooter\" ominous new resonance. The same qualities that made Doom and Quake so adrenaline-pumping, so unlike any other form of violent media, now made them a primary target of outrage. These games plunge you into a three-dimensional world where you must kill to survive, whether your opponents are controlled by the computer or by real-life rivals. Romero refuses to talk now about the events in Littleton, but when he sat fragging Superfly Johnson into bloody chunks, it seemed that nothing could threaten this world he'd created. With a severed head rolling one way and a rib-sprouting torso bouncing another, he was perfectly candid when asked if he was concerned about criticism of game violence. \"I'm the one who made this stuff why would I care about that?\" he said, not looking up from the screen. \"I make games I want to play. If I want to see more gibs, I make it. If people don't like it, they don't need to play the game.\" The penthouse office of Romero's Ion Storm is an astonishing place, like something out of a Jetsons cartoon with walkways suspended above a maze of stainless steel cubicles, wall lighting embedded in marble sconces, glass cases filled with models of one-eyed monsters, the whole enterprise wrapped in clouds and sky. It bustles with 88 employees, including screenwriters and producers, developing three games at once and making plans to branch into movies, action figures, comic books and clothes. There are leather couches and giant projection screens, a locker room with showers, ping-pong and pool tables, a million-dollar recording studio for making game soundtracks and a special area for death-matching that's linked to 16 television sets in a nearby spectators' lounge. And, of course, all the junk food you can eat. It's a dream clubhouse for game freaks, the kind Romero could have only imagined as a kid drawing violent cartoons of superheroes, hanging out in the video arcades and flunking his classes. While growing up in Tucson, Arizona, and Rocklin, California, Romero was pretty much left to whatever engaged his imagination until, Romero says, his angry step- father, a retired military officer named John Schuneman, crept up behind him while he was playing an arcade game and smashed his face into the glass. One of Romero's recurring cartoon characters was Melvin, a crew-cut kid who was always getting blown away by his dad. Then Schuneman noticed his stepson's fascination with computers and bought him an Apple II. Romero became a brilliant programmer, with no interest in anything besides making games, and eventually made his stepfather proud. After high school, he bounced around several game companies before hooking up with Carmack, a teenage prodigy from Kansas City. Their first game, Wolfenstein 3-D, is considered the original first-person shooter, letting players shoot Nazis in dungeons adorned with swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler. It was an instant smash, bringing in about $120,000 a month in sales. \"Everybody thought it was awesome,\" Romero recalls. \"But when we started playing, it was like, 'we have to have more blood, more violence in there.' It seemed real, but we needed to show the guys dying. \" Their next game, Doom, had a seismic impact on the computer game industry when it was released in 1993, just as the internet was coming of age. Id's marketing was brilliant. You could download the first stages or \"levels\" of Doom free. But once addicted, you couldn't get the whole game unless you gave out your credit card details. So many people tried to download Doom that it crashed the computer system at the University of Wisconsin, on which it was posted. By now, Doom and Doom II have sold about 2.7 million copies in the United States, over the internet or through retail stores (as most software is distributed). Though it's impossible to know for sure how many free copies of the opening levels were downloaded worldwide, some estimates range as high as 20 million. Sitting at a computer at Ion Storm, Romero expertly leads a visitor through Doom, and at first it's hard to understand what all the fuss is about fuzzy figures attacking, a crude pistol firing, splotches of red appearing on falling bodies. Then he starts playing Quake I and II, the next stops in his historic tour of the first-person shooter. The \"story\" doesn't change much, but as Romero moves through 1996 and 1997 the games gradually enter new dimensions of realism. You can see Carmack's programs becoming more sophisticated and taking advantage of the soaring processing speed of computers and powerful 3-D graphics accelerator cards. By the time Romero reaches Daikatana, the illusion is truly remarkable. Physical reality suggests that you are sitting in a chair operating a mouse and keyboard. But with the computer screen replacing your field of vision, you believe you're actually creeping around a corner, causing your breath to shorten. Afraid an enemy is lying in wait, you feel your pulse quicken. When the monster jumps out, real adrenaline roars through your body. And few things in life are more exhilarating than spinning around and blowing the thing to kingdom come, the flying gibs so lifelike you can almost feel wet blood. Hurtling through the 3-D environment can give even serious gamers motion sickness. The technology pioneered by Carmack's shooters has spread to other genres, and in recent years Doom and Quake have been passed on the all-time best-seller list by titles like Myst, which takes you on peaceful adventures to exotic places. Other games allow you to build cities, simulate flying and play a big-league sport. Still, it's telling that the first thing Americans wanted to do upon discovering this remarkable new virtual world was to start shooting up the place. Shortly after Littleton, a military expert appeared on [news programme] 60 Minutes calling shooter games \"a how-to manual for killing without a conscience\"; politicians howled, and then came the lawyers. Last month Id Software was among 24 entertainment companies named in a $130 million lawsuit by the families of three victims killed in last year's school shooting in West Paducah, Kentucky. It turns out that the 14-year-old gunman in that case, Michael Carneal, also loved Doom. Before Littleton, such talk sounded ludicrous. How could clicking a mouse possibly help someone fire a real gun any more accurately? But shooter developers like the media that lionises them one minute and demonises their games the next want to have it both ways. Most refuse to address questions linking games to the real world, but even as he shows off his wares for a reporter, Romero himself points out that the Marines have used a version of Doom for training troops how to kill: \"They made a special version, an add-on, so that soldiers played Doom to feel like they were in a war situation, where you have one-shot kills.\" The \"one-shot kills\" argument is precisely the one made by Lt. Col. David Grossman, the leading figure in the campaign to blame computer games for Littleton. Grossman teaches courses on the psychology of killing to Green Berets and federal agents and has been hired as an expert witness by the parents of the three girls killed in the West Paducah shooting. Not only do games like Doom and Quake help people overcome what he calls the natural human reticence to murder, Grossman maintains, they also counter the natural instinct for neophyte hunters and soldiers to shoot repeatedly until a target drops. The Kentucky teenager Carneal, he argues, followed the computer game pattern of moving quickly from one target to another, with an emphasis on head shots. Though he'd never fired a gun before, the teenager hit eight people with eight bullets, five to the head and three to the upper torso. And that's what makes shooters unlike any other form of media violence we've ever seen before. You're not just watching a movie, you're in the movie. You're not just empathis ing with Arnold Schwarzenegger as he blasts the bad guy to smithereens, you're actually pulling the trigger. Unlike a movie, this three-dimensional world has a peculiar logic and set of rules that can be entertaining for hours on end. Getting killed is a drag because suddenly the game stops, and the only way to remain master of this intoxicating new universe is to kill. How that translates to the real world varies according to the individual playing the game. For his part, Romero is working all night to finish Daikatana, the game that could confirm or destroy his legendary reputation.It will give fans an \"awesome\" ride through 4,485 years of human history, he says, armed with more weapons of annihilation that will destroy more monsters than ever before. \"Nobody's made one like this before,\" he says, \"and I doubt that anyone's ever going to try to make something this big again.\" In other words, for the shooter-game community, nothing has changed since Littleton. Doom Objective: Not big on plot. Blast your way through assorted monsters ranging from humanoids to a screaming pink flying octopus to reach the next level. Doom 2 is more of the same but with bigger and better weapons. Weaponry: The BFG9000 is the most powerful weapon in the game, but the chainsaw is far more fun. Gore factor: Considered gratifyingly bloody at the time of release but since surpassed by newer, more gruesome games. Quake Objective: In the first chapter, your mission is to destroy demons in a hellish world called Quake. In part two, it's up to you to save the world by eliminating an alien race. Weaponry: Electrocute your enemies with the Thunderbolt in Quake 1, while, in Quake 2, the railgun will shoot through entire rows of baddies. Gore factor: Messy. Wolfenstein 3D Objective: You are BJ Blazkowicw, an escapee from a prisoner of war camp. Your mission is to infiltrate a Nazi fortress to discover plans to build the perfect army. Along the way you must exterminate all the Nazis you come across. Watch out for a guest appearance from Hitler. Weaponry: Limited firepower here; a choice of only three guns. Gore factor: Minimal blood spillage. SiN Objective : Freeport, 2037. Baddies rule the city and it's up to you, John R Blade, to sort it out. Your job is to track down and destroy the source of an illegal drug called U4. Weaponry : An unimaginative arsenal of rifles, rocket-launchers and your fists. Gore Factor: High. Get shot in the back and you'll see your own blood splattered on the wall in front. Aliens v. Predator Objective : Scientists have carried out secret biological experiments on aliens who have escaped. You have the choice of three characters a Marine, the Alien or the Predator and your ensuing mission varies accordingly. Weaponry: The Marine gets to toast his victims with The Incinerator; the Alien has acid spit and Predator bristles with wristblades for \"trophy decapitation\". Gore factor: Gratuitous. Bodies disappear but bloodstains remain."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/1999/jun/01/alantravis2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-01T00:45:09Z","webTitle":"Britons: the optimists of Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jun/01/alantravis2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jun/01/alantravis2","fields":{"headline":"Britons: the optimists of Europe","bodyText":"Britons no longer see themselves as the \"poor relations of Europe\" and are more confident about their future personal and professional prospects than even the French or the Germans, according to the results of a new poll published today. The resurgent optimism among British voters uncovered by the poll means the traditional image of the British workforce as poorly paid, underproductive, inefficient and always complaining, will have to be ditched. The poll also shows that while most Britons are happy not to have joined in the launch of the euro earlier this year, they are not noticeably more hostile towards the way the EU functions than the average European voter. Some 50% say they are dissatisfied with the way the EU is evolving, in line with the average for all the countries surveyed. The poll confirms that there is not that much confidence in Britain that either the European Commission (36%) or the European Parliament (40%) can improve the lot of the ordinary voter, but it is rising and is higher than among voters in Austria, Finland, Greece, Denmark and Germany. When it comes to the pace of European integration and cooperation, most people think the Labour government has got the balance about right. There is even a slight feeling that it has not gone far enough. However British public opinion firmly rejects demands for a common European army and a directly elected European president, propositions which do command support throughout most of Europe. The finding is part of a special survey of the state of public opinion across 12 EU countries commissioned by the Guardian and other leading European newspapers including Le Monde, the Irish Times and El Pais, on the eve of next week's elections to the European Parliament. The European barometer survey was conducted in Austria, Finland, Italy, Belgium, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, where the fieldwork was carried out by ICM. The above average optimism in Britain - 69% say they are confident about their future - is also noticeable among Irish voters. It stems in part from the continuing impact of the election of the Labour government. In Britain 60% of voters say they have confidence that their national government can improve their lives, more than almost anywhere else in Europe. In Germany only 47% of voters say they have any confidence in their national government delivering economic and social improvements to their lives. Surprisingly, some 68% of Britons say they believe next week's European elections are either \"quite\" or \"very\" important, in line with the general view among European voters, despite the predictions of a record low turnout at the polls. It looks as though it is more likely to be a \"khaki election\" in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. Some 57% of UK voters say the Nato military campaign against Serbia will be \"rather\" or \"very\" important in deciding how they will vote next Thursday. This proportion is the highest in Europe and even greater than in Greece. Membership of the euro is unlikely to prove a handicap to those nine governments who joined its launch in January. The poll shows that public opinion in those countries is generally positive (53% satisfied) but only 12% could be described as enthusiastic. Germany and Finland are the only countries in Euroland where opinion is still marginally unfavourable to the euro. But even among the Germans (47% for and 49% against) the scale of opposition has weakened as they have learned to live without the deutschmark. One man who has so far failed to win a place in the heart of European voters is the incoming president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi. Half of European voters have not heard of him. In Britain, only 23% of voters say they even recognise his name. The poll, which was coordinated by Louis Harris of France, involved interviews with 9,436 adults aged over 18 in 12 EU countries, between May 6 and May 22."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jun/02/northernireland.kevintoolis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-02T01:11:52Z","webTitle":"War crimes of the IRA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jun/02/northernireland.kevintoolis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jun/02/northernireland.kevintoolis","fields":{"headline":"War crimes of the IRA","bodyText":"It was while the old headstones of Faughart cemetery lay shrouded in mist that the latest weapon in the IRA's war in Ireland gleamed beneath the bushes - the new coffin containing the long dead remains of one of their victims. Eamon Molloy, killed as an alleged IRA informer in Belfast when he was 21 in 1975, has been dead longer than he had lived. His pitiful bones are part of Ireland's history as the first of the IRA's \"disappeared\" to be recovered just hours after the government's Northern Ireland (Location of Victims' Remains) Act had passed into law. Under that legislation any evidence gathered during the process of recovering the disappeareds' remains cannot be used in evidence in future prosecutions. Their killers' amnesty is pre-enshrined in law by the House of Commons and the Dail. But even with this extraordinary abuse of democratic legislatures behind them, the IRA took no chances. Molloy was dug up from where he had almost certainly incriminatingly lain in the land of some IRA chieftain along the border, and deposited on neutral ground at Faughart. Gerry Adams even politically spun out Molloy's tortured procession towards burial, traducing him in life as a reviled informer but offering Molloy's bones up as a symbol of republican good will. Other sites for other bodies have been named and further digging continues. But by any objective political reckoning this is a twist of the republican knife too far. Even in the long annals of the British House of Commons it is hard to think of a more disgraceful abuse of a democratic legislature than to write into law an amnesty for the judgment of the IRA's kangaroo courts and their killers. It is the type of legislation one would expect in Pinochet's Chile, not in the United Kingdom. Where was counsel for the defence when Eamon Molloy or Belfast mother of 10 Jean McConville met their end? And who appointed the judge and jury? We will never know even though our laws now, in effect, endorse this IRA judgment and the sentence - a bullet in the head for betrayers. Serious questions have to be asked about the whole purpose of such legislation. Most of the disappeared have been dead for 20 years. They would have been seized by their near neighbours and shot by IRA \"nutting squads\". The places of their death are unknown. What little forensic evidence that remained, if any, is likely to be confused, incomplete, leading nowhere. With the best forensic will in the world the chances of securing convictions on the evidence of 20-year old bones is minimal. Obviously if the peace process is to continue we must draw a line somewhere on the past and its crimes. But that does not mean we have to indulge republicans at every turn. The return of the IRA's disappeared should not even be a recognised bargaining chip in the political process. The abduction of members of the nationalist community, their murder and burial in secret places, and denial of their involvement, is an IRA war crime. To lie about these killings as the IRA have done so for the past two decades and to deny the victims' families the right of a proper burial is a further crime. But it is an IRA war crime that the IRA should solve. It is not the role of the British House of Commons to grant absolution to the IRA for its dirty deeds. Ironically all this empty legislative symbolism takes place at the same time as hundreds of IRA men are now openly walking the streets of Northern Ireland, immune from arrest under the informal executive amnesty granted by the peace process. In many cases we know precisely who their victims were, who fired the shots, who drove the car. These are crimes that took place not in the 70s but in the 80s and 90s. The RUC still has the warrants for their arrest on file. The Location of Victims' Remains Act is an inglorious fraud. It was a serious misjudgment by Downing Street to start down this legislative road. It shames us all by reducing the democratic process - elections, laws, courts - into a rubber stamp vindication of murderous IRA tribunals. The only consolation in this whole process is that the IRA miscalculated with their timing about delivering up its hidden victims just on the eve of the European elections. The images of teams of Garda digging up bits of Irish bog for graves is proving to be an awkward pictorial message for Sinn Fein candidates to cope with on the doorstep. The coffins in the mist have revealed a terrible chapter in the IRA's \"glorious war\" in Ulster that Gerry Adams would rather have hoped lay buried forever. \u0095 A new edition of Kevin Toolis's book on the IRA, Rebel Hearts, will be published later this year by Picador"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/jun/02/uk.politicalnews2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-02T01:12:19Z","webTitle":"Labour set for big losses in elections where size matters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/02/uk.politicalnews2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jun/02/uk.politicalnews2","fields":{"headline":"Labour set for big losses in elections where size matters","bodyText":"Whatever the outcome of next week's European elections, one theme of the contest is already clear size matters. Everything about the poll, except, almost certainly, the turnout, will be on a grand scale, from the 11 giant regions candidates will represent to the cumbersome dimensions of the ballot papers themselves. Voters in London will be handed forms 28in wide and seven deep to accommodate the names and logos of 12 parties and three independent candidates. Others around England, Scotland and Wales will be barely smaller. Organisers in the London region are even beginning to worry about how voters will fold their papers, and will post officials to offer advice. The ballot-folding quandary is among the more trivial repercussions of the switch on June 10 to a system of proportional representation. Under the chosen system, known as the regional list, the UK is divided into 11 electoral mega-constituencies. Parties nominate a list of candidates for each region, placing them in order of priority and winning seats in Strasbourg according to the percentage share of the vote. Voters, meanwhile, will put a cross or, it has emerged, another permissible symbol such as a smiley face against one party, but will have no say over individual candidates. A vote is cast for a party list in its entirety or not at all. While Tories have mocked the shift to PR, and scored points against Tony Blair for instituting a closed list system, Labour denies claims that the approach is too complicated and will put off voters. \"It's no harder than at a general election just one cross next to a party,\" said a spokesman. \"In fact, it's simpler you've got party logos as well.\" Low turnout, possibly influenced by confusion at a changed system, is one factor which could swing an otherwise largely predictable poll, where surprises will arise only on the margins. Labour, as the party of government whose supporters are broadly content with its performance, is likely to be hit hardest by low voting figures - possibly set to fall below 30%. It is already destined to lose nearly half its existing European seats as a result of the switch to PR. Forecasts of the outcome, enthusiastically proffered by the parties set to gain, are based on voting patterns under different electoral systems, or on opinion polls. Figures produced by the London school of economics' public policy group indicate that if voters repeat the behaviour at local government elections last month, Labour will come out with 34 seats (down 28 on its present total), the Tories will gain 29 (up 11) and the Lib Dems will rocket from their present two seats to 15. Nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales could increase by from two to five seats. Calculations based on the 1997 general election would see Labour with 42 MEPs, the Tories with 28 and the Lib Dems with 12. The shocks, if they come, will be caused by the smaller parties. The Greens, holding no seats in Europe, have hopes of one in the south east, where they must gain 8.3 per cent of the vote they polled almost 10 per cent in local council elections and in London. The party has urged voters to turn the poll into a referendum on genetically modified foods, which they seek to ban. They have invited voters to mark their support with smiley faces on ballot papers. In London the miners' leader Arthur Scargill heads the Socialist Labour list, depending on a promise to take Britain out of Europe's \"exclusive capitalist club\". The Tories face a double challenge from their left and right flanks in the shape of the breakaway Pro-Euro Conservative party, whose deselected MEPs Brendan Donnelly and John Stevens are standing in the west midlands and the south east, and the fiercely anti-single currency United Kingdom Independence party. The Tories are fending off threats from the right with tough talk on the euro, waste and corruption, highlighting \"gravy train\" tendencies in the commission and European parliament. Labour asserts that it is \"positive about Europe\", using the UK's influence in the European Union to push through reforms. The Lib Dems are fighting on largely the same platform, but seek early entry to the euro."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jun/03/7","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-03T02:51:18Z","webTitle":"British Steel in merger talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jun/03/7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jun/03/7","fields":{"headline":"British Steel in merger talks","bodyText":"British Steel is in talks with rival Dutch steel-maker Hoog-ovens about a possible merger in the latest round of consolidation in the troubled European industry. The long-rumoured merger would amount to a takeover by British Steel of its smaller Dutch competitor and result in Europe's second largest steel producer. The UK firm, with an annual output of 15m tonnes of steel, is, at around £2.6bn, worth three times Hoogovens, which produces 6.2m tonnes. Yesterday's announcement in Holland followed a sharp upward rise in British Steel's share price even though the company is due to unveil annual losses of around £200m and is expected to make similar losses this year. British Steel shares jumped as much as 21.5% and closed up 29.75p at 163p. The British firm, seen as one of the most efficient in Europe after a long-running cost-cutting programme that will see a further 2,500 jobs disappear by 2001, is expected to return at least some of the £400m cash on its balance sheet to shareholders after completing the Hoogovens deal. An agreement could come as early as next week, with an announcement promised for no later than Monday. Analysts said British Steel's move was prompted by the savage effect of the pound's strength against the euro. Both John Bryant, the new chief executive, and Sir Brian Moffat, the chairman, have repeatedly urged the treasury and Bank of England to talk down the pound's value. Some estimates suggest that sterling's strength has cost British Steel some £600m in pre-tax profits over the past three years. A deal with Hoogovens would enable it to shift some of its cost base to continental Europe. Most of the steel it sells is priced in euros but its costs are based on the pound. Under the relentless pressure of sliding prices, cheap imports which have prompted a series of anti-dumping complaints and over-capacity, Europe's steelmakers have undertaken a spate of mergers in recent years. These include the fusion of Germany's Krupp and Thyssen and, this year, of France's Usinor with Belgium's Cockerill Sambre. British Steel, which is still trying to buy a Polish steel mill, has been seeking its own partners such as Salzgitter and, frustrated, hinted at a £500m purchase in the US. Analysts said the proposed merger would be unlikely to meet regulatory hurdles as previous alliances have been cleared by the European Commission. Equally, it was felt that the Dutch state's 13% stake in Hoogovens would not raise problems. But British unions immediately voiced fears over job losses, with Ken Jackson, leader of the AEEU engineering union, saying: \"We are concerned about employment security in the event of a merger so we will be having urgent discussions with British Steel.\" The ISTC steel union said: \"Our concern is that any investment abroad or merger abroad does not mean any reduction in investment in the United Kingdom and that any merger results in the new company going for a larger market share rather than the same market share which would mean heavy job rationalisation.\" Steel production in the north could be badly hit if, for example, British Steel decided not to go ahead with its plans for rebuilding the giant Redcar blast furnace. British Steel executives recently told union officials that they intend to increase UK investment by 50% to £300m over the next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jun/03/claredyer.stephenbates","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-03T02:54:37Z","webTitle":"World court 'concerned' at bombing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/03/claredyer.stephenbates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jun/03/claredyer.stephenbates","fields":{"headline":"World court 'concerned' at bombing","bodyText":"Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav government yesterday lost their audacious attempt in the International Court of Justice to try to halt the Nato bombing. The Hague-based world court rejected Yugoslavia's application for \"provisional measures\" in effect an interim injunction against 10 main Nato countries. But in a move that will cause some discomfort in Nato circles, the judges, who took their decision by 12 votes to four, expressed \"profound concern\" about the bombing campaign and called for a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The Sri Lankan presiding judge, Christopher Weeramantry, said during a two-hour ruling: \"The court is profoundly concerned about the use of force in Yugoslavia. Under the present circumstances, such use raises very serious issues of international law. The court is deeply concerned with the human suffering and loss of life in Kosovo that forms the background of this case and with the continued loss of life and human suffering in all parts of Yugoslavia.\" The Yugoslavs, who brought their application under the United Nations charter, the Geneva convention and the Genocide convention, failed to make out a prima facie case that the court, which can hear only disputes between states, had jurisdiction over the dispute. The ruling effectively ends the court's role in the current conflict. The next step is for it to consider in depth whether it has jurisdiction, but this could take two or three years. International law experts said that yesterday's ruling pointed to a likely eventual defeat for Belgrade. It may well decide not to take the case further. Ten countries were cited in the Yugoslav claim: Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Yugoslav move was shrewdly aimed at attacking the legality of Nato's offensive in the absence of a supporting United Nations security council resolution. The question of legality is unresolved, but Marc Weller, deputy director of the centre of international studies at Cambridge university, said it was arguable that the offensive was legally justified under the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. \"This has gained acceptance since 1990 in customary international law, especially when addressing a grave and overwhelming emergency which has been identified as such by the UN security council or other objective international agency.\" Mr Weller said the language chosen by the court to express its concern over the bombings was \"designed to appease all. Nato will be able to live with it because it expresses concern in general terms and does not condemn Nato.\" The Yugoslav regime had said it would accept any decision by the court relating to events only since April 25, a month after the Nato attacks began and after some of the worst cases of ethnic cleansing and expulsions by Serb troops. The court found that there was no arguable case for claiming under the genocide convention that the Nato attacks were aimed deliberately at destroying an ethnic group. Serb representatives at the court dismissed the ruling as politicised. But Mr Weller said: \"The court has held that what Nato is doing is by no stretch of the imagination genocide.\" He added: \"There is no doubt that any state which is a party to the genocide convention could bring a case against Yugoslavia for genocide.\" At last month's hearing, the Yugoslav claim that the Nato states were committing genocide in Kosovo was described by the US special counsel, David Andrews, as hypocrisy on an Orwellian scale. There is no appeal procedure from the judges' ruling, though the parties may choose to submit written arguments for further consideration. In the cases of Spain and the US, the court rejected the applications on technical grounds, because both countries have opted out of the genocide convention clause requiring disputes to be referred to the world court. Those two claims were dismissed altogether and will not feature in any further examination of the jurisdiction question. In the other eight cases, the court decided it lacked prima facie jurisdiction because its authority in the matter was not accepted by the states involved. However, it could still go on to consider jurisdiction in more depth. Britain, in particular, had opted out of the court's jurisdiction in a dispute with any state which, like Yugoslavia, filed a claim within 12 months of accepting the court's jurisdiction. Yugoslavia filed its claim within three days. The judgement stated: \"Whether or not states accept the jurisdiction of the court, they remain responsible for acts attributable to them that violate international law, including humanitarian law. Any disputes relating to the legality of such acts are required to be resolved by peaceful means, the choice of which is left to the parties\". In this context, \"the parties should take care not to aggravate or extend the dispute.\" The case, brought by the Yugoslav government last month, is separate from the indictment issued by another UN court, the war crimes tribunal, across town in The Hague last week, citing Mr Milosevic and four of his colleagues as war criminals. The international court has existed since 1946 to adjudicate in disputes between states. In that time it has issued 68 judgments and has 21 cases pending."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jun/03/balkans3","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-03T02:55:14Z","webTitle":"World court 'concerned' at bombing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/03/balkans3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jun/03/balkans3","fields":{"headline":"World court 'concerned' at bombing","bodyText":"Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav government yesterday lost their audacious attempt in the International Court of Justice to try to halt the Nato bombing.

A squall of up to 60mph hit the end of the Dart 18 Catamaran national championship off Weymouth, Dorset, tipping most of the 156 competitors in to the sea. Within three hours of the alarm being raised, all involved were reported safe. A 37-year-old woman was airlifted to the Dorset county hospital in Dorchester with reported hypothermia and up to 30 people were reported as needing treatment for cold. Rescue services won widespread praise for their response. Yachtsmen said they had dealt with the crisis in textbook fashion. Organisers including the Royal Dorset yacht club, the Weymouth sailing club and the Castle Cove sailing club insisted the squall had caught them by surprise despite daylong weather warnings of possible gale force winds. One yachtsman said national weather forecasts were often treated sceptically by sailors. The Met Office spokesman had warned of wind speeds of \"6 and 7 and occasionally 8\" - 8 is gale force - since 5am yesterday. The coastguard at nearby Hayling Island, Hampshire, yesterday afternoon had reported winds of 45mph, equivalent to a gale. But when competitors set off at 2pm wind speed for racing was a perfect 18-20 knots. \"They were smiling,\" said one yachtsman. Dart 18 yachts are popular and relatively cheap. Eighteen feet long and made of fibreglass with two cross beams of aluminium, they travel at a top speed of about 18 knots (20mph). As the south-westerly wind stepped up to around 6 and 7, an awkward sea mist set. Then the squall - a big \"downrush\" of wind which hits the sea surface and shoots up - hit the end of the race. Many capsized while others beached on the far side of the bay. Brian Phipps, 43, who sailed with his 10-year-old son Tom, from Falmouth, Cornwall, said many people took the sensible and standard practice of capsizing their boats themselves. His main concern was to make his son feel safe and the best way to do that was just to sit on the boat and talk to each other and wait. Jessica Walton, 21, from Stokes Bay Sailing Club, said: \"The wind just got up to quite gusty with 6ft to 7ft waves. We weren't able to tack very easily and we capsized. I got separated from the boat, which was frightening because the boat had righted itself and the wind caught the mainsail and pulled it away from me and I couldn't hold on. It was like a massive force pulling away from me.\" Another competitor, Mark Way from Portsmouth, an experienced sailor, admitted: \"It was very frightening. When the race started the conditions were perfect, but the squall hit so quickly and we did not stand a chance.\" Andy Jones, treasurer of the United Kingdom International Dart Association, said: \"During the race the wind just built and built. The gales were not expected till tonight. We expected a windy race today but we didn't expect the gale till early evening. We knew the forecast was for strong winds but we all fully expected to be finished by the time they came.\" Derek Sergeant, secretary of the Weymouth lifeboat, said the alarm was raised at 3.08pm by the coastguard. Seven crew cast off the Arun class lifeboat and the smaller inshore Atlantic 75 lifeboat was launched by its three crew. Ten private boats alerted by a private mayday call were used to ferry stranded sailors. The coastguard helicopter, Hotel Lima, also took part in the rescue. Police and coastguards broadcast appeals for all sailors who had been involved in the race to \"tally off\" with the race organisers. Several failed to do so at first, raising fears that 22 had drowned. By 5.30pm all but 12 competitors were accounted for, and by 6.30 all were declared safe. Mark Clark, a spokesman for Portland coastguard which co-ordinated the rescue, said: \"You could forecast that there was going to be poor weather this afternoon and in fact it is indeed. Squalls are another matter entirely and you can't forecast those.\" Organiser Jon Garcka defended the decision to hold the race. \"We do race in strong winds. The boats are designed to sail in strong winds. But a freak squall came over in the middle of the race.\" Mr Jones said: \"Assuming that nobody is hurt I don't see any reason why the championship shouldn't continue.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jun/03/renewableenergy.bp","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-03T15:23:04Z","webTitle":"Oil majors reach for the power switch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jun/03/renewableenergy.bp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jun/03/renewableenergy.bp","fields":{"headline":"Oil majors reach for the power switch","bodyText":"Heavyweight oil companies such as Shell and BP Amoco could become big providers of gas and electricity direct to British households. By completing the supply chain from the drill bit to the light switch, just as they control the production of petrol from oilfield to pump, oil companies would further their ambition to become all-round energy providers. Deregulation of electricity and gas supply in the United Kingdom, and the opportunity to sell a range of products under one brand, has already given consumers a taste of what the future might hold. Centrica, now demerged from the former British Gas, last year picked up 1.5m electricity customers. It is talking about providing customers with everything from financial services to security systems. The traditional labels of \"oil\" and \"gas\" companies are becoming meaningless, say industry watchers. BG itself, the former state-owned utility British Gas, has moved into the power-generation sector. Analysts predict BG will eventually spin off its exploration and production arm to concentrate on global downstream gas and power interests. Further afield, Shell has begun supplying gas and electricity to residents in the American state of Georgia and has purchased the gas-marketing customer bases of Total and Texaco in Britain. BP now provides gas and electricity direct to large industrial customers but says it has no plans to go further. Neither company has attempted to hide a growing interest in gas rather than oil. Shell acquired the US gas distribution and marketing company Tejas in 1998. A joint venture, Intergen, in partnership with US engineering group, Bechtel, has led Shell to commission two gas-fired power stations, one in the UK. BP, which has seen its reserves of gas jump from around 15% to 40% of its total through the Amoco tie-up, makes clear it wants to create as much demand as it can for gas. Last year it received permission to build a gas-fired power station in Hull while more recently it has obtained the green light for plants at Grangemouth and Baglan Bay. Even smaller exploration and production companies such as Premier Oil, which acts as a partner to Shell in Pakistan, has said its future lies with gas. The oil industry knows that demand for more environmentally-friendly fuels has meant that gas demand has outstripped oil and is likely to show double the amount of growth against oil over the next decade. This has led to US companies such as Enron, initially a pure gas pipeline operator, trading as much electricity as gas last year. Meanwhile Dominion Resources, which started life as a utility, has just bought out producing group Consolidated Natural Gas so it can provide consumers with both electricity and gas. Some of these industry changes were hastened by the slump in crude prices during 1998. Oil prices at the $10 per barrel mark for the key Brent blend - their lowest levels in 25 years - prompted a serious rethink about the best way to build future value for shareholders. The first way was to slash costs in the oil business by cutting back exploration and production expenditure while putting expensive development projects on hold. Costly oil regions such as the North Sea have had their profiles downgraded in favour of slightly higher risk but potentially more rewarding sectors such as the deepwater areas of the US Gulf, Angola and the Caspian Sea. The vast oil reserves of the Middle East have once again become an area of profound interest with French and British players queuing up to talk about projects with Iran and Libya. The second wave of cost savings came from mergers and acquisitions with BP starting the ball rolling with the £30.3bn takeover of Amoco. This was quickly followed by tie-ups between Exxon and Mobil, Total and Petrofina, plus a host of smaller deals such as that between Lasmo and Monument Oil &amp; Gas. There is plenty of scope for privatisations as governments worldwide look for ways to filling their coffers at a time when they have adopted free-market principles. There would be no lack of interest in foreign buyers seeing ways of gaining entry into difficult local markets, as the Argentinians have just found out with the sale of YPF to Repsol of Spain. Integrated oil groups such as BP and Shell have traditionally been involved in upstream exploration and production plus downstream refining and marketing. Chemicals have been a spin-off from the refining side. However, there are signs that the major oil companies, led by forward-looking chief executives such as Sir John Browne at BP Amoco, are willing to throw conventional wisdom overboard. Already Browne is leading the debate on the future of renewable energy sources while investing in solar power. The oil bosses can also see that highly volatile chemical sectors and cash-hungry refining plants make nothing like the returns of pipeline operations or power stations. They are as aware as Centrica that further down the supply chain there are even wider opportunities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/jun/05/books.guardianreview10","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-05T01:09:32Z","webTitle":"The perils of Pauline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jun/05/books.guardianreview10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/jun/05/books.guardianreview10","fields":{"headline":"The perils of Pauline","bodyText":"The evening before he died, John Smith arrived late for the gala dinner with which Labour launched its 1994 European Election Campaign and which provided its more wealthy supporters with a chance to make a conspicuous contribution to party funds. Pauline Green, for a year the leader of British Labour members of the European parliament, but virtually unknown in London, was mildly irritated by being left alone to greet the celebrity diners. But when Smith eventually arrived together with Michel Rocard, sometime prime minister of France, leader of the French Socialist Party and guest of honour, all was forgiven. Smith gave a reassuring nod and wink. During the discussions which had delayed his arrival, Rocard had agreed that Pauline Green should lead the socialist MEPs, the largest group in the parliament. Green says she does not know why Smith chose her. She had been leader of the British Labour Group in Europe (recently renamed the European Parliamentary Labour Party) for barely a year. And when she was first asked who should lead the whole socialist contingent, she suggested two names which, \"John said he didn't think suitable\". But it is not hard to guess why she became Smith's candidate. Like him, she radiates blunt practicality - a desire to be guided by common sense and an antagonism (which amounts almost to contempt) towards the superficialities of political image-making. And, like him, she looks as if she would be difficult to knock over. Green - a notably unpretentious woman - agrees that there was a good deal of \"Buggins turn\" about her appointment as the most powerful member of the parliament. The procedure by which she was elected was an uncomfortable compromise between the demands of individual member states and the rights of MEPs. The national leaders of the socialist and social democratic parties make an agreed nomination which the MEPs then endorse or reject. Jean-Paul Cot of France, Green's predecessor, was an academic lawyer from Caen who became famous for both accusing Britain of \"playing Russian roulette with Europe\" and suggesting that the United Kingdom was in desperate need of Norman wisdom. Having caused much offence by his uncompromising views on European Union, he stood no chance of a renomination. John Smith was determined that Britain - and Green - should fill the vacancy. Like her enthusiasm for European Union, Green's down-to-earth approach to politics is the product of her upbringing. There was no silver spoon. Bertram Wiltshire, her father, was a Scottish soldier who, at 20, married his 16-year-old Maltese sweetheart. Pauline was born in 1948 while he was still stationed on Malta. She spent \"a lot of the very young days in army barracks\" and, in consequence \"missed out on secondary and further education\". Her earliest memory is Guy Fawkes Day 1956 when the family had moved to Germany. \"Usually bonfire night was a big event and I was looking forward to it. I remember how disappointed I felt when it was cancelled.\" Soviet tanks had suppressed the Hungarian uprising and the British Army of the Rhine was on full alert. Enthusiasm for the European Union is often more the result of personal inclination than of political judgement or economic analysis. Pauline Green developed the instinct when she was young. \"Remember\", she says, \"my background as a little girl going round Europe.\" Remember too her disappointment on November 5 1956. When she talks about the advantages of the union - and especially its enlargement to include the old Soviet satellites - the first benefit that comes to mind is guaranteeing the peace. The seeds which were planted in the married quarters of the British army abroad took some time to grow. Green wanted, above all else, to be a police officer. At first that ambition was denied her. Back in civilian life, her father, manager of an off-licence in London's Kilburn Broadway, was anxious that his eldest daughter did something safe and steady. So she studied for an Ordinary National Diploma in business studies at Kilburn Polytechnic. For three years she was a secretary at a firm of wallpaper manufacturers, earning, from the start, more than her father. After four years she was personal secretary to the finance director. She was also dissatisfied with the sedentary life. On her 21st birthday, December 8 1969, she joined the police. Commentators - particularly those critical of her performance during the Strasbourg parliament's censure of the European Commission earlier this year - wrote of her as if she had left the beat a couple of days before her first European election. In fact she was a police officer for only four years. During her time in the West Hampstead division she met and married PC Paul Green. Regulations prevented them from serving in the same division and, in those unequal days, it was the woman who had to move. She resigned from the police in 1974, five months before the birth of her first baby. Chief superintendent Paul Green is now borough commander for Brent, part of his wife's north London Euro-constituency. She is anxious to emphasise that, despite his promotion and her election, they have lived in the same house for more than 20 years. There is no adequate preparation for life in the arcane world of Euro-politics. And within the myriad institutions, nothing is quite so bewilderingly complex as the parliament itself - a vast conglomeration of rival national interests which possesses neither independent legislative powers nor the right to exercise detailed control over the commission executive, which is, in effect, Europe's cabinet. However, Green served an apprenticeship of a sort. At home with her two children - her son is now studying for his PhD and her daughter is a nurse - she needed something to occupy her mind. A degree from the Open University was followed by two full-time years at the London School of Economics and an MSc (Econ) in comparative government. She described her LSE interview in endearingly self-deprecatory terms: \"It was the time when the Open University was the big thing. And I went, ready to talk about what I'd done. They asked me if I had GCE maths.\" After a couple of jobs in local social work and increasing activity on the soft left of her local Labour party she became the parliamentary officer of the Cooperative Party. The job, like Europe itself, was changing fast. Her predecessors had lobbied in Whitehall and Westminster. More and more of Green's efforts were concentrated on Brussels. There she promoted the food hygiene directive, the first item of European legislation to be pioneered from outside the institutions of the union. At least it helped her to master the strange jargon. The white paper which proposed the creation of the Single European Market said nothing about common standards of food hygiene. A few products, meat and poultry amongst them, were covered by specific regulations. But the British cooperative movement thought that more comprehensive legislation was needed. John Tilley, secretary of the cooperative union, was \"astonished by the competence\" with which Green promoted the idea: \"After all she hadn't had a regular job for 10 or 15 years.\" When she said she was going to stand for \"a hopeless seat in the European elections\", he thought: \"It will do no harm and she'll learn a bit more about Europe\". She won and, as an MEP, helped to ensure the adoption of the draft directive. An unsuccessful campaign to win a seat on the local council had whetted her appetite for elective politics. Nobody without a surplus of energy and enthusiasm contests elections. Massive \"Euro-constituencies\" elected MEPs on the first-past-the-post system, which is still the rule in general elections. In her successful pursuit of the nomination, Green visited \"most of the 65 local branches\". Before the election the Tories held the seat with a majority of 6,000. Green won by the same margin. New members were entitled to feel lost amongst the constitution, complications and contradictions of the Strasbourg parliament. But, Green says, without a hint of conceit, that the new entrants of 1989 \"all knew what they were doing. They were people who had chosen to go to Europe, interested in European politics in its own right.\" The implication was clear. Before that watershed, Strasbourg had too often been used as a springboard for a soft landing in Westminster. And Labour MEPs had often fought to the near political death in battles which, as well as reflecting the ancient schism between left and right, also concerned the vexed issue of members' allowances. At one group meeting, at which the British permanent representative to the commission was scheduled to speak, the formal business was postponed while one member accused another of buying \"bucket shop\" air tickets and selling them to colleagues at inflated prices. The man against whom the allegations were made claimed total innocence and accused his assailant of sleeping on her office floor but claiming the cost of nights in a Strasbourg hotel. Allegations of corruption and extravagance persist. Candidates of all parties contesting next Thursday's election are regularly told by voters to \"get off the gravy train\" and \"keep their hands out of the till\". Newspapers have accused Green of using her official car in Britain and of arranging a meeting in Cyprus so she could have a free trip to an assistant's wedding. She has used the car in London twice this year perfectly legally, and the wedding - three years ago - was, she says, arranged after the meeting. She has begun to wonder if one of her Brussels comrades is spreading the stories. The European Labour group is a notoriously uncomradely institution. It includes David Martin, Barry Seal and Glyn Ford, all ex-leaders elected and deposed within a single decade. Green concedes that \"the issue of how members use their allowances remains\" - meaning, without saying it, that some of her colleagues are still using their expenses in a way which would not be allowed in the increasingly prudential British House of Commons. The problem is not, however, anything like as bad as it was. Among British MEPs the greater concern with probity, and the related willingness to be subject to financial scrutiny, coincided with \"the greater professionalism\" which the socialists' leader claims has given them much \"more focus and much more cohesion\". Ironically, all the improvements began under the leadership of Glyn Ford - now accused of misappropriating his own expenses. Green is full of praise for Ford's modernising efforts. But it did not stop her in 1993 challenging and beating him for the leadership of the British Labour Group. Ford was not a popular leader. One of his colleagues described him as an \"ex-Spartist who suddenly moved to the authoritarian right of the party. The old left thought of him as a deserter and the right just didn't trust him.\" Philip Whitehead, the television director turned MEP, says that Green at once established herself as \"the clear voice of sanity. She was very direct, a refreshing no-nonsense figure.\" After a year at the head of the British MEPs, she moved on to lead 221 socialists from 15 different countries. The issue facing the new European parliament, and the leader of the largest group within it, was the endorsement of the new commission, including its president, Jacques Santer. The parliament was doubtful about Santer from the start. He had been imposed by John Major, who feared that the alternative nominees would pursue \"the federalist agenda\" of which the Tory Eurosceptics were so fearful. True to her down-to-earth approach, Green was less concerned about his European philosophy than his willingness and ability to push through essential reforms to the commission. The necessary changes all concerned money. The priority she gives to competence over ideology is typical of her approach. She dismisses the dream (or nightmare) of a European super-state with the concession that \"if, in 75 years' time, we move towards a federal Europe, so be it\". In the past \"too many European elders have swum against the tide of public opinion. It is important, before we take any new initiative, to secure a majority of public opinion behind what we are doing now. I don't want us to do any more until we are better at what we are doing already.\" It was clear from the start that those objectives could only be achieved by a major reform of the commission - the effective executive of the union. And nobody believed that Jacques Santer could bring it about. But the parliament had only the power to accept or reject the entire commission. \"We agreed because most of them were fine. It was 17 to three. So we let it go. Next time, if there was only one not up to the job, we'd reject them all.\" Despite the early doubts about Santer's enthusiasm for reform, \"discussions went on for some time\". They were principally concerned with what Green calls \"the culture of the commission\" which produces \"an antipathy to accountability\". But there was also a fundamental structural problem. \"The commission's job has changed without the commission changing: 10 years ago it was a largely representative body. Now it has a multi-million pound programme to implement. Yet its decision-making process is just the same as it always was. \"Then we all rightly became preoccupied with what we called budgetary rigour, absolutely necessary in times of financial stringency. But too often it was interpreted as meaning no more staff. So we threw more and more jobs at the commission - Mediterranean policy, big budget. Central European policy, big budget. Humanitarian aid, big budget. Because they were allowed no more staff, they employed external agencies to spend the money. And you don't have proper control over external agencies.\" If Europe needs more managers and fewer visionaries, Pauline Green is one answer to its prayer. \"If the commission is to do its job,\" she says \"we can't cut down. We have to make sure that the money is spent more effectively.\" That requires commissioners no less than MEPs \"to act in the interests of the union as a whole\". Yet \"there is far too much concentration on national interests, especially with the cabinets. It sounds like a small thing, but it is essential that each commissioner has a multi-national cabinet to give him or her a wider perspective.\" It is, in its way, a prosaic suggestion - but at this stage of its development prosaic suggestions are exactly what the EU needs - and it is only slightly diminished by the claim of Green's critics that her own office is \"insular and monolingual\". She may have fewer enemies than her predecessor but they do exist. If Green is re-elected leader of the socialist MEPs - and she had already made clear that she has no wish to occupy the \"largely bureaucratic\" presidency of the parliament - they are the sort of reforms which she will, methodically, attempt to impose. One problem is the heterogeneous quality of the MEP group she leads. It is made up of men and women who are held together \"not by discipline but goodwill and a desire to find a genuine common European position\". Agreement is achieved \"85% of the time. For the rest, the national agendas take over. For the Spaniards it's fish, for the British agriculture and for the Belgians taxation.\" Julian Priestley, the British chef de cabinet of the parliament, says Green has been \"remarkably successful in keeping her followers united\". There have been occasional disruptions. \"When she makes up her mind, she can suddenly take off at great speed - and this place normally works on a slow consensus.\" But normally, \"she makes sure that her troops are behind her. She is an instinctive politician. And her direct, far from traditional style has gone down very well. She has an extraordinary understanding of southern European attitudes, partly from the Maltese connection and partly her Cypriot constituents.\" It is reflected in her theory of leadership - \"it is not about stuffing little delegations but giving special attention to little delegations and creating a feeling of consensus\". Neil Kinnock, who barely knew her when he was leader of the Labour Party, has, since he became a European commissioner, formed a firm view both of her character and the reason why at least some of the non-British European socialists have reservations about her leadership style. She is, he says, \"strong, confident and well organised\". Those characteristics are universally admired. But there are some members of the socialist group who, Kinnock says, \"do not like anyone so firm and focused. They like decisions to be floppy and fluffy.\" Floppy and fluffy Pauline Green is not. Yet this apparent paragon of European virtue has, over the past six months, been constantly excoriated for what her critics claim was vacillation over the way in which the commission, and the budget which it controls, could be brought under control. Many of the attacks have been the result of newspapers making the mistake of which Green says British MEPs were once guilty - \"confusing the European parliament with national parliaments, when it has different powers and responsibilities\". But even her closest friends admit that her attempts to improve financial discipline did not, in the words of one Westminster veteran, \"come over as a coherent strategy\". A harsher critic says, in the patois of the moment, \"Having considered several alternative ways of making the commission more accountable, she suddenly declared war without being certain what her war aims were.\" In Green's defence it must be understood that the parliament possesses strictly limited powers. One of them is to \"discharge the budget\" - in effect confirm that the year's expenditure conforms to the plans originally set out by the commission, and that the money was spent honestly and efficiently. In March 1998 the parliament decided to postpone \"discharge\" of the 1996 budget until it had been satisfied on five points. As always, the concerns were expressed in language which is more usually employed by I-speak-your-weight machines. But, equally common in Strasbourg, the disputes involved huge amounts of money. A typical example of the parliament's concern was \"the non- execution of the recommendations of its committee of inquiry into the transit system, especially regarding the computerised control system\", which, deciphered, means stopping fraud. Green is shrewd enough to understand how easy it is for MEPs to get sucked into the system and she talks openly about the \"tensions between the specialist MEPs on the parliament's committees and the politicians who see the issue more of national public reactions\". For six months the parliament's budgetary control committee put pressure on the commission as a reflection of \"national public reaction\" to even the suggestion of waste or fraud. Then the specialists - among them two senior socialist MEPs - reported considerable, if barely visible, improvement. The socialist group decided to support discharge but press for more radical change. Nobody should have been surprised when the rest of the parliament seized the opportunity to demonstrate its own probity, the socialists' profligacy and the commission's incompetence in a single vote. The motion to discharge the budget was defeated by a combination of parties of the centre and the right. It was then that the behaviour of the socialists and Green became more Byzantine than European. The refusal to discharge the budget was, they claimed, created by a conflict between executive and parliament which, in a national democracy, would be resolved by a vote of confidence. Since that procedure does not appear in the Strasbourg constitution, the socialists decided to pursue what they believed to be the closest equivalent. They tabled a motion of censure which, since they had already recorded their belief that the commission was mending its ways, they immediately announced they would vote against. In her speech, proposing the resolution which she hoped would be defeated, Pauline Green made her position as clear as was possible in the circumstances. \"Those who feel that the commission was culpable with respect to the 1996 budget should face up to their responsibilities ... One of the fundamental reasons for tabling this motion of censure was to decide now - immediately - whether or not the European Commission is able to do its work.\" In House of Commons terms that was a highly responsible position for the leader of the largest party to take up. The commission had to be either sacked or backed. The tactic also enabled her, at least in retrospect, to claim that, by defeating her own vote of censure and saving the commission, she had made it the creature of the socialist group. That might well have happened if the world, as seen from Brussels, had not dramatically changed over Christmas 1998. At the end of the year a deep throat whispered stories of nepotism and corruption. Edith Cresson of France was, rightly, as it turned out, said to have appointed her dentist as special adviser on the environment. She and Manuel Marin of Spain were named as the principal culprits. A group of \"experts\" - the EU description of all specialists - were asked to inquire into the whole operation of the commission. The results, although exonerating Marin of any wrong-doing, led to the second and successful censure motion, supported by the socialist group and its leader as well as the rest of the parliament. The commission resigned although, bewilderingly, its members kept their salaries and their jobs. Green's hopes for \"a change in culture\" and \"more transparency and accountability\" suddenly seemed modest ambitions. On the other hand, her ambition to lead the socialists for another five years may not be realised. If it were left to the MEPs she would almost certainly survive. But she is dependent on the nomination of the national leaders of the European parties, a group of politicians notoriously attracted to the notion that jobs ought to be rotated amongst nationalities. And, unlike 1994, she will not go to Strasbourg in the glow of a British election triumph, even if this week's Guardian poll showed that 68% of voters in Britain believe the election is important. Thanks to the introduction of proportional representation, the new European parliamentary Labour party may be only half the size of the old. Green told her colleagues: \"Tony has asked me to stand again\". In a week or so we will know whether he was able to deliver."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1999/jun/05/eu.politics2","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-05T08:16:20Z","webTitle":"The perils of Pauline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/05/eu.politics2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jun/05/eu.politics2","fields":{"headline":"The perils of Pauline","bodyText":"The evening before he died, John Smith arrived late for the gala dinner with which Labour launched its 1994 European Election Campaign and which provided its more wealthy supporters with a chance to make a conspicuous contribution to party funds.

One of his colleagues described him as an \"ex-Spartist who suddenly moved to the authoritarian right of the party. The old left thought of him as a deserter and the right just didn't trust him.\" Philip Whitehead, the television director turned MEP, says that Green at once established herself as \"the clear voice of sanity. She was very direct, a refreshing no-nonsense figure.\" After a year at the head of the British MEPs, she moved on to lead 221 socialists from 15 different countries. The issue facing the new European parliament, and the leader of the largest group within it, was the endorsement of the new commission, including its president, Jacques Santer. The parliament was doubtful about Santer from the start. He had been imposed by John Major, who feared that the alternative nominees would pursue \"the federalist agenda\" of which the Tory Eurosceptics were so fearful. True to her down-to-earth approach, Green was less concerned about his European philosophy than his willingness and ability to push through essential reforms to the commission. The necessary changes all concerned money. The priority she gives to competence over ideology is typical of her approach. She dismisses the dream (or nightmare) of a European super-state with the concession that \"if, in 75 years' time, we move towards a federal Europe, so be it\". In the past \"too many European elders have swum against the tide of public opinion. It is important, before we take any new initiative, to secure a majority of public opinion behind what we are doing now. I don't want us to do any more until we are better at what we are doing already.\" It was clear from the start that those objectives could only be achieved by a major reform of the commission - the effective executive of the union. And nobody believed that Jacques Santer could bring it about. But the parliament had only the power to accept or reject the entire commission. \"We agreed because most of them were fine. It was 17 to three. So we let it go. Next time, if there was only one not up to the job, we'd reject them all.\" Despite the early doubts about Santer's enthusiasm for reform, \"discussions went on for some time\". They were principally concerned with what Green calls \"the culture of the commission\" which produces \"an antipathy to accountability\". But there was also a fundamental structural problem. \"The commission's job has changed without the commission changing: 10 years ago it was a largely representative body. Now it has a multi-million pound programme to implement. Yet its decision-making process is just the same as it always was. \"Then we all rightly became preoccupied with what we called budgetary rigour, absolutely necessary in times of financial stringency. But too often it was interpreted as meaning no more staff. So we threw more and more jobs at the commission - Mediterranean policy, big budget. Central European policy, big budget. Humanitarian aid, big budget. Because they were allowed no more staff, they employed external agencies to spend the money. And you don't have proper control over external agencies.\" If Europe needs more managers and fewer visionaries, Pauline Green is one answer to its prayer. \"If the commission is to do its job,\" she says \"we can't cut down. We have to make sure that the money is spent more effectively.\" That requires commissioners no less than MEPs \"to act in the interests of the union as a whole\". Yet \"there is far too much concentration on national interests, especially with the cabinets. It sounds like a small thing, but it is essential that each commissioner has a multi-national cabinet to give him or her a wider perspective.\" It is, in its way, a prosaic suggestion - but at this stage of its development prosaic suggestions are exactly what the EU needs - and it is only slightly diminished by the claim of Green's critics that her own office is \"insular and monolingual\". She may have fewer enemies than her predecessor but they do exist. If Green is re-elected leader of the socialist MEPs - and she had already made clear that she has no wish to occupy the \"largely bureaucratic\" presidency of the parliament - they are the sort of reforms which she will, methodically, attempt to impose. One problem is the heterogeneous quality of the MEP group she leads. It is made up of men and women who are held together \"not by discipline but goodwill and a desire to find a genuine common European position\". Agreement is achieved \"85% of the time. For the rest, the national agendas take over. For the Spaniards it's fish, for the British agriculture and for the Belgians taxation.\" Julian Priestley, the British chef de cabinet of the parliament, says Green has been \"remarkably successful in keeping her followers united\". There have been occasional disruptions. \"When she makes up her mind, she can suddenly take off at great speed - and this place normally works on a slow consensus.\" But normally, \"she makes sure that her troops are behind her. She is an instinctive politician. And her direct, far from traditional style has gone down very well. She has an extraordinary understanding of southern European attitudes, partly from the Maltese connection and partly her Cypriot constituents.\" It is reflected in her theory of leadership - \"it is not about stuffing little delegations but giving special attention to little delegations and creating a feeling of consensus\". Neil Kinnock, who barely knew her when he was leader of the Labour Party, has, since he became a European commissioner, formed a firm view both of her character and the reason why at least some of the non-British European socialists have reservations about her leadership style. She is, he says, \"strong, confident and well organised\". Those characteristics are universally admired. But there are some members of the socialist group who, Kinnock says, \"do not like anyone so firm and focused. They like decisions to be floppy and fluffy.\" Floppy and fluffy Pauline Green is not. Yet this apparent paragon of European virtue has, over the past six months, been constantly excoriated for what her critics claim was vacillation over the way in which the commission, and the budget which it controls, could be brought under control. Many of the attacks have been the result of newspapers making the mistake of which Green says British MEPs were once guilty - \"confusing the European parliament with national parliaments, when it has different powers and responsibilities\". But even her closest friends admit that her attempts to improve financial discipline did not, in the words of one Westminster veteran, \"come over as a coherent strategy\". A harsher critic says, in the patois of the moment, \"Having considered several alternative ways of making the commission more accountable, she suddenly declared war without being certain what her war aims were.\" In Green's defence it must be understood that the parliament possesses strictly limited powers. One of them is to \"discharge the budget\" - in effect confirm that the year's expenditure conforms to the plans originally set out by the commission, and that the money was spent honestly and efficiently. In March 1998 the parliament decided to postpone \"discharge\" of the 1996 budget until it had been satisfied on five points. As always, the concerns were expressed in language which is more usually employed by I-speak-your-weight machines. But, equally common in Strasbourg, the disputes involved huge amounts of money. A typical example of the parliament's concern was \"the non- execution of the recommendations of its committee of inquiry into the transit system, especially regarding the computerised control system\", which, deciphered, means stopping fraud. Green is shrewd enough to understand how easy it is for MEPs to get sucked into the system and she talks openly about the \"tensions between the specialist MEPs on the parliament's committees and the politicians who see the issue more of national public reactions\". For six months the parliament's budgetary control committee put pressure on the commission as a reflection of \"national public reaction\" to even the suggestion of waste or fraud. Then the specialists - among them two senior socialist MEPs - reported considerable, if barely visible, improvement. The socialist group decided to support discharge but press for more radical change. Nobody should have been surprised when the rest of the parliament seized the opportunity to demonstrate its own probity, the socialists' profligacy and the commission's incompetence in a single vote. The motion to discharge the budget was defeated by a combination of parties of the centre and the right. It was then that the behaviour of the socialists and Green became more Byzantine than European. The refusal to discharge the budget was, they claimed, created by a conflict between executive and parliament which, in a national democracy, would be resolved by a vote of confidence. Since that procedure does not appear in the Strasbourg constitution, the socialists decided to pursue what they believed to be the closest equivalent. They tabled a motion of censure which, since they had already recorded their belief that the commission was mending its ways, they immediately announced they would vote against. In her speech, proposing the resolution which she hoped would be defeated, Pauline Green made her position as clear as was possible in the circumstances. \"Those who feel that the commission was culpable with respect to the 1996 budget should face up to their responsibilities ... One of the fundamental reasons for tabling this motion of censure was to decide now - immediately - whether or not the European Commission is able to do its work.\" In House of Commons terms that was a highly responsible position for the leader of the largest party to take up. The commission had to be either sacked or backed. The tactic also enabled her, at least in retrospect, to claim that, by defeating her own vote of censure and saving the commission, she had made it the creature of the socialist group. That might well have happened if the world, as seen from Brussels, had not dramatically changed over Christmas 1998. At the end of the year a deep throat whispered stories of nepotism and corruption. Edith Cresson of France was, rightly, as it turned out, said to have appointed her dentist as special adviser on the environment. She and Manuel Marin of Spain were named as the principal culprits. A group of \"experts\" - the EU description of all specialists - were asked to inquire into the whole operation of the commission. The results, although exonerating Marin of any wrong-doing, led to the second and successful censure motion, supported by the socialist group and its leader as well as the rest of the parliament. The commission resigned although, bewilderingly, its members kept their salaries and their jobs. Green's hopes for \"a change in culture\" and \"more transparency and accountability\" suddenly seemed modest ambitions. On the other hand, her ambition to lead the socialists for another five years may not be realised. If it were left to the MEPs she would almost certainly survive. But she is dependent on the nomination of the national leaders of the European parties, a group of politicians notoriously attracted to the notion that jobs ought to be rotated amongst nationalities. And, unlike 1994, she will not go to Strasbourg in the glow of a British election triumph, even if this week's Guardian poll showed that 68% of voters in Britain believe the election is important. Thanks to the introduction of proportional representation, the new European parliamentary Labour party may be only half the size of the old. Green told her colleagues: \"Tony has asked me to stand again\". In a week or so we will know whether he was able to deliver."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jun/06/drugstrade","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-06T03:45:55Z","webTitle":"Drug cash laundered through royal bank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jun/06/drugstrade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jun/06/drugstrade","fields":{"headline":"Drug cash laundered through royal bank","bodyText":"Coutts &amp; Co, bankers to the Royal family, is being targeted by money-launderers and criminals who are laundering millions of pounds of drug profits through its branches. Coutts and other private banks have been criticised by the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) for failing to co-operate fully in the fight against money-laundering. All banks have a legal duty to report suspicious transactions. Around 30 per cent of all such reports add significantly to existing police or customs investigations. The most recent figures released by NCIS show that in 1998 it received 14,129 disclosures, the vast majority from banks and bureaux de change. During that same period, Coutts made no reports of suspicious transactions, claiming there were none to report. Although it will not comment on specific banks, NCIS is disappointed by this. Simon Goddard, of NCIS's Strategic and Specialist Intelligence Branch, said: 'A large number of financial institutions, including private and investment banks - some highly respected names - make little or no disclosures to NCIS. Of the over 500 deposit-taking institutions in the United Kingdom, only eight are responsible for 70 per cent of the disclosures. 'It is our strong view that financial institutions seem increasingly split between those with proper reporting systems, trained staff and motivated money-laundering reporting officers, and those where the disclosure regime is somewhat lacking.' Private banks such as Coutts are far more likely to be targeted by major money-launderers. The nature of their business and financial background of their clientele means they are far more used to, and far more likely to be dealing with, extremely large transactions or large quantities of cash on a regular basis than their high-street cousins. The fact that they have a network of branches around the world makes it even easier to launder cash. The reputation of banks such as Coutts means that other financial institutions are far less likely to question the origin of money sent to them from a Coutts bank. In public, Coutts says its superior vetting procedures ensure that unsavoury customers are not able to open accounts, and that this means it simply does not have any suspicious transactions to report. In private, bank officials are said to believe that a regime of reporting would be unpopular with clients, who might take their business elsewhere. There is no suggestion that Coutts is actively assisting in the laundering of money through its branches. The most recent Home Affairs Select Committee report suggested that British banks were unknowingly helping to launder around £2 billion each year. But, despite its safeguards, Coutts has fallen victim to launderers in the past. The infamous Mafia mobster Emilio Di Giovine, who is now serving time for extortion, drug running and manslaughter, laundered nearly £2 million of cash from his criminal empire through his Coutts account. In 1995 the former deputy finance director of Scotland Yard was jailed after stealing more than £5 million from a secret police account. He opened an account at Coutts to help to launder the proceeds and even received a coveted gold card."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/1999/jun/06/newsstory.sport2","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-06T19:44:13Z","webTitle":"Why must they always play along with the dictators?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jun/06/newsstory.sport2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/1999/jun/06/newsstory.sport2","fields":{"headline":"Why must they always play along with the dictators?","bodyText":"There is a gaggle of people who are angry that Ireland cancelled their match with Yugoslavia yesterday. They think Uefa should ban the Irish from Euro 2000, because, as they say: 'Sport has nothing to do with politics.' If this were true hardly anyone would bother watching those boring matches in the World Cup. International football matters because, like politics, it is about identity. A national team is the nation made flesh: people feel that those eleven young men in garish shirts are England, or Ireland, or Yugoslavia. Because the team is more than just the team, playing football against a bad state is nauseating. This is made plain by a book called Football Ambassador, first published in January 1945, whose author, Eddie Hapgood, captained the England side that played Germany in Berlin in 1938. Before the game, he recalls, FA officials were debating whether the players should give the Nazi salute. The England amateur team at the Berlin Olympics two years before had granted Hitler only an 'eyes right' drawing boos from the German crowd. Stanley Rous, secretary of the FA, later president of Fifa, decided that this time the players would 'get the crowd in a good temper' by giving the salute. Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador, was 'vastly relieved' to hear the news, but Hapgood was miffed ('We are of the British Empire and I do not see any reason . . .') Still, he obeyed. The photograph of the England team's salute went around the world. 'The only humorous thing about the whole affair,' writes Hapgood, 'was that while we gave the salute only one way, the German team gave it to the four corners of the ground.' England won 6-3, which Hapgood thought served the Nazis right. Sir Nevile watched the game with Hess, Ribbentrop and Goering, the last of whom knew so little about football that he was seen gazing through his field-glasses at the English goal while England were scoring at the other end. Ah, the gaggle says, but refusing to play such games would be to punish the German and Yugoslav players, who are innocent victims of their own regimes. This argument is irrelevant - - missing out on a football match pales as a suffering beside being ethnically cleansed - but in the case of Yugoslavia it is wrong anyway. On a sunny day about a year ago I went to the Yugoslav training camp in the French village of Saint Galmier. The World Cup had just begun, Serb units were killing and raping people in Kosovo, and NATO was threatening to bomb Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav team were, quite naturally, in no mood for western visitors and held a press conference only because the World Cup organisers made them. Slobodan Santrac, the Yugoslav coach, faced the press as if he were a brave POW under interrogation. 'You can torture me, you kill me, but I'm saying nothing,' seemed to be his attitude. He told us: 'All games at a World Cup are tough,' 'We hope to win,' and finally: 'Football is a game of eleven men,' which the interpreter rendered as: 'Football is a game of ten men.' It was clear that Santrac was deliberately insulting our intelligence. Later I asked Ivica Kralj, the keeper, whether it was strange to be at a World Cup when bad things were happening to Kosovan Albanians. Kralj peered down on me as if upon a moronic and evil child. 'I don't know how much truth there is in the pictures on the international television stations,' he said. He could have said that he was just a footballer who knew nothing about such things, but I have never heard a Serb player take the 'innocent victim' line. Zjelko Petrovic, the midfield player, confided: 'I shouldn't say it, but we have a special motivation against Germany and the US. We will kill to win.' Uefa will probably decide to punish the Irish. In a way, this is natural. If every country went around boycotting countries it didn't like then football would become like the Olympics. When it comes to sanctions against evil states, Uefa follows the United Nations, and there are no UN sporting sanctions against Yugoslavia. Yet something disgusting is going on here. The people who run football belong to the gaggle: they have always believed that there is a kingdom of football separable from real life. This moral indifference leads them to be nice to dictators. Rous arranged the Nazi salute; Jules Rimet, founder of the World Cup, took the French team to Germany in March 1933, saw the crowd listen politely to the Marseillaise, and promised that on his return to France he would correct mistaken views about Germany; Joao Havelange, head of Fifa, spied for the Brazilian secret service and was made an honorary chieftain by the Nigerian murderer Abacha. Listening to all those national anthems makes football officials go soft in the head."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/1999/jun/07/news","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-07T17:15:14Z","webTitle":"The Krypton factor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jun/07/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/jun/07/news","fields":{"headline":"The Krypton factor","bodyText":"Rumour has it that a new Superman storyline is being considered by Warner Bros.

Hannibal proving too greedy The making of Hannibal - the sequel to Silence of the Lambs - is proving to be a tricky affair. Producer Dino de Laurentiis owns the rights to Hannibal and a previous deal between him and Universal gives the company first option and last refusal rights on any flesh-eating projects. But reports from Universal suggest that the studio may decide not to produce the sequel because it is \"costing an arm and a leg.\" Universal has already spent $10m on the movie rights and may have to spend four times that much to sign each of the two original stars, Anthony Hopkins and Jodi Foster. De Laurentiis is reportedly trying to drop \"Judy\" as he allegedly refers to Foster, in order to save $20m, the going rate for both A-list stars. You'll do it my way The government is considering setting up a film industry training support scheme to complement the skills fund it announced at Cannes last month. The financial support for the project would come from the Department for Education and Employment and supplement the $2.4m (£1.5m) that the skills fund is expected to raise per annum. Participation in the fund will be voluntary, but access to public funding through the Film Council - to be operational by April 2000 - will be dependent upon contributions to the fund.

Estate agents Knight Frank say parental choice has \"affected the structure of the prime housing market around Britain\". A school doing well in the league tables can add as much to 10% to purchase prices in its neighbourhood. In Kent where grammar schools still flourish or districts such as Oxford as much as 50 per cent of house-buying is based on securing some kind of educational advantage. This integration of housing and school choices needs to be recognised as a social fact. It is going to result in further social and geographical polarisation within cities, as the more successful schools act as magnets and magnifiers on the housing market and price out low-income families. Schools which are left behind can get trapped into a vicious circle of decline. Where parents don't move house to be near school, they accept longer school journeys as a necessary evil. According to the government's latest transport trends report, the average length of all school trips has increased from 2.1 miles to 2.7 miles over the last decade. That's good news for the car industry and public transport operators, but bad news for Frank Dobson's public health objectives or John Prescott's programme to reduce car use in cities. Over the past decade, \"school-run\" journeys have risen by 52% (and mileage by 90%) and now outnumber business trips. According to Birmingham's director of housing, Graham Farrant, just under 20% of his city's rush-hour traffic is made up of parents driving children to and from school. Britain is following the North American pattern of ever-increasing reliance on the car, with women bearing the brunt of the escort duties. The increasing use of cars further exacerbates the educational divide. The pedestrians' association has recently shown that poorer families have less access to the use of a car and correspondingly lack the means to exercise full choice, as children from the poorest families are almost twice as likely to walk to school as children from the highest income brackets. Such obstacles to equality of opportunity might explain why a recent parliamentary answer revealed that only 3.4% of grammar school pupils are eligible for free school meals, compared to a national average of 18%, confirming the impression that grammar schools are still largely self-selecting, and are not the escape route for the high-flying children of working-class families as is sometimes portrayed. Both trends - moving house or chauffeuring children further to school, one centripetal, the other centrifugal - pose problems for other areas of government policy. Neither helps create the stable and mixed communities which are actively promoted elsewhere in the government's vision of a better Britain. It is also worth reflecting on one part of the United Kingdom where parental choice operates differently, Northern Ireland. There, over 90% of children attend either protestant or catholic schools, resulting in other kinds of polarisation. Whatever form it takes, unmediated or unmoderated parental choice stores up problems in the long term for different civic goals. The government has been taking tentative steps to address some of these issues, but they remain at the level of wishful thinking rather than thought-through strategies. John Prescott's transport white paper last year argued for \"encouraging schools and local authorities to take account of the transport implications of their educational policies\". However, there's little evidence of what this means in practice. Similarly the intention to create more socially mixed communities through jumbling up different kinds of housing tenure in new urban regeneration schemes, is already in trouble according to recent research published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. This was a study of Teesside housing initiatives which showed how the development of owner-occupied housing in a renewal area had exacerbated social tensions rather than lightened them. Twentieth-century town planning made the school the focal point of the neighbourhood or community. Today many of the connections between neighbourhood and school have been stretched or sundered by social and demographic change, patterns of home-ownership, parental choice and the continuing presence of old-fashioned poverty and the social alienation which that so often engenders. For some this is simply part of the continuing process of individualisation of choice in a market society. Yet the government is also seeking to re-light the flame of citizenship in schools. Can one teach or understand citizenship without an understanding of the dynamics of \"community\", especially if home and school are in two different neighbourhoods or even different towns? This is as much an issue for housing policy as for education. As housing becomes one of the main engines of urban renewal, it is now quite scandalous that the big private housing developers and their social housing counterparts have given so little thought to education. Unless housing policy and education policy are quickly brought into some kind of cross-sectoral strategy, then the forces pulling homes, schools and communities apart are likely to gather strength. \u0095 Ken Worpole is director of a soon-to-be-published Comedia/Demos study on home and school Links DETR: Annual Report on Housing The Joseph Rowntree Foundation: Housing research European Network for Housing Research Shelter York University: Centre for Housing Policy The Home Repossession Page The Housing Corporation DETR: The government department with responsibility for housing Department of Education"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/1999/jun/08/artsfeatures3","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-08T01:20:06Z","webTitle":"Poet in a prize position","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/jun/08/artsfeatures3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/jun/08/artsfeatures3","fields":{"headline":"Poet in a prize position","bodyText":"Paul Muldoon has been having a good time of it lately. His two-week-old son, Asher, is thriving; he has been granted one of the highest honours in the English literary firmament; and no one has made him the target of a stream of invective. Not bad going for a poet. What's more, he didn't really need to make any great effort to secure the position of professor of poetry at Oxford. He wasn't even sure that he wanted the job. After all, Muldoon has it made already. The attraction of another academic title is limited when you are the Howard GB Clark professor in humanities at Ivy League Princeton university, New Jersey. He has been described as attracting more imitators than any poet since Auden and has won prizes and accolades in Ireland, the United Kingdom and America - as well as having written plays for the stage and television and edited and translated poetry collections In short, he has more honours than you could wave a bag of shite at. Ah, yes - while Andrew Motion was being abused in such terms for having the temerity to accept his appointment as poet laureate, the cultural agent provocateur Tom Paulin was making it his business to see to it that his friend Muldoon won the other big job, the finally uncontested Oxford seat. \"There are aspects of the Oxford thing that I'm not too keen on,\" says 47-year-old Muldoon, closing his eyes below a wild thatch that looks like it has not seen a brush since he was Seamus Heaney's student at Queen's University, Belfast. \"One was the very thing that was avoided - the 'Muldoon is a bag of shite' tendency. Historically there's been a bit of a slagging match that has nothing to do with the quality of the people involved. People like a bit of a dogfight - not that I'm above it. This time I guess no one else was up to the hassle, though that didn't stop people from running in the past.\" Perhaps it's partly because the glittering prizes have always sought him out that Muldoon is able to regard them with a healthy disinterest. \"Do you really believe that people care very much about who the poet laureate is? The answer is No.\" Actually, there is at least one person who cares about the job of poet laureate - Paul Muldoon. As president of the Poetry Society he cared enough to suggest that the title should be awarded for a limited period rather than for life. The idea was taken up and Andrew Motion is there for 10 years. The American laureate is in position for three years and Muldoon believes that a short stint helps to maintain energy and enthusiasm. \"Ted Hughes was a great poet laureate and and he was constantly derided for what he wrote. When Andrew got the job, somebody called me up and asked for a quote. I said 'He'll do a fine job' and the guy said, 'You're the first one to say so.' \"Actually, Andrew will be great. The people who say these things wouldn't even want the job, but if you're going to say them then it shouldn't be done anonymously. You've got to back it up.\" He does not buy the line that bickering over prizes stimulates interest in art. \"It would be nice to think that people would go out and read Andrew Motion now but I've serious doubts as to whether that will happen. Maybe a few will do it.\" I had the dubious pleasure once of marvelling at the poet Michael Horovitz, the late Allen Ginsberg at his side, discussing the intimacy of poetry and the relationship between the reader and the page. Then he had to blow it by suggesting that if only there were a weekly television programme called Pick Of The Poets, modelled on Top Of The Pops, poets would be every bit as popular as rock stars. Muldoon has a more fundamental approach to the poetry problem. \"Poetry is something that happened to you at school - when some jerk of a teacher said you had to learn a poem and kicked your head in if you didn't. They say: 'Eliot is a great poet but you wouldn't know that because you're just a moron. See this line? You might think you know what it means but you don't, you need me to show you.'\" But he is optimistic about the form and believes that poetry is healthy, diverse and less dominated than before by a narrow consensus about big names. Muldoon, a man who laughs easily and has an endless curiosity, must deliver 15 lectures a year at Oxford over the next five years in return for an annual fee of £4,695. Clearly, he is concerned that his lectures should be something special. \"Filling football stadiums is not the norm for poets. It's not the norm for football. It is the norm for the Rolling Stones. Young people want to be rock stars and, let's face it, who wouldn't want to be a rock star? I've got a guitar in my basement, I'd love to be a rock star. My wife thinks I'm crazy. \"Why do you and I know all about Keith Richards but almost nothing about Keith Douglas [a soldier-poet who died in the second world war]? The answer is that we've had such a great time listening to the Rolling Stones. The combination of words and music gets us. \"The grammar of a documentary movie [Muldoon is a former BBC Northern Ireland radio and TV producer] is very sophisticated. We know we are not seeing everything that was recorded and that it may not have been shot in that order. We understand the genre. When we look at Spinal Tap, the rock parody, we understand its allusiveness, what irony is. The thought of a poem having any impact is something we don't generally think very much about. Part of the problem is exposure, and sympathetic exposure.\" Muldoon could go on like this forever. Let's say instead that you might have just read a preview of his first lecture as professor of poetry."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/1999/jun/08/uk.politicalnews2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-08T01:25:26Z","webTitle":"61% of Britons oppose joining euro","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/08/uk.politicalnews2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jun/08/uk.politicalnews2","fields":{"headline":"61% of Britons oppose joining euro","bodyText":"Opposition to Britain joining the euro has surged to record heights on the eve of Thursday's elections to the European Parliament, according to the monthly Guardian/ICM opinion poll published today.

The poll prediction is based on those who said that on a scale of one to 10 of how certain they were to vote replied: \"10 out of 10\". The predicted share of the vote for Labour on 38% would be just above the 36% they secured in the local elections in England on May 6, while the Conservative figure of 31% compares with their earlier 33 %. The poll also shows that a 34% turnout would see a significant share of the vote - up to 17% - going to other parties such as the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), the Greens and even Socialist Labour. However, the fragmented nature of the fringe candidates means none of them - outside of the Scottish and Welsh nationalists - is likely to secure a large enough share of the vote in any one particular region to get an MEP elected.

They can be interesting, without being particularly important. The European election the day after tomorrow is a case in point. The outcome is unlikely to provoke much conversation down at the Dog and Duck. Nor will it vastly affect our lives. But it's packed with interest, all the same. There is the new voting system, for a start. For 'new', read clapped out and discredited, for the closed-list method is just another way that party leaderships have of manipulating democracy and holding on to centralised power. We are free to choose the party label of our choice, but we have no means of declaring our preference for individual candidates on that party list. The running order has already been decided by the apparatchiks. Still, it's a start on the way to truly fair voting. There is a fighting chance that the Liberal Democrats will at last achieve representation roughly in line with popular support - or, more correctly, the lack of it. There is even an intriguing possibility of some exotic political fauna emerging from the electoral undergrowth, such as a Green MEP or even a UKIP one. The United Kingdom Independence Party, indeed, is the most interesting runner of all. It wants Britain to leave the European Union. Judging by its election literature, its members yearn to go further and leave Europe itself. We could then be towed into mid-Atlantic, or perhaps some warmer ocean, where we could resurrect our greatness without having to share our tea with foreigners. It would be worth good money to hear a UKIP member of the European Parliament explaining this in Strasbourg. \"Nous ne sommes pas xenophobique, vous comprenez,\" he or she might say. \"Quelques de nos meilleurs amis sommes etrangers. Mais c'est un question de notre heritage. Dunkirk et tout ca.\" A poll in this morning's Guardian suggests that the UKIP might get 4% of the vote, which hardly suggest a raging tide of anti-Europeanism. Mind you, it also predicts Conservative support at 31%, which whiffs of a certain iffyness in Middle England. Moreover, support for Britain joining the euro-zone has also slipped almost as badly as the ailing new currency. Those who would vote against immediate entry now number 61%, which is rather sensible in view of the euro's alarming slide towards parity with the dollar. The only really alarming finding in the recent crop of polls is that the great British electorate is thoroughly bored with the Euro-elections. There are dire predictions that the turnout will be less than one-third. Voters, it seems, have very correctly divined that the parliament has only a marginal impact on their lives. This is a chicken-and-egg situation. The parliament needs public support to challenge the near-monopoly of Euro-power held by the sovereign member-states. The sordid intrigues and squabbles in the Council of Ministers cannot give way to a coherent European identity without accountable European structures. The European Commission cannot fill that role, because it too is utterly in the pocket of the member-states. Only the parliament can give us all a distinctive European voice. That idea of Europeanness is of course shocking to those on the right who have the audacity to pose as patriots. They talk of saving the pound and preserving Our Way of Life. In reality, their way would banish Britain to the ignominious margins of Europe, forever whining and snivelling on the sidelines about the unfairness of it all.

But how does he get back to where they started? \"Stick to the left-hand wall and keep coming.\" Raphael is back in the November of five years ago at the home 20 miles north of London where the film director Stanley Kubrick lives. So little is known of the director that no detail, it seems, is so small that it should not be recorded with the apparent pretext of illuminating his work. Take lunchtime, for instance. Of course there is a spread of soup, cold chicken breast, salad, Gruyere cheese, lettuce and watercress with raspberry vinaigrette. But it's the New Zealand wine that really matters. \"Two twenty-five a bottle,\" says Kubrick. \"What do you think?\" Raphael sniffs and sips and says: \"I think it tastes like two seventy-five.\" Boom-boom. It turns out later that Kubrick can do without the laughs. Later, that is, in a piece by Raphael in the current edition of the New Yorker magazine on the push and shove of the two men's collaboration on Kubrick's last movie, Eyes Wide Shut. The film, released next month in the United States and at the end of August in the United Kingdom, is the most keenly-anticipated picture, as opposed to movie event (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace), of the year. Anyone who cannot wait that long might call up the trailer on the internet and observe wobbly footage of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman kissing and cuddling and people in dark clothes walking down the street. The fascination with Kubrick persists because he is brilliant, odd, and, as of March, dead. Raphael says in his article that he had underestimated the extent of the curiosity about the Brooklyn-born director of Paths Of Glory, Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining and Barry Lyndon. If so, the writer of the screenplay for Far From The Madding Crowd certainly acknowledges the longing for information now. Raphael tells us that initially Kubrick sent him a photocopy of a novella with the title and author's name removed. The writer guesses that it is the work of Arthur Schnitzler or Stefan Zweig (it's Schnitzler). Raphael visits the big house in the country and, observing that the director was once a ranked chess player, embarks on a minute examination of the intellectual sparring in their creative partnership. Kubrick opens the door. \"He was wearing blue overalls with black buttons...his hands were curiously delicate and white.\" The scene set, they get down to discussing the project. Kubrick is annoyed with himself for letting slip the identity of the novella's author. Raphael makes a mistake and says the Frick collection is on Central Park East in Manhattan: \"Kubrick grinned and said 'Central Park East is Fifth Avenue.' He collected my pawn with relish.\" Kubrick is elusive about where they should take the plot but knows how he wants to work. Would it be possible for Raphael to get down to work at once, trust him that there will be no problem with the contract, and let him see the first 30 or 40 pages once he's finished them? \"You're the only director in the world I'd say yes to on that.\" They talk later on the phone and Raphael says the book is infused with Jewishness. \"When I suggested that transferring the story to New York offered an amusing opportunity for retaining - although modernising - the Jewishness of the story, Kubrick was firmly opposed - and he forbade any reference to Jews - his main motive was, I am pretty sure, the wish not to alienate his audience.\" In four weeks, the writer has produced the first 42 pages and the director is \"absolutely thrilled,\" though subsequently he will trash the words. Kubrick seems surprised that Raphael is stopping work for Christmas but by the New Year asks if the writer has seen Woody Allen's Husbands And Wives. Kubrick's verdict: it's pretty good but the character of the book editor has an apartment that's too large. Later, they talk about a scene with a prostitute in their work in progress. Kubrick says: \"I don't like the scene with the hooker. I mean, she sounds like Barbra Streisand, know what I mean? The dialogue kinda goes boom-boom, which I don't...I don't want.\" An examination of what two people in the film might be saying to each other leads from the Holocaust to Schindler's List. Kubrick says: \"That was about success wasn't it? The Holocaust is about six million people who get killed. Schindler's List was about six hundred people who didn't.\" Raphael concludes that while Kubrick might admire his work, that's about as far as it goes. \"I was there to prepare the way for him to do his stuff. Anything that was markedly mine was never the stuff he was going to do.\" The roadmap of their progress is marked by whether Kubrick's faxes and letters are signed \"best regards\" or merely \"regards\". They flirt with a falling out after Raphael commits a transgression by sending a copy of his first draft to his agent, compromising \"his deal-making and casting efforts on the film\". The writer says his agent has never let him down, unlike many producers, executives and directors. On their final meeting, Kubrick puts an arm on Raphael's shoulder. \"It was the first time he had done more than shake hands hurriedly. There was a wary warmth in his embrace which made it more unguarded - and more flattering - than anything he ever said to me.\" And Raphael's name survives on the final writing credits, along with those of Arthur Schnitzler and Stanley Kubrick."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/1999/jun/09/electionspast.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-09T00:43:45Z","webTitle":"Danger - keep out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/09/electionspast.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jun/09/electionspast.uk","fields":{"headline":"Danger - keep out","bodyText":"For the chronic and irreconcilable Eurosceptics - and there are a lot more of them around than there used to be - voting in tomorrow's European parliament elections presents some real problems. The European parliament is basically a powerless nonsense because the real powers in the EU are concentrated in the councils of ministers, the commission and the European court. So why should we bother to vote at all? There is, of course, an argument for voting if we wish to treat the elections as an opinion poll. Because as experience has shown, governments do pay a great deal of attention to such indications of popular feeling. And for the Eurosceptics there are two parties - the United Kingdom Independence party (UKIP) and the Democratic party, which reflect the views of those who would wish to sever our European Union connections. UKIP is quite specific in stating that it would wish to withdraw completely, and the Democratic party, which stems from Jimmy Goldsmith's Referendum party, would wish a fundamental change in our relationship and in the structure of the EU. Of course neither party could make any progress in its endeavours within the European parliament, but if the vote is designed simply to express an opinion, is this not a cause worth supporting? I've had many phone calls and letters from firm Eurosceptics seeking opinions on this issue. However, the basic problem for them as for me is that no matter how much we might wish to call for the restoration of our national freedom and independence, we have to face up to the basic issue that our UK parliament and the other democracies in the EU simply do not have the power to disengage. I am sure that there will be many Eurosceptics who, having read this article thus far, will proclaim that such arguments are utter nonsense, that no British parliament can bind its successors, and that a decision to repeal the treaties would have a binding effect. Having spent my political life arguing against and voting against the Euro treaties, I wish that they were right and I was wrong. However, sadly, the right to repeal is simply not there. But what about Greenland? Was it not once a member of the European Union when joined with Denmark, and did this enormous nation not succeed in disengaging after they had a referendum some years ago? In fact it was not the parliament or the people of Greenland who made the decision. Their escape was only secured when every other member state including the United Kingdom passed a law to allow amendments to the treaties to permit Greenland to leave. Our debate in the House of Commons took place on October 31 1984. But could not Britain seek to secure the Greenland answer using the same procedure? Sadly we can't, because while the treaty base for Greenland's secession was article 236 (now article N) which provides for treaty amendments subject to the approval of all member states, Britain's appropriate article is 240, which provides for membership for an unlimited period and there is no provision for withdrawal. We also have the basic problem that under the treaty of Rome, EU law has direct and superior application in the UK. Having resigned from Ted Heath's government over the decision to join the EU, and having voted against the third reading of the treaty of Rome and the second and third readings of all subsequent treaties, it gives me no pleasure to put these arguments, but I genuinely feel that the large and growing army of Eurosceptics should be aware of the seriousness of the constitutional situation we face. To take any other attitude is simply political day dreaming. The vital thing now is to do all in our power to prevent the final surrender of our sovereignty, and this means uniting to oppose it. We must warn the people not only that the euro means a massive surrender of sovereignty but also participation in an exercise that seems doomed. All previous endeavours to establish single currencies (and there have been two already in Europe) ended up in economic distress and massive unemployment. A single currency can only work, as in the US, if you have one government, one treasury and, most important, a feeling of national identity. Of course UKIP is opposed to a single currency, as I am, but as we face the time of decision, the best vehicle by far is one of the major parties. The Conservative party under William Hague's leadership has happily abandoned the previous \"wait and see\" policy and has committed itself to opposing the single currency in the referendum after the next election. Hague's decision was a very major step and he has received little enough credit for the step he has taken. I therefore believe that if we really care about our nation's future and our right to manage economic policy and job creation, the right answer on Thursday is to vote, and to vote for the Conservative party. A solid and massive vote for the Conservatives will not, sadly, alter the structure of the EU, but it would give the right message at the right time to our political leaders.

England provides few of the new \"high profile\" words in the edition for the first time, such as \"tanked-up\" for drinking heavily and \"tiggy oggy\" for a Cornish pasty. In the last edition of the Concise, a sixth of words came from outside Britain. One of the book's main editors, Catherine Soanes, said, \"What is fascinating is how, partly because of the media and the internet, world English is increasingly reaching back to influence the vocabulary used in Britain itself. These figures are all the more remarkable when considering that space in the Concise Oxford is strictly limited.\" The main Oxford English Dictionary's deputy editor, Penny Silva, said: \"Some English speakers might feel that English was being swamped by foreign languages.

As Brock explains how the history of ordinary, decent, though mostly rather unhappy people mangled by ambition and failure turned into Indiana Gothic, his 18-month-old twins Hannah and Molly are tumbling around in copies of the New Yorker and Luther the dog is panting in the heat of a room lined with family photographs. Next to CDs of Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Count Basie are his wife Susan's three Emmy awards for her work as an NBC news producer. The couple moved here to Chappequa, one stop down the line beyond Pleasantville, from Manhattan just after the twins arrived. It is a prosperous town, the land of BMW and Lexus, the perfect lawns and flowerbeds of its public spaces replete with peace, contentment and civic pride. Brock is convinced that his family scandal was concealed rather than allowed to slip away over the decades and that even those who knew nothing of it were shaped to some extent by the implications. \"It explains to some degree the rigidity of my grandfather who had a tremendously fierce idea of what's right and what's wrong. The range was very narrow and that was transmitted down to my mother. \"Everybody had to be very, very good. Of course, at the time I just thought I had a particularly bad case of the 1950s. Family secrets were kept routinely and people were not in the habit of talking about things. \"I began to think more of the impact down the line and I thought it was time to blow the lid off this baby.\" Not everyone in the family was as enthusiastic about disinterring the corpse of their tainted heritage but came round to the idea and started digging around in their attics to help with the research. At 49, Brock has left it late for a first book, but, apart from anything else, he wanted to take control after working as an actor and then as a magazine journalist. It was those other strings to his bow that helped him to shoot for the characters in Indiana Gothic. \"It was the first time acting and journalism had come together for me.\" Anyone who visits bookstores might be inclined to the view that the last thing the world needs is another volume, particularly by a journalist, a class of person who seems to believe that his or her craft as a wordsmith is invalid until it has appeared between hard covers. And then it is only to be expected that \"real\" writers will carp, as they did when Tom Wolfe's A Man In Full was published, that this sort of stuff is all very well, but it's not literature. \"I wanted to test myself. There's a denial of reality when you get into writing a book. But you either capitulate or test yourself against the mountain. That's one reason why it was a kick to do it. You get to do all the stuff a journalist does and then you start to climb the stairs into the next level. \"Starting in journalism I was inspired by Tom Wolfe, Hunter S Thompson, Gay Talese. Wolfe had preached that fiction is dead so I felt a little betrayed when The Bonfire of the Vanities came out. I think Wolfe's genius is for journalism not fiction. I don't think he's as good at getting into the heart and soul of characters.\" Brock is pretty harsh on his own work too. \"When I felt it was getting a little too fancy I went back and took it out.\" This is something of which the more introspective and undemonstrative people in his book would have approved. \"William Faulkner said you have to kill your darlings. Any good writer will do that to a point, but there's still some darlings in there.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/1999/jun/10/evolution","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-10T00:06:15Z","webTitle":"A womb with a new view","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/jun/10/evolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/1999/jun/10/evolution","fields":{"headline":"A womb with a new view","bodyText":"There are two great puzzles in biology, and both concern the origins of life. On the one hand, people are fascinated by the idea that we are descended from primitive ancestors who roamed the earth millions of years ago. This is the puzzle of evolution. On the other hand, we want to understand how we grew from a tiny embryo inside the womb, and this is the puzzle of development. Many biologists will tell you that they study development because they find embryos mysterious - even beautiful. The sloth embryo shown here looks like some kind of alien creature, floating in space and frozen in time. One can't help but wonder what secrets it holds to the evolution of life. To find out, we need to look for some kind of link between evolution and development. Finding this link has been a Holy Grail of biology for more than a century, and many scientific reputations have been made - and ruined - in its pursuit. But scientists are getting close to completing the puzzle, and in the process creating a new field of biology: \"evo-devo\". This promises to be one of the most exciting areas of scientific research in the next decade. Last month, the press reported that scientists have uncovered fresh evidence about the evolution of elephants. It turns out their ancestors may have been been water-dwellers, who used their trunks as snorkels. This is interesting - but not obviously a big news story. In fact, what really captured people's imagination was that the research was based on the study of embryos, taken from the wombs of pregnant elephants. This research was surprising because of its methods, not just its conclusions. Most evidence about ancestors comes from palaeontologists who study the fossilised remains of extinct creatures. So how can scientists possibly study evolution by looking at embryos? The answer, is simple: embryos evolve. These two small words represent a big change in the way we think about evolution, not least because Darwin and his followers had very different ideas. Darwin recognised that some parts of the body do not change down the generations, and thereby reveal the common descent, or ancestry, of all animals. But other parts do change, or evolve, and this is what makes adult animals look different. Darwin's agency of change was natural selection, which passes favourable variations on to the offspring. So far so good; but where do embryos fit into the scheme of natural selection? Not at all, was Darwin's answer. He believed that natural selection acts mainly on late stages of development, around the time we are born. In his opinion, the embryo itself is left almost unaltered down the centuries. In short, his message was: embryos do not evolve. This, of course, was a non-starter for evo-devo, because it implied embryos are not part of the evolutionary process (although Darwin did realise that embryos can evolve temporary structures, such as the placenta). Darwin's evidence included the similar appearance of embryos in different creatures. He knew that the embryo of a human looks remarkably like the embryo of a dog, cat, or monkey. Indeed, every Guardian reader, developing as an embryo in the womb, had grooves in the side of the neck which bear a passing resemblance to the gill slits of a fish. This suggests that embryos stubbornly hang on to ancestral features, rather than yielding them to evolutionary change as adults do. Any textbook will show that many biologists agree with Darwin, and assume embryos are an evolutionary bottleneck. This view has been strengthened by research highlighting the genetic similarities among animal embryos; thus the same types of genes control development in humans, fish and most other creatures. British researchers, including groups in London, Reading, and Cambridge, have played a leading role in making these discoveries. This all seems straightforward: embryos of different creatures look similar and share similar genes. But does this really mean that evolution has passed them by, as Darwin believed? Since I have devoted several paragraphs to Darwin's view, the reader has probably guessed that I am now going to knock it down. Here goes. My reading of the evidence is that, contrary to Darwin, embryos do evolve. One line of evidence comes from researchers in Wales, who used radioactive isotopes to detect tiny differences in the skeletons of animal embryos. They found that differences between species are mapped out invisibly inside the embryo before they can be seen from the outside. It looks like there may be subtle, even cryptic, differences among embryos which foreshadow the differences we see later in the grown-up animals. The same story emerges if we take a closer look at genetic experiments. Embryonic genes are indeed similar across the animal kingdom; but not identical - and this indicates the genes have been changed by natural selection. For instance, scientists at Harvard looked at why geese have long necks, but frogs do not. They found this anatomical difference could be traced back to subtle differences in the time and place that genes work in the embryo. A startling discovery was reported last week in the journal Nature. Martin Cohn and Cheryll Tickle wanted to understand why snakes do not have legs. On one level, the answer is obvious: snakes crawl, so they don't need legs. But they wanted to know whether the snake embryo develops differently from embryos of four-legged animals. Sure enough, they found that the genes which control leg development do not work properly in snake embryos, so they end up legless. This type of evidence suggests that evolution works by making small changes to embryos. These changes nudge embryos down new paths of development, so they grow into different-looking adults. Many of the differences between, say, a snake and an elephant, may be mapped out in the embryo. If future research supports this view, it will mean that embryos, far from being trapped in an evolutionary time-warp, may actually be the key targets for natural selection. This could be the vital link between evolution and development that we have been looking for. Scientists are cautious, and we need more evidence about evo-devo. First, we have to avoid Darwin's mistake. He was misled because he relied on scientists who looked at embryos of different animals under the microscope, and decided that they looked similar. Judging embryos by eye in this way is a bit like trying to work out people's family history by comparing their portraits. \"Portrait gallery science\", as it is sometimes called, can give us important clues about evolution, but it does not provide a secure foundation for evolutionary theories. A better approach is to subject embryos to a more intense kind of scrutiny. We can do this by taking a leaf out of the book of palaeontologists. Palaeontologists study fossils, and while fossils cannot tell us directly about development (most embryos are too delicate to be preserved in rock), they can tell us about the lost diversity of extinct adults. Michael Coates, at University College London, is a leading figure in evo-devo. He has shown that studies of fossils and embryos are complementary, and can be dovetailed together to provide new insights into evolution. Since the mid 1980s, palaeontologists like Michael have been using sophisticated computer programmes to sort fossils into ancestral family trees. In the same way, molecular biologists put DNA sequences through computers to look for evolutionary relationships). Michael and I have now joined palaeontologist Jonathan Jeffery to make a computer analysis of embryonic development in different creatures. With funding from the Leverhulme Trust, we are finding that embryos may carry an evolutionary \"fingerprint\" - a revealing record of the effects of natural selection. When we run the vital statistics of embryos through the computer, we do not find the lack of evolutionary change that Darwin predicted. On the contrary: the computer tells us that while a human embryo develops much like its fellow mammal the pig, it develops rather differently from a fish or frog (the differences are mainly in the time at which different organs develop). So much for the human embryo clinging to its ancestral past. Darwin missed the point about embryos. This was not his fault; it was more a reflection of the primitive state of embryology in his time. We now think that embryos do evolve, but you have to look closely to see it. And as we look ever closer, using a mixture of genetics, computers - and even good old-fashioned portrait gallery science - we will get closer to finding that Holy Grail, the link between evolution and development.

Marvellous! The lads were raring to go. Ah, but the bad news is that you're the Serbs. Oh. And who's playing the Allies? Er, the Paras. ¥ On a similar subject, the chaps in the red berets are under scrutiny for their role in the events of February 1972. Top judge Lord Saville is heading the Bloody Sunday inquiry, and finds himself surrounded by former Serious Fraud Office bigwigs. Former assistant director John Tate is his lordship's top helper, and Mr Tate is himself helped by former SFO assistant director Gordon Dickinson. But it could have been worse (or better, depending on your feelings for the Elm Street heavy mob) - the SFO's policy supremo, Robert Wardle, was the name in the frame for the helper-in-chief position, but preferred to stay in Elm Street, threatening suspects (sorry, \"helping to combat the very real problem of serious fraud\"). ¥ Not that over-vigorous interrogation seems to be a feature of the fashion business. Luxury goods group LVMH, of Krug fame, has been beaten back in its assault on Gucci, best known for supplying shoes to those who have never mastered tying their own laces. Instead, Gucci has hurled itself into the arms of France's richest businessman, Francois Pinault. Vanity Fair can hardly contain its excitement, with a special look behind the scenes at \"the battle over Gucci\". How did Gucci's creative wizard, Tom Ford, react to Mr Pinault? \"Ford says he liked him upon meeting him. 'What I liked about him was his eyes. There was an instant rapport ... I always go with my gut instinct. What can I say? I'm a Virgo.' \" Just the sort of thing Lord Hanson used to say in the old days. ¥ More than gut instinct, we feel, will be needed to crack the fiendish code being used internally by One2One to inform its staff on the five-way auction for the mobile-telephone group. One's workers are not being entrusted with the actual names (for those they would need to have read the Guardian a fortnight back), but instead are being given the following ciphers: Victor (alias Vivendi), Tom (alias Telecom Italia Mobile), Dan (alias Deutsche Telekom), Fred (alias France Telecom) and Mike (alias Mannesmann). Any chance of a One2One with Alan Turing? ¥ Meanwhile, ta-ra to to the Tar Tsar, that hard-hitting Eliot Ness character unveiled by Gordon Brown at the time of the Budget as the answer to the roaring cross-Channel ciggie racket. More effective even than assorted Treasury roundheads insisting that a little of what you fancy does you no good, the tsar would crack open car boots and axe his way into white vans, bringing to justice the bearers of ultra-cheap non-ultra-light Euro-baccy. Nearly four months on and the tsar has yet to be crowned. Worse, he is a tsar no more, but an \"evaluator\" (exciting, eh?), a glorified management consultant who will write a report on the efficacy of Customs' anti-ash measures (that shouldn't take too long). Interviewing continues, we hear. ¥ Another priority Gordon project is cracking the great British high street rip-off and bringing our own allegedly astronomical prices to within hailing distance of those prevailing in, for example, the US, home of the square deal. An Underside agent has cast an eye over these slender American mark-ups coast-to-coast during the past week. He reports: car parking (in your own hotel), £7 a day in Los Angeles; call from Detroit hotel to UK, £10 minimum; pint of beer in New York, £2.50.

This is a pity - Mikki's photographs of Moscow, with their slanted camera angles, their skewed sense of composition, their severe cropping and eye for the disregarded detail, are the talk of this otherwise lacklustre Biennale. And it is always good to discover a new artist. Rather than causing an international incident, or dark mutterings about a return to the Soviet days of artistic censorship, Mikki's problems are different. Mikki is a seven-year-old chimpanzee. The painter in the pavilion couldn't make it either - no hotel in Venice would provide accommodation for an elephant. Mikki's snaps and the elephant's paintings are part of a number of \"ecollaborations\" between members of the animal kingdom and Russian artists Komar and Melamid, whose witty, rumbustuous art has been known in the west since their self-exile in New York began in the 80s. But can elephants paint? A film shows them at work, brush held delicately in trunk, Rembrandtian eye focused on the canvas. Elephants, it seems, only do Abstract Expressionism; it's part of their culture. The elephant paintings are part of the Asian Art and Conservation project, set up by Komar and Melamid, who have instituted two elephant art academies in Thailand as a way of raising money for superannuated elephants and their keepers. Without Russian aid, the elephants would starve. Komar and Melamid's project does have its serious side, and it is presented with impeccable Biennale decorum. Mikki's hamfisted photos remind the artists of their childhoods, and their own first fumbling attempts to photograph the architectural highlights of Moscow. The elephant paintings have a sincerity so often lacking in contemporary art. The artists plan to make further collaborations with nature - architectural projects with beavers and termites are next on the itinerary. There isn't, on the face of it, much difference between animals' art and the human variety, except the humans worry about their careers a lot and how to get tickets for the Pulp gig at the British Pavilion party for painter Gary Hume. Hume could be in line for the most prestigious prize of the Biennale, the Golden Lion.

Of course, and rightly so, the Kosovan conflagration has overshadowed everything else. But this should not be allowed to disguise or deflect from the fact that we have just gone through a decisive phase in our political history, one which has fundamentally recast the structure and style of UK politics as a whole. The foundation stones for a truly twenty-first century constitution and political system have now been put in place. This is all an achievement for both the Liberal Democrats - who have campaigned for these changes - and for a Labour government which has quickly and effectively carried these reforms through parliament. It was also an achievement for progressive cross-party cooperation. And yet, turnout for the European elections was distressing at under 25 per cent (despite the previous 70 days being saturated with coverage of military conflict on the continent). While it is true that the closed-list election system was less than helpful in seeking to enthuse people, this is far from the entire story. In local government, voter participation is just as discouraging. Look also at that Leeds Central by-election. I do not always instinctively endorse a Benn analysis but on this occasion Benn Junior was correct to contrast his experience with the images from South Africa last week. The technologies and smart communications of the age have not helped to engage more people in the political process itself. Two years ago, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds achieved its one millionth member. That is more than the entire membership of every political party in Britain. Party politics needs to start reconnecting. The Liberal Democrats must be - and be seen to be - central to that task. This decisive new phase in the UK's political evolution may be something of a participative last-chance saloon. Politics in Britain is now multi-layered and multi-dimensional. Politics is no longer just about what happens, too often on discredited lobby terms amid excessive secrecy, in Westminster and Whitehall. It is a more complicated kind of politics - but also, potentially, more refreshing and relevant to the world in which we live. The challenge now is to harness this opportunity and reinvigorate party politics as a whole. We are all on a learning curve, Liberal Democrats included. For example, what is a very powerful coalition agreement in Scotland received a far less favourable initial response than could and should have been the case. With Liberal Democrat government ministers in Edinburgh, Assembly influence in Cardiff and a significant increase in our rally of MEPs in Brussels, we must review our entire communications strategy, both internal and external. Useful lessons can be learned from our more successful local authorities - as you move into Government it is even more imperative to communicate speedily and persuasively with your members and your voters. Equally, while you administer you have to keep on campaigning. Political communication has been central to my own parliamentary career over the past decade and a half. The coming leadership election within the party is a timely and excellent opportunity to communicate among ourselves and connect more with the wider electorate. The initial interest may focus on who should be leader. More telling surely is to agree upon just what we want the next leader to do with the party: what strategy and what direction? We will both make a mistake and miss a chance if we allow our leadership dialogue to become nothing more than a referendum on relations with the Labour government - who wants to get closer, who wants to get further away? It is a vital question but it is not the only question. There is that issue of wider voter malaise that needs to be addressed and this event is also one which should see the party place the entire social justice agenda back where it belongs - centre stage in British politics. Environmental politics needs to be given a much sharper focus as well; we must not cede ground to the Greens by default. And, largely due to our ongoing constitutional excursions, the entire notion of Britishness is legitimately up for discussion and debate. I happen to consider myself a Highlander even before a Scot; I am proud to be British yet feel comfortable as a European citizen. These conundrums call for exploration - and a federally orientated party has to be the best context in which to think aloud and to think afresh. All parts of the United Kingdom must continue to contribute to Westminster politics at all levels; the only logical alternative is tantamount to surrendering to nationalism. I did not come into politics to help sell that. In due course, in our very British way, we will complete our constitutional journey of discovery. There is much that remains to be done - from fair voting in English and Welsh local elections through meaningful freedom of information to democratic reform of the House of Lords - and so much to engage Liberal Democrats and the Government in dialogue and co-operation. Well and good, but our enhanced credibility at every representative level must enable us to campaign distinctively towards the next Westminster as a properly perceived, independent political party. Which is why the wider dialogue with all those voters, not yet sufficiently engaged in the political process, remains a central concern. Inclusive politics is not just about sensible cross-party interchange, it must be about bringing in many more who are today not even contemplating joining the table. It was Roy Jenkins's compelling Dimbleby Lecture that originally made me cross a personal Rubicon; we need to engender a new sense of energy and excitement. The Liberal Democrat leadership election can be an important straw in that particular wind. \u0095 Charles Kennedy is MP for Ross, Skye and Inverness W."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jun/13/millennium.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-13T00:38:35Z","webTitle":"Romancing the dome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/13/millennium.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jun/13/millennium.uk","fields":{"headline":"Romancing the dome","bodyText":"The Dome is, of course, preposterous: a £758-million behemoth set in a hard-to-reach industrial wasteland, with scarcely a car-park in prospect; a bizarre monument to extravagance and hubris tricked out with weird yellow spikes like some kind of intergalactic mine; a deranged New Labour white elephant whose raison d'être is a few transitional seconds of lost time at the end of the year. That, roughly, was my opinion. Until the end of 1998. Then, early one December morning, the phone rang and a familiar voice said: 'Have you a couple of minutes to discuss something important?' It was Simon Jenkins, the Times columnist and Establishment gadfly. We had worked together in the early Eighties on a television series about the English language, and although we had rarely spoken since, we'd kept in touch. Before I had time to answer, Simon, typically, cut to the chase. 'What,' he asked, 'do you think of the dome?' 'Er... ' The truth is that, like a lot of people, my attitude to the Millennium Dome was a cocktail of ignorance and prejudice, with a twist of indifference. It was a frightful waste of public money, obviously; absurd-looking in photographs and a boon to the cartoonists. When I was conscious of the dome at all, it was as part of the electrical media storm that seemed to surround the always-colourful Peter Mandelson. An hour later, I was sitting in Jenkins's cosy north London study listening to an impassioned account of the tangled genesis of the project from its chief begetter and visionary cheerleader, the millennial commissar. Facts, figures, jargon and the names of virtually everyone associated with the London literary and media scene swirled around: 'Litmus group... Richard Rogers... glue group... Michael Grade... Millbank... DCMS... Stephen Bayley... ' Stephen Bayley! Land ho! Now we were on terra firma. Didn't I dimly remember a certain - ah - disaffection with the dome from the legendary design guru who'd resigned from the project in a notorious hissy-fit, citing the intolerable interventions of the Prince of Darkness? Simon swatted Bayley aside with a dismissive gesture and launched into a persuasive dome spiel. The dome was not costing the taxpayer a single penny; it would be paid for by a mixture of lottery money (£399m), sponsorship (£150m) and revenue (£194m); and, finally, it would confound all the nay-sayers. Look at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Look at the 1951 Festival of Britain. Major national and critical hat-eating events, both of them. Derided up and down, but proved all right on the night. The dome, said Simon, would be the equal of both: plus it was on time and on budget. Jenkins concluded this effective sales pitch with the words: 'There's a very important job to be done and, like everything connected with the dome, it needs to be done yesterday.' The job in question was beguilingly simple: what to call each of the 14 state-of-the-art zones that make up the dome's Millennium Experience. By now, I was wavering, and when Simon let slip that Laurie Lee had played the same role on the South Bank in the Festival of Britain, I was hooked. Jenkins's subtle rendering of Your Country Needs You had played to my curiosity and - I confess it - my vanity. At the very least, I thought, I'd get the chance to go somewhere interesting on millennium Eve. In no time at all, I was in a dandelion-yellow hard hat and Wellington boots trudging round the dome site. A little voice piped inside my head: 'Preposterous, eh?' No question, the first word out of the lexicon had to be 'Stupendous'. There is no fancy way to say this. The Millennium Dome is a simply awesome contemporary structure, rising from the derelict riverside at Greenwich like the bizarre mother ship from some yet-unfathomed part of outer space. It has been compared to Xanadu, to a spiky crown, to a big tent, to a Teflon-coated Ayers Rock, to a massive contraceptive device, but these tortured metaphors overlook the obvious point: it is colossal. Vast, massive, titanic. Twice the size of Wembley Stadium. The height of Nelson's Column, and then some. As wide as the Eiffel Tower is tall. Dominating, with its glorious cream canopy, an area the size of Mayfair. And would I care to be involved in naming the parts of this fabulous construction? Well, yes, I think I would. I soon found that the site of the Millennium Dome was thrilling in another, more human way, too; it was buzzing with activity. Cranes, diggers, trucks, miles of cable. And mud, wherever you looked, a sea of mud. And, in the middle of all this, the mudlarks: a youthful community of domeites, operating out of a hideous jumble of Portakabins, with the barely suppressed panic of a newsroom on deadline. And, as in a newspaper office, everyone was under 30, or so it seemed. If the dome turns out to be successful, it will be because it has been infectiously youthful. It is sited on that meanest of mean lines, the Greenwich Meridian. Park your car at the site office of the New Millennium Experience Company (the quasi-governmental organisation that's managing the project) and you can step from east to west in a heartbeat, or bestride the very meridian line itself like Puck or Ariel. A project blessed, but not initiated, by New Labour has become a showcase for the New Labour vision of Britain. It has brought together a ministry of all the talents from the worlds of media, culture, rock'n'roll, entertainment and design. The linguistic antennae of this new establishment are exceedingly sensitive. The upshot is that the experience the public will have in the Millennial Dome will truly reflect some of the important concerns of the twenty-first century: globalisation, genetics, cyberspace and the environment. One of the most impressive aspects of the dome is the remarkable range of public consultation that's taken place. Every town in the British Isles has been invited to present its 'story' in the Our Town Theatre. The public has been polled to provide a tapestry of impressions of British life, and its nominations include fish and chips, the smell of freshly cut grass, a bulldog, sweet peas and Mo Mowlam. It's probably this populist side of the dome that the domeites have found hardest to accommodate, but the awkward fact is that the dome has to belong to everyone if it's to justify the expenditure of money and effort. So, after six months of working at the dome, I now believe that an extraordinary moment in the international calendar should be celebrated by a extraordinary monument. Over the top and larger than life? Of course. Tony Blair's instinct was right - if we're going to do this, we should do it on a scale commensurate with the event. As the countdown to Y2K continues, (201 days from today) the domeites are cramming more and more hours into each day, working sleeplessly to realise this extraordinary dream. Contractors have been summoned from all four corners of the kingdom: steel cables from Doncaster, reinforced glass fibre from the Isle of Wight, masts from Bolton, the cardboard for the Living Island zone from a papermill in Halifax. Presiding over this hive is the Queen Bee, NMEC's chief executive, Jennie Page, without whom, I guess, the dome would still be a couple of skips and a hole in the ground, and who, as 1999 began, became my unofficial boss, when I set about helping to devise names for the dome's 14 zones, and for many of the landscape features at the dome site. As I pottered about in my wellies, I found myself bumping into Peter's ghost. He was no longer involved, but everyone had his or her Mandy tale about being lectured by the Prince of Darkness. Looking back, it's clear that Mandy's resignation was probably the best thing that happened to the dome. Under the benevolent guidance of Lord Falconer, the dome ceased to be a screaming headline and enjoyed a bit of anonymity in which to get on with meeting its rendezvous with the calendar. In hindsight, I'm glad that I learned to love the dome. It has, by no means, been plain sailing. Even the most trifling naming decision has been approved by what has sometimes seemed like hundreds of separate, competing sub-committees. Corporate sponsors such as Ford and Sky have wanted to see a return on their £12m investment and care desperately what their particular bits are called. A project of this kind accumulates vested interests as a ship gathers barnacles. Besides, when it comes to language everyone fancies himself to be an expert. There's not much, you may say, to coming up with simple words to describe simple things, but don't you believe it. There have been battles over words such as 'Learning' and 'Rest'. Many of my early attempts at naming the zones were comically misconceived. Finally, we have established a no-nonsense style of nomenclature, inspired by my two literary heroes, Samuel Johnson and George Orwell, in which we label things, from the 14 zones to the Thamesside pier at which the waterborne public will disembark, by appropriate nouns, using everyday English words that will be familiar from China to Peru. Amid the morass of post-modern theorising and speculation that will, inevitably, accompany a building that commemorates a new millennium, we have established some clarity and simplicity. The ambiguous 'Spirit', zone, celebrating the world's major religions has become 'Faith', the unlovely 'Transaction' has become the more direct 'Money'. In the process, I have made some good friends and worked in a stimulating can-do environment, part-improvisation, part-visionary invention. There's no escaping that the Millennium Dome is a remarkably apt advertisement for contemporary Britain. It is already spoken of with envy by many Europeans, notably the Germans and the French. No wonder New Labour is so keen to claim it as its own.

Bunting would be displayed, editorials cleared, while we would all note that, of course, we've always had the finest actors... That film, by necessity, would be seen as the ïdominant British style'. In a kingdom of one, as the film critics used to have it, there could only be one king. And for years, the king was Four Weddings and a Funeral. Each subsequent Britfilm would endeavour to feed off its heat, seeking to sell itself as the 'next Four Weddings'. You could amuse yourself ticking off the ways\u0083 the recognisable architecture, the bumbling hero, the posh-but-terribly-nice cast. Last year's Four Weddings was Sliding Doors, which was a sort of London travelogue with Gwyneth Paltrow occasionally getting in the way of our views of the Thames, nice red phone boxes, ye typical pub, etc. Now, things have become confused. We have two successful films, and two stark contrasts in style. Do you want Notting Hill - which truly can claim to be the next Four Weddings, since the films share a writer and producer - or Human Traffic, debutant Justin Kerrigan's Cardiff-based vibrant novelty? (Or is it just the new Trainspotting? Oh, well\u0083) Naturally, we should be proud, judge it as a sign of maturity that British films can be whatever we want them to be. But what are those aspirant movie-makers to do? Those who for years have been working on getting their heritage films just right? Should we now expect a rush for the clubs, as directors attempt to emulate Human Traffic and give the real lowdown on youth culture? Word from the native industry is that producers have been genuinely surprised that Human Traffic has done such good business (at least domestically), so don't be surprised by a series of Down With The Kidz movies in the next few years. Though since selling to America is often in financiers minds, the old school will probably continue to hold sway.

Top dog is Tom Hanks, the James Stewart of his age, star of Saving Private Ryan and You've Got Mail. He displaces Tom Cruise in a poll that asked studio executives to name actors who could put bums on seats and attract lucre from the money men. Cruise slips into third place behind Hanks and Mel Gibson. Researchers consulted 135 international film executives who were asked to rank the stars on a scale of 0 to 100 on their ability to guarantee film finance and distribution, as well as filling cinemas. Hanks, winner of a pair of Oscars, scored 100. Gibson got 99.44 and Cruise, 99.05. The only female name in the top ten was Julia Roberts, currently starring in Notting Hill with Hugh Grant, who came in at No. 8. Connery, of James Bond fame and currently starring in Entrapment, is the biggest British name, ranked 19. Sir Anthony comes in at a respectable 35. British women are well down the totem pole, with Emma Thompson placed at 83 and Kate Winslet at 84. Four winners and a film deal Working Title films has signed a two-picture deal with Notting Hill screenwriter Richard Curtis to produce two original feature scripts over the next five years. No scripts have been identified under the deal, which caps Curtis' successful collaboration with Working Title since 1987, when the company produced his first feature, The Tall Guy. Curtis teamed up a second time with Working Title to write the British hit Four Weddings and a Funeral, which became the highest-grossing British film, taking £28 million in the United Kingdom. Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie followed, taking £18 million and Notting Hill, Curtis' latest, and probably biggest, hit, has to date raked in £15 million at the UK box office. Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, co-chairmen of Working Title films, said: \"Quite simply, we believe that Richard Curtis is one of the world's great writers and we are thrilled to continue our long-standing relationship into the next millennium.\" Taking the Michael One of the great British caper movies, The Italian Job, is about to get the Hollywood treatment. One Hollywood studio has approached Plunkett and Macleane writers Robert Wade and Neal Purvis to draft a script. The 1969 classic starred Michael Caine as an ex-con who outwits the Mafia and contains the famous scene of a fleet of Mini Coopers running amok. Wade and Purvis, who are currently working on this year's James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough, are prime candidates to tailor British stories for Hollywood. The Italian Job, to be re-released in September, is part of a Caine revival. The British film noir classic, Get Carter, which Caine made in 1971, is currently receiving another airing. There are also plans for a remake of this film, starring, of all people, Sylvester Stallone. Summer gamble Downtown Pictures, a small British distributor, is taking a gamble on Spike Lee's controversial movie, Summer of Sam. The company bought the UK distribution rights to Lee's film from Buena Vista International, the Disney UK distributor, in a deal struck at Cannes. Downtown has never released a film from any of Hollywood's major studios. Summer of Sam attracted controversy as soon as Lee announced plans to make the film; an examination of the paranoia that engulfed New York in 1976 during the months that serial killer David \"Son of Sam\" Berkowitz roamed the city. Detractors thought a convicted, imprisoned killer's reign of terror was an unsuitable subject. Michael Lauria, the father of Berkowitz's first victim says Lee's movie, released in the US in July, has already reopened old wounds. Lee came under pressure from Disney to tone down the film in April. Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth told the Los Angeles Times: \"Let's judge it when it's finished... Lee's got stuff in there that is rougher than I would make it. I'm hoping at some point he will trim it out. Summer of Sam received an NC-17 (no children under 17) rating in March and Lee has been trying to get it switched to an R (restricted) rating instead. Freedom of distribution Another film in trouble is Dogma, written and directed by Kevin Smith, who is trying to sell his religious satire to a distributor at a time when Hollywood is under pressure to clean up its act following a spate of high school killings. A Catholic group known as America Needs Fatima has been distributing leaflets strenuously objecting to the movie and urging people to send complaints to Disney and the Weinstein brothers at Miramax. \"Freedom of expression does not allow one to attack the rights of others,\" says the group's material. The film's detractors pick up on this relatively harmless line to illustrate their point: \"The nature of God and the virgin birth - those are leaps of faith. But believing a wife never humped her husband - that's just gullibility.\" Eyes Wide Pook Jocelyn Pook provides no less than four songs for Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut: Backwards Priest, Migrations, Naval Officer and The Dream.

I want to achieve it by not dying.\" It looks like in the end he might achieve it by becoming the lover of his ex-wife's adopted daughter. In the past couple of years his life has gone from the arts pages of the broadsheets to the front pages of the tabloids and turned into an episode of the Jerry Springer show. So it's hardly surprising that his latest film is called Celebrity and has a cast of characters that include a guest list of modern-day parasites - models, movie brats, plastic surgeons, weathermen, chatshow hosts, and even a mention of Sonny Von Bulow who is only famous because she is in a coma. Previously Woody was only known, or at least loved, by the kind of people who went to cinemas where they sell carob cake rather than popcorn. But transgression has made him a celeb. The papers carry long-range pictures of him with his forbidden lover and their baby and he finally appeared on Parkinson - solo. The last person to do that was George Michael and, as he himself pointed out, he had had to get his todger out in public to achieve it. George joined Hugh Grant on the short list of the pay-and-display famous who have managed to parlay notoriety into self-deprecating owning up. They both just used to be stars but now they're celebs too. Grant has even managed to edge himself back up the celebrity ladder alongside his girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley. We no longer stand in awe of them as gods of fame, but regard them closer up as mortals with flaws. The famous have slid from the top of Mount Olympus down to the plains where mere humans dwell: they are no longer even representations of ordinary life but ordinary life itself. The perfect example is Maureen Rees. When a woman who drives a car in much the same way as John Prescott speaks the English language becomes a national figure it is almost unnecessary to repeat that we live in a climate obsessed with creating celebrity. Alongside Maureen Rees in Driving School sit Eileen Downey in Hotel and, most terrifyingly, the apparently tone deaf Jane McDonald from The Cruise who became the defining faces of television last year. McDonald, who by now has had a number one hit and her wedding featured in a TV documentary, even presented a BAFTA award in May. It was one for factual programming, although her creation as a public figure is closer to fiction. In Woody Allen's movie there is a pivotal moment when a child is asked to tell his granny who came to speak at his school that week. He explains that it was a man who had been a hostage in the Lebanon. From what he says we recognise a kind of Terry Anderson type. \"Why's he famous?\" the granny wonders. \"He just got caught\". But he didn't just get caught. Like McDonald, Rees and Downey, he got famous because he got caught on TV. The emergence of stars is generally dated from the theatre of the 18th century with such actors as Garrick, Sarah Siddons and Edmund Kean. They and a number of others became famous separately from the characters they played. As the theatre became financially and professionally more viable they moved away from playing prescribed roles and became known in their own right. In movies the key event in the creation of a star is generally taken to be the planting of a story in 1910 in the St Louis Post-Dispatch that Florence Lawrence, \"the Biograph Girl\", had been killed in a trolley car accident. She was in fact at home and quite well. And the producer who spun the original deceit, Carl Laemml, promptly took an ad in the trade press the following day denouncing it as a vicious lie. There always has been a great deal of fiction in the creation of a star. God's gift to women Rock Hudson was never straight and goody-goody Doris Day was divorced. In fact the fiction surrounding Judy Garland was precisely what made her a great star. As critic Richard Dyer has pointed out, we all knew that her family, her daughters, her marriage to Vincente Minnelli, her extraordinary smile and her remarkable vivacity on screen was an unreality for her. It was the fact that her \"normality\" was an act that made her an icon, in particular to a gay culture that knew all about brave pretence. Individual stars embody the contradictions of their age. That's what makes them stars. And we know what that means when we think of Monroe, Dean, Hepburn , Davis, Tracy, Stewart, Streisand, Newman, Beatty, Redford, Madonna, Dylan, Springsteen, Cruise and maybe even Julia Roberts. Celebrities, however, embody nothing at all as individuals. Ex-prime ministers' sons, minor marrying royals, weather girls who sell topless photos, hounded rugby captains, Page Three girls, Paula Yates, Melinda Messenger and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson exist only as a group. Their sole aim is to get themselves for any reason whatsoever on to the other side of the velvet rope in life and encourage us to believe that we can do it too. They - and we - are driven by nothing but fame itself. Together they do embody one great contradiction of our age. The drive away from elitism and towards equality none the less demands new elites and new inequalities. This New Celebrity is a complicated mixture. There's money in there for sure, but you also have to add breasts, sin and, worst of all, feelings. Pools winner Viv Nicholson, one of the first New Celebs, perfectly, and significantly at the beginning of a time of prosperity, captured the thrill of being catapulted from charlady to Croesus in 1961 in her exhilarating call to shopping, \"Spend, Spend, Spend.\" Now she's a Jehovah's Witness in Wakefield with only the riches of the kingdom of God to look forward to as she followed her own exhortation to the letter and has none of her £152,000 win left. At the start of the 70s girls billed as having little in their heads and lots in their bras showed that you could make an indecent living from Page Three. All you needed was attractive breasts, which unlike talent you could acquire. And with earnings for the more successful girls at £100,000 a year you can only agree with John Berger's assertion that \"glamour cannot exist without envy\". The roll call continues through Mastermind winners, instant Lottery millionaires, streakers, footballers' exes, air stewards, models with safety-pin dresses: a heady cocktail of what the sociologist Leo Lowenthal called heroes of consumption. Fame originally touched those who did, those who achieved - the inventors, the conquerors, the leaders. Now it alights on the shoulders of those who \"stem predominantly from the sphere of consumption and organised leisure time\", which in plain language means actors and sports people. They become models of consumption for every one of us. But at least, never mind how indolent Jack Nicholson or Faye Dunaway might be, stars in some way tell our stories. Celebrities however, at inordinate and dreary length, just tell their own. The heart of myth and collective tales has been ripped out of fame and now we are just exposed, through the false idea that to talk about something is to act on it, to newspapers and television dignifying the lives of perfectly ordinary people with an aura of specialness. Hit TV shows are now about things that we can all do ourselves, gardening, cooking and DIY. If we couldn't do the latter it would be called \"I do it on TV\" - IDIOTV. And in parallel, celebrity is created from notoriety. OJ and Louise Woodward are not good old-fashioned moral warnings they are fictions created in the same mould as soaps. The elevation of Louise Woodward to the level of a Panorama interview is an absurdity as great as the prime minister speaking out in support of the Free Deirdre Raschid Campaign, when Ken Barlow's ex was about to be gaoled on Coronation Street. They are all fictions in the service of profit and sales. As are the false moralities that editors throw up to create the new Fallen Idols. Lawrence Dallaglio was only a role model for a narrow group of rugby enthusiasts until the editor of the News of the World decided he was a role model for everyone in order to tell the world that he wasn't. He was only made famous in order to make him infamous. He had to be invented to sell newspapers. It's the way with celebrity. It's no surprise at all that Jerry Springer and Vanessa both made up stories and got actors to play out \"real lives\". Just how different is that from EastEnders, where actors, who spend much time off set trying to look as glamorous as possible, are paid large amounts of money on set to be as convincingly ordinary as they can? An age of increased social mobility inevitably devalues celebrity by making it more accessible. Real heroes and proper stars transcend that, in part by doing something that is genuinely out of the ordinary, achieving beyond even their own dreams, and in part by just making themselves more inaccessible. So then the daily diet of a vastly expanding media is filled with those who are the cousins to stardom. Stars stick their head above the crowd. But \"celebs\" are just ordinary people in the crowd who accidentally catch the spotlight looking for the stars. And there are signs that we're tiring of them. So come in Monica Lewinsky, Grant Bovey, Julia Carling and a thousand others on cable, your time is up."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/1999/jun/16/balkans3","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-16T00:15:21Z","webTitle":"Last refugee flight to land next week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/16/balkans3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jun/16/balkans3","fields":{"headline":"Last refugee flight to land next week","bodyText":"The mass airlift of Kosovan refugees to Britain is to come to an end next week, the home secretary, Jack Straw, announced last night. A total of 4,300 Kosovans will have come to Britain under the programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The final flight will carry refugees who cannot be cared for in the camps in Macedonia and those who have very close family relatives already here. In an unexpected announcement, Mr Straw also said that the 10,000 Kosovan Albanians who came to Britain before Nato bombing began are also to be given exceptional leave to remain in Britain for 12 months. Their individual asylum applications will be suspended and they will, unlike other asylum seekers, be able to claim full welfare benefits while they are here. His decision ends the sharp contrast in the British treatment of those who arrived on the UNHCR programme and those who fled to Britain from Slobodan Milosevic before the Nato campaign began. Mr Straw said nobody would be forced to return to Kosovo. \"Those refugees arriving under the UNHCR programme who have been granted 12 months leave to enter will not have their stay curtailed. We will, however, actively be establishing arrangements to facilitate the return of those who want to go back to Kosovo before then.\" The scale of the British airlift of Kosovan refugees was fiercely criticised by the Germans and others from the European Union. The Germans took 14,300 refugees and seven other countries, including Canada (5,206), Austria (5,080) and Norway (6,070), accepted more from the camps than Britain. The UNHCR said yesterday it expected about 500,000 in camps in Macedonia and Al bania to go back to Kosovo in the next few months but it was expected that those in asylum countries were likely to stay at least through the winter. Mr Straw said that although the evacuation flights from Macedonia to the UK were coming to an end, Britain would continue to allow close relatives of those who are already here to come to the UK on family reunion grounds. \"Anyone granted a visa for travel to the United Kingdom will, however, be required to make their own travel and accommodation arrangements.\" The home secretary paid tribute to the British local authorities and refugee welfare organisations which received the evacuees. \"Even those areas which have not actually received flights or accommodated evacuees have responded with generosity and enthusiasm to the need to plan for arrivals,\" he said. The Local Government Association also praised local communities for their swift reaction to the emergency. \"Local authorities have had an extraordinary level of support from local people who offered everything from clothes and money to beds in their own homes. Without their commitment this programme would not have been the overwhelming success it has been,\" said Len Duvall, chairman of the LGA asylum seekers project group. Nick Hardwick, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, welcomed the government's decision to allow family reunions to continue and for those who came to Britain independently to have the same status as the evacuees. He said the return of refugees from exile in Europe should only be organised in conditions of safety and dignity and when they could have the means to live. \"It is still too early to say when these conditions are likely to be met,\" said Mr Hardwick, who added that while most wanted to go home, for some it may not prove possible. \"This may include those who are from mixed marriages and those who have worked for Yugoslav government institutions. These evacuees must have access to the asylum procedures so that we can be certain that no one at risk will be returned.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/jun/16/guardianobituaries","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-16T00:17:05Z","webTitle":"Frederick Thorpe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jun/16/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/jun/16/guardianobituaries","fields":{"headline":"Frederick Thorpe","bodyText":"Frederick Thorpe, who has died aged 85, had a vision in 1964 which transformed the lives of large numbers of people. Some \"voluntary ladies\" had told him that many elderly people could no longer see to read ordinary books. As a recently retired publisher, he abandoned his plans to become a farmer and devoted his life to promoting the cause of Ulverscroft large print books for the visually impaired. A ruddy-faced, smiling and engaging personality, Thorpe launched himself into selling his new idea. While working out the technical problems of producing the books, he lobbied everyone who could possibly help get the project off the ground. He was especially gratified by the response of librarians in hospitals and public libraries. There were, however, problems, and Thorpe could well have given up - and cut his considerable losses - during those early years. Publishers were, at first, unhelpful, but a significant breakthrough came with the endorsement of Agatha Christie. Then there was the problem of expense: more ink led to a heavier paper and thence to substantial binding, all of which threatened to defeat the object - the provision of readable books for predominantly elderly and often frail readers. Librarians saw other problems. The books would need separate treatment, while the unrelentingly popular choice of titles - including romances and westerns - would not at that time have been stocked by some self-respecting libraries. Having found a suitable and successful format, Thorpe went on his way with missionary zeal, preaching the cause of large print, initially throughout the United Kingdom and then to the rest of the English-speaking world. The ultimate compliment of imitators began in the United States within a year, and, after the profitability of the venture had been demonstrated, by other publishers in this country. It was a truly charitable enterprise. Thorpe established the Ulverscroft Foundation, which today still receives all the profits and sponsors research into visual impairment. It has recently included a unit at the Great Ormond Street children's hospital. Frederick Thorpe was born in Leicester, the son of a cordwainer. After leaving school at 14, and working briefly as a painter and decorator, he bought a small van and set up a travelling library, charging tuppence per volume per week. After war service in the RAF, he started a wholesale magazine business and later, as Thorpe and Porter, specialised in publishing children's classics. He received the OBE in 1969, Leicester University conferred an honorary doctorate and he received numerous awards, including the Queen's award to industry. Thorpe's greatest legacy is the universal availability of books in large print, and the joy and satisfaction that these books have brought to countless readers who thought they would never be able to read again. He is survived by his second wife, Vera, and a son.

It's called Stars And Their Scars - Hollywood celebs reveal their disfigurements on camera. No? Okay, how about Lonely Pets, Modern pets in Blair's Britain - millennial Britain - they're isolated. We examine their state of mind. Maybe with Oliver James. No? How about Kingdom Of The Senses. Two people with different disabilities - say a blind person and a deaf person, compete to see who can complete more Krypton Factor-style challenges without their, y'know, sight or hearing. It's a science programme really, or a disability programme if you like... with a game show twist. We're in the middle of a pitching session. Frighteningly, all of the above were ideas pitched at television commissioning editors in the last 12 months. None made it beyond paper, but why not, when Families At War, When Athletes Attack and Celebrity Deathmatch did? In TV, the line between a terrible idea and a fantastic one seems to be getting thinner all the time, yet the reason why the last three made it through the commissioning process and the first three didn't was... was... well, who can ultimately tell? Feng Shui? Caligulan whim? That they were - gulp - better ideas? This is the TV producer's nightmare. There's a direct analogy here with record companies, in which A&amp;R people are suddenly as likely to see a Baz Lurhmann or The Beta Band go to number one as the Corrs. Shoving themselves up with walls of stats - demographic breakdowns, focus group analysis and research from the weather-forecasts of style - still none can be insulated from the unpredictability of a hit. This is why both record company and TV executives still see the potential value of taking a complete flyer on something whimsical or plain daft. Well, you never know, do you? When Patrick McGoohan stepped into Lew Grade's smoke-filled office in order to pitch The Prisoner, McGoohan ranted insanely about giant balloons and Port Meirion for half an hour. Eventually, Grade told McGoohan he hadn't a clue what he was talking about, but that if it made as little sense as his rant, it was bound to be a hit. Clearly the risk is worth taking if TV executives have a chance of reflected glory in associating themselves with a wildcard success. Yet there can be a kind of brilliance in making ultra-obvious decisions, too. Commissioning a show like Who Want To Be A Millionaire? - Double Your Money meets a pub quiz - was killer scheduling by ITV's David Lidderment. The programme was such a success, it's known in TV as Why Didn't I Think Of That? Prime-time proposals like Vic &amp; Bob's Families At War make an ironic nod to the Lew Grade moment: to the unknowability of the good idea. They also subconsciously acknowledge that coming up with (and selling) TV ideas is a desperate, desperate business. This process is called \"development\" and is a purgatorial period of punishment for TV people \"between programmes\", forced to come up with new! exciting! ideas in order to keep working. Producers in development sit on a Xeno's Arrow of perpetual close-misses, condemned to dream-up programmes with ever more ridiculous titles, enticing in inverse proportion to the hopelessness of the content. After development comes the pitch, which must be \"high concept\" ie being able to sell the idea in 12 seconds flat to a baggy-linen suited exec with perpetual ennui. Phrases to avoid at this meeting including anything \"on acid\", \"with attitude\", \"funky\". Or \"sexy\", especially (kiss of death) \"A Changing Rooms for [fill in the blank]. The finest, most frightening, on-screen glimpse into this process came from Alan Partridge, sitting in the Controller of BBC1's sixth floor office, frenziedly pitching ideas in the wake of being sacked: Monkey Tennis, Swallow (a detectives series set in Norwich. \"No one had heard of Oxford before Morse\"), Inter-city Sumo and Partridge Among the Pigeons (\"Don't know what it is, I've just thought of the title.\") Partridge's pièce de résistance was to pitch an idea for a show in which he drives a lawnmower across Britain. David Lynch has just taken this very idea and made it the central notion of his latest movie, which has just won a prize at Cannes. Does that make it a crap idea or a brilliant one? The movie pitch itself has long been a big-screen comedy staple; the \"Graduate Two\" pitch at the start of The Player and the swimming pool (non) pitch from Barton Fink, two modern classics. On TV, however, Partridge demonstrated a fresh kind of hell. The US equivalent of the Partridge moment is the single most satirical TV moment about the TV process itself ever made. George Costanza and Jerry Seinfield are sitting before network executives in an air-con pent-office, pitching the idea of Seinfeld as a show... in a spoof episode of Seinfeld called... The Pitch. \"It's a show about nothing,\" they explain. Silence from the network executives (they don't get the commission). Following Seinfeld's transmission in Britain, commissioning editors were inundated with \"shows about nothing\". The Pitch is the US equivalent of the Partridge moment. It points up the fundamental difference between the two TV cultures in Britain. Alan still has an outside chance. These people, in their baggy linen suits - well, they're all right really. In America, however, George and Jerry are swimming with sharks. Nothing, absolutely nothing, escapes these hardball monsters, who wouldn't see a funny idea if it comedy-punched them on their ha-ha hooters (the network execs hate the \"show about nothing\" but love George's \"back-up idea\" in which Jerry plays a slapstick butler). The first rule with pitching TV ideas is that if you employ irony, be sure to use bold print. Peter Bazalgette, the TV supremo behind Changing Rooms and Ready Steady Cook, has said that if Chaucer tried to pitch the Canterbury Tales today, no one would be able to categorise it in any existing genre, and so it wouldn't get commissioned. Perhaps, but then again, they might give it a leisure programming spin, which would make most entertaining viewing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/1999/jun/18/religion.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-18T00:44:22Z","webTitle":"Hume was 'goodness personified'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/18/religion.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jun/18/religion.uk","fields":{"headline":"Hume was 'goodness personified'","bodyText":"Tributes following the death of Cardinal Hume came from all religious faiths and across the political spectrum. The archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, said the news had left him profoundly sad: \"We worked together closely and productively for many years and throughout that time my respect, admiration and affection for him have grown. \"I especially value his personal commitment to bringing our Christian communities and traditions closer to one another. \"He was rightly held in high regard for the leadership he gave the Roman Catholic church, and for his dedication to the cause of ecumenicism.\" In statement issued by Downing Street, Tony Blair said: \"He was goodness personified, a true holy man with extraordinary humility and an unswerving dedication. He did much to inspire people of all faiths, and none. \"He made an incalculable contribution to the Catholic church. Around the world there are people who will miss him deeply and remember him for the extraordinary good that he did.\" The Queen, joined the flood of tributes. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said : \"The Queen is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Cardinal Hume, whom she will remember for his outstanding contribution to the Christian life of this country.\" A Kensington Palace spokesman said: \"The Duchess of Kent said that it had been a privilege to have got to know Cardinal Hume as a friend whose whole life bore witness to his extraordinary qualities.\" Michael Ancram, the Conservative party chairman, a Catholic who remained a close friend of the cardinal after being taught by him at Ampleforth college, described him as an \"exceptional person\". In a statement, Mr Ancram said: \"Cardinal Hume was a man who combined great spirituality with the warmest humanity. He was a leader who led by example, a friend who always left his friends feeling better, and a stalwart in the fight against injustice. He will be missed by people of all religions.\" Mr Ancram recalled his memories of the cardinal at Ampleforth. He told Channel 4 news: \"My recollections are of the warmth of the man. He was a great friend. He had a tremendous sense of humour. He was a great sportsman. He was someone who lived life to the full and lived it in a very Christian way.\" Abbot Timothy Wright of Ampleforth, where Cardinal Hume lived as a monk and abbot for 26 years before coming to Westminster in 1976, said: \"All of his brethren at Ampleforth are mourning the death of Cardinal Basil. He was an inspiring abbot to the community, a much-loved bishop in his diocese and a spiritual father for millions of others in our country and beyond.\" Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary who converted to Catholicism after seeking the cardinal's guidance, said: \"Cardinal Hume left the church immeasurably stronger than he inherited it. He will be a very hard act to follow. While sorry about his illness, I am glad that he is at peace.\" Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, praised Cardinal Hume's contribution to ecumenical understanding. In a statement, he said: \"Cardinal Hume was a great ambassador for his faith. \"He will be a terrible loss to the Catholic church and for those he reached out to beyond its confines who believe that the heart of religion is tolerance.\" Cardinal Thomas Winning, leader of Scotland's Catholics, said: \"Today is a sad day not only for the Catholic community of England and Wales, but for people of all faiths, and none, throughout the United Kingdom.\" Rabbi Thomas Salamon, from the Westminster synagogue, said Cardinal Hume's passing will be felt beyond the Catholic community. \"The passing of a great man reverberates around the world, especially someone who was as compassionate and feeling as Cardinal Hume. \"His relationship with the Jewish community was very cordial.\" Otto Herschan, chairman of the Catholic Herald newspaper, said: \"He became a great Christian leader in this country because of his sincerity. He was seen as a Christian leader and a leader, full stop.\" Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \"Our condolences go to the Catholic community for the loss of their leader.

Disclosure of information during the regular investigations they face is the key for their defence. We would therefore strongly support your campaign.\" Consumers Association \"The culture of secrecy dominates British public life so comprehensively that it seems normal. However, it eats into the fabric of society and undermines democracy in a way that should concern us all.

PG Wodehouse wrote feelingly of raw work at the font. He himself was ruthlessly christened Pelham Greville. You can usually keep this kind of thing under your hat until your next visit to church, to be married. Prince Edward, it turned out, was Edward Anthony Richard Louis - which spells EARL. If he has any monogrammed socks, shorts or whatnot, these can live on happily under his new name. If, as Sue Barker for the BBC seemed to think, he had been created Duke of Wessex, it would have been an underwear Armageddon at Bagshot Park. And his briefcase, monogrammed EW, can breathe again. Unfortunately, the only person who believes Wessex exists is the Marquess of Bath - he of the flowing robes and the wifelets - and he wants to take it out of the United Kingdom. The Royal Wedding (BBC and ITV) was charmingly done, with the bridegroom involved to the point of pickiness. According to John Suchet for ITV, 'Prince Edward has made sure that he has had a hand in every single decision. He's actually driven them slightly mad with his constant changes of mind.' He didn't make the programme, but he chose the picturesque locations and the unusual time. According to Sue Barker, he had even hoped, in vain, to divert the flight path of incoming planes. He insisted on arriving on foot, waving, in the Blairite way (and had to be asked to get out of the way of the Queen Mother's car, whose chauffeur was presented with the delicate problem of to toot or not to toot). He picked the scarlet chairs. He chose the sweet peas. He banned hats (though his elderly leading ladies proved refractory, as elderly leading ladies often do), obliging perfectly rational women to wear bits of budgie in their hair. In other words, he produced it. It was the most TV-oriented thing the royal family have been in. All Edward's Ardent productions have been pretty and trivial. The Royal Wedding was probably pretty and trivial too, but it was by far his best work. Where can he go after this visible triumph? Surely not Edward - The Divorce. Perhaps, more cheerfully, Son of Edward. As he was so choosy about production values, he must have approved the BBC's camera angles, which were exceptionally close-up and personal. They caught Edward's wink and the way Sophie's eyes locked onto his as she repeated her vows. The faces of bride and groom filled the screen. So, at one point did the huge backside of a horse. 'Oh, I say!' said Michael Buerk, taken aback, for a horse's rump is bigger than seems possible or strictly necessary. 'We have a camera on the carriage. That gives you a sense of what it must be like sitting in a carriage.' The Queen Mother popped something - at a guess, a mint - in her mouth during the longueurs of the service. A once-golden couple, Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret, arrived by the back door, limping and in a wheelchair. It was the end of a generation. Edward is, as Spike Milligan used to put it, the last turkey in the shop. Next time round it will be the chickens. Incidental delights were watching the Sultan of Brunei and his wife or wives, clanking with jewellery, arrive in a minibus. And Prince Charles wearing a grey tail coat when Gieves and Hawkes, the royal tailors, had earlier said so repressively, 'Obviously you don't wear your Ascot grey tail coat to morning-dress wedding events. That is a major faux pas.' Would you care to rephrase that, Gieves - to, perhaps, 'an exciting fashion statement'? Around midnight Channel 4 has a lively programme called The Sundays, which chooses the best stories from the early editions. They fell on the story like a wedding guest on a canape. There was, as it were, enough said at our Sophie's wedding. Andrew Marr: 'Ninety-seven pages of bilge.' Anthony Holden (who had written a longish piece for the Sunday Express on the subject): 'A couple who are completely marginal to British public life.' Linda Smith, left-wing comedian: 'A rather dreary suburban wedding. She was wearing the entire contents of Brentford Nylon on her head. Earl of Wessex - that's a completely made up title. They might as well call him Obi-Wan Kenobi.'

Pundits over the months had confidently predicted one of two outcomes: either Prince Edward would be made a duke - most likely of Cambridge - in keeping with the precedent of previous royal weddings, or he would not be given a title at all in recognition of the public and political cynicism over the creation of new hereditary titles. In another break with tradition, the new earl and countess have agreed that their children will not be princes or princesses of the royal blood and will therefore not bear the title of royal highness. The resurrection of the earldom of Wessex after an absence of more than 900 years - a decision taken on the formal advice of the prime minister and in line with the Queen's wishes - is unusual in a number of ways. Formally, earls rank two grades below dukes in the descending order of superiority of the peerage. In a compromise gesture, Edward has also been promised the dukedom of Edinburgh on the death of his parents, and has been given the courtesy title Viscount of Severn. Palace insiders say the choice of a lesser title reflects the Queen's wish to balance fairness to her son with political reality. The creation of a new dukedom was regarded as incompatible with a more informal monarchy. But if he had not been given a title at all, his wife would have been styled Her Royal Highness, the Princess Edward. She is understood to have been keen to avoid becoming a princess to remove one possible comparison with Diana, Princess of Wales. Nevertheless some royal observers have taken the title as a slight to the prince. \"He is the first son of a monarch in this dynasty going back to George I not to be made a duke,\" Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said yesterday. \"The (present) Duke of Edinburgh is not on his deathbed at the moment so it is a curious compromise. It shows that Prince Edward will not play a major part in public life.\" The choice of Wessex has raised eyebrows because it has no physical reality. The Anglo-Saxon kingdom, thought to have covered modern day Berkshire, Somerset, Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire, rose to prominence in the 10th century after the rule of its king, Alfred the Great. Then there is the history of the title. The earldom is most closely associated with its last incumbent, King Harold II, who was defeated by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/jun/22/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-22T00:32:01Z","webTitle":"Who'd be a Wessex Man?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jun/22/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/jun/22/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"Who'd be a Wessex Man?","bodyText":"The Queen's decision to elevate her youngest son and his bride to the newly created earldom of Wessex has puzzled many a royal commentator. How could anyone be happy with a title that was only a consonant away from the 'Countess of Essex', wondered the man in the Independent, while the Observer speculated that this urge to 'appropriate the dark ages' might 'backfire'. Quite why this nod in the direction of one of the most successful periods in early English political and military history should so alarm the Observer's leader writers is a mystery. At the same time this kind of bran-tub ennoblement does raise interesting problems of definition and authenticity. Duke of Edinburgh? Well, yes. Duchy of Lancaster? Up to a point. But Earl and Countess of Wessex? Where exactly is Wessex, and how do you get there? What will Burke and Debrett have to say about it? What kind of people, and what kind of destinies, can be found within its boundaries? If nothing else, the choice of 'Wessex' is a tribute to our national heritage's capacity for reinvention. The ability of the great early English tribal units to survive a millennium or so of demon cartographers and devious local government reorganisations is one of the more cheering by-products of English history. Even today 'Mercia' and 'Northumbria' haven't quite disappeared as vague and mythical-sounding tags for enormous and usually indeterminate chunks of the map. A thousand years since there actually was such a place, Wessex has exactly this sort of fake quasi-regional status - it gets prefixed, for example, to government agencies and is much relished by bodies such as the National Trust. South-western telephone directories abet this movement by compiling lists of 'Wessex businesses'. Although the definition is complicated by a great many literary extras picked up in the late 19th century, essentially Wessex has survived in much the same way as the other main component of the 9th-century English map - a faintly exalted-sounding piece of topographical shorthand with a historical pedigree so ancient that, apart from King Alfred and his cake, nobody can quite remember what it consisted of. Strictly defined, Wessex means 'Country of the West Saxons', a band of continental invaders that Bede calls the Gewisse, and who, never modest when it came to ancestral origins, claimed descent from Woden. According to the extremely fragmentary documentary evidence this raiding party turned up on the south coast late in the 5th century, under the command of a father-and-son team named Cerdic and Cynric, and proceeded to carve out a path of rapine and settlement all the way to the modern Thames Valley. They may even something of which the royal name-choosers were no doubt aware have got as far as Windsor. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is full of references to Wessex Men (unsurprisingly, given that it was probably sponsored by King Alfred, the greatest Wessex Man of all) - tough-sounding guys with names like Stuf and Wihtgar, who took over the Isle of Wight, and Cuthwine and Ceawlin, who 'fought against the Britons and slew three kings' before going on to capture Gloucester, Cirencester and Bath some time in the 570s. Alfred, who three centuries later frustrated the Danes, captured London and established some enduring structures for English government, seems to have been a royal role-model: diligent, hard-working and studious (he divided the day into eight hours' work, eight hours' study and eight hours' sleep), canny and politically astute. In his early days, then, Wessex Man is everything that a scion of comparatively ancient royalty might aspire to, ruler, too, of a kingdom that now extended all the way from Surrey to Exeter. Only when literature supervenes, 900 years or so later, does this inspiring vision of a high-minded public servant grimly doling out socks on the jaw to the sneaky Danes start to fade away and be replaced by something a great deal more ambiguous. Carefully nurtured by the local tourist industry, Thomas Hardy's Wessex is one of the great modern literary theme parks, and yet, like the Wessex of Cerdic's day, its boundaries are surprisingly inexact. While much of the action in Hardy's novels takes place in his native Dorset, there are excursions as far west as 'Port Bredy' (Bridport), as far east as 'Melchester' (Salisbury) and even occasional sojourns in Berkshire and Cornwall, the setting for his 1873 novel A Pair of Blue Eyes. With this geographical imprecision, though, came a dismal awareness of what was happening to an area that Hardy had started off apostrophising as his 'dream country'. By 1895 he was complaining that it had 'solidified into a utilitarian region which people can go to, take a house in, and write letters to the papers from'. And if Wessex itself had become debased and modernised, so had its inhabitants been similarly ground down by fate and passing time. What destinies lie in wait for Wessex Man in Hardy's immensely gloomy novels? Well, they have a distressing tendency to get drunk and sell their wives at public auction (Henchard in The Mayor of Casterbridge), marry the wrong woman and then compound the offence by setting up with a one-parent family (Jude the Obscure) or caddishly worm their way into the affections of innocent but susceptible young girls (Alec d'Urberville in Tess - it turns out that the d'Urbervilles have bought the family name, so perhaps he doesn't count). Romantic success, when it comes, is always bought at a price. Thus when Swithin St Cleeve, the youthful astronomer of Two on a Tower, finally offers to marry the much older and aged looking Lady Constantine, the shock is too much and she drops dead of heart failure. Wessex Woman, meanwhile, is just as washed-up or otherwise ineffectual: a sluttish bar-maid with false hair (Arabella in Jude); no better than she should be (Tess); even had up at one point for urinating in the street (the furmity woman in The Mayor of Casterbridge). Worse, though, than this catalogue of personal failings, irresolution or sheer bad luck, is Hardy's habit of coating everything he writes about Wessex and its inhabitants in an absolutely chronic determinism. The fates are out to get you in this suicide-strewn debatable land beyond the home counties, no pleas by the defence are accepted, and the President of the Immortals is always just around the corner ready to impart some particularly bad news. Curiously enough, this strain of writing about south and south-west England endures. Christopher Hart's excellent debut novel The Harvest, set in the countryside near Salisbury and repeatedly invoking the idea of Wessex, paints a grim picture of half-dead villages colonised by weekending toffs, farms converted into tourist sideshows and rural life becalmed in a backwater of poverty and dereliction. Wessex Man, according to Hart is terminally out of a job - odd, smock-draped mornings at Farmer Gyles's Olde Farmstead excepted and spends his leisure hours out of his head on cheap cider, attending illegal dog-fights or pilfering trout out of private rivers. Significantly, Lewis Pike, his teenaged protagonist, ends up doing something very nasty to himself with a crossbow bolt. It would be invidious, perhaps, to concentrate on this literary tradition of blighted hopes and smashed illusions. Even so, other modern definitions of what Wessex is supposed to stand for aren't always encouraging. A mid-90s stand-off in the pop world between Blur's Damon Albarn and former Teardrop Explodes singer turned New Age apologist and ley-liner Julian Cope ended up with Cope suggesting that 'I'm Wessex Man and he's Essex Man', that Damon, in fact, was a spiritually vacant Colchester hedonist. Subsequent photographs of shaven-headed and sheepskin-coated Cope embracing standing stones and cavorting on the downs didn't inspire confidence. So what did Her Majesty think she was doing? No doubt the royal aim, conceived as a part of the general monarchical reinvention that currently distinguishes the House of Windsor, was to conjure up a pleasant, vision of Heritage England a kind of compound of downland mists and sun on the chalk-hills, wattle and daub huts and King Alfred brooding over his candles. But cultural expropriations of this kind have a nasty habit of bringing more baggage with them than the expropriator intended. When you come to think about it, perhaps 'Earl and Countess of Mercia' would have been a safer bet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/jun/22/freedomofinformation.uk4","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-22T00:35:08Z","webTitle":"Ten questions for Jack Straw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/22/freedomofinformation.uk4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jun/22/freedomofinformation.uk4","fields":{"headline":"Ten questions for Jack Straw","bodyText":"Jack Straw will this morning give evidence to the Commons public administration committee on his draft freedom of information bill.

A moustache, incidentally, that is a godsend to the fraud-beaters at the Bank of England. Come again? Elgar has made it on to the new £20 note (legal tender as from yesterday).

The Guardian has learned that a study from the accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche found untaxed economic activity on a hitherto unimagined scale. Deloittes estimated that 40% of Greece's economy did not exist for taxation or other official purposes, and suggested that the Italian government's 16% figure for the country's shadow economy ought to be closer to 30%. Given that the two key components in calculating national payments to the Brussels budget are the total of each country's VAT receipts and the size of its gross national product, the Deloitte figures suggest serious flaws in the system. They also raise a question mark over the mechanism for paying EU aid to the poorest member states, given that some seem to be understating their national incomes. The report was commissioned in 1997 by DG21, the Brussels taxation directorate. A Deloittes team including the leading tax partner Martyn Bridges, a former officer of the Inland Revenue, worked for a year on the project, concentrating on five sample mem ber-states - Britain, Italy, France, Belgium and Germany - but taking in the EU as a whole. Deloittes presented the report in the summer of 1998, and parts of it were published. But it is understood that the most sensitive data, including the revised estimates for untaxed economic activity, will not be made public. A Deloittes source said yesterday : \"The EU exercised its right not to publish.\" It is thought that among the findings of the report were figures for shadow economic activity well above official estimates in most cases, including Britain (8% to 10%), France (16%), Germany (14%), Italy (30%) and Greece (40%). Britain's relatively low figure of about a tenth of the total economy is still much higher than the 1.5% added to economic data since 1992 by what is now the Office for National Statistics to take account of \"informal\" activity. Belgium, home of the EU's chief institutions, is thought to have a \"submerged\" economy around 30% of national income. A source close to the inquiry suggested that, along with Greece, two of the four countries that have traditionally taken the largest slice of EU convergence funds - Portugal and Ireland - have shadow economies amounting to a fifth or more of gross economic activity. Data is not available for the fourth, Spain. Earlier this year, the United Kingdom secured its annual £2bn budget rebate from its contributions to the European Union for the foreseeable future, but the so-called \"agenda 2000\" talks on restructuring the EU budget in advance of new entrants from the Mediterranean and former Soviet bloc continue. Yesterday the treasury said that it had not raised the specific issue of the unofficial economies of other member states during negotiations, despite the fact that this may strengthen Britain's case for a substantial permanent rebate on its contributions. The treasury's position is that the total size of the EU budget ought to stay un changed, but that it ought to be spent more wisely. At the time Deloittes was hired to compile the report, the commission let it be known that it was considering including black-economy figures in estimates of the size of member states' economies from this year onwards. The Luxembourg-based Eurostat agency, official compiler of EU statistics, was not available for comment yesterday . Deloittes has, since submitting the report, established the world's first black-economy think-tank, the Informal Economy Research Centre, which has attracted interest from more than 40 national revenue services around the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/1999/jun/24/onlinesupplement","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-24T01:31:14Z","webTitle":"Access your quirk, then lurk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/jun/24/onlinesupplement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/1999/jun/24/onlinesupplement","fields":{"headline":"Access your quirk, then lurk","bodyText":"Several years ago in South London I heard about a bartering initiative whereby people would exchange one service for another: \"You cut my hair, I'll fix your car\". Newsgroups operate on a similar level. Open to anyone with an Internet connection they act as free public message boards and discussion forums. Like-minded people from all around the world meet in this cyber kingdom and share information and debate, instead of car keys and shampoo. I had my first taste of newsgroups two weeks ago when I decided to progress from the one-on-one conversations in emailing to a more group-orientated discussion. I found them easy to access through my browser on Internet Explorer 5. You can also use specifically-designed software - Free Agent, for example. If you are unsure which newsgroup will best serve your requirements, go to www.deja.com (\"Share what you know, learn what you don't\") which acts as a newsgroup search engine and links you with relevant groups after you type in a subject. There are 30,000 in Usenet so you shouldn't have a problem accessing your particular quirk. Then lurk for a while. Lurking is the term used for browsing a specific group before actually posting a message. This is a good way of sussing out the calibre and relevance of the particular group and avoids the embarrassment of submitting an FAQ (frequently asked question). You can check for FAQs at www.faqs.org/faqs or check the newsgroup itself. They are usually posted every two-to-four weeks. Delurking is the next stage, when you move from looking at what everyone else is saying to actually thinking you could have something to contribute or ask yourself. Being a newsgroup virgin I found the initial process quite intimidating. All this lurking and delurking made me feel like an unsavoury secret agent from a James Bond movie (try rec.007 or misc.confidencecrisis ). There appeared to be a certain netiquette that had to be followed. Do not at any cost send Spam (mass-advertising) or you will end up with luncheon meat all over your computer. Do not SHOUT, do not start a flame war (personal attack online) and just remember your Ps and Cs. My first attempts resulted in a semi-spamming at alt.acting when I tried to advertise a friend's acting workshop and (I blush with shame) an FAQ at alt.linedancing . Initially it's like being the new kid at school. Most subscribers are regulars who debate and share information and resources. But you too can join in. Take a deep breath, straighten your pigtails and load your catapult. Just type your message and post it onto the notice board. Depending on the group I used, my message generally appeared the following day, and within a couple of days I heard from fellow groupies from all over the world. Personal experience over the past couple of weeks has led to some unprecedented success. Posting a message to alt.cybercafes, I asked where to find the largest cybercafe in the world. Kierron then posted a reply and I got the website. Traditional web engines had failed to provide me with this information. I lurked at rec.climbing which gave some answers about indoor rock-climbing in London. I laughed at misc.immigration.au when John P asked for advice about how to obtain Australian residency for his South African girlfriend (he felt he was too young to get married). A lad in Adelaide offered to do the honours. Groupies have a sense of humour too. A slight variation are the moderated groups (where submissions must first go to an individual, the moderator, before they can be posted to the group). It allows for more coherent debate and less repetition, a common pitfall if you frequent a group. My main problem with accessing the newsgroups was trying to interpret the confusing terminology. News servers, readers, moderators, providers, engines - it can all become very complicated when the process is in fact very simple. Also watch out for moneymaking schemes. Someone out there wants your cash and it is easy to fall victim to entrepreneurs. On the whole I found newsgroups invaluable. They serve a real purpose in this age when getting information is often expensive or time-consuming. I was impressed with the way a simple internet accessory could ascend to the heights of human kindness. And that is surely a positive response from such a lonely activity. We may not be able to communicate on the Underground, but we can talk quite magnificently on line."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/1999/jun/27/peopleinscience.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-26T23:02:38Z","webTitle":"The case for Darwin and Maxwell ... and not a note out of place","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/jun/27/peopleinscience.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/1999/jun/27/peopleinscience.comment","fields":{"headline":"The case for Darwin and Maxwell ... and not a note out of place","bodyText":"Have a glance at your wallet or purse. Got a £20 note? If so, whose face is on the flip side from the Queen's? Most likely it is that of Michael Faraday, the physicist whose research revealed the principles of electromagnetism. In that case, treasure it, for the picture of Faraday - one of world's greatest experimenters - is being replaced by that of Edward Elgar on all £20 notes. The aim, says the Bank of England, is simple: Elgar has a moustache, while Faraday was a smooth man, rendering his image easy to forge. The argument is bollocks, of course. If not being hirsute leads to forgery, how come the Queen's boat race is still being kept, you might ask? And does it mean we can no longer honour our Jane Austens or Mary Wollstonecrafts on our paper currency? And even if the claim was true, why pick Elgar? He was a good composer, but not a great one: Pomp and Circumstance, a cello concerto, some Enigma Variations and the odd symphony. Sound stuff, but not world-beating. By contrast, Faraday was a real giant among researchers. His experiments were brilliant, elegant expositions that paved the way for the development of the electronics revolutions of the twentieth century. Elgar, hairy upper lip or not, is simply no substitute. Of course, if the Bank of England insists that we must have a hairy great Briton on our banknotes, we face the obvious question: who should it be? Two key figures spring instantly to mind: Charles Darwin and James Clerk Maxwell, two of the world's greatest thinkers. The former utterly changed our view of ourselves by linking mankind irrevocably to the animal kingdom. He is revered globally (though not among religious bigots), yet he remains improperly honoured in his own country. As for Maxwell, he is acknowledged - along with Einstein and Newton - as a true genius. His work on electromagnetic radiation, carried out with utter inspiration and mathematical brilliance, led to the development of radio, radar, TV, modern astronomy and many other wonders. Richard Feynman said that in a thousand years, Maxwell would be the one scientist remembered from our millennium. He was British (Scottish to be precise), yet is unknown outside scientific circles. More importantly, Darwin and Maxwell were both wonderfully hairy individuals, sporting luxuriant Victorian beards. So let us honour them in future, not second-division composers. Let us celebrate our science not our art, for we have been truly great at the former and have been merely adequate as a nation at the latter, not withstanding the odd Hockney, Dickens or Austen.

The irreconcilable can be reconciled; the wolf will live with the lamb; guns will be turned into butter. That belief faces its toughest test at the tensest time in that unforgiving place called Northern Ireland. The drums of Drumcree are beating their sectarian mood music. Unless the current impasse is overcome, this threatens to be the overture to a slide back into the Troubles, that gentle euphemism for the grisly cycle of murder and maiming by bomb and bullet. By flying to Belfast with the Irish Taoiseach as the clock counts down towards his 'absolute deadline' of 30 June, the Prime Minister obviously hopes to replicate the atmosphere that produced the agreement signed on that long Good Friday last year, which was subsequently given the overwhelming endorsement of the peoples of Ireland, North and South, Protestant and Catholic. To general astonishment, opposites had been persuaded to attract even in this most intractable of territories. For the first time, Unionists accepted a role for the Republic in the affairs of the North, and a Republican share in its government. For the first time, Republicans acknowledged Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom and agreed that its status could only be changed with the consent of a majority of the population of the North. That historic achievement is in peril. When he talks of a 'last chance', the Prime Minister speaks not just for rhetorical effect. He believes it. If the agreement disintegrates, Tony Blair confesses that he does not have a 'Plan B'. This makes him a more honest man than those who lambast the peace process when they possess no alternative except a return to full-blooded conflict. What has bedevilled progress is whether Sinn Fein, and the gunmen who stand in the shadows of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, have genuinely accepted the principle of consent. The Assembly has been established. Terrorists are walking free, among them the man who attempted to assasinate Margaret Thatcher and her Cabinet. Everyone who was party to the agreement, including the Unionists and Tories who now fulminate about it, knew that this was the stomach-churningly high price that democracy would pay to terror to secure peace. But if Republicanism is ready to become an exclusively democratic force, relying only on the conventional political weaponry of persuasion, then why do they still hang on to their guns and their Semtex? This is a crisis of trust, a commodity never in copious supply in politics anywhere, and particularly rare in Northern Ireland. The Unionists won't accept that Sinn Fein is truly committed to peace unless the IRA begins to dismantle its arsenal. The IRA won't make the necessary gesture until it is convinced that the Unionists are sincere about sharing government with Sinn Fein. It is true that the Good Friday Agreement does not make it a pre-condition that the terrorists should decommission their weapons before the executive is formed. It is also true that the side letter that Mr Blair wrote to David Trimble to secure the Unionist's signature says that only parties committed to democratic means should hold office in Northern Ireland. It is on this fudge that everyone is cracking their teeth. David Trimble says no guns, no government. Gerry Adams says no government, no guns. For weeks, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern have been searching for another Third Way. They tried to persuade everyone to make a jump of faith together. The formation of the executive would be matched by a simultaneous declaration that some terrorist weapons had been destroyed. This would have been a symbolic act of good faith, not a guarantee that the IRA could never detonate another bomb. But symbols matter, nowhere more than in Northern Ireland, home of murals, flags and fifes. When Sinn Fein proved intransigent, the Unionists were leant on to give instead. This underestimated the extent to which David Trimble feels exposed. The Unionist leader has taken some heroic gambles, for which he has been deservedly rewarded with a share of the Nobel Peace Prize, but it has left him vulnerable to an internal putsch by the rejectionist elements of his own party. He also has to guard his flank against extremist Unionism. In the recent European elections, the Ulster poll was again topped by Ian Paisley, the blood Orangeman. I can appreciate Trimble's predicament without thinking he served his cause with that choleric outburst demanding the head of Mo Mowlam. It is hardly a secret that there is little loathing lost between Unionist politicians and Ms Mowlam. Yet it can't be the best way to win sympathy for your position by attacking the only politician in Britain who is a candidate for public beatification. It was also wholly counter-productive. Ms Mowlam has been signalling for some time that she is anxious to re-enter mainland British politics. Mr Blair is ready to move her. Their artful double-act in Northern Ireland - she as the friend of the Nationalists, he as the ally of the Unionists - had about run its course. But I'm not surprised to learn that, the day after Mr Trimble's outburst, Mr Blair summoned him to Number 10 at 8.30 in the morning for a robust exchange of words. No Prime Minister will have the configuration of his Cabinet dictated to him. The Unionist leader has simply made it marginally less easy for Mr Blair to bring Ms Mowlam home from Belfast. I suspect that the real object of Mr Trimble's wrath is the Prime Minister himself for setting a time limit which Unionists fear is designed to bounce them into making concessions. Yes, there are perils to laying down deadlines, the most obvious of which is the vacuum of credibility that will be left if this one is not met. But the Prime Minister had to be alert to the equal dangers of letting things drift. Momentum is one of the most powerful forces in politics. What does not progress will regress. I can't believe that any of the principal players are actively willing a return to the disfigured past. But without a compromise, they will make certain that violence again becomes Northern Ireland's future. The third Third Way found by Tony Blair offers just a glimpse of hope. Sinn Fein will be admitted to government only on the unequivocal promise, a pledge that has never before been offered, that the IRA's arsenal will be put beyond use by next May. Decommissioning will have to occur to timetable on penalty of the executive being terminated. If the guarantees offered to the Unionists really are cast in iron, then David Trimble should summon the strength to take a further risk for peace. I can't say anyone is wildly optimistic, but perhaps gloom can serve a life-saving purpose. This week, the politicians of Northern Ireland stand at the brink of a horribly familiar abyss. They should stare, long and hard, into the marrow-chilling blackness before they choose whether to hurl their people back into the pit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/1999/jun/27/organics.theobserver","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-26T23:03:28Z","webTitle":"Planet organic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/jun/27/organics.theobserver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/1999/jun/27/organics.theobserver","fields":{"headline":"Planet organic","bodyText":"'I don't want to make you jealous, but I'm just turning on to the bank of Loch Lomond, watching the sun disappear between a pair of mountains... it's beautiful...' The mobile line stutters into silence, and Patrick Holden finds peace at last, at the end of his frenzied day. Our conversation had begun at 8.30 that morning as Holden, the director of the Soil Association, was driving to the Prince of Wales's Highgrove estate to meet Richard Rominger, deputy secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture, a man despised by organic farmers in the US. It continued as Holden moved on to his manic headquarters in Bristol, to the BBC for an appearance on Newsnight, to the airport to catch an airplane to Glasgow. A few short years ago, the Soil Association was an insignificant charity with a staff of five, whose job it was to help define and maintain standards in Britain's tiny organic agriculture sector. This year, Holden's staff increased to 80, and it's still not enough. The extent to which his life has changed in the space of a few months is almost surreal: suddenly, he is a player, a power broker, a custodian of the fastest-growing commercial brand in the world. To consumers, 'organic' means purity. It is worth millions, perhaps ultimately billions, of pounds. But behind the scenes, a fight for its soul is raging. At issue is more than the mere future of organic food. What happens now will determine nothing less than who controls the world's food supplies in the 21st century. Anyone who has stepped into a supermarket recently will be aware of the explosion in demand for organic food. Waitrose and Sainsbury's now stock more than 400 organic lines, and their rivals are making strenuous efforts to catch up, while organic restaurants, cafés, juice bars and greengrocers are springing up in urban high streets. At the moment, 70 per cent of organic produce is being imported: domestic farmers and growers can't keep up with demand, although, for the first time in history, more land is now in conversion (a process that takes about three years) than in production, and the Soil Association reckons that it receives 40 calls a day from farmers eager to make the switch. Even so, organic farming accounts for only one per cent of the UK total, as opposed to a European average of two-and-a-half, with a higher percentage in some countries. Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Finland and Switzerland aim to reach 10 per cent by the end of the year. Why is this happening? Fears over the use of toxic pesticides in conventional intensive agriculture, over the feeding of hormones and antibiotics to livestock, over the degrading of the environment and disappearing wildlife - along with a desire to be reacquainted with the concept of taste in store-bought food - had long ago combined to produce a slow but steady move towards organic farming. Then there was the BSE crisis and, this year, the scare over genetically modified crops: their effects on human health and the countryside are not fully understood, despite the fact that they are already at large in the food chain. GM is a response to the growing instability of conventional farming systems; specifically, to the increasing immunity of insects and bacteria to chemical pesticides and antibiotics, and the artificial fertilisers used in intensively farmed soils. At present, the only sure way to avoid them is to buy organic. For how long this continues to be the case remains to be seen. At this pivotal moment, we can be certain of nothing. So what is organic food? The short answer is that it depends on who you ask. The long answer will cost you sleep. There are currently seven different bodies licensed to certify food as organic in the UK, of which the Soil Association is one. They are empowered and overseen by the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards (UKROFS), which was established in 1987 to interpret and apply EU regulations on organic food. Where none existed, as in the case of livestock, it set its own. Thatcherism being in its full pomp at the time, the then agriculture minister, John Gummer, decided that if competition was good for buses, it was good for organic food standards. Thus, anyone can apply for a licence to certify organic food, and most UK agencies are run privately as commercial enterprises. The two oldest, the Biodynamic Agricultural Association and the Soil Association, are not, and their standards both exceed the UKROFS legal minimum in a number of significant ways. UKROFS decisions are made by an 'independent' board of academics, researchers and representatives of producer groups, retailers and accreditation agencies. Patrick Holden, of the Soil Association, has sat on the board since its inception. His aim has been to get the stricter principles he espouses adopted as the norm. Theoretically, UKROFS's regulations are rigorously policed. One inspector contacted for this article called the procedures 'a pain in the arse', and the Organic Café in London, one of only three fully accredited restaurants in the country, employs a full-time member of staff just to keep the necessary records. A closer look at this arrangement, however, reveals that members of the board are appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture. They are recommended to ministers by an 'independent panel' of civil servants. At this point, Holden's contention that 'the government is absolutely desperate for us to concede that a little bit of GM pollution is inevitable' starts alarm bells ringing. What is to stop ministers from gradually replacing organic hardliners with more pliant appointees? The current system for regulating organic food was developed during a period when there was little at stake and practitioners were often driven as much by belief as by profit. That is no longer so, and the pressure is being felt by those in a position of influence. Take the Soil Association and GM, for instance. 'If GM planting goes ahead, then most of the world's staple food crops will either be GM or polluted with GM by cross-pollination,' says Holden. 'The scale is unimaginable. It will change forever the relationship between farmers and nature and be a step towards the industrialisation of agriculture which will eclipse all others. It's irreversible. The Government is trying to pressure us by saying, \"You're being flat-Earthist about it. GM pollution is already with us,\" to which we reply, \"If GM pollution is already with us, you'd better tell the public.\" 'Jonathan Dimbleby [SA president] and Helen Browning [chair] and I had a fascinating meeting with the Government's chief scientific advisor, Sir Robert May, in which we asked how he could justify approving actions which will make it impossible for others to grow organic food. There is no answer to that.' A few weeks ago, the Soil Association revoked Captain Fred Barker's right to call his winter beans organic, on the basis that they were too close to an experimental crop of GM spring oil-seed rape he was growing in the next field for the German biotech company Agrevo. However, another certification agency, Organic Farmers and Growers Ltd, stepped in to issue their own rating. This was quite legal, and OFG chairman Charles Peers explains that, while his organisation sees no place for GM in organic agriculture, they considered it wrong for Barker's licence to be withdrawn retrospectively. Peers's organisation employs only four people, plus five part-time inspectors, and began as the marketing arm of the Soil Association before breaking away in 1975. Farmers issued certificates by them generally become members, and income derives mostly from membership fees. Peers is extraordinarily honest about his business. 'With us, the commercial side was always to the fore, rather than the socialistic, charity side,' he says. 'There are certain businesslike farmers who find it difficult to comprehend the angle that the Soil Association is coming from. We fill that gap. The Soil Association is more ethically oriented than we might be, which is not to say that we don't have regard for things like the environment...' But the Soil Association's concern is more principled? 'That's right, more principled.' Large-scale agribusinesses, biotech concerns and food processors, surprised by the growth in demand for organic products, have two options. First, they can challenge the claims made for the health, taste and environmental benefits of organic food, and for its capacity to produce sufficient quantities. This has become a fruitless exercise. Alternatively, they can try to colonise the enemy territory, massaging standards down until they may be met with relatively little threat to their existing production methods. This sounds like conspiracy theory until you look at what has happened in the United States, where an outcry over dairy farmers' use growth hormone in dairy herds circa 1994, combined with a lack of information about GM products on supermarket shelves, provoked a surge in organic demand similar to our own. Invited to propose some national standards, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) came up with a set which would have permitted GM ingredients, irradiation and certain drugs for livestock. It would have given the government legal ownership of the word 'organic' and outlawed the advertisement of products as 'exceeding government standards'. Meeting with widespread opposition, the USDA backed off, but is due to return soon. 'We're preparing for significant compromises as the government takes over this thing,' Ronnie Cummins of the Minnesota-based Organic Consumers Association says defiantly. 'What's happening is that people are developing a set of alternative national standards, and we will fight in the courts and the marketplace to make sure that, even after the government has its bogus USDA organic label, the real thing will still be out there. We may be legally prevented from using the word \"organic\" , but I think we're in a strong position because the customer base and retailers are pretty savvy. We have some great civil rights and legal people on our side. The only ones who want to compromise are the big corporate processors.' Is this all scaremongering? An EU proposal to allow pigs to be raised conventionally, then 'converted' to organic as weaners, suggests not. According to some, a tendency to conventionalise organics in line with the needs of big business is already on the horizon. Lawrence Woodward has been in organic farming for 26 years in Berkshire. Finding a dearth of information on the subject in the early days, he and his father-in-law David Astor established the Elm Farm Research Centre in 1980. Woodward also sits on the UKROFS board, although he may soon have to leave as a result of Nolan Committee limitations on the number of terms experts may serve in public bodies. He prefaces his testimony with the proviso that 'organic standards are an often uncomfortable balance between principle, what is technically possible, what farmers and consumers expect and, increasingly now, commercial pressure'. Then, he points to a series of recent controversies as evidence of 'tremendous danger'. These include the Soil Association's support for the use of sodium nitrite as a preservative in 'organic' bacon. 'I'm not alleging corruption, but the Soil Association included sodium nitrite in its standards very quickly and did not consider the information available in other countries [some research holds it to be a carcinogen]. This went on to the fast track because one of the supermarkets wanted to market bacon as organic. You don't need sodium nitrite in bacon. You only want it for an extended shelf life or if you have some obsession with food safety that originates in intensive farming.' Woodward then moves on to Elm Farm's recent finding that supermarket chains were washing ready-to-eat organic salad in sodium hypochlorite - otherwise known as chlorine, otherwise known as bleach - as they do conventional salads. After a fierce debate at UKROFS, the European Commission confirmed that it was contrary to their regulations. The multiples were given three months to find an alternative; the deadline was later extended to the end of this year. Robert Duxbury of Sainsbury's, a committed organics man of 16 years' standing, explains that sodium hypochlorite is used by parents to sterilise babies' bottles. Considered to be harmless, it 'reduces the microbe biological loading from pathogens that exist on soil and leaves'. Fair enough, except that alternatives are available, and he concurs with Woodward's assertion that the problem is not with the lettuce, but with the plastic packaging, which encourages bacteria to breed. This takes us to the heart of the problem, as Woodward sees it. About 40 processing aids are sanctioned by the EU regulations. Some, like vitamin C, he has no problem with. Other stabilisers and emulsifiers change the nature of the product. 'That's a direct result of the movement of the organic food industry, which is seeking to mimic the range of conventional products. Now, there is no way of producing the organic equivalent of a pre-cooked meal or a Mars bar unless you use the kinds of processing aids you find in conventional foods, or unless you accept a much shorter shelf life, which the supermarkets are not prepared to do. The danger is, and this is the way things appear to be going, that one day we will all wake up and find that we have an organic food industry that none of us recognise.' What can be done? 'It all depends on packaging and management of shelf and freezer space. What we need is the multiples to alter their buying and in-store management to organic food's strengths, and not just expect that management of conventional food can be applied to organic. So it's different temperatures, clearing out shelves more, using different packaging. They'll say that preservatives and stabilisers and emulsifiers are necessary for health and safety, but they actually have more to do with packaging and distribution. Change that, and the problem disappears.' It's not impossible. At present, we consumers might consider ourselves lucky to have so many committed experts looking out for our interests, and luckier still that so many of them have a voice. When a label says 'organic', we can be reasonably sure that it is and that the standards by which it has been so adjudged mean something. However, the mechanisms for ensuring that this stays that way are disturbingly vague, and this is something worth fighting to change, in the face of newly arrived vested interests. Just before his voice disappeared, as he headed off into the sunset, Patrick Holden allows himself a single flight of fancy. 'What's happened in the past 50 years, and especially in the past 30, is that we have picked apart the fabric and bio-diversity of our landscape and degraded it to such an extent that it will take a major reconstruction job, not just a bit of tinkering, to get it back,' he says. 'But it can be done, and probably quite quickly. We could see the return of mixed farming to the eastern counties, livestock coming back, more of a balance between cropping and grass - changes which will affect our whole culture, because those sorts of farming systems employ more labour, are more interesting visually, have lots of hidden benefits which we'll only notice when they come back...' He stops himself, as if realising something for the first time. 'I really think this can happen, you know.' It's an inspiring vision, and here's hoping we live to see it. Because if we don't, the probability is that no one will."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jun/28/1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-28T01:29:19Z","webTitle":"Iran challenges Saudis for top oil job Opec role candidate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jun/28/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jun/28/1","fields":{"headline":"Iran challenges Saudis for top oil job Opec role candidate","bodyText":"Iran said yesterday it will put up a candidate for the post of Opec secretary-general, unleashing a battle with powerhouse Saudi Arabia for the crucial post at the oil cartel. \"Iran has a candidate for the position of Opec secretary-general,\" an Iranian oil ministry source told Reuters agency. Oil industry sources said the candidate would probably be Iran's Opec governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, though oil ministry sources said it was not certain. Ardebili, a former Iranian ambassador to Japan, sought the job in 1994 but was defeated when Opec could not agree over the choice. Iran and Saudi Arabia - traditional Opec rivals - worked together to help secure global production cuts in March in order to boost flagging prices. A visit by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to Saudi Arabia in May underscored the efforts of the two regional powers to co-operate on oil. The secretary-general must be elected unanimously by the 11 Opec members. Saudi Arabia has nominated its own Opec governor, Sulaiman al-Herbish, to fill the position. Saudi analysts say the kingdom is trying to reinforce its already strong influence inside Opec and stabilise oil prices by filling the post with an official from the largest producer and exporter. Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment on the Iranian decision. Ardebili is a top adviser to Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh and a powerful player in Iran's vast energy industry.

Yacoub is a pioneer of heart-lung transplants. His latest leading-edge work is live lobe surgery, where a part of the lung is taken from living donors. He was recently made a Fellow of the prestigious Royal Society, and, as patron of the charity Chain of Hope, gives his time freely to operate on children in the developing world, who would otherwise be left to die. He operates every day of the week, long into the evenings and often at weekends, and Scott's own working pattern must be adapted to match this. Her day starts at 7am and she spends a couple of hours dealing with correspondence before the phone starts ringing and visitors arrive at the Heart Science Centre, built specifically at Harefield Hospital in Middlesex for Yacoub's research work. Yacoub spends two to three days at Harefield, dividing the rest of his week between the Royal Brompton and Wellington Hospitals. His administrative support consists of seven secretaries in total, including a PA at the Royal Brompton Hospital, two private secretaries at the Wellington Hospital, a clinical secretary, a part-time secretary who works from home and a retired woman who helps with his private affairs. \"But Harefield is his kingdom,\" says Scott. Through the window is the helipad where donor organs arrive by air to be rushed into the theatre. Scott liaises closely with the Brompton PA. \"We share the typing of his scientific papers and email them back and forth until he has completed them.\" Scott has also taught herself to prepare slides from 35mm film, to avoid the last-minute panic of running to a developing service. She transcribes his scribbled notes onto Powerpoint, then uses processing facilities at Harefield to convert these into film. Yacoub uses the slides when he gives his frequent presentations overseas. The hectic pace of Yacoub's professional life often results in panic, and is exacerbated by his tendency to leave things until the last minute. \"The worst moment was a call for forgotten slides at 6.25pm when he was catching the 7pm Concorde for a meeting in the States,\" says Scott. \"I sped off to Heathrow but couldn't find him until he ran out in front of my car. I thrust the slides through the window, he grabbed them and ran back through the traffic into the terminal with seconds to spare.\" Scott arrived at Harefield 12 years ago when she stood in for a secretary on leave. She hadn't done any medical secretarial work before, so bought a medical dictionary and ended up in the position permanently. In the early days, she says, she \"absolutely loved it\" but wouldn't have applied if she'd seen the job advertised because the responsibility was so huge. Patients from all over the world would wait until 11pm to see Yacoub, and Scott would stay on to take dictation. She was also responsible for filling in forms to ensure that patients underwent the necessary investigations - chest X-rays, ECGs and blood tests - and that Yacoub had the results to hand when he saw the patients. \"He will lose a stethoscope if you leave it with him, so I had to hang on to everything and hand it to him when he was ready to use it,\" she explains. Six years ago, when Yacoub started to become seriously involved in research, Scott was promoted to PA. The job demands a lot of patience, a sense of humour and the ability to make decisions quickly: \"Patients and their relatives call just needing someone to listen to them,\" says Scott. \"They may say they're fine to the professor but afterwards they ring to discuss their anxieties.\" If Scott wants to discuss any worries with Yacoub, she has to run round to the theatre and catch him between operations. Her small office, where every spare inch is piled high with files, has become an unofficial counselling room, and Dr Adrian Chester, a member of Yacoub's research team, has dubbed her \"St Jacqui of Harefield\". Scott's concern for others' welfare even extends to Yacoub's family: \"He is so driven that all appointments slip his mind. I send copies of social invitations to his wife so that she has some warning, otherwise he'll remember to ring her just an hour before the event.\" In spite of the stress of the job, she maintains that working with Yacoub is inspirational. He is a highly dedicated and charismatic employer, who exists on little sleep but, in turn, expects a great deal from his team. \"Working here is a challenge. Although it's sad when you lose patients, you also see very sick people recover and start to live again.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/1999/jun/28/guardianobituaries","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-28T01:31:50Z","webTitle":"Lord Robens of Woldingham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jun/28/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/jun/28/guardianobituaries","fields":{"headline":"Lord Robens of Woldingham","bodyText":"Lord Robens of Woldingham - 'Alf' Robens - who has died aged 88, was the classic Mr Might-Have-Been Man. He might easily have become leader of the Labour party and, in 1964, prime minister instead of Harold Wilson. The late George Brown was quite convinced of that - and he held to it until his death. He persistently told me: \"Had Robens stayed in the parliamentary party there is little chance that Harold Wilson would ever have been prime minister.\" Whatever Brown's motives, it was an opinion shared, certainly in later life, by Alf Robens himself, though he was careful not to offer it in public. Not that Robens had anything but a remarkable and successful, not to say lucrative, career as an industrialist. It was a prime example of rags-to-riches; the elementary schoolboy from a poor Manchester home, very working class, starting as a messenger boy in the local Co-op, doing a stint as an umbrella salesman, and then becoming a full-time official of the shop workers' union, Usdaw, in 1935, the union that always had a close connection with the Co-operative movement. No-one could have had a better Old Labour pedigree. That very background seemed to help Robens develop a forceful, thrusting, ambitious self-confidence a contemporary once described to me in glowing terms. \"We always recognised something special in Alf even as a young union official. If he met someone new, he would always make a note of their personal details in his notebook; the names of their wives, children, etc, in case he met them again. He had that kind of organised mind even as a young official.\" Robens was medically unfit for war service, and that gave him the opportunity to enter politics, on Manchester city council from 1941 to 1945, when he became Labour MP for Wansbeck (Northumberland). That constituency disappeared in 1950 and Robens became MP for neighbouring Blyth, where he remained until he became chairman of the National Coal Board (NCB) at the end of 1960. In the 15 years he sat in parliament he had a number of junior ministerial roles; at transport, then at the old ministry of fuel and power, where he served with Hugh Gaitksell, until in April 1951 he was promoted into the At tlee cabinet as minister of labour to succeed Aneurin Bevan. It was only a brief spell - the Attlee government fell in October 1951 - yet Robens made his mark with considerable diplomatic skill in handling a period of tense industrial relations. In the years that followed the fall of the Attlee government and the election of Gaitskell to the Labour leadership, Robens was always associated with the Gaitskell camp against the Bevanite rebellion on the left. He was close to Gaitskell both personally and politically. Yet he shrewdly never closed the door on his contacts with the left, and in the mid-1950s - when the clash between Bevan and Gaitskell was at its height - Robens, in the shadow cabinet, voted against withdrawing the party whip from Bevan. He was in a minority of nine votes to four. Then came the great turning point in Robens's career - the 1959 general election with Gaitskell's Labour party defeated by a huge swing to Harold Macmillan's Tories. Robens was despondent at the prospect of a long period in opposition; he was approaching 50, and although shadow foreign secretary, the defeat had a profound effect on his outlook. Macmillan brilliantly timed his invitation to Robens to become NCB chairman. It all began with a casual talk between Robens and 'Rab' Butler in May 1960. Butler called Robens into his room and said: \"The prime minister has asked me to discover whether, if you were offered the chairmanship of the coal board, you would accept it?\" Robens was taken aback. He asked for time and then saw Macmillan. He talked, privately, to Gaitskell, who was equally shocked but said he wouldn't stand in Robens's way - though Gaitskell hoped he would return to parliament if Labour won the next election. So Robens accepted Macmillan's offer at a meeting in No 10, suggesting to the prime minister that, given the state of NCB finances, it would be next to impossible ever to make a genuine profit. Macmillan looked at him through drooping eyelids. \"Don't worry, dear boy; just blur the edges... just blur the edges.\" So Robens took over Britain's coal industry in October 1960 for his Ten-Year Stint (the title of his own 1972 book). It was his 10 years at the NCB that have left their imprint on the nation, the industry (even allowing for its virtual disappearance), and on his reputation. No nationalised industry has experienced as much trauma as coal; perhaps no other industry in the country, publicly or privately owned, has so much dramatic luggage in its history bag. No wonder Macmillan advised \"blurring the edges\". He knew what an exceptionally difficult task Robens was taking on. Far greater than Robens himself realised. When he took over at Hobart House, the NCB's London headquarters, there were 698 pits employing 583,000 miners. Ten years later, when Robens left, there were 292 pits employing only 283,000. The coal revolution, and downward spiral, was well under way. What Robens inherited in 1960 was not merely an industry, it was a social and political culture. And though the industry had been nationalised for more than 13 years, it was still living through a good deal of its bitter inheritance. Unofficial strikes were still the norm in many coalfields, most notably in South Yorkshire where the Communist party had great influence. Much of the trouble was due to the endless disputes about the chaotic system of piece-rate payments endemic to the old wages' practices under private ownership. But overshadowing even these severe difficulties was the market situation in which coal was steadily being priced out by oil. North Sea gas had yet to come. Robens tackled all these battlefronts with energy and courage. He established a punishing schedule of pit visits - roughly one pit visit a fortnight - which he maintained throughout his 10 years. He reckoned to have visited 350 pits in that period. He persuaded the Macmillan government to provide the industry with a measure of protection by tax concessions and import restrictions. In particular, he succeeded in holding on to the coal industry's key customer - the power stations - and received government help to do so. He also had a remarkable stroke of luck from the National Union of Mineworkers. Shortly before he took over, the NUM had elected a new general secretary, Will Paynter , leader of the South Wales miners and a veteran communist of Spanish civil war vintage. Quite quickly - and unexpectedly - Robens and Paynter established a working alliance, and eventually a mutual trust, which without doubt laid the basis for a reformed and revitalised - if smaller - coal industry. It was only with the help of Paynter that the NCB succeeded in introducing a more rational and equitable pay structure, which, in turn, significantly reduced the number of disputes. Paynter paid a high political price for his cooperation with Robens. He came under constant criticism from his CP comrades, but he stuck to his guns since he had become convinced that the only way to save the industry - and sustain it within the public sector - was to help modernise and, however reluctantly, accept the closure of exhausted collieries. There is little doubt that the Robens-Paynter alliance saved the coal industry until the combination of Margaret Thatcher and Arthur Scargill finally closed the shop. While Paynter was persuading the NUM to face realities, Robens was in constant session with ministers and Whitehall civil servants, lobbying for the industry's salvation. Curiously, he found it easier to do this under Macmillan's (and later Home's) Tory government than with Harold Wilson's Labour administration. He was perpetually at war with Whitehall during the Wilson period, and became convinced that if senior civil servants in the treasury and department of energy had their way most of the coal industry would disappear. He was right, but it remained for Thatcher and Scargill to produce the punchline. Perhaps the outstanding feature of Robens's fight to sustain a smaller coal industry was his moderate success in persuading governments of both parties to adopt what he called \"a social policy\" to cushion the pit closures he was compelled to make. He demanded that both national and local government should combine to ensure that new industries and investment moved into the declining coalfields. This, too, brought him into regular conflict with Whitehall and a succession of Labour ministers, many of whom he despised - and made no bones about it, either. When the Aberfan disaster came on Friday, October 21, 1966, killing 116 children and 28 adults after colliery waste slid down a mountain to engulf Pantglas school, the knives were out for Robens's scalp. His immediate behaviour did not help. Instead of going direct to Aberfan, which everyone expected of him, he kept an appointment to be installed as chancellor of Surrey University . He went to Aberfan the following day. It was a grave error of judgment for which he was never forgiven. His critics inside the Wilson cabinet, and elsewhere, wanted his resignation, and when the Aberfan tribunal of inquiry, under Lord Justice Edmund Davies, reported in July 1967, the demands became more widespread. The tribunal report found the coal board culpable of neglect and, by definition, responsible for the Aberfan tragedy. Robens offered his resignation in a letter to the then minister of power, Richard Marsh. In September, Wilson and Marsh rejected Robens's offer though several cabinet ministers argued strongly that he should go. Robens himself believed that the tribunal report - and the manner of the inquiry - were seriously flawed and unfair to the coal board. Yet he was ready to quit. What, in the end, was particularly significant was the decision of the NUM to urge him to stay on. Yet to this day, the shadow, if not the shame, of Aberfan still hangs over his reputation. That is unfair - but irremovable. Without doubt the Aberfan disaster played an important part in Robens's ultimate decision not to accept a third five-year term as coal board chairman. It was certainly offered to him when the Conservatives won the 1970 election. The Heath government wanted him to stay, but he declined, although he did agree to carry on for an extra six months into 1971 before handing over to Derek Ezra. Perhaps an inner intuition warned him about the dangerous, even disastrous, years ahead, though the industry did enjoy a modest recovery in the early 1970s. Robens had been a supreme chairman - virtually an emperor of this once great nationalised industry, which he liked to run at times like a feudal kingdom. A member of his board still argues that \"there was simply no-one like him in either public or private sectors of industry; at his peak he reigned like a king.\" From then on all seemed a little like anti-climax. He was still recognised as \"the voice of industrial common sense\" on television and radio; he became chairman of Vickers Ltd, and of Johnson Matthey Ltd, as well as a director of Trust House Forte and a string of others. He had earlier been a director of the Bank of England, and Times Newspapers Ltd, and was an original member of the National Economic Development Council from 1962. He sat on the royal commission on trade unions and employers (1965-68), where he advocated tough new legislation to curb unofficial strikes and secondary picketing.

He might easily have become leader of the Labour party and, in 1964, prime minister instead of Harold Wilson. Instead, he had a remarkable and successful, not to say lucrative, career as an industrialist. It was a prime example of rags-to-riches; the elementary schoolboy from a poor Manchester home, very working class, starting as a messenger boy in the local Co-op, doing a stint as an umbrella salesman, and then becoming a full-time official of the shop workers' union, Usdaw, in 1935. No-one could have had a better Old Labour pedigree. That very background seemed to help Robens develop a forceful, thrusting, ambitious self-confidence a contemporary once described to me in glowing terms. \"We always recognised something special in Alf even as a young union official. If he met someone new, he would always make a note of their personal details in his notebook; the names of their wives, children, etc, in case he met them again. He had that kind of organised mind even as a young official.\" Robens was medically unfit for war service, and that gave him the opportunity to enter politics, on Manchester city council from 1941 to 1945, when he became Labour MP for Wansbeck (Northumberland). That constituency disappeared in 1950 and Robens became MP for neighbouring Blyth, where he remained until he became chairman of the National Coal Board (NCB) at the end of 1960. In the 15 years he sat in parliament he had a number of junior ministerial roles; at transport, then at the old ministry of fuel and power, where he served with Hugh Gaitksell, until in April 1951 he was promoted into the Attlee cabinet as minister of labour to succeed Aneurin Bevan. It was only a brief spell - the Attlee government fell in October 1951 - yet Robens made his mark with considerable diplomatic skill in handling a period of tense industrial relations. In the years that followed Robens was always associated with the Gaitskell camp against the Bevanite rebel lion on the left. He was close to Gaitskell personally and politically. Yet he shrewdly never closed the door on his contacts with the left, and in the mid-1950s - when the clash between Bevan and Gaitskell was at its height - Robens, in the shadow cabinet, voted against withdrawing the party whip from Bevan. He was in a minority of nine votes to four. Then came the great turning point in Robens's career - the 1959 general election with Labour defeated by a huge swing to Harold Macmillan's Tories. Robens was despondent at the prospect of a long period in opposition; he was approaching 50, and although shadow foreign secretary, the defeat had a profound effect on his outlook. Macmillan brilliantly timed his invitation to Robens to become NCB chairman. Robens was taken aback. He suggested to the prime minister that, given the state of NCB finances, it would be next to impossible ever to make a genuine profit. \"Don't worry, dear boy,\" Macmillan replied. \"Just blur the edges... just blur the edges.\" So Robens took over Britain's coal industry in October 1960 for his Ten-Year Stint (the title of his own 1972 book). It was his 10 years at the NCB that have left their imprint on the nation, the industry (even allowing for its virtual disappearance), and on his reputation. No nationalised industry has experienced as much trauma as coal; perhaps no other industry in the country, publicly or privately owned, has so much dramatic luggage in its history bag. No wonder Macmillan advised \"blurring the edges\". When Robens took over at Hobart House, the NCB's London headquarters, there were 698 pits employing 583,000 miners. Ten years later, when Robens left, there were 292 pits employing only 283,000. What Robens inherited was not merely an industry, it was a social and political culture. And though the industry had been nationalised for more than 13 years, it was still living through a good deal of its bitter inheritance; unofficial strikes were still the norm. Much of the trouble was due to the endless disputes about the chaotic system of piece-rate payments endemic to the old wages' practices under private ownership. Then there was the market situation in which coal was steadily being priced out by oil. Robens tackled all these battlefronts with energy and courage. He established a punishing schedule of pit visits - roughly one pit visit a fortnight - which he maintained throughout his 10 years. He reckoned to have visited 350 pits in that period. He persuaded the Macmillan government to provide the industry with a measure of protection by tax concessions and import restrictions. In particular, he succeeded in holding on to the coal industry's key customer - the power stations - and received government help to do so. He also had a remarkable stroke of luck from the National Union of Mineworkers. Shortly before he took over, the NUM had elected a new general secretary, Will Paynter, leader of the South Wales miners and a veteran communist of Spanish civil war vintage. Quite quickly - and unexpectedly - Robens and Paynter established a working alliance, and eventually a mutual trust, which without doubt laid the basis for a reformed and revitalised - if smaller - coal industry. It was only with the help of Paynter that the NCB succeeded in introducing a more rational and equitable pay structure, which, in turn, significantly reduced the number of disputes. Paynter came under constant criticism from his CP comrades, but he stuck to his guns, convinced that the only way to save the coal industry - and sustain it within the public sector - was to help modernise and, however reluctantly, accept the closure of exhausted collieries. There is little doubt that the Robens-Paynter alliance saved the industry until the combination of Margaret Thatcher and Arthur Scargill finally closed the shop. While Paynter was persuading the NUM to face realities, Robens was in constant session with ministers and civil servants, lobbying for the industry's salvation. Curiously, he found it easier to do this under Macmillan's (and later Home's) Tory government than with Harold Wilson's Labour administration. He was perpetually at war with Whitehall during the Wilson period, and became convinced that if senior civil servants in the treasury and department of energy had their way most of the coal industry would disappear. He was right. Perhaps the outstanding feature of Robens's fight to sustain a smaller coal industry was his moderate success in persuading governments of both parties to adopt what he called \"a social policy\" to cushion the pit closures he was compelled to make. He demanded that national and local government combine to ensure that new industries and investment moved into the declining coalfields. This, too, brought him into regular conflict with Whitehall and a succession of Labour ministers, many of whom he despised. When the Aberfan disaster came on October 21, 1966, killing 116 children and 28 adults after colliery waste slid down a mountain to engulf Pantglas school, the knives were out for Robens's scalp. His immediate behaviour did not help. Instead of going direct to Aberfan, he kept an appointment to be installed as chancellor of Surrey University . He only went to Aberfan the following day - a grave error of judgment for which he was never forgiven. His critics wanted his resignation, and when the Aberfan tribunal of inquiry reported in July 1967, the demands became more widespread. The tribunal report found the coal board culpable of neglect and, by definition, responsible for the Aberfan tragedy. Robens offered his resignation in a letter to the then minister of power, Richard Marsh. In September, Wilson and Marsh rejected Robens's offer though several cabinet ministers argued strongly that he should go. Robens himself believed that the tribunal report was seriously flawed and unfair to the coal board. Yet he was ready to quit. What, in the end, was particularly significant was the decision of the NUM to urge him to stay on. Without doubt the Aberfan disaster played an important part in Robens's ultimate decision not to accept a third five-year term as coal board chairman. It was certainly offered when Edward Heath's Conservatives won the 1970 election. Perhaps an inner intuition warned him about the dangerous, even disastrous, years ahead, though the industry did enjoy a modest recovery in the early 1970s. Robens had been a supreme chairman - virtually an emperor of this once great nationalised industry, which he liked to run at times like a feudal kingdom. A member of his board still argues that \"there was simply no-one like him in either public or private sectors of industry; at his peak he reigned like a king.\" From then on all seemed a little like anti-climax. He was still recognised as \"the voice of industrial common sense\" on television and radio; he became chairman of Vickers Ltd, and of Johnson Matthey Ltd, as well as a director of Trust House Forte and a string of others. He had earlier been a director of the Bank of England, and Times Newspapers Ltd, and was an original member of the National Economic Development Council from 1962. He sat on the royal commission on trade unions and employers (1965-68), where he advocated tough new legislation to curb unofficial strikes and secondary picketing. He held honorary degrees at numerous universities and he was a governor - one-time chairman of governors - at Guy's hospital, where a Robens' Suite is named in his honour. Almost to the end, his advice was still sought. Alf Robens was one of those remarkable products from the legendary generation of Labour and trade union talent, largely untutored, who scaled the heights, loved the glamour and successes, yet did not forget their roots.

The second world war was certainly not fought to save the Jews. Indeed their plight was played down by the Allies. Neither during nor after that war were human rights high on any political agenda. Yet we have in recent weeks been led to believe that since the Holocaust ethnic cleansing in Europe had become intolerable. Not so. Few remember that the defeated Germans were given a bitter taste of their own medicine. The years 1945-47 saw on a grand scale what we have seen in Kosovo - though the term ethnic cleansing had not been invented. There was no law to impede it. Human Rights Conventions are of more recent date. At the Potsdam Conference, with Stalin, Truman and Attlee around a table, the map of central Europe was redrawn. The United States and the United Kingdom bowed to Stalin's demand to annex almost one-third of Poland. In turn Poland got the eastern provinces of Germany, Silesia, Eastern Pomerania and two-thirds of East Prussia. The remaining third, with the historic German city of Konigsberg - today's Kaliningrad - became part of the Soviet Union. In one of the century's most bitter winters, most of the German population of these provinces as well as the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia, somewhere between 10m and 12m people, were driven out of their towns and villages. Of these, at least 2m died on the freezing trek to Germany's four allied occupation zones. In the British-occupied Ruhr, its industries laid waste, children were starving, and thousands of homes had been destroyed. In these pitiable conditions Germany had to absorb some 8m displaced fellow Germans. All this made no headlines. Television as we know it now did not exist. With Nazi atrocities fresh in everyone's mind, there was little pity for these German victims. Was not the only good German a dead German? An exception to this \"serves them right\" attitude was the Jewish publisher Victor Gollancz, who did all he could to make Britain aware of the misery of defeated Germany. Very few were prepared to champion the universality of human rights. For more than a generation the German expellees' organisations campaigned for the right to return to their homes. They and their children formed a significant part of the German electorate. Instead of giving way to this pressure, Chancellor Willy Brandt went to Warsaw, knelt in penitence at the monument to the victims of Nazi terror, and negotiated a treaty that guaranteed Poland's western frontier. The German churches, in a historic document, had prepared the ground for this act of renunciation. With a dignified sense of reality, any claim on this historic German soil was publicly abandoned. Since German unification a decade ago, that has been solemnly reaffirmed. While no Polish leader has yet found it possible to express any degree of remorse, President Vaclav Havel's recent brave apology for the cruel way in which the Sudeten Germans had been driven out, has made an important contribution to German-Czech reconciliation. Ethnic cleansing is now rightly recognised as a crime justifying foreign intervention. How to intervene without making matters worse is still far from clear. America and Britain, prepared to go to war to punish a delinquent Serbia, might pause to remember that within living memory they signed up to a post-war settlement that led to ethnic cleansing on a huge scale, and lived at ease with the consequences. Germans, still burdened by the incomparable guilt of their Nazi past, were in no position to seek any kind of redress. But, in the words of Coventry Cathedral's litany of reconciliation, a cathedral destroyed by German bombs, \"all have sinned and fallen short...\" It was always so, and is today. To admit it publicly would help to affirm our ever-threatened moral values. Those values are undermined by Britain's extreme reluctance to accept significant numbers of refugees and by its habitually unjust treatment of many asylum seekers. In contrast, Germany, over the past quarter-century, has taken in more refugees than the rest of Europe put together and absorbed them without major social upheaval - first, I suggest, to assuage the guilt of the Nazi past and second because a large number of Germans know from personal experience what it means to be driven out of their homes. They know too what living in a police state is like. There was no one to admonish the Allies in 1945. To win a war militarily is sometimes easier than to win it morally. It may be wise on several counts, as more Balkan atrocities come to light, not to judge the Serbs too self-righteously. • Rev Dr Paul Oestreicher, a former chairman of Amnesty International UK, is international consultant to Coventry Cathedral.

Just days after the far more ostentatious house of Windsor proudly announced it had shaved £5m off its expenditure last year, the egalitarian Dutch are wondering exactly how loaded their queen and her family really are. Beatrix's father, Prince Bernhard, answered in his own fashion on his 88th birthday yesterday. He does not find walking particularly easy these days, which might explain why he gave himself not a bicycle but an olive-green Ferrari 456m GT capable of 200mph and worth about £200,000. The famously thrifty Dutch do not usually make a fuss about the prince's eccentricities, but taken in tandem with the Forbes revelations such behaviour is beginning seriously to test people's indulgence of the house of Orange-Nassau Forbes's stab at estimating Queen Beatrix's worth has not only produced a figure far greater than anyone suspected, but the magazine says that the Dutch monarch's fortune is cloaked in such secrecy that a reliable calculation has been made impossible. \"Of course it's a scandal,\" said one newspaper commentator, Cees Huybregt. \"I think many Dutch people would not mind the queen being wealthy. But there is something wrong about such remarkable wealth when no one knows exactly what it amounts to or where it is hidden away.\" Forbes's annual rich list ranked Queen Bee, as she is affectionately known, behind the Sultan of Brunei, four Arab potentates and just after President Saddam Hussein of Iraq among the world's wealthiest queens, kings and dictators. Her £25bn fortune is substantially more than that of Elizabeth II once the Royal Collection, held in trust for the British nation, is discounted. Not everyone is sure the magazine has done its homework properly. \"Beatrix's wealth is one of the best kept secrets of the kingdom,\" said Maurits Kikkert, an expert on the royal family, in part because she does not pay taxes and therefore does not have to reveal her wealth. \"Every paper that has tried to work it out has come up against a brick wall,\" said Mr Kikkert. But Philip Droege, author of a recently published book investigating Beatrix's finances, believes Forbes may be close to the mark. \"The basic problem is that she divides and diversifies her investments through countless funds and investment vehicles,\" he said. \"She's very, very clever at making sure no one can trace her money.\" Officially, the queen's fortune is managed by a treasurer and three assistants at her Huis Ten Bosch palace in the Hague. But Mr Droege claims to have discovered that much of the money is in the hands of an umbrella foundation sitting atop up to a dozen smaller funds, and that the merchant banks Mees Pierson, Salomon Brothers and Lehman Brothers are entrusted with Queen Beatrix's investments. Vast tracts of land and spectacular art collections are not behind this fortune, Mr Droege says - although the family has several chateaux and villas in the Netherlands and Italy, and a number of property investments in the United States. Queen Beatrix, 61 and a politics graduate, is rather a capitalist royal, with major stock holdings in Amsterdam, London, New York and Geneva. A rumoured stake of 3.5% in the huge Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell - worth an estimated £2.2bn - is reported to underpin her fortune, supplemented by holdings in Esso, the Dutch airline KLM and the big Dutch bank ABN AMRO, Mr Droege believes. Inside the palace counting-houses Queen Elizabeth of Britain heads the most ostentatious of Europe's monarchies. But once the £10bn Royal Collection is taken out of the financial equation - being held \"in trust for the nation\" and including the crown jewels - the Queen's estimated fortune of about £280m is dwarfed by that of her Dutch counterpart. King Harald of Norway is a modest Scandinavian royal, with an annual state salary of £1.9m, on which he pays tax. His personal fortune, inherited from his father, King Olav, is estimated at about £160m - mostly in property in Britain. Queen Margrethe of Denmarkholds open house at Christianborg palace in Copenhagen - any Dane can ask to see her or one of her family. Her annual salary of £3m helps maintain the palace; she has a private fortune put at £9m. Her husband Prince Hendrik went on strike in 1985, refusing civic duties till the government gave him pocket money. King Juan Carlos of Spain is estimated to cost the Spanish state some 5m a year. Heading a monarchy reinstated only in 1975 after the Franco era, the king has negligible assets. He uses the main palace for official occasions only and lives at a modest hunting lodge outside Madrid. King Carl Gustaf of Sweden is another low-key royal whose two palaces are state-owned and whose personal fortune, mostly in property, is estimated at £6m. His annual state stipend to run his affairs is £2m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/jul/03/books.guardianreview9","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-03T01:26:54Z","webTitle":"The hard man of peace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/03/books.guardianreview9","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/jul/03/books.guardianreview9","fields":{"headline":"The hard man of peace","bodyText":"They call it the Gay Wedding in Northern Ireland, and they will remember it tomorrow in Portadown, citadel of sectarianism. To rousing cheers, Ian Paisley and David Trimble skipped hand in hand up to Carlton Orange Hall in the town, grinning manically. Paisley, Unionism's strongest personality for 30 years, took second billing to the local MP, a bespectacled figure strutting camply at his side. It was July 1995, and the first of the battles over the Orange Order's right to march down the nationalist Garvaghy Road from Drumcree Church of Ascension. This was a defining moment for Trimble, then MP for Upper Bann for just five years. His fellow Orangemen struck a special memento for the bookish former Queen's University law lecturer, but managed to get the spelling wrong, and the medal refers to the Seige of Drumcree. Trimble's heroic deed was to help get them through police lines after the Portadown Number One Lodge was refused permission to walk the Garvaghy Road for the first time since the Orange Order began parading to and from its annual religious service in 1807. The RUC, unthinkably, lined up against the Protestant marchers. The dispute, as it will be tomorrow and has been ever since, was about more than an Orange walk. It was a litmus test for who was winning in Northern Ireland, nationalists or unionists, and the Orangemen refused to disperse. Trimble told them: \"Orangemen have marched along that road for 188 years, so abandoning it is not something that is going to be done lightly. We are not going back the way we came.\" Nor did they. A deal, brokered with Trimble's involvement, was struck with the Catholic residents, and the marchers proceeded in silence. The triumphalist dance at the march's end infuriated nationalists, explaining their more hardline attitudes now. Trimble's gleeful participation came as little surprise. He was seen as a resolute hardliner: able, certainly; bending, never. He had, after all, been involved in organising the loyalist workers' strike of 1974, which brought down the last attempt at power-sharing in Northern Ireland. He was a leading figure in Vanguard, an extreme unionist outfit, and a zealous opponent of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Just a few months before he was elected to Parliament in 1990, he abused Charles Haughey, the Irish Taoiseach, from the roof of the Ulster Unionist Party HQ in Belfast. Haughey's offence was to venture onto United Kingdom soil. Trimble was seen by nationalists as bad-tempered, irascible; a unionist with the typical Not An Inch mentality, an Orangeman; in short, a bigot. When he was chairman of the Ulster Society in 1987 he wrote the acknowledgements to a collection of Orange songs, most of them virulently anti Catholic. Included was William Johnston Of Ballykilbeg, whose first stanza begins: All Fenian rascals I love them so well I could see every scoundrel well roasted in Hell. Another inclusion was Bangor And No Surrender, which has these lines: Let craven hearts to tyranny Their craven homage render; The watchword of the brave and free Will still be \"No Surrender!\" That he was thought to have few apparent social skills only added to the contempt which was felt for him in most liberal circles. Just after Drumcree I, James Molyneaux decided to quit as leader of the UUP on his 75th birthday. The MPs Ken Maginnis, Willie Ross and Martin Smyth all declared, but the bookmakers' choice was ex Stormont minister John Taylor. He was a tough operator who had survived a murder attempt by the Official IRA in 1972. Trimble, who shared an office with Taylor at Westminster, entered the race a week before the 800-strong Ulster Unionist Council was due to vote. Journalists just about managed to hold in check derisive smirks at the press conference launching Trimble's candidature. But he had told his wife, Daphne, he would win, and he did, with ease. Only hours before his victory, he had been presented with that Drumcree medal, and there was no doubt that the conservative council had gone for the most hardline option. The portents for the fledgling peace process looked poor. They were aghast at a meeting of the British-Irish Association, an academic talking shop, as they gathered around the television. David Adams, of the Ulster Democratic Party, recalls: \"I was like many there. I thought it was the end for reasonable unionism.\" David McKittrick, Ireland correspondent of the Independent, called Trimble the leader no-one wanted. He said he had come to power on a hardline ticket, and that his 25 years in politics had left no real indication that he had a vision beyond Unionism and Orangeism. In an otherwise damning leader, The Irish Independent said: \"Perhaps the most positive thing that can be said about this election is that many politicians have shown themselves capable of growing into office and of reaching compromises that would have appeared impossible in their early years.\" Within 30 months, Trimble had done just that, pulling his reluctant party into the Good Friday Agreement, which underpinned the principle of consent but also promised republicans a full role in government. He talked of pluralist government for a pluralist people, and he walked off with the Nobel Peace Prize last year with John Hume, the SDLP leader. He had turned his back on a previous ambition of a single united unionist party, facing down Paisley and UK Unionist leader Bob McCartney, in the May 1998 referendum on the agreement. Trimble has struggled with pressure on all fronts, from Sinn Fein to his own treacherous ranks, and still he has ploughed on. He will miss Drumcree tomorrow. He is no longer welcome. Orangemen there now see their one-time champion as a traitor. He has even been accused of being an MI5 agent. They reacted angrily when Trimble attended the funeral last August of three young boys killed in the Real IRA's bombing of Omagh. It meant him attending a Catholic service, anathema to hardliners. There was fury too when he met the Pope in April, as one of 54 Nobel peace-prize laureates, and, while hardly at ease, his gesture was seen as something of a watershed. One woman said: \"The loyalist people of this town and Drumcree put David Trimble into office. Now he has turned his back on us. That's a fatal mistake. This town and Drumcree will now destroy Trimble.\" It is a long way from holding hands in an Orange sash with Ian Paisley at Portadown to shaking them with Irish president Mary McAleese at the funeral mass of three Catholic boys in County Donegal. Further still to greet the Pope in the Vatican. William David Trimble was born in October 1944 and was brought up in Bangor on County Down's overwhelmingly Protestant Gold Coast. His father, Billy, was upper working-class, a junior civil servant in the ministry of defence and an avid reader of the Daily Mail. His mother, Ivy, was well-to-do, though the family's building business had gone bust. One friend remembers her as a snob. Trimble has an older brother, formerly in the RAF, and a younger sister, who is the spitting image of him. They were in Oslo last December when he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Trimble went to Bangor Grammar School and confesses to having had a rebellious streak. His father was keen for him to have a steady job, and so he too became a civil servant, joining the department of finance at the Land Registry in 1964 and discovering he could go to Queen's University and remain on salary. He had joined the Orange Order in Bangor at 17. But his forays into formal politics were to come much later. Herb Wallace, a work colleague at the Land Registry, says: \"He was a very serious fellow. He didn't find it easy to fit in with the general banter and messing about. But he still wanted to be one of the gang. It wasn't as if he tried to cut himself off.\" He shunned trendy fashion, preferring a sports jacket and flannels, but he loved music. His favourite single then was My Guy by Mary Wells, and his obsession was Elvis Presley. He was recently to be found in animated discussion arguing that The King's Blue Suede Shoes was far superior to Carl Perkins's effort. The Air Training Corps attracted him and he joined to fly gliders. Never much good at sport, he nevertheless turned out for a while for Jordanstown's third 15 at rugby and later became fascinated with American football when Channel 4 screened it in the mid-80s. Wallace, who studied law with Trimble at Queen's and later became a lecturer alongside him, says: \"He enjoyed a drink, though as one friend said, he was never the captain-of-the-rugby-club type. There were several times when we all drank too much, and he was never one to be the first to leave any party.\" Trimble was often the butt of his colleagues' practical jokes, which he bore with good humour, partly because he knew that if he reacted angrily he would get more stick. They once fixed a paper lantern to his coat, and he unwittingly walked about with it stuck there all day, much to their mirth. At the office Christmas party that night, he began a relationship with colleague Heather McComb, who was to become his first wife. As well as working in the Land Registry, she was a Greenfinch reservist in the Ulster Defence Regiment. They married in 1968 and were together for about three years. At Queen's, Trimble's tutors told him he had a good chance of a first-class honours degree, but would have to devote himself full-time to his studies. He took leave of absence, and secured his first. His father was then seriously ill with lung cancer and is believed to have died after Trimble's exams and before graduation. Trimble was called to the bar in 1969, but always preferred academic life to the cut and thrust of the court-room, something which UK Unionist leader Robert McCartney, a pugnacious QC, delights in rubbing home. The future first minister of Northern Ireland became a fixture at Queen's University, specialising in equity law, which was made for his pedantic approach. Students recall him at best as a thorough but uninspiring lecturer who kept everything he needed to know about his subject in a yellow lever-arch file, packed with his tight, handwritten notes. One student, now a barrister, says: \"He had no personal skills whatsoever. He was terrible, really boring. There was never any inter-action, and he never came to any social occasions. His tutorials were regimented. He would start on his left and work through to the right, so you knew just where to sit to avoid work.\" One habit infuriated nationalist students, who increased in numbers during his time at Queen's - if they had a Gaelic name, he would insist on the English equivalent. But he went to Long Kesh, now the Maze Prison, on several occasions to teach a Catholic student of his who had been interned there. He told friends that he found it an interesting experience. He was acting director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies for a time, but failed to land the job which went to Mary McAleese, one of his ex-students, a Catholic from north Belfast, and now President of Ireland. He is said by colleagues to have been furious. By 1990 his career was going nowhere. He published a couple of books, but was never fully committed to research, the key to academic success. His political ambitions were blunted too. Molyneaux disliked him. He had failed to become the UUP candidate in the European election the previous year when John Taylor stepped down. But when Harold McCusker, MP for Upper Bann, died of cancer in 1990, Taylor encouraged Trimble to seek the nomination. He won it. In the by-election, he fared better than in his previous effort at the polls nine years earlier, when he failed to get on Lisburn Borough Council. At the age of 45, a new life in Westminster beckoned. Trimble had become interested in politics only after Stormont was prorogued in 1972. He says he was motivated after he was persuaded to read Karl Popper's The Poverty Of Historicism, an attack on the Marxist notion of historical determinism. He decided then was the time to stop shouting at the television and do something. He was seduced into ex-Stormont minister Bill Craig's Vanguard movement, a strange hardline outfit with links to paramilitaries. Trimble is said to have been a key thinker in the 1974 loyalist workers' strike. But Glen Barr, a former Ulster Defence Association commander who masterminded the protest, is sceptical. He says: \"David was a terrific analyst and a terrible strategist.\" Craig once said: \"One of these days, if and when the politicians fail us, it may be our job to liquidate the enemy.\" He claimed recently that his comments were misinterpreted. Trimble did not endorse his comments but he, too, could indulge in hardline rhetoric. He once supported calls for citizens' armies, adding \"I would personally draw the line at violence and terrorism. But if we are talking about a campaign that involves demonstrations and so on, then a certain amount of violence may be inescapable.\" He once ridiculed Paisley during a stormy debate in the constitutional convention, an ill-fated attempt to bring devolution back to Northern Ireland, quoting from Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago: \"We should look for our brave men in prisons and for the fools amongst politicians.\" Paisley's retort was to cite an apocryphal story in which an MP and Queen's University law lecturer had accidentally discharged the gun which, as a person at risk in Northern Ireland, he was allowed to carry for personal protection. Trimble tried to interrupt twice, then left the chamber. Those looking for clues to Trimble's contemporary moderation can see it in the destruction of Vanguard. The organisation fell apart when he backed Craig's plan for a voluntary coalition with nationalists. He joined the UUP in 1977 but was distrusted, partly because of his Vanguard past, his perceived intellectual snobbery, and his lack of the farming background associated with the unionist tradition: to many unionists, he \"wasn't one of us\". He watched as a colleague in the law faculty at Queen's became the rising star in the party - Edgar Graham, almost a decade younger. In December 1982 the IRA pumped several shots into Graham's head as he parked his car at the university - he was 29. One colleague recalls: \"It had a tremendous impact on David. They were close. I heard the shots, and I thought it was someone knocking on the door. David knew immediately and he was the first on the scene. But there was nothing anyone could do. I remember the university putting out a statement which said the attack hadn't taken place on its premises. It infuriated David.\" It angers Trimble that nationalists have staged propaganda battles over alleged security-force collusion in the loyalist murders of the lawyers Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. He feels that Graham's memory is ignored because he was a Protestant. The Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 re-invigorated Trimble. He organised the Ulster Clubs in opposition, and the quasi-academic organisation was to spawn many of the young unionists whose votes in the leadership election were vital. They skipped a generation in backing Trimble and he was a decent television performer. But they thought they were getting a hardliner, and many, including the so-called baby barristers, are now dismayed at his leftward shift. But Paul Bew, Professor of Irish Politics at Queen's University, believes the perception of him as a hardliner was wide of the mark. He says: \"He was always a liberal on human rights, but tough on the constitutional aspects.\" Ken Reade, the Ulster Television political correspondent and close observer of Trimble, says: \"Since he became leader, he has always been pragmatic. He realised Unionism had to cement a constitutional deal, and it would be more difficult to get the longer he delayed it.\" Broadcaster Eamonn Mallie agrees: \"He knew Unionism had to cut a deal or it was going into the wilderness.So he took on the stone-faced No Surrender mentality.\" One of Trimble's themes is confidence. He says: \"If you say I'm not going to get out of bed in the morning until I've got an absolute guarantee that I will not be run down by a bus while going across a pedestrian crossing, you'll never get out of bed.\" But he lacks charisma and the vision thing and he still has a long way to go in improving his presentational skills. He says: \"I'm not very good at the evangelical bit. Blair is good and Clinton's good, but I'm a bit flat. I know it. But at least I don't try to bullshit people.\" At the same time he is a nervous soul, prone to humming and fidgeting at times of stress, when he might flash his slightly sinister smile which, he jokes, must terrify nationalists, and he has a habit of rocking on tip-toe under pressure. His get-out to a hard question is flippancy, and his puerile responses infuriate reporters. His short-temper is famous, once angrily telephoning a journalist to demand why he had been described in a profile as irascible - as the reporter said, the call rather proved the point - and he can be exceptionally rude. Some say this is from shyness, and believe he would prefer to be back in the university toiling over some dusty point of law. He is prone to lapses of judgment, as his recent outburst against Mo Mowlam, Northern Ireland Secretary, showed. His closest chums in the party are Sir Reg Empey, an old Vanguard colleague, and Dermot Nesbitt, who was chatting with Graham when he was assassinated. But even they don't pretend to know Trimble well. Empey says the pressure on him is incredible and that he has to watch out for almost everyone else. John Taylor is a particular conundrum: one colleague says of him: \"He has more positions than the Kama Sutra.\" David Thompson, chairman of the UUP branch in Portadown says of Trimble: \"He is loyal almost to a fault. I have seen him let down several times by people in the party, and he just takes a deep sigh and gets on with it. There is no vengeance in him.\" His relationships with the other side are problematic. Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, has made it clear he believes building personal relationships are key, but he has yet to make a positive impression on Trimble, who is said to have confided to friends \"He is the most appalling human being I have ever met.\" They first met face-to-face nine months ago in a side office at Stormont. Party colleagues say Trimble put a chair under the handle to keep the door ajar and Adams pulled it away as he sat down. At least they talk now. During the multi-party negotiations at Stormont, Trimble issued his party with instructions to avoid any contact with Sinn Fein. Adams says Trimble's nervous body language belies a man in control. It is conversely true that when he often appears most relaxed, he is under the greatest pressure. During a trip to the United States last year, his younger son, Nicholas, 11, found himself beside Adams, who helped him open his sweets. Trimble looked on, unperturbed. But at the St Patrick's Day celebrations at the White House in March he was said to have been furious when Adams gently patted him as he tried to pass to get to his seat. Trimble stormed out. His relationship with John Hume has never been close. Some say there is a touch of snobbery in this. He thinks there is a lack of intellectual rigour about Hume. Great things were predicted for the Trimble-Seamus Mallon ticket as first minister and deputy respectively. They were a superb double act at Poyntzpass in Co Armagh in March last year when they arrived separately but at the same time to visit the families of friends Philip Allan, 36 and Damien Trainor, 25, after they were gunned down in the Railway Bar by the Loyalist Volunteer Force. The small community straddled their respective constituencies. The two victims were Catholic and Protestant, and the two politicians, also from opposite sides of the religious divide, were impressive in their condemnation of the killings. The murders acted as a spur and the Good Friday Agreement was born five weeks later. The close relationship envisaged has evaporated. The strains are mainly over the agreement. Trimble thinks Mallon should have been tougher in demanding IRA decommissioning. Mallon believes Trimble has delayed for too long in setting up the institutions. But neither is a renowned team player. Colleagues who negotiated the agreement with Trimble were unsure what his bottom line was. Some suspect he never really knew either. Friends, though, say he can be fine company, with a well developed sense of humour and a neat line in self-deprecation. He is at his most relaxed when with his family. He is openly affectionate towards his second wife, Daphne Orr, a former student whom he began dating only when she graduated. She gave up her career to run his constituency office. She is warm and down-to-earth, and complains he is useless with money and was never one for pension plans. He still has the near-£300,000 Nobel peace prize award, but it may be earmarked for work with the recently set-up Victims' Commission, of which Daphne is a member. He is fond of a drink, and buys cases of wine to cram into his battered Renault Espace while on holiday with the family in Germany, France and Italy, soaking up as much culture as possible. They have four children, Richard, Victoria, Nicholas and Sarah, aged 16 to six, and their chaotic home in Lisburn is a happy one. He takes phone calls as Sarah fires Action Man rockets at him. The children's birthdays are all in March: he likes to point out what a fine time of year July is for an Orangeman. He is a great reader, and says his favourite bookshop is Barnes and Noble in Washington. The historian Ruth Dudley-Edwards was amazed at one Irish Embassy function in London when a group was discussing Brian Moore, the Catholic author from Belfast, who had recently died. Trimble listed five of his books he had read, more than the others could manage together, but was frustrated at being unable to recall the sixth. His other love is music, with Wagner, Verdi and Strauss his favourites, the legacy of the love of opera he inherited from his father. His one extravagance is a fine music system. Ken Reade recalls a long discussion on Van Morrison: Trimble admitted he disliked Astral Weeks, a must among most Morrison fans, preferring instead the melodic jazz influences of Moondance. He believes there is life after politics. In 1996 he said privately he had two more years as leader in him. The pressure gets to him. But his perspective is sanguine. He says: \"Nothing in life's settled. You know, it ain't over till the fat lady sings? \"In the same way, parliament has a good rule too. It doesn't put up anything inside parliament to mark the contribution of a particular politician until he's dead. Until then, you don't know if he was a really good one or not.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/1999/jul/03/immigrationpolicy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-03T14:05:12Z","webTitle":"Profile: Trimble - the hard man of peace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jul/03/immigrationpolicy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jul/03/immigrationpolicy","fields":{"headline":"Profile: Trimble - the hard man of peace","bodyText":"They call it the Gay Wedding in Northern Ireland, and they will remember it tomorrow in Portadown, citadel of sectarianism. To rousing cheers, Ian Paisley and David Trimble skipped hand in hand up to Carlton Orange Hall in the town, grinning manically. Paisley, Unionism's strongest personality for 30 years, took second billing to the local MP, a bespectacled figure strutting camply at his side. It was July 1995, and the first of the battles over the Orange Order's right to march down the nationalist Garvaghy Road from Drumcree Church of Ascension. This was a defining moment for Trimble, then MP for Upper Bann for just five years. His fellow Orangemen struck a special memento for the bookish former Queen's University law lecturer, but managed to get the spelling wrong, and the medal refers to the Seige of Drumcree. Trimble's heroic deed was to help get them through police lines after the Portadown Number One Lodge was refused permission to walk the Garvaghy Road for the first time since the Orange Order began parading to and from its annual religious service in 1807. The RUC, unthinkably, lined up against the Protestant marchers. The dispute, as it will be tomorrow and has been ever since, was about more than an Orange walk. It was a litmus test for who was winning in Northern Ireland, nationalists or unionists, and the Orangemen refused to disperse. Trimble told them: 'Orangemen have marched along that road for 188 years, so abandoning it is not something that is going to be done lightly. We are not going back the way we came.' Nor did they. A deal, brokered with Trimble's involvement, was struck with the Catholic residents, and the marchers proceeded in silence. The triumphalist dance at the march's end infuriated nationalists, explaining their more hardline attitudes now. Trimble's gleeful participation came as little surprise. He was seen as a resolute hardliner: able, certainly bending, never. He had, after all, been involved in organising the loyalist workers' strike of 1974, which brought down the last attempt at power-sharing in Northern Ireland. He was a leading figure in Vanguard, an extreme unionist outfit, and a zealous opponent of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Just a few months before he was elected to Parliament in 1990, he abused Charles Haughey, the Irish Taoiseach, from the roof of the Ulster Unionist Party HQ in Belfast. Haughey's offence was to venture onto United Kingdom soil. Trimble was seen by nationalists as bad-tempered, irascible a unionist with the typical Not An Inch mentality, an Orangeman in short, a bigot. When he was chairman of the Ulster Society in 1987 he wrote the acknowledgements to a collection of Orange songs, most of them virulently anti Catholic. Included was William Johnston Of Ballykilbeg, whose first stanza begins: All Fenian rascals I love them so well I could see every scoundrel well roasted in Hell. Another inclusion was Bangor And No Surrender, which has these lines: Let craven hearts to tyranny Their craven homage render The watchword of the brave and free Will still be 'No Surrender!' That he was thought to have few apparent social skills only added to the contempt which was felt for him in most liberal circles. Just after Drumcree I, James Molyneaux decided to quit as leader of the UUP on his 75th birthday. The MPs Ken Maginnis, Willie Ross and Martin Smyth all declared, but the bookmakers' choice was ex Stormont minister John Taylor. He was a tough operator who had survived a murder attempt by the Official IRA in 1972. Trimble, who shared an office with Taylor at Westminster, entered the race a week before the 800-strong Ulster Unionist Council was due to vote. Journalists just about managed to hold in check derisive smirks at the press conference launching Trimble's candidature. But he had told his wife, Daphne, he would win, and he did, with ease. Only hours before his victory, he had been presented with that Drumcree medal, and there was no doubt that the conservative council had gone for the most hardline option. The portents for the fledgling peace process looked poor. They were aghast at a meeting of the British-Irish Association, an academic talking shop, as they gathered around the television. David Adams, of the Ulster Democratic Party, recalls: 'I was like many there. I thought it was the end for reasonable unionism.' David McKittrick, Ireland correspondent of the Independent, called Trimble the leader no-one wanted. He said he had come to power on a hardline ticket, and that his 25 years in politics had left no real indication that he had a vision beyond Unionism and Orangeism. In an otherwise damning leader, The Irish Independent said: 'Perhaps the most positive thing that can be said about this election is that many politicians have shown themselves capable of growing into office and of reaching compromises that would have appeared impossible in their early years.' Within 30 months, Trimble had done just that, pulling his reluctant party into the Good Friday Agreement, which underpinned the principle of consent but also promised republicans a full role in government. He talked of pluralist government for a pluralist people, and he walked off with the Nobel Peace Prize last year with John Hume, the SDLP leader. He had turned his back on a previous ambition of a single united unionist party, facing down Paisley and UK Unionist leader Bob McCartney, in the May 1998 referendum on the agreement. Trimble has struggled with pres sure on all fronts, from Sinn Fein to his own treacherous ranks, and still he has ploughed on. He will miss Drumcree tomorrow. He is no longer welcome. Orangemen there now see their one-time champion as a traitor. He has even been accused of being an MI5 agent. They reacted angrily when Trimble attended the funeral last August of three young boys killed in the Real IRA's bombing of Omagh. It meant him attending a Catholic service, anathema to hardliners. There was fury too when he met the Pope in April, as one of 54 Nobel peace-prize laureates, and, while hardly at ease, his gesture was seen as something of a watershed. One woman said: 'The loyalist people of this town and Drumcree put David Trimble into office. Now he has turned his back on us. That's a fatal mistake. This town and Drumcree will now destroy Trimble.' It is a long way from holding hands in an Orange sash with Ian Paisley at Portadown to shaking them with Irish president Mary McAleese at the funeral mass of three Catholic boys in County Donegal. Further still to greet the Pope in the Vatican. William David Trimble was born in October 1944 and was brought up in Bangor on County Down's overwhelmingly Protestant Gold Coast. His father, Billy, was upper working-class, a junior civil servant in the ministry of defence and an avid reader of the Daily Mail. His mother, Ivy, was well-to-do, though the family's building business had gone bust. One friend remembers her as a snob. Trimble has an older brother, formerly in the RAF, and a younger sister, who is the spitting image of him. They were in Oslo last December when he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Trimble went to Bangor Grammar School and confesses to having had a rebellious streak. His father was keen for him to have a steady job, and so he too became a civil servant, joining the department of finance at the Land Registry in 1964 and discovering he could go to Queen's University and remain on salary. He had joined the Orange Order in Bangor at 17. But his forays into formal politics were to come much later. Herb Wallace, a work colleague at the Land Registry, says: 'He was a very serious fellow. He didn't find it easy to fit in with the general banter and messing about. But he still wanted to be one of the gang. It wasn't as if he tried to cut himself off.' He shunned trendy fashion, preferring a sports jacket and flannels, but he loved music. His favourite single then was My Guy by Mary Wells, and his obsession was Elvis Presley. He was recently to be found in animated discussion arguing that The King's Blue Suede Shoes was far superior to Carl Perkins's effort. The Air Training Corps attracted him and he joined to fly gliders. Never much good at sport, he nevertheless turned out for a while for Jordanstown's third 15 at rugby and later became fascinated with American football when Channel 4 screened it in the mid-80s. Wallace, who studied law with Trimble at Queen's and later became a lecturer alongside him, says: 'He enjoyed a drink, though as one friend said, he was never the captain-of-the-rugby-club type. There were several times when we all drank too much, and he was never one to be the first to leave any party.' Trimble was often the butt of his colleagues' practical jokes, which he bore with good humour, partly because he knew that if he reacted angrily he would get more stick. They once fixed a paper lantern to his coat, and he unwittingly walked about with it stuck there all day, much to their mirth. At the office Christmas party that night, he began a relationship with colleague Heather McComb, who was to become his first wife. As well as working in the Land Registry, she was a Greenfinch reservist in the Ulster Defence Regiment. They married in 1968 and were together for about three years. At Queen's, Trimble's tutors told him he had a good chance of a first-class honours degree, but would have to devote himself full-time to his studies. He took leave of absence, and secured his first. His father was then seriously ill with lung cancer and is believed to have died after Trimble's exams and before graduation. Trimble was called to the bar in 1969, but always preferred academic life to the cut and thrust of the court-room, something which UK Unionist leader Robert McCartney, a pugnacious QC, delights in rubbing home. The future first minister of Northern Ireland became a fixture at Queen's University, specialising in equity law, which was made for his pedantic approach. Students recall him at best as a thorough but uninspiring lecturer who kept everything he needed to know about his subject in a yellow lever-arch file, packed with his tight, handwritten notes. One student, now a barrister, says: 'He had no personal skills whatsoever. He was terrible, really boring. There was never any inter-action, and he never came to any social occasions. His tutorials were regimented. He would start on his left and work through to the right, so you knew just where to sit to avoid work.' One habit infuriated nationalist students, who increased in numbers during his time at Queen's - if they had a Gaelic name, he would insist on the English equivalent. But he went to Long Kesh, now the Maze Prison , on several occasions to teach a Catholic student of his who had been interned there. He told friends that he found it an interesting experience. He was acting director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies for a time, but failed to land the job which went to Mary McAleese, one of his ex-students, a Catholic from north Belfast, and now President of Ireland. He is said by colleagues to have been furious. By 1990 his career was going nowhere. He published a couple of books, but was never fully committed to research, the key to academic success. His political ambitions were blunted too. Molyneaux disliked him. He had failed to become the UUP candidate in the European election the previous year when John Taylor stepped down. But when Harold McCusker, MP for Upper Bann, died of cancer in 1990, Taylor encouraged Trimble to seek the nomination. He won it. In the by-election, he fared better than in his previous effort at the polls nine years earlier, when he failed to get on Lisburn Borough Council. At the age of 45, a new life in Westminster beckoned. Trimble had become interested in politics only after Stormont was prorogued in 1972. He says he was motivated after he was persuaded to read Karl Popper's The Poverty Of Historicism, an attack on the Marxist notion of historical determinism. He decided then was the time to stop shouting at the television and do something. He was seduced into ex-Stormont minister Bill Craig's Vanguard movement, a strange hardline outfit with links to paramilitaries. Trimble is said to have been a key thinker in the 1974 loyalist workers' strike. But Glen Barr, a former Ulster Defence Association commander who masterminded the protest, is sceptical. He says: 'David was a terrific analyst and a terrible strategist.' Craig once said: 'One of these days, if and when the politicians fail us, it may be our job to liquidate the enemy.' He claimed recently that his comments were misinterpreted. Trimble did not endorse his comments but he, too, could indulge in hardline rhetoric. He once supported calls for citizens' armies, adding 'I would personally draw the line at violence and terrorism. But if we are talking about a campaign that involves demonstrations and so on, then a certain amount of violence may be inescapable.' He once ridiculed Paisley during a stormy debate in the constitutional convention, an ill-fated attempt to bring devolution back to Northern Ireland, quoting from Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago: 'We should look for our brave men in prisons and for the fools amongst politicians.' Paisley's retort was to cite an apocryphal story in which an MP and Queen's University law lecturer had accidentally discharged the gun which, as a person at risk in Northern Ireland, he was allowed to carry for personal protection. Trimble tried to interrupt twice, then left the chamber. Those looking for clues to Trimble's contemporary moderation can see it in the destruction of Vanguard.

Their turnover is now greater than all but three of the world's economies. The UN's 1999 Human Development Report estimates organised crime syndicates gross around £1,000 billion a year. The UK's economic output is just over £800bn. The report says the syndicates' economic power rivals that of multinational corporations. The biggest growth area is drugs, which is now a bigger global industry than motor manufacturing. Over the past 10 years, the production of opium has more than tripled and the production of coca leaves has doubled. The illegal drug trade - supplying 200 million customers - is worth around £250bn, or 8 per cent of world trade. Another growth industry is trafficking in women and girls for the sex industry. It is now a business worth £5bn a year. The report, due out next week, studies the advantages and disadvantages of globalisation. It says crime syndicates have been particular beneficiaries of advances in telecommunications and the opening up of borders. 'Globalisation creates new and exciting opportunities, and among the most enterprising and imaginative opportunists are the world's criminals,' it says. 'As the multinational corporations have led the drive to globalise the world's economy, so the ''crime multinationals'' have been quick to exploit it.' It cites examples of a computer hacker in Russia who came close to stealing millions of dollars from Citibank in New York, and Nigerian con men who take advantage of the semblance of legitimacy that a fax machine gives to a forged document. Most of the main criminal groups have extended beyond their home territories. The Chinese triads are in the restaurant trade in London, the Sicilian mafia is selling heroin in New York, and the Japanese yakuza are financing pornography in the Netherlands. The Medellin and Cali cartels in Colombia, the Juarez, Tijuana and Gulf cartels of Mexico and the Cosa Nostra in the US are all exporting their crimes. The report claims 'they are now developing strategic alliances linked in a global network, reaping the benefits of globalisation'. The criminals have been particularly helped by the ease with which money can now be transferred between continents. 'The precipitous removal of currency controls, before a proper regulatory environment has been established, is the perfect condition for laundering money,' says the report. It also suggests the lowering of trade barriers has aided criminals: 'It helps the luxury car hijacked on a Johannesburg street to reappear for sale in Moscow.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/1999/jul/05/tvandradio.television1","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-05T01:16:29Z","webTitle":"Work experience","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/jul/05/tvandradio.television1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/1999/jul/05/tvandradio.television1","fields":{"headline":"Work experience","bodyText":"You would not expect a dramatist to smile while admitting that the most powerful scene in their latest play was written by someone else. Such an admission is normally a prelude to a plagiarism scandal in the papers or an author's appeal to the Writer's Guild to have their name removed from the credits. But, with the latest work from Jimmy McGovern, such confusions are a vindication of the play. Dockers (10pm, Sunday, Channel 4) is a drama-documentary about the lock-out at Liverpool docks in 1995. This dispute received little attention because both the media and the TGWU under Bill Morris were preparing themselves for the accession of Tony Blair. Striking dockers seemed an anachronism. The main publicity for the cause came - though quite inadvertently - from television when the footballer Robbie Fowler lifted his Liverpool shirt after scoring a broadcast goal to reveal a tee-shirt supporting the sacked men. Under football's nanny rules, Fowler was disciplined and was next heard of accusing a Chelsea defender of being, in a different context, a shirt-lifter. But, four years on, another Liverpudlian - Jimmy McGovern - has rolled up his sleeves to publicise on television a story which can now be seen as a pivotal moment in British labour relations. The Liverpool dockers found themselves trapped between the politics of the 70s and the 90s. Compelling and passionate, Dockers is political drama of the highest-class. But, in two significant ways, it departs from the conventions of Play For Today, the strand in which a work of this kind would have appeared 20 years ago. The first distinction is authorship. As a writer, Jimmy McGovern has always experimented with genres. First proving his worth in soap (Brookside) and then drama (Cracker, which he created), he next wrote a kind of drama-soap (The Lakes) and drama-documentary: the award-winning Hillsborough. Dockers might have been another Hillsborough - a painful Liverpool story recreated from real stories - but McGovern has changed the rules again. In this project, the dockers were not passive raw material but literally self-dramatisers. Most of the script was written by them during workshops supervised by McGovern and the Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh. The professional writers take their credit alphabetically in a list of 16 scripters, 14 of them dockers or their wives. This unique attribution radically changes the viewer's usual relationship with the dialogue. For example, a docker berates an idle colleague with the words: \"The last time I saw dirt on you was fucking Ash Wednesday.\" Normally you would note this as a clever line, underlining the Catholic culture of the Liverpool working class. Here you know that it was a genuine docker's insult, transcribed by a man who was on one or other end of it. Even more dizzyingly, there is a scene - the one you can expect to see replayed at awards ceremonies - which seemed to me to have the obvious mark of a professional playwright showing his fledgling co-authors what the big guys could do. A striker and his wife go to bed in silent anger after a row. She wakes in the early hours to find him naked at the end of the bed blowing soap-bubbles through a child's toy plastic blower. Laughter leads to reconciliation love-making. This weird sequence - with its daring combination of eroticism and childishness - feels pure McGovern. You could easily imagine the scene given to Fitz in Cracker. But the playwright told me in an interview that the scene was written by a woman at the workshop, describing an incident from her own marriage. It was then that McGovern gave the surprisingly proud smile I referred to earlier from a dramatist attributing the best scene to someone else. But, apart from its collective genesis, Dockers is significant in the history of political drama on television for its complexity of tone. The piece is very reminiscent of the Seventies work of the writer Jim Allen (who died recently) and, in particular, of The Spongers and United Kingdom. But, whereas those and other Plays For Today tended to be polemical and eloquently confident of one view-point, Dockers, though angry, is a play of debate: the single most powerful speech is delivered by a docker who breaks the strike. McGovern has said that the biggest tension in the workshop came from his insistence that both sides should be written. So, paradoxically, a drama which is frequently sneering about the new politics of the Left - the villain is TGWU boss Bill Morris - is itself, in both production method and rhetorical temper - the vanguard of a new kind of political drama."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/1999/jul/05/mondaymediasection2","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-05T14:46:17Z","webTitle":"No surrender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/jul/05/mondaymediasection2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/1999/jul/05/mondaymediasection2","fields":{"headline":"No surrender","bodyText":"Something unusual went on in Court Number 15 at the Old Bailey last Friday in front of Mr Justice Pownall QC. Nine newspapers and broadcasting organisations, normally the fiercest of competitors, combined to fight a legal action. The fact that this unusual alliance won is a decision which will have important implications for the freedom of the media. The reason for the case was an application by the City of London Police for possession of all untransmitted video material, photographs and reporters' notes taken during the recent anti-capitalist demonstration in the City. The action went right to the heart of a strong but nonetheless controversial principle of journalistic practice: that it cannot be and must not be seen to be the job of journalists to gather material for the police. Our critics accuse us of attempting to put the media above the law, of hindering the police in their investigations and of helping law-breakers to escape arrest. When the police investigate disturbances such as those in the City of London they naturally have one objective and one objective only: to accumulate as much evidence as possible which may help them to make arrests. While of course, as citizens, we all back the police in upholding the law there is a difficult but very important balance to be struck between handing over material to the police and protecting the rights of the media to independently cover such events. This right to legitimate freedom of expression is laid out in the European Convention on Human Rights, shortly to be incorporated into English law. Newsgathering is a difficult task. The risks are part of the job. Day in and day out our reporters and crews find themselves in tricky and sometimes very fraught situations. Outside of the war zones of a Kosovo conflict, some of the most difficult events to cover are demonstrations and protests. They can be unpredictable, if they erupt they can be very fast moving and you can never be sure when a peaceful protest will spill over into violence right behind your back and you will become part of it. But what has become an increasing tendency in recent years has been for our news crews and journalists themselves to become the deliberate target of the demonstrators' anger. What can make this 10 times worse is when the crowd believes that our crews are gathering material for the police and are doing so routinely. The crowd turned on a BBC crew during the City unrest. When a crew went to Stonehenge recently, a BBC reporter was kicked. The confusion can be increased by the growing use by the police of their own video crews to gather evidence . On the day of the London protest there were around 30 police crews in action. If the police were to be granted unrestricted access to our material then there is little doubt that attacks on our teams would get worse. The police are increasingly trying to get their hands on our material under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. This is despite the fact that such powers under the Act at the time were granted by parliament as exceptional powers and despite the fact that these days the police can increasingly rely on material gathered from other sources. On the day of the City of London disturbances there were hundreds of CCTV cameras in operation as well as the 30 police video crews. If we were to find ourselves regarded as police agents then there is little doubt that we would sooner or later have to withdraw from coverage of such protests and demonstrations. The safety and protection of our teams must be paramount. But the consequences of such a withdrawal would be very serious indeed for the role of a free press and broadcasting in the United Kingdom. It is vital that the public are able to see for themselves what happens and the conduct of those who cause trouble and those who deal with it. To understand the possible implications of the cameras not being there you have to think no further ahead than the advent of this year's marching season in Northern Ireland and the recent events at Drumcree. Of course in this argument there is a balance to be struck and we would not attempt to argue that there should be a blanket exemption for the media for every request. There will be times when the criminal act is so serious and the material so crucial that it is right for the broadcasters to surrender any relevant material. But that is not the same as agreeing to every fishing expedition by every police force for every disturbance. Each case must be scrutinised very carefully. We are not arguing that we should be above the law, only that we should be independent of it. That is an important distinction. It is crucial for the future conduct of the media that the courts make this distinction, and that our teams can continue to safely and independently cover important events. The decision is an important one. On this occasion the court got the balance right. Let us hope that other courts and other police forces will now follow suit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/jul/06/features11.g23","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-06T01:54:22Z","webTitle":"'He'll pin your eyelids open till you nearly go blind with overload'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jul/06/features11.g23","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/jul/06/features11.g23","fields":{"headline":"'He'll pin your eyelids open till you nearly go blind with overload'","bodyText":"One of the persistent quibbles about Kurt Andersen's first novel - the book du jour of Manhattan and an essential modern primer on money, the media and technology - is that it is far too long. But he is able to catch much of its essence in one sentence when he chooses. \"My characters, the people in my book, would feel obliged to buy, if not read, my book,\" he says. Andersen knows these people well. After all, he is one of them - the brilliant comets of a creative elite who anticipate or direct the aesthetics of whatever is just beyond the horizon. They might not know everything but they know about everything. Andersen has captured lightning in a bottle and is well aware of it. Maybe that's why he uses the expression so much. Most of the reviewers of Turn Of The Century tell him so. \"Anderson jacks you into the nerve centre of the media society and pins your eyelids open until you go nearly blind with overload,\" said one. Another, making passing reference to Ulysses, said: \"Most of the digressions are informative, wickedly satirical or outrageously funny and often all at once.\" As if that were not enough, he has been described as \"the first most promising novelist of the third millennium\". Most promising novelist? At 44? He's entitled to feel pleased with himself and he does, here in the Blue Bar of the Algonquin Hotel, no mention of which is possible without a nod to Dorothy Parker if only because Andersen would have met with ease the standard of repartee required in her circle. Much of what he says is in inverted commas, played for laughs or self-deprecating. Or at least that's the way it seems. The book's main players are George Mactier and his wife Lizzie Zimbalist, who are not entirely happy with the moral dimensions of what they are doing but do it just the same, deaths in the family an inconvenient interruption in the rush of ideas and deals that drive their careers. He is a former journalist, now a TV producer on $16,575 a week, on a show that not merely blurs but obliterates the lines between fact and fiction; she, the conceptual brain behind a software house, is repelled by and attracted to an alliance with Microsoft. Andersen strafes the story with the buzzwords and cadences, the wisecracks and gizmos of a generation whose lease on power might not extend far beyond his book's 659 pages. Smart guy that he is, he has it both ways, in the club but on a sceptical membership card. One character, explaining the controls of a private jet, could be passing judgment on George and Lizzie's world: \"It isn't real. The throttle levers are vestigial. Completely unnecessary. They're just a sop to the pilots. Pure nostalgia. Welcome to the 21st century.\" Again, Andersen knows what he is talking about, as one of the co-founders (Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair was another) of the 1980s satirical magazine Spy, an editor of New York magazine, writer for the New Yorker and Time, and sometime television producer. Just in case the author is as readily defined by his environment and his choice of products as are the cast in his book, his blue denims are parked on a rust-red leather seat, and when he is not smoking Marlboro Reds he is emptying a bowl of peanuts as quickly as phrases and ideas enter his head, and drinking Pete's Wicked Ale (The Original American Brown Ale). He knows what's coming and launches a perfectly amiable pre-emptive strike. \"The question 'Are you tired of hearing all the same questions?' is usually framed in this way, 'Are you tired of questions about Tom Wolfe?' My stock reply is, 'No, those are very flattering comparisons.' My last actual mild argument with the publishers was whether to have a reference to The Bonfire Of The Vanities on the jacket cover. In the end I gave in and let them [it's there on the United Kingdom edition, published on Thursday]. It would be disingenuous to say that there was no anxiety of influence. I re-read Bonfire before I began writing to get clear about what that was, with 12 years' hindsight, that I was worrying about. Yeah, it's a big, fat social novel set mostly in New York, so what can you do?\" Just as Wolfe's definitive 1980s chronicle of the city transcended the book review pages to assume the status of a cultural fixture, so Turn Of The Century and its author have become starting points for any number of conversations and columns: the death of the traditional media is a favourite; he is fair game for the gossip columns; and a photograph of Andersen, a mere writer, has appeared in the public prints alongside a picture of the Teletubbies. It cannot be long before he is invited to write lyrics for Celine Dion. But just when the success of Turn Of The Century had been diagnosed, the backlash began. A peculiar piece appeared recently in the New York Times dedicated to the precept that, just because Andersen's book is on most bestseller lists, that doesn't make it a bestseller (you guessed: no, it's not on the Times list). And in case the argument failed to prevail in the face of 75,000 hardback copies sold since May, the article also noted that the film rights had not been sold (they were, though, the day the story appeared). Andersen pretends to pretend that he did not see the piece. \"No, I missed that,\" he says extravagantly. \"It was a little too Jesuitical for me. I am loath to infer motives but Marty Arnold, who wrote that piece, is the last living New York Times man whom we regularly gaffed in Spy and there might be some baggage motivating that. Fortunately, he had the integrity to print the facts that contradicted his premise.\" Then there is the wholly negative review in the New Republic - appearing a sprightly six weeks after the book was published - which says, at its kindest: \"Turn Of The Century is a book about the media by a media person for the media. That is why we have it and that is why it has this month's buzz. This is vanity publishing on the largest scale.\" Perhaps Andersen might have expected more from the equally slothful Fortune magazine, but one has to hope not. \"Who could have guessed, back when they were mocking the Jay McInerneys and Tina Browns of the world, that what Andersen and Carter wanted more than anything on earth was to actually be Jay McInerney and Tina Brown?\" it asks in its latest issue. Clearly, there is a price to be paid for being clever and clever-clever at the same time. \"If someone I knew had managed to write a novel and gotten it published and gotten interviewed and gotten some attention, I'd be jealous,\" says Andersen. \"I wouldn't commit that jealousy to print but I'd be jealous. I have a pretty high ambient level of self-doubt and criticism but no, I'm pleased with the book and feel it has got, and is getting, the correct amount of praise and sales. It's been well within the correct proportions for my mental health.\" Andersen does not know what Wolfe thinks about Turn Of The Century, only that he declined to review it for Time. He does know what some of the grand old men of letters have to say about Wolfe's novels, that they are long works of journalism rather than bona fide literature. \"It's, 'How dare this journalist presume at this advanced age that he can also do this?' In my junior way, I've had a little bit of the same copping but not too much. I can't pay or not pay attention by choice. When it stings it stings, and it hasn't stung very much. When things are done out of bad taste, what looks to be transparent jealousy, the other monkeys declaring that this monkey can't evolve into a Neanderthal, it seems kind of unsportsmanlike. But having got good reviews from places that matter I was able to brush off the carping.\" The book is being published in German, Dutch and French. \"And Chinese, which is my favourite. In 40 years you'll see China has gone the wrong way and it's all my fault.\" But it's an open question whether people outside the United States - or even outside New York City and Los Angeles - will feel flattered that the book has allowed them into a world that otherwise would be closed, or baffled by many of the references. Sure, there's no problem with Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Willem de Kooning, Barbie or Jack Daniel (and these are drawn from only two pages). But Pat Riley (former Knicks coach), Ken Burns (grown-up documentary maker) and Charlie Rose (a sort of American Melvyn Bragg, though unintentionally much funnier) might not mean much in Beijing. Not yet, anyway. As we part (there are no peanuts left) it occurs to me that it would be mean if I did not mention that I enjoyed the book. \"Maybe it's my arrogance, but I took that as implicit,\" says Andersen over his shoulder. Don't worry, he was sending himself up. Of course he was.

David Bickford, a former ministry of defence under-secretary and legal adviser to MI5 and MI6 until 1995, surprised MPs on the Commons public administration committee by telling them that his former colleagues would, unlike Whitehall, welcome opening up the security services to public scrutiny subject to a harm test. He made a strong case for both policy and administrative issues - as opposed to top-secret information on operations - to be subject to public debate, just as in the United States where security agents, academics and researchers meet at conferences to discuss the effectiveness of the FBI in fighting the mafia and terrorist organisations. Mr Bickford dismissed the government's case for a blanket ban on information on MI5 and MI6. He said disclosure would neither help criminals nor cause information by for eign agencies to the UK to dry up. \"Countries with freedom of information legislation which covers their agencies will no doubt question the value of information given to them by the UK. The non-exposure of the agencies under UK legislation will tempt greater efforts to expose in foreign jurisdictions, if only to ridicule the UK position.\" Police chiefs appearing before the same committee faced accusations from MPs of lacking enthusiasm for greater openness. Paul Whitehouse, chief constable of Sussex police, and North Wales chief constable Michael Argent, insisted the service was keen to provide citizens with more information but warned against any move to compel police to disclose information which would prejudice the fight against crime. Under the legislation, information obtained during police inquiries will be exempt from release, subject to the force's discretion. The Lords joint committee, also scrutinising the draft bill, heard forceful criticism of its proposals from Guardian journalists and from Whitehall and government expert Professor Peter Hennessy. Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, asked by Liberal Democrat peer Lord McNally whether the bill would transform the relationship between \"the ordinary citizen and government\", pointed to clauses which would prevent the release of accident reports to relatives of victims, or which would block the disclosure of details of charity mismanagement. He told peers: \"It is not an accident that clauses like that get in. They do, I am afraid, make one cynical about the basis for the entire bill.\" Prof Hennessy attacked the bill as a backwards step after gradual progress over 20 years towards greater openness. A widely-approved white paper had been significantly watered down once responsiblity for the project was transferred to the home office, he claimed. \"Something nasty has happened in the woodshed.\" But Lord Butler, who retired this year as cabinet secretary after over three decades as a senior civil servant, argued strongly against any moves to amend the bill to open access to details of government policy discussions, claiming the step would curtail open, frank discussion in cabinet. Leaking from cabinet was already on the increase, he argued. \"At the level of the cabinet committees, the fact that the cabinet has become much leakier is inhibiting freedom of discussion in the top council of the country.\" But he acknowledged that civil servants were ready to find ways to split advice and factual information given to ministers, allowing facts to be released, while policy advice remained secret."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/jul/07/features11.g24","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-07T01:58:27Z","webTitle":"No: 1434 Musk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jul/07/features11.g24","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/jul/07/features11.g24","fields":{"headline":"No: 1434 Musk","bodyText":"Appearance: Reddish-brown, waxy substance.

Or diced one with a light sabre? Ape Escape is a supercute Japanese game that could easily have come from Nintendo, and the background tunes hark back to the first appearance of Mario in the original Donkey Kong. The graphics are bright but blocky and don't have the detail that was so nice about Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country. But then, Ape Escape isn't a 2-D platform game. It lets you move freely in a full 3-D environment with smooth camera movements, though the dreadful clipping does mean floors tend to disappear, and you can almost swim through the bottom of a pool. Oh yes, the programmers have been playing Tomb Raider, too, and have created some really nice watery effects. To win at Ape Escape you, Spike, an indefatigable young tyke, have to travel through time to recapture numerous intelligent (and cheeky) monkeys in your nets - a simple but effective scenario. As well as having eight worlds and more than 20 levels for variety, Ape also includes several mini-games. It's a running, jumping, crawling, climbing, swimming, rowing, skiing, boxing type of thing. When you manage to catch a monkey, the PlayStation's analogue controller vibrates, but the game can be played only with these Dual Shock controllers. If you don't have one yet, Sony sells them separately in translucent blue, emerald and crystal. There are compatible alternatives from independent suppliers, but it does bump up the cost of a fine game. New balls please All Star Tennis 99 Nintendo 64 £39.99 Ubisoft (0181 944 9000) With its empty corporate seats and exorbitantly-priced strawberries, Wimbledon fortnight is a curious season where previously indifferent sports fans pay homage at SW19. In an attempt to foster longer term interest Ubisoft gives us All-Star Tennis 99. This offers the usual tournament options as well as some arcade extras. The most novel of these is bomb tennis, where ball meeting court creates a ticking explosive. Graphically things are as inconsistent as the British summertime. The characters move smoothly enough but the animation is rudimentary. A willingness to dive at every opportunity merely highlights the lack of detail with the gravity-defying skirts failing to titillate even the most avid tabloid tennis voyeur. Grunt fans are treated to a full range of player emissions but the crowd noise is unintentionally hilarious, with fans sometimes egging on nonexistent players. Multiplayer mode repeats its role as saviour of sports games. Although there is too much wild button pressing, human opponents are the best way to appreciate the game, with doubles as enjoyably chaotic as the real thing. All Star Tennis? With Chang instead of Sampras this is stretching the truth somewhat, and although a licence is no guarantee of gaming excellence, you can't help but feel uninspired with the players on offer. The lack of real competition volleys All-Star Tennis to the top of the N64 tennis ratings. But this top ranking is undeserved, because of the bugs and rough-edged graphics. On a quiet day the multiplayer game would scrape a match on Court One. But really, All-Star Tennis is one for the outer courts only. Britannia rules, OK! Ultima Online: The Second Age PC CD-Rom £39.99 Origin/Electronic Arts The mortal affliction that is Ultima Online has already claimed one in 50,000 of the world's population - and that number is about to grow. The Second Age isn't so much a sequel as a story so far, bundling a few new features and areas together with all the patches and add-ons to the original online role-playing game (RPG). But its heart and soul are unchanged: as a character in the virtual kingdom of Britannia, you choose a career, hone your skills, trade, make friends, buy a house, go on quests, battle dragons... All this is by turns irritating, thrilling, boring and hilarious. Getting started is still way too much like hard work - becoming a decent fisherman, for example, involves something in the order of 100,000 mouse clicks. But then the sheer scale and variety of the experience - combined with the kick of interacting with thousands of players worldwide - make Ultima Online more of a way of life than a game. The main obstacle for us benighted Brits is the money. Game plus phone bill plus internet service charges plus monthly fee equals no birthday present for the boy this year. Still, how much did you really love him anyway?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jul/09/eu.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-09T14:20:28Z","webTitle":"Key European Commission posts for Kinnock and Patten","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/09/eu.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jul/09/eu.politics","fields":{"headline":"Key European Commission posts for Kinnock and Patten","bodyText":"Two Britons today won key posts in the new European Commission after the mass resignation of the previous 19 commissioners in March, forced out by allegations of cronyism, nepotism, fraud and mismanagement. Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, was appointed as one of two deputies with special responsibility for cleaning up the scandal-hit European bureaucracy. Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, becomes the other deputy, responsible for foreign affairs, a particularly heavy responsibility for a first-term commissioner. He will come under pressure to steer at least some of the leading candidate countries - such as Poland and the Czech Republic - into membership before his five-year term runs out. Mr Patten will also be involved in the challenge of Balkan reconstruction, since the candidacies of states such as Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia fall under his remit. He will have to cope with the difficult question of Cyprus, whose membership application could become entangled in the island's division between the Turkish-occupied north and the Cypriot-run south. Mr Kinnock pledged a policy of zero tolerance towards fraud in Brussels. After the announcement of Mr Prodi's new team, Mr Kinnock declared there would be \"absolutely no tolerance for any form of misbehaviour or fraud\" within the commission. He said that he would quickly be putting in place an effective \"anti-fraud machinery\" which had already been drawn up to tackle the problem. \"It is a job of getting the best out of people as well as pursuing those who, for any reason at all, are not up to the standards of public service that the people of the European Union have an absolute right to expect,\" he said. Prime Minister Tony Blair warmly welcomed the appointments of Mr Kinnock and Mr Patten. \"Romano Prodi is a great friend and admirer of Britain and has clearly recognised the outstanding abilities of the two UK commissioners in giving them two absolutely vital jobs,\" he said. \"There's no doubt this will help Britain's standing and influence in Europe and shows once more that if the United Kingdom engages as a constructive partner in Europe, Britain is the beneficiary.\" A Downing Street spokesman said that not only Mr Blair, but other heads of government had pressed for Mr Kinnock's appointment \"because of his proven modernising credentials\". The spokesman added: \"Neil Kinnock is widely recognised around Europe as the man who saved the Labour party from oblivion. The UK commissioners have effectively become deputy president and foreign minister of the commission.\" Mr Kinnock, transport commissioner in the previous administration, chose to stay on for a second term, after escaping criticism in the inquiry into commission mismanagement. Other appointments include Spain's Pedro Solbes, who gets the key monetary affairs post, responsible for the fledgling euro currency. Mr Solbes, 56, a former Spanish finance minister, takes over from Yves-Thibault de Silguy who masterminded the move to a single currency in 11 of the 15 EU nations. In a surprise move, France's Pascal Lamy is appointed to replace Sir Leon Brittan as trade commissioner while Italy's Mario Monti gets the powerful competition portfolio. Mr Monti was the commissioner in charge of taxation and the EU single market in the outgoing commission. As such, he masterminded the abolition of duty-free within the EU. Four commission members will return - Mr Kinnock, Mr Monti, Erkki Liikanen of Finland and Franz Fischler of Austria, who keeps the farm portfolio. While Mr Kinnock and Mr Patten are respected figures, most of their colleagues are not considered political heavyweights. At least half the commissioners, after much political in-fighting in Europe's mostly coalition governments, are barely household names in their own countries, let alone Europe. Mr Prodi's announcement ended weeks of speculation about the makeup of the new commission. He faces a stern challenge in restoring credibility in the European Union's executive body after the old team resigned in March following a damning report on fraud and corruption in the ranks. The scale of Mr Prodi's task as he takes over the EU presidency was underlined last week when a poll found that only 49% of Europeans thought EU membership was \"a good thing\", with support in Britain lowest at 31%. This represents a fall of five percentage points since in the last six months, and contrasts with a peak of over 70% in 1991. Only 44% of Europeans in the 15-nation poll say their country has benefited from EU membership. This may be because when asked where the EU mostly spent its money, the biggest single group of respondents - 26% - said they thought it went on bureaucracy. In fact, the bureaucracy takes just 5% of the budget, while agriculture and the structural funds each command more than 40%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview11","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-10T00:33:38Z","webTitle":"DiarySecret male fantasy lurking in Notting Hill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview11","fields":{"headline":"DiarySecret male fantasy lurking in Notting Hill","bodyText":"There is a theory that it will soon be possible to create a gene which wipes out that part of the brain which causes aggression in the human male. What I hadn't realised, until I finally saw it in the week it passed $100 million at the US box office, is that the film Notting Hill got there first. What a collection of drippy, unambitious, unaggressive weeds the men all are! It could be feminist parody of male inadequacy. Hugh Grant is a failed bookseller and all-round wimp, his assistant is rightly compared to a wet dishcloth, his friends include a failed stockbroker, a failed restaurateur, and someone else whose only role in the film is to be a failed cook at home. His flatmate is an amiable but dysfunctional person. The only men who are remotely in charge of their lives have small walk-on parts: the PR man, the concierge at the Ritz. By contrast, the women are strong and resolute. Julia Roberts as the beautiful Anna directs the relationship with Hugh Grant from the moment they meet. Grant's sister announces to the weird flatmate that she has decided to marry him. Grant is allowed one small piece of control when he rejects Roberts's final advances, but even then his mind is changed for him. This doesn't worry me; it's part of the comic vocabulary these days, and few men objected to the old Hollywood stereotype of the loveable but ditsy female. But I left thinking that the real male fantasy embedded in Notting Hill is not that a gorgeous film star will fall helplessly in love with us, but that one day a powerful woman will pick us up and force us to do something with our pointless and benighted lives. The Queen Mother I have been reading for Radio 4's A Good Read a new edition of Michael Frayn's finest work. Frayn was a hero to me as a boy, and three days a week I would run downstairs to catch his Miscellany column in the Guardian. If you had told me that one day I, too, would have a column in the paper, I would have been thrilled beyond belief; if I ever thought it was one-fifth as good as Frayn's, I would be in a state of perpetual bliss. The extraordinary thing is the way that his characters have lasted over nearly 40 years. Christopher Smoothe, the minister of Chance and Speculation, is in the cabinet now. Rollo Swavely, the well-known public relations consultant, is interviewed these days every time a politician sleeps with someone not his wife, and H Spencer Upcreep, the oleaginous author of Through A Royal Keyhole, appears to have returned this week to write about the Queen Mother in the Daily Telegraph. I am especially indebted to the latter series for clearing up any anxieties we might have about the Queen Mother's remarkable spending habits, which include imbibing vast quantities of the finest wines and spirits. \"She inhabits what is effectively her own private kingdom, unrestricted by obvious financial constraints,\" we learn. She has, apparently, \"five or six cars with a special series of number plates, three chauffeurs and five cooks.\" The explanation, this latterday Upcreep vouchsafes, is that \"she has a very high view of the duties of the Royal Family. She feels that Britain is Great Britain, and that therefore ours must be no banana court.\" So that's the reason: she's doing it for us. Every time she pops a jeroboam of champagne, or chooses which of the five or six cars with special number plates should be driven by which of the three chauffeurs to the next of her several residences, it is in our interest, in order to enhance the prestige of our country. Such devotion to duty is impressive. But I can't help but wonder whether this altruistic consumption should be in private. Wouldn't it be better if we were allowed to stand, perhaps in a convenient minstrels' gallery overlooking the dining room, to watch this doughty work on our behalf? Or if foreign tourists were bussed to the kitchens to see her order delicacies from one of the five cooks? That would rub Johnny Foreigner's nose in his own inferiority, and so get even more value for the taxpayer's pound. Why I don't play golf I was in a golf club this week, for a birthday party which I enjoyed hugely. But a study of the notice board reminded me why, even if I thought golf the most fascinating game in the world, I could never join a club. One bulletin read: \"Social and Golf Committee [a strange priority, I thought at the time.] The committee has decided that tailored shorts may be worn on the course and in the clubhouse, up to 6pm. If these are to be worn with short socks, the socks should be predominately white in colour.\" There are, I suppose, people to whom such details are of consuming importance, and I don't want anything to do with them. Capital punishment Listening to Capital Radio with my daughter the other day, I reflected again why British disc jockeys, with obvious exceptions such as John Peel and the late Kenny Everett, are such morons. The DJ was wittering on aimlessly as they do, and somehow an oxbow in his stream of consciousness caused him to drift over to a recent horrible and much-reported crime. \"Well, there's one thing,\" he mused, \"at least they've got the guy.\" That is such a blatant contempt of court that I won't repeat what the crime was. But it made me wonder why so many Spam-for-brains people like him are allowed on to our airwaves. In America being a disc jockey is quite a high calling. Howard Stern, a bore on TV, is a tremendous comic talent on radio. The top DJs in big cities can earn millions a year. I suppose the answer is that the comic talents here go into stand-up, and hence to their own TV series. Capital, Radio 1 and the rest are thought terminally uncool, so attract only the dross that's left. Heaven and Hull For a billion pounds, Sir Norman Foster is going to turn Hull into a new version of Barcelona, including a covered Las Ramblas-style mall. But Hull doesn't need to be any more foreign than it is. I was raised there, and leaving Hull seemed like entering a less exotic world. The white call boxes of the only municipal phone company. The scarlet summer blazers of my school. Streets with names like The Land Of Green Ginger. The grandly titled Paragon station (only one direct train a day to London, now). The past citizenry, including Marlowe and Wilberforce. The dome-top buses, able to pass through the Bar at nearby Beverley, one of the loveliest towns in Britain. The last time I was in Hull I saw a bus stop near the station, bearing the four words: \"Board here for Rotterdam\", and it took no effort of the imagination to see the bus gliding with its cargo of unsurprised passengers into the North Sea, until the waves covered its sugarloaf top."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/1999/jul/10/cookislands","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-10T18:28:48Z","webTitle":"In your dreams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1999/jul/10/cookislands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/1999/jul/10/cookislands","fields":{"headline":"In your dreams","bodyText":"\"Gee,\" sighed the clean-cut young American through a squish of chewing gum as he and his gang of twentysomethings in the seats behind me joined hands, \"let's pray we come through okay\". And they did just that - prayed. And came through okay. We were flying at 10,500ft over the South Pacific in a twin-engined, 18-seat Bandeirante turbo-prop between Aitutaki and Rarotonga, two of the 15 dots on the map known collectively - although these are up to 1,000 kilometres apart - as the Cook Islands. The weather at this altitude was anything but pacific. Hail beat on the roof and the stubby wings of the little aircraft, yet the propellers kept revolving in determined rainbow-coloured arcs. The veteran Kiwi pilot barely brushed the control column with one sun-freckled hand to keep the plane more or less steady. His young German co-pilot - fastened into knife-pleat tropical shorts and Arctic-white, knee-length socks - lounged back in his seat, raising his RayBans to check the classified ads in the back of the local newspaper. Without much help (I guess) from the American God - there are much older gods in this part of the world - Rarotonga hove into view through a sodden density of tropical cloud. The pilot banked the little aircraft steeply and dropped us routinely on to the runway. I dote on this anecdote for two reasons: firstly, because it reminds us that there is no such thing as a tropical paradise, no matter what travel guides and tourist authorities claim; and, secondly, because the Cook Islands have been made to seem so safe - a kind of South Seas Pontins - that anything remotely out of the blue, such as a minor storm, appears to threaten life, limb and the pursuit of vacational happiness. Rarotonga (pop 11,000) - the principal Cook Island, and arrival point for nearly everyone that comes this way (mostly New Zealanders, Australians and Americans) - might just be the home of that American God my gum-chewing travelling companions were beseeching out of the depth of the storm. Although rather beautiful at core, this palm-fringed, coral-laced volcanic island is held in check by a tight knot of bungalows and diners, shops and petrol stations that look as if they have been culled from the pages of an American issue of Watchtower. You know those pictures that Jehovah's Witnesses show you of the kingdom to come in which everyone has been turned into a plaid-clad American c.1955 and lives in the sort of bungalows featured in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind... Superficially, Rarotonga looks a bit like this. Which happens to be great if you are a New Zealander because it must feel like home (not more than four hours away) with the added benefit of warm white beaches, girls bringing breadfruit (whatever that is) and a lifestyle as laid back as a comatose sloth. I happened to feel like a fish out of water, and reached for my maps. The small islands looked more interesting, largely because I hoped that they would be a lot less developed than the nominally independent, yet NZ-dependent, Rarotonga. Yes, there are things I enjoyed on the main island: the lusty singing by Maori ladies, complete with home-made straw hats, in the island's handsome old missionary churches on Sunday morning, interrupted by prolix reverends preaching hellfire and damnation; lying in a hammock listening to the sigh of the sea; walking into the slippery hills at night to gaze at the unfamiliar southern stars. Most other events are plotted along well-trodden tourist trails. The \"island nights\", when lively, drum-led music is accompanied by beefy blokes strutting their stuff and smooth-skinned girls wiggling in grass skirts, should be fun, but you feel - unlike you do, say, listening to the street music of Cuba or Bolivia, of the Cape Flats and Soweto - uncomfortably uninvolved. Sat at tables, you can barely sway much less dance. The truth is that the islanders, many of whom have left (as their ancestors did by canoe) for New Zealand (more jobs, better pay), live a suburban lifestyle or, if poorer than that, get by in a world framed by cars and mopeds, supermarkets rather than street markets, and bungalows rather than the straw cabins of my imagination. To be honest, the Isle of Wight is a lot prettier and far more old fashioned. So to my maps. The island I liked, not too far but a world away from Rarotonga, was Mangaia (pop 700 and falling). This was much more how I imagined a South Sea island. It has few beaches to speak of, but in my mind it is Treasure Island. Yes, I know Stevenson's fiction was meant to be the other side of the world, but it really doesn't matter: some islands are magical; others aren't. Mangaia is. You land on a strip by the sea, the plane churning up clouds of wet sand as it bounces to a slithering halt. A straggle of flower-clad islanders arrives to see what's going on. Jan and Tu Kristensson pull up on put-put motorbikes and we wobble our way along the island's main road (a mud track) between dense foliage and a straggling village lined by lazy dogs and masticating goats, down to what's grandly called the Are Moana Hotel (one of the few places to stay on Mangaia; tel: 34-278; fax: 34-279). This turns out to be a necklace of hairy huts gathered in a hollow around a big hut that serves as a bar, restaurant and the Kristensson's home, although all these words are too grand to describe a delightful, low-key set-up; a kind of ecologist's dream. As there was a dog to walk, superb bird and bat life, glorious butterflies (by day) and moths (by night), I was as happy here as a sandboy (whatever that is). The Kristenssons are the sort of hoteliers, or just the sort of people, you could hang out with for weeks. Jan, an electrical engineer from Stockholm in an another life, sailed from Sweden to the Cook Islands more than 20 years ago. He liked what he saw, set up home with Tu, an island girl, and has stayed. While Jan took me out to explore underwater caves (something I would never have dared to do without his matter-of-fact confidence in my ability not to be scared - \"it's no problem for you\"), Tu and her relatives (everyone on the island is someone's brother, sister, cousin, aunt) made straw hats and necklaces and dinners of fish and coconut and sweet potatoes. In the evening Tere Taukume, a friend (and relative) came with his wife to sing island songs, some which he had written himself. Only the voracious mosquitoes did anything to diminish days and nights that were as relaxed and authentic as I had found Rarotonga uptight (you might not) and touristy. One morning Tere took me on a hike (you should be fairly fit, agile and unfazed by heights for this) up into the mountain caves of Te Ana o Kakaia (The Cave of the Tern) and the Cave of Ngauru's Final Resting Place. These are magical places, real Famous Five stuff, with secret passages, sudden views across the tropical lushness of the island's untouched interior, terrifying gorges you feel such a coward making such a fuss about inching around (well, there is the reality of immediate death several hundred feet below if you slip; not that Tere would let you cross if your courage failed you) and such darkness that it is hard to imagine that islanders hiding from cannibal kinsmen lived in them for years. Tere is a great guide and now offers tours (NZ$35; tel: 34-223) to any of the island's comparatively rare visitors. What I loved was the way he took a copy of the superbly-observed From Darkness to Light in Polynesia by the Victorian missionary William Gill, who spent 20 years in Mangaia, and read out excerpts of tales that took place in the exact places we walked and climbed. Tere had the knack of making Gill's stories sound as if they happened yesterday. And, with his intimate knowledge of the island, he could find exact trees, precise rocks where an island princess was burned to death by her captives, and a young boy hid when he was fleeing from a cannibal warrior. I felt - happily - like a child being read to. Guided tours just aren't like this. I'm loath to say it's because Mangaia is unspoilt - it sounds like such a cliché - yet it's true. Filled with tales of cannibals, my clothes muddied and more than slightly foxed, I came back down from the caves to walk through the astonishingly clear sea, stepping between basking sea-cucumbers (which the locals like to eat raw; I couldn't) and almost catching fish in my hands. I was sad to take off from the island, ploughing through damp sand, wondering if I would lift before the sea swallowed my tiny plane. Back in \"Raro\", which seemed like downtown Manhattan after Mangaia, I reached for my maps again. I had only time for a day trip to another small island and so allowed myself to be swept up in (aaggh) an organised tour. Well, it would only be for 12 hours and I felt man enough to cope (just). I flew to Aitutaki in the plane that would be caught in that hail storm later in the day. Actually, the best thing about the trip was the storm. It gathered all day, biding its time, until my tour party, aboard a catamaran, entered the magnificent blue lagoon around which Aitutaki curls. The brooding heavens opened, and how. The rain was magnificent. Now I would have liked to have been at the wheel of an 18th-century sloop with Captain Cook (but not Captain Bligh, who also famously came this way with Fletcher Christian and the Bounty). However, I had to settle for a diesel-powered catamaran, and we limped back to base, the sun-worshippers among us, for whom Pacific islands equal sun, sun and sun, looking decidedly green. I'm not quite sure how to leave the Cook Islands. There are many of them, and I think that if I could sail (which I can't), I'd enjoy exploring them, particularly the remote northern group which are all but uninhabited. If I had the money, I'd equally enjoy hiring a plane for a week and trying a few more of those sandy landing strips. You can fly almost as free as a frigate bird here. Even then, I'm still unsure. How much you enjoy Pacific islands is surely dependent upon your expectations. There's no point being unrealistic. For the most part, the best of the islands - at least the most physically beautiful - are playgrounds for honeymooning couples and laid-back people who like to hang out. Good luck to them. I know the world that Gauguin, Stevenson and Rupert Brooke all dreamed of doesn't really exist and that today islanders follow the latest soap operas and pine for McDonald's. This isn't meant to be cynical, but my visit to the Cook Islands, on the way back from Australia to California, reminded me that when we travel we chase dreams. I missed that dream in Rarotonga and Aitutaki, but caught it in Mangaia, although even that wouldn't have been the same if it hadn't been for the intelligent hospitality of a renegade Swedish electrical engineer who had chased and hopefully found much the same dream 20 years before me. As for those young, gum-chewing Americans, I hope they made it through to the islands of their dreams, too. They certainly prayed hard enough. As hard as the hail that fell from the heavily pregnant skies above the Cook Islands. The practicals The cheapest way to visit the Cook Islands is as a stopover en route to New Zealand or Australia - this usually cuts about £100 off the normal direct fare. Air New Zealand is the only long-haul airline flying into the Cook Islands with regular connections off its daily flights from Heathrow to Los Angeles through to Rarotonga. Return fares cost from £904 (plus £27.30 in UK taxes) from August to September, and the whole of November, and include the Cook Islands as a stopover en route to New Zealand. Air New Zealand's South Pacific Go As You Please stopover programme offers rates at all major hotels in the Cook Islands together with tours to Aitutaki (020 8741 2299)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/1999/jul/11/uk.politicalnews4","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-10T23:33:09Z","webTitle":"Tories torn over English flag-waving","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jul/11/uk.politicalnews4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jul/11/uk.politicalnews4","fields":{"headline":"Tories torn over English flag-waving","bodyText":"Broadcaster Jeremy Paxman once declared that 'an Englishman can be defined as someone who lives on an island in the North Sea governed by Scots'. He was joking, of course, but like the best political jokes, it was too close for comfort. Three hundred years ago, England had a Parliament whose members had beheaded one Scottish king and sent another into exile. But there will be no English Parliament under a Labour Government, nor even under a Conservative Government headed by William Hague, although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now have their assemblies. A growing number of Tories believe the English feel aggrieved about this. Rebel Tory MP Teresa Gorman, who campaigned for an English Parliament, claims: 'We see the passions of patriotism beginning to stir in the breasts of those who live in England. I hope the people of England will stand up for their right to be treated equally with the rest of the United Kingdom.' The question the Tories have not settled is how far they can risk pushing this issue without being linked to the nasty undercurrent of English nationalism typified by the white racist soccer hooligan wrapped in a Union Jack. One idea thrown up by the party strategists is that the history curriculum in English schools should be turned into an election issue. If Scottish children will be taught a more Scottish version of history, emphasising the prowess of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace, and Welsh children are to learn more about the likes of Owen Glendower, perhaps English children should be brought up to glory in the victory at Agincourt and admire King Edward I, conqueror of the Celts, who was portrayed in the film Braveheart as a cold-blooded, tyrannical killer. Underlying this is a fatalistic view that the UK has been damaged beyond repair by Labour's constitutional experiments, and that Tory policy must reflect that harsh fact. David Maclean, one of the few Tory MPs born and bred in Scotland - his Penrith seat is not too far south of the border - says: 'Let us make no bones about it - Scotland will be independent sooner rather than later. One cannot be 95 per cent pregnant: one cannot be 95 per cent independent.' His young political adviser, George Osborne, Tory candidate in the normally safe Tory seat of Tatton, has been convinced by voter reactions there that English grievances are having an impact they did not have before devolution. Others, like Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude, are very wary of approaching the issue. Some Tories see the 'English question' as dangerous territory for a party that projects itself as the protector of the UK. One leading Tory historian groaned aloud at the mention of the subject. 'Hague isn't going to get into this, is he? I'm sorry, I can't talk to you on the record: all my thoughts on this are too negative,' he said. This week Hague will indeed 'get into this' and make his first foray into a new arena with a speech on England and the constitution, to be delivered to the Centre for Policy Studies on Thursday. Hague's instinct appears to be to play safe. He will reject the idea of an English Parliament, and is expected to concentrate on sound but dry issues such as the fact that the Scots and Welsh are the recipients of more government spending per head than the English, and that Scotland in particular has more MPs per head of the population than the English. His environment spokesman, John Redwood, has vowed the Tories will dismantle regional government. No doubt he will mention the six Scots in the Cabinet, including three of the four most senior office-holders - Gordon Brown, Robin Cook and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine - and the extraordinary fact that the Transport Minister Helen Liddell, a Scot whose seat is in Lanarkshire, has more authority over English motorways and airports than over the traffic system in Glasgow. This is an example of the so-called 'West Lothian' question posed 20 years ago by the Labour MP for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell. This asks why a Scottish MP should be allowed to vote on the running of hospitals and schools in England while English MPs would have no such say over devolved Scottish institutions. 'The slow candle of English nationalism is well and truly lit,' Dalyell warns. When asked what Labour could do about it, he answered in two words. One of them was unprintable, the other was 'all'."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/1999/jul/11/featuresreview.review6","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-10T23:33:55Z","webTitle":"Red all over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/jul/11/featuresreview.review6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/jul/11/featuresreview.review6","fields":{"headline":"Red all over","bodyText":"Bolshoi Ballet London Coliseum, London WC1 Royal Ballet Sadler's Wells, London EC2 This month is packed with ballet, as the Bolshoi and Royal Ballet companies field star dancers in clashing repertoires. Both companies competed with Giselle last week, though the Bolshoi was persuaded to open with La Bayadere (which returns at the end of this week), a doubtful decision, since the Kirov has already brought its lovely production several times and the Bolshoi brooks no rivals. It still wants to be regarded as the biggest and best ballet company in the world - a Soviet boast that was always questionable. According to my 1981 Bolshoi Ballet souvenir book, the Moscow-based company had to be the greatest because it 'reflected the aesthetic principles of the socialist epoch, introducing a new depth of content into the genre of ballet'. Yuri Grigorovich was in charge then, as he had been since 1964. He was eventually ousted four years ago but his legacy lingers on. He has threatened to exact money from the current management for presenting his productions in London. Of the seven ballets on offer this month, three were mounted by him and three by Vladimir Vasiliev, the company's former star who is now artistic director of the Bolshoi Theatre. Whatever the outcome of the legal threat, the fact remains that both men are suspect producers of the classics. They want to leave their signatures on nineteenth- century 'heritage' ballets, adding and adapting choreography in the guise of 'deepening the content' of old favourites: Swan Lake, Giselle, La Bayadere. The fantasy worlds they place on stage are bizarre concoctions: 'new' motivations for old steps make little dramatic sense; extra solos for central characters add nothing; but the performances still work because the dancers (and their coaches) believe in the ballets. Nadezhda Gracheva, the opening-night heroine in Grigorovich's La Bayadere, gives the role of Nikiya tragic dimensions. Her solos in the first part of the ballet are shaped by emotion, not aimed for bravura effect. She can be simple, like her mentor, the great Galina Ulanova, who died last year. Ulanova was at Gracheva's side when the Bolshoi last came to London in 1993. Their season at the Albert Hall was savaged for presenting chunks of ballets out of context: the dancing was soulless but superb. Gracheva was 24, beautifully schooled but unable to emote, in spite of Ulanova's urging. Now 30, the same age as Darcey Bussell, her blue eyes sparkle with passion, her whole body expresses joy or despair in the grand, old-fashioned style the Royal Ballet can never hope to emulate. Inna Petrova as Nikiya's rival, the Rajah's daughter Gamzatti, has none of her nuances. Grigorovich beefed up Gamzatti's role with extra solos (Minkus's music is chopped up by the yard) which reveal, redundantly, that she is a spoiled brute. No wonder that Andrei Uvarov as Solor is perturbed at being married off to her, especially since her jump in no way matches his. His elevation is not as spectacular as it was at the Albert Hall but his stage presence is much improved. The corps are no match for the Kirov's, even though they pulled themselves together for the Kingdom of the Shades act. They snake spectacularly down the Himalayas, in a more dramatic staging than the Kirov's purer symphonic account. Gracheva pulls out the technical stops and misses the spirituality - but since Grigorovich has botched the ending, she cannot entice her man to a higher realm. He dies of an opium overdose or a badly projected rockfall; either way, no apotheosis for him. Vasiliev has interfered needlessly with the ending of Giselle by having the nearly-dead hero whizz radiantly round the forest to the closing music. Sergei Filin was doing fine until then, hanging on to a traditional interpretation which complemented Svetlana Lunkina's tender, young Giselle. Lunkina, at 20 the most junior of the Bolshoi principals, first danced the role straight out of school in Vasiliev's 1997 staging. Although the production has ghastly touches (with hideous designs by Sergei Barkhin), Lunkina has inherited the wisdom of her predecessors in the role. She knows who Giselle is and how she should dance; the mechanics are still visible in the second act, but although her fluency stutters, her intent is strong and clear. The verdict so far, then, is that the Bolshoi's heart is still true. Its young dancers are in a recognisable line of succession, faithfully coached in interpretations that resist the ineptness of their staging. In contrast, the curiosity of the week was the Royal Ballet's Giselle, its guest artists, Sylvie Guillem and Laurent Hilaire, out of kilter with the production. Undeclared war was going on, with the Royal troupe, led by Belinda Hatley, stating that they did it like this (and to hell with the Bolshoi), while Guillem chose to dance to a different drum. Her volatile, out-of-period Giselle, long, red hair flying, cracks when her view of the world is shattered. In her self-absorption, she appears not to have noticed that her noble lover belongs to an earlier century. Hilaire's Albrecht is grandly stylised, which Peter Wright's production is not. Inconsistently in Act II, Guillem reverts to a fairly conventional account of Giselle as a Wili - high extensions excepted - instead of developing her Act I reinterpretation. In spite of the pulling power of Guillem's name, the Royal Ballet should fare better with the home-grown Giselles who take over this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/11/hunting.ruralaffairs2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-11T17:20:02Z","webTitle":"Should we ban hunting?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/11/hunting.ruralaffairs2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jul/11/hunting.ruralaffairs2","fields":{"headline":"Should we ban hunting?","bodyText":"Yes My dining room curtains and my place mats are covered with hunting scenes, something which puzzles those visitors who are aware of my very strong anti-hunting views, but I explain that I consider the hunt a colourful feature of Olde England and that in Olde England it firmly belongs. A meet may be a splendid and traditional sight but I find no place for it in a modern, humane society. My opposition to hunting with packs of hounds has nothing to do with the fact of the kill but everything to do with the cruelty of the chase. I do not object to shooting or stalking. I object, simply, to the prolonging of terror. When the fox or deer is chased it is running for its life; when the hounds are closing in it will be aware of it, especially in the immediate run up to the kill. Anyone who has seen an animal cowering must concede that it knows fear. Yet the better the chase the better the sport for those who hunt. We have regulations governing slaughter houses, farming and transport. The RSPCA can enter peoples' homes. Cruelty to animals is a crime. Yet chasing an animal to exhaustion and tearing it to pieces is enshrined as quintessentially British. According to public opinion surveys, the British would rather it were not. There is a great deal of false argument being put forward by the pro-hunting lobby. They claim variously that those who oppose their so-called sport are merely a majority oppressing a minority, townsfolk ignorant of country ways or motivated by class hatred. They claim hunting is necessary to control foxes and that if hunting is abolished foxes will be killed by other, crueller methods. None of these claims bear serious examination. If minority sports must be protected at all costs then we should argue for a return to cockfighting or bearbaiting, even duelling. The issue is not that the recreation is practised by a minority but that it is acceptable and morally defensible. If it is wrong, it does not matter that it is done by a few or by many. The town versus country claim is irresponsible for it attempts to divide Britain. My constituency covers both town and country and I find plenty of rural opposition to hunting. I myself come from a family with a tradition both of walking and riding to hounds and I have heard farmers whisper that they would cheerfully see hunting banned but don't like to say so. They also expound, in more audible tones, on the depredations the hunt can cause to their land and its produce. As for the argument that hunting controls foxes, more than 10 times as many are shot as killed by hunts. Already shooting is the major means of control, yet this is held up as a dreadful alternative to hunting as if it did not already exist on a wide scale. Equally dishonest is the claim that poisoning or gassing would be alternatives when both are illegal. Other arguments are deployed to tug at the heartstrings. Hounds will be put down in thousands. Yet this did not materialise when otter hunting was abolished and how many foxhounds or staghounds live their natural lifespan in any case? Then we are told that, if more foxes are shot, it will result in hundreds dying slowly from wounds. Yet the RSPCA report that out of nearly 1,700 sick and injured foxes dealt with in 1994, only one had pellet injuries. Hunting has its casualties too, both human and horse. The fox, says the hunting fraternity, is cruel. I am often asked if I have ever seen a hen coop after Reynard has been. What does this prove? That we should take our own standards from the animal kingdom? Besides, it is not as if I were opposed to killing foxes. I am not: merely to prolonging the business for recreation. It is probably valid to claim that the abolition of hunting would result in some unemployment, but that alone cannot determine the issue. The abolition of crime would also result in unemployment, as would the abolition of ill health. I understand the enjoyment of the riding involved in hunting. I used to ride myself. However, drag hunting can provide a good ride, reduce the risk of injury to horse and rider and confine activity to those parts of his land the farmer indicates. It can also employ the hounds. I have only heard one honest defence of hunting, from a fellow MP who said: 'Of course it's cruel, but I enjoy it.' That is what would-be vegetarians, including me, say when explaining why they still eat meat. But while we can kill cattle and sheep humanely, there is no way of making the chase humane. 'Do ye ken John Peel' is a terrific song. The pack in full cry is a magnificent sight. Hunting pink, stirrup cups and the sound of the horn will be something to describe to one's grandchildren as part of history. But it is history and not the future. Hunting is rightly doomed. It is time for the last 'tally ho!' Ann Widdecombe, MP, is shadow Home Secretary No Let's for a moment leave aside the welfare of the damned fox because we can be sure that Tony Blair's sudden announcement on Question Time that his Government would introduce a Bill against the use of dogs for hunting has little to do with the well-being of animals. It has everything, however, to do with the health of the Labour Party and John Prescott's heroic new role as the party's radical conscience. Someone at the top made a hasty calculation - probably Campbell or Mandelson, possibly even an extemporaneous Prime Minister - that a Bill against hunting would make Old Labour feel that New Labour still possessed the appetite to stomp the county toff. Both sides of the party will combine in a short crusade of histrionic self-righteousness that will satisfy the need for the party to be moving forward on a superior moral agenda. Whatever you may feel about this, you have to admit the boys at Number 10 haven't lost their touch. The reintroduction of the fox hunting issue so soon after the Foster Bill was allowed to peter out not only to throws the party into a radical clinch but creates a huge distraction on the political scene. Hunting absorbs the country's attention, although it is now so layered with meaning and prejudice that the real issues have been lost. Yet even as we recognise this, something snaps in each of us and we set about the argument with Lilliputian gusto, fulminating about the rights of animals, the backwardness of country people and the arrogance of urban politicians. The last time round I lost count of friends falling out over the supper table, all flushed with indignation and rendered wordless by passion. So as Jack Straw makes his announcement in Parliament on Monday let's remind ourselves that there are more important things to think about - Irish peace and Balkan horrors, to say nothing of the creaking performance of so many public services. Having said this, I now engage in the ritual. The idea of fox hunting is not for me particularly pleasant. I don't much like riding and I have never chased any animal with a view to watching its death. I fish occasionally and used to shoot, but have no ability in the first and long ago lost the taste for the second. I have never been thrilled by watching what Ted Hughes called the 'tiny deaths' of wild animals but I admit to enjoying the challenge of fly fishing and the beauty of the places it takes me to. So it is the ancillary return that gives me a lot of pleasure and I imagine this is the same for those who hunt. The jumping, the riding at top speed, the horseback flirtation and the smell and beauty of landscape in winter are all important parts of the experience. I am in favour of bloodsports and the freedom to pursue them, partly because I know that our attitudes are hopelessly inconsistent when it comes to animal welfare, but mostly because the campaign against hunting is fuelled by wilful misconceptions about the class and character of the people who do it. They are not, as portrayed, exclusively upper class or right wing. They are neither cowardly nor especially cruel and they are no more arrogant than the average New Labour policy maker. Added to this is the ignorance about the importance of hunting to the fabric and relationships of the countryside. Most urban eyes swivel to the ceiling when this is mentioned but it is no exaggeration to say that the business of hunting - the horse trading, the training, the breeding of dogs, the veterinary visits, the meets, the gossip, the endless horse chat - represents a large part of the social activity of rural areas. Believe me, to ban hunting will add to the depressed state of many farming people who struggle away to make a life in the country: it will add to the emptiness and listlessness of rural Britain. And so to the damned fox. One way or another the fox is going to get killed. If the Government bans hunting, it is sure to make arrangements for the legal dispatch of tens of thousands of foxes by bullet. This will be done at night with search lights and doubtless dogs will be involved. The slaughter has to take place because the fox is such a successful breeder it would become much a bigger pest without culling. It must be plain to the most ardent campaigner that the heart of the matter is not about animal welfare. How could it be when the moment we wield our cutlery we condone the breeding and slaughter in appalling circumstances of huge numbers of pigs, sheep, cattle and poultry. No, it is about depriving a small group of people of a pleasure that is deemed by an unreflective urban majority to be immoral. On this basis, therefore, bans on fishing and shooting must follow. But they won't because far too many people - that is to say a politically important interest group - will protest at the bossy curtailment of their fun. Those that support hunting are not yet beaten and, judging by the almost separatist anger of last year's countryside rally, they are not going to roll over because Tony Blair needs a sideshow to divert his fractious party. They will understand that this attack on their way of life and their pleasure is a shady political manoeuvre. Their protest will be long and loud. My fear is that this will suit the Prime Minister's purpose too well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/jul/13/healthandwellbeing.health3","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-13T15:23:49Z","webTitle":"Bigger than Viagra?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/jul/13/healthandwellbeing.health3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/jul/13/healthandwellbeing.health3","fields":{"headline":"Bigger than Viagra?","bodyText":"Modern medicine still relies on chance and serendipity far more than it cares to admit. Viagra, the prescription drug phenomenon of the past two years, was originally developed as a treatment for heart disease and it was only when users reported their impotence was a thing of the past that the manufacturers realised they had created a golden goose. If reports from America are to be believed, a new drug that has properties also discovered by accident may take the United Kingdom by storm next year, and could be set to rival the success of Viagra. If approved, it may also go some way in helping health professionals to achieve their goal of reducing the number of premature deaths in this country from heart disease, as set out in the recent department of health white paper on the health of the nation. Originally developed as an antidepressant, the drug - bupropion hydrochloride - was licensed in the US three years ago under the name Wellbutrin. Its main marketing point was that it did not greatly interfere with sexual function, something most antidepressants are notorious for affecting. During trials of the drug, and quite by chance, it was realized that people taking Wellbutrin were finding it far easier to stop smoking than those who were not using it. Early reports suggested that they were not craving for cigarettes as they normally did, and had fewer withdrawal symptoms on stopping their habit. Once the the company involved, Glaxo Wellcome, had picked up on this aspect of the drug, it began further trials specifically looking at the effectiveness of the drug as an anti-smoking aid. The results of this comparative clinical study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March this year, and make for impressive reading. Just under 900 smokers were involved, all of whom smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. They were split into four groups - those taking a dummy pill or placebo, those taking bupropion, those using a nicotine patch plus a bupropion tablet, and those using a nicotine patch alone. After 12 months, 15% of those on the dummy pill were still not smoking. This was only marginally worse than the 16% using only nicotine patches, but nearly 31% of smokers taking bupropion had stopped. The surprising statistic, however, was in the group using both patches and bupropion - a success rate of 35%, more than double the usual rate seen in smokers trying to give up. Just as important, side effects appeared to be minor, with few people having to stop the drug because of them. A dry mouth and insomnia were reported by users, but little else. People with a history of seizures or eating disorders should not take bupropion, but otherwise most smokers will be valid candidates for such treatment, which is the first such non-nicotine prescription available. This combination of effective results and low side effects led to the drug being licensed in the US as an aid to stopping smoking, under the name Zyban. This has now been prescribed to some 3m Americans, over 1m of whom have stopped smoking. Some of these ex-smokers who had kicked the habit by taking Zyban appeared on the BBC Watchdog Healthcheck programme in March this year. One of them, Keith Webber, was quoted as saying: \"I was thoroughly addicted to cigarettes, which seemed to be a part of me. Zyban does make it easier, does calm that irritability, it keeps you on a far more even keel in dealing with the world.\" Another recovered nicotine addict, Paula Covey, said: \"As sure as I'm sitting here I will never have another cigarette _ it's just a better life now.\" Attempts are now being made to secure a licence across the EU, with the Dutch authorities taking the lead through the regulatory hoops. The drug could be available in this country early next year. Rob Cohen, therapeutic and science communications manager of Glaxo Wellcome, says: \"With success rates double that of nicotine replacement therapy, Zyban, upon approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities, will provide an effective weapon for many people in their battle against nicotine addiction. \"A combination of Zyban and the nicotine replacement patch has shown a small benefit over Zyban alone, but it should be remembered that it is the addiction to nicotine that drives us to smoke. If you can overcome this addiction without feeding it through another route then the longer-term chances of keeping cigarette-free may be increased.\" The prospect of a new popular prescription drug arriving on the market will inevitably lead to much debate over funding, and the government will be keen to avoid another debacle like that over prescription of Viagra. Costs are in the region of £2 per day, but as Clive Bates, director of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) points out: \"The big question here is whether the government will allow doctors to prescribe Zyban on the NHS at the normal prescription charge. If not, the market could be severely limited. If they do allow it, then the demand could be enormous - of over 13m smokers in the UK, 70% would like to quit. \"I believe such treatments are extremely cost-effective because it is much cheaper to help people to quit smoking rather than pour money into the treatment of cancer or heart disease later in life.\" Nicotine addiction is a medically recognised condition; more than 1bn people smoke worldwide, and 3m died from smoking-related conditions last year. The figure is expected to rise to more than 10m a year by 2025. Global sales of products to help smokers quit will exceed £500m this year, and a non-nicotine medicine may be welcomed with open arms by smokers who have repeatedly failed to give up using standard nicotine replacement treatments. And while at first glance such a treatment might appear to have a lower success rate than, say, Viagra, the large number of smokers means that there are still far more potential patients - of both sexes - who may benefit. And there is a promising postscript to this story. At the same time as the trials of Zyban, an American psychiatrist - Dr Kishore Gadde from the Duke University in North Carolina - found that obese depressed women who were given the drug in its capacity as an antidepressant began to lose weight quicker than those not taking it, by a factor of about three. Early trials showed this to be a consistent weight loss and the women reported they felt satisfied with smaller portions of food, so ate less. Although it remains unclear exactly why this should be the case, it is probably linked with the neurotransmitters that are responsible for the craving and reward cycle linked to eating. \"This is not a flash in the pan,\" says Dr Gadde. \"These patients have continued with their weight loss over a year and there do not appear to be withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking the drug.\" Bigger trials will take place later this year, and this weight loss aspect of bupropion remains at an early stage of development, but there is already excitement in the pharmaceutical industry about it. A drug that works on depression and helps you stop smoking and may help you lose weight into the bargain? It sounds like a marketing dream. But as the drug regulatory authorities continue their deliberations, it is probably only a matter of time before pleas for the next \"wonder drug\" are heard by British doctors. One thing can be sure though - decisions over who will get it and who will pay for it will be a headache for doctors, patients, and politicians alike."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/14/sarahboseley","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-14T01:30:58Z","webTitle":"Cheating, lying and sleeping with the boss.

Is this the young person's route to success?","bodyText":"Young people today are under so much pressure to succeed that some admit they would lie, cheat or sleep with the boss if it would help them get on. Relationships inside the family, with partners and with friends all take second place in the lives of these striving young people who want success apparently at any cost. This upward drive puts them under great strain. Between the ages of 18 and 24, one in five thinks having a career or getting qualifications is more important than their family. Nearly two-thirds (58%) say they feel under pressure to be a success - among women the figure is 61% - and 17% feel very pressured. With surprising honesty, a substantial minority revealed in a survey for the Bread for Life campaign just how low they would sink in pursuit of success - which to 70% of them is defined as wealth and career. Out of nearly 1,000 young people questioned, 13% said they would sleep with the boss if it might advance their prospects. Even more - 17% - admitted they would be willing to do something ethically and morally wrong. A quarter said they would be willing to be dishonest. Those who acknowledged feeling under pressure to succeed were twice as likely to sleep with the boss - 16% compared with 8% of the rest. But the young people drew the line at stabbing their colleagues in the back on the way up the career ladder. The self-imposed stress that careerist young people were under was also damaging their health. Those who admitted feeling under pressure were twice as likely to skip meals, 50% to smoke excessively and 36% more likely to spend beyond their means. Young women (51%) were more likely than young men (37%) to sacrifice a healthy lifestyle by failing to exercise and eat properly. Leisure time - sports and hobbies - were considered the least important aspect of the young people's lives. Those who felt unsuccessful were over three times more likely (7%) to have felt suicidal than those who felt successful (2%). Helen Wilkinson, a member of the advisory council of the think tank Demos, said at the launch of the research yesterday that women were now falling into the hitherto predominantly male trap of sacrificing everything for success at work. \"They are in danger of emulating the male model and sacrificing their health and their relationships on the altar of career success. It is time for young women to feminise their workplaces and strive for a feminine definition of success,\" she said. The study was commissioned by the Bread for Life campaign from ORC International, a market research company, which interviewed 950 young people, selected as a representative sample of 18-24 year-olds in the UK. The industry-funded campaign aims to encourage young people to eat more bread as part of a healthy diet. Young women, said Ms Wilkinson, were \"hungry for success\" and wanted \"the keys to the masculine kingdom\". But success at work still seemed to be intimately connected to physical perfection, she said. Media interest in the fulsome figure of actress Kate Winslet, dubbed Titanic Kate by the tabloids, or prying into the weight loss of Calista Flockhart who played Ally McBeal in the US television series, ensured that girls got the message as impressionable teenagers. \"They learn from a young age that even our most successful career women never quite come up to scratch. They also learn that they will be judged quite differently from men,\" she said. These images of physical perfection, combined with young women's hunger for professional success are \"the dynamic driving the rapid increase in 'eating disorders' which experts acknowledge has accelerated in a generation,\" she said. In straining to be like men, women were failing to nurture their own health and well-being. \"In our efforts to be successful,\" she said, \"women are not just seeking success in traditional male terms - we are also beginning to emulate their dysfunctional habits as well.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/14/4","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-14T09:19:44Z","webTitle":"British beef ban to be lifted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/14/4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jul/14/4","fields":{"headline":"British beef ban to be lifted","bodyText":"The worldwide ban on British beef will end on August 1, European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler confirmed today. The news British farmers have been waiting for will end a trade blockade imposed more than three years ago in response to consumer fears about the spread of \"mad cow disease\". It will trigger a major marketing campaign designed to regain lost export sales estimated to have cost the beef industry £1.5 billion. The European Commission will vote today to clear British beef for export following final approval from EU veterinary experts of Government measures designed to protect against BSE. Mr Fischler said: \"What has changed is very clear. First of all, we have got positive advice from our scientists. \"Secondly, we did a lot of inspections in the United Kingdom and the results are now all positive, so it is justified now to lift the ban. If I wouldn't be convinced about that, then I would not vote in favour to lift the ban.\" Even when the ban is lifted, precautionary restrictions will still apply. All meat for export must be de-boned and come from cattle born after August 1 1996 - the date on which a ban came into force on the feeding to animals of meat and bone-meal. In addition, meat from cattle more than 30 months old will not be sold overseas. Mr Fischler said British beef exporters will face an uphill struggle winning over European consumers in a free market. He told BBC1's Breakfast News: \"This is a question which has to be raised with the exporters - how they can convince the consumers so they will again buy British beef? \"It will be necessary in my view in the main importing countries for British beef to do some advertising and also to give all the information necessary so that it can be showed that British beef is safe.\" Britain still has more reported cases of BSE than any other EU country, although this year's figure of 1,000 so far contrasts sharply with a peak in 1992 of more than 36,000. A feared link between BSE in cattle and a similar disease, new variant CJD, in humans, prompted the unprecedented decision by Brussels to ban British beef across the globe. Claims by the then Government that the European Commission were far exceeding their powers were rebuffed by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that Britain could be ordered to wipe out an export industry beyond EU borders. The move could be justified, said the judges, because of the danger that blocking only exports to other EU member states could lead to a \"back-door\" market in Europe for British beef re-imported from third countries. The Government says that its response to the beef crisis means British beef is now safer than that from anywhere else in the EU. UK farmers hope this will lift the shadow still hanging over British beef on the Continent. National Farmers' Union president Ben Gill said: \"This is very welcome news and it has been long overdue. \"It is not the end but it is the beginning of the end. It allows us to start rebuilding the markets that we have lost.\" The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) heralded today's announcement as the beginning of the end of BSE. A spokesman said: \"The British livestock industry lost its £520 million annual [export] income with the introduction of this ban so obviously we are very pleased that it is finally about to go. \"But we have to remember that getting these markets back will be a long and slow process. We will no doubt be starting back with small quantities and we estimate that in the first year we are unlikely to exceed 5,000 tonnes of exports. Our main hope is that as the markets build, the density will also grow.\" The MLC said that while it would begin marketing meat to suppliers and industry contacts around the world, it had no immediate plans to launch a massive campaign to restore worldwide consumer confidence. Hugh Richards, president of the National Farmers' Union in Wales which represents some 20,000 livestock farmers, said that one way to market British beef would be to stress its regionality. Welcoming the lifting of the ban he said: \"Marketing British beef is not going to be easy and one way round this might be to call it Welsh beef or Cornish beef or Yorkshire beef. We need to develop a brand image that consumers abroad trust.\" But Mr Richards said that things would not suddenly improve for Welsh beef farmers. He said: \"In 50 odd years I have not seen any crisis as bad as this. We have had to go through so much pain and a number of producers haven't survived because of the extremely tough economic conditions that we have faced. But this at least gives us a glimmer of light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
