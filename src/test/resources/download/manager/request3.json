Demand for fossil fuels is likely to fall sharply in the medium term, according to a report published on Monday by the Carbon Tracker thinktank. That makes relying on gas exports to fuel economic growth a short-term, risky strategy, while boosting solar power would prove a better long-term bet, the analysis found. Although gas prices are high now, and the top five oil and gas companies alone have made profits of more than $170bn so far this year, gas revenues would fall by half by 2040, and the gas market would see record low prices owing to shrinking demand, the report forecast. That would leave Africa with huge investments in gas infrastructure, but no export market, if countries pursued a “dash for gas” now, the analysis found. Kofi Mbuk, senior clean tech analyst at Carbon Tracker and lead author of the report, warned that companies investing in fossil fuels in Africa would be left with stranded assets. “The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is inevitable and irreversible,” he said. “The growth in energy demand globally and regionally is now being met by renewables and squeezing out fossil fuel demands. In Africa, and across emerging economies, solar and wind offer the best route for economic development.” The future of Africa’s vast gas reserves is a major topic at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt, now in its second week. Although not formally on the agenda for the UN talks, the conference is buzzing with talk of Africa’s potential as a gas exporter. Countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea and Algeria have sizeable gas reserves, as does the Cop27 host country, Egypt. There are more than 600 fossil fuel executives and lobbyists at the talks, and a host of African heads of government who attended the leaders’ summit segment of the summit last week were keen to use the opportunity to strike gas deals. Macky Sall, president of Senegal, told the Guardian at the talks that it was wrong for developed countries to try to urge African leaders not to drill for gas when the west had grown rich on fossil fuels. “Why not Africa?” he asked. “Why should we not do the same?” Other leading figures have also voiced support for Africa to exploit its gas reserves. Tony Blair, former prime minister of the UK, told the Guardian: “They’ve got to be able to get gas. Gas for them is going to be a transitional fuel. Large numbers of people are burning wood for their fuel, which is bad for emissions but also bad for their health. For a transitional phase, they’re going to need to develop their gas resources.” This could save reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to some alternatives, he argued. “If you could swap, for example, heavy-duty diesel for gas, that would be highly beneficial for those countries. And in time you will have the potential for the development of hydrogen off the back of it [gas],” he said. Before the talks, the Sudanese-British billionaire Mo Ibrahim also called for Africa to exploit its resources. “We need a balanced and fair policy for everybody. Gas can be useful to our transition. [Developed countries who say otherwise] are hypocrites,” he told the Guardian. There are 600 million people in Africa without access to electricity. “How can we even think of development if people don’t have power?” he asked. “How can we have education, hospitals, business, companies, social life, TVs, tablets, computers, whatever?” Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of former world statespeople and business leaders, told the Guardian in June she supported the expansion of gas in Africa to provide access to modern energy for the 600 million people across the continent currently without it. Gas could provide clean cooking fuel as an alternative to biomass and paraffin, which currently kill thousands through indoor air pollution, especially women and children, she told the Guardian. “Africa is trying to get its voice out about its needs for just, equitable energy, and of course that implies some use of gas as a just transition,” she said. Egypt, host of the Cop27 summit, is understood to be eager to expand its gas industry, positing it as a help to European countries struggling with supplies to replace imports from Russia. However, many African climate experts and activists are speaking out against the expansion of gas on the continent. They argue that African’s poor are unlikely to see any benefit from the gas, which is likely to be exported abroad to the highest bidder by multinationals, with profits siphoned off to the countries’ elites. “The “dash for gas” in Africa is dangerous and shortsighted,” wrote a coalition of dozens of African climate groups in an open letter as part of a campaign called “Don’t Gas Africa”. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said Africa’s plentiful solar and wind resources offered a better route to energy than investing in gas. “For far too long, Africa has been controlled by outside interests – a resource pool for extraction and export, and a dumping ground for the practices and technologies no longer wanted elsewhere,” he said. In its report entitled African Sun: Why solar not gas offers the continent the best economic opportunity in the transition, published on Monday, Carbon Tracker argues that Africa could be an exporter of solar energy, rather than gas. “Electricity will be the backbone of Africa’s economic future, with solar leading the way,” the report predicted. “Even though prior to the Ukraine conflict, solar was competitive with coal and gas for power generation, the conflict means that the continent should, more than ever, build solar as a means to decrease its dependence on its global commodity market and achieve a secure and affordable source of domestic energy. Further acceleration of cost reduction will put Africa in a unique position as a beneficiary from one of the best abundance of solar potential on the planet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is not the only option | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","fields":{"headline":"Letters: nuclear power is not the only option","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I do not share your enthusiasm for the “good news” that Sizewell C is believed to be safe from Jeremy Hunt’s budgetary cuts (“Britain can’t afford to waver over nuclear power – soon it will be too late”, Editorial). “On a freezing cold, windless, winter’s evening”, Britain’s grid will indeed need an alternative power source to wind or solar, but why is it assumed that only nuclear can provide an alternative base load? And at the cost of how many billions? And how many decades of lead time? Geothermal could do the job faster, more safely and cheaply – for about a quarter of the cost. Geothermal power plants operate already in the United States, Italy and Iceland. And nothing is more certain and regular than the tide twice a day; sea turbines already operate in tidal flows off Orkney and Shetland and are another safe source of energy baseload. Let us not be blinkered by nuclear. Wendy Fowler Carnac-Rouffiac, France Your leader on Sizewell C ignores a couple of factors that are key to our local objections. First, the coastline on which Sizewell A and B are built and Sizewell C is proposed is disintegrating at an increasingly alarming rate – just two weeks’ ago a building at nearby Thorpeness had to be demolished due to collapse of the cliffs. Second, there is insufficient water in Suffolk to build and operate Sizewell C, which was one of the main reasons the government’s own planning inspectorate advised against it recently. Water is planned to be found through the construction of desalination plants – these require huge amounts of energy, but more importantly the waste salt and other minerals from the extraction process will be put back into the sea, poisoning the waters around for miles. There are other reasons why this is a disastrous location: it is a site of special scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty and the prototype for this type of reactor has yet to be proved at Flamanville – still not operational, years over schedule and way over budget. Nuclear has moved on since the design of these reactors. The government should think again. Rosie Hoare Saxmundham, Suffolk No wonder we Irish are off “There’s not many left,” noted Peggy O’Donoghue, a long-time Irish resident in your highly revealing article (“Britain’s dwindling Irish community mourn the fading of a great migration”, Focus). But what your article didn’t ask is what is the attraction of the UK to young Irish people in 2022? England is no longer the land of opportunity it once was. Brexit and the negative media attitudes that painted a picture of a country that didn’t welcome foreigners only encouraged young people to emigrate to America, Australia, South Africa and Europe. Ireland has emerged from the shadow of a colonial power and the grip of the Catholic church and developed into a well-educated, diverse and globalised society. Like many others, I left Ireland in 1990 because of a lack of opportunities at home. Today, the opportunities on offer to school leavers in Ireland are much improved. Ireland is not without its problems, such as a lack of affordable housing and unequal income distribution, but at least we have a generation who have hope for their country. I don’t see that in England today. Stuart Finegan Lewes Get Brexit undone I do not agree with your correspondent Tanya Firth when she says that the Labour party did not support remain in the EU referendum (Letters). As an ordinary Labour party member, I canvassed, telephoned and door-knocked to stay in the EU following a six-point question list from national Labour. It was a deeply unpleasant experience and many of my colleagues stopped because of the nightly racist comments. One night it was against Poles, the next Romanians. When Boris Johnson announced the Turks were coming, they were the target. We can see the same today with the hatred being generated against asylum seekers. Steven Bowditch Stanwix, Carlisle I wholeheartedly agree with David Mitchell’s critical analysis of politics as the art of the possible when concluding that “reversing Brexit would be the most significant geopolitical choice that Britain could make in its own interests” and a goal that Labour should embrace (“Labour should reverse on not reversing Brexit”, New Review). Reversing the Brexiters’ winning election slogan and campaigning vigorously to “Get Brexit Undone” would be a powerful means. Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol The way to net zero Keir Sarmer rightly points out the gap between rhetoric and reality that has characterised the UK’s response to the climate emergency over the last 12 years (“Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age”, Comment). It should not be the case that the biggest backers of our potentially “world-leading” renewable energy technologies have been ordinary investors putting their money where their mouth is via regulated crowdfunding platforms such as Abundance Investment. Labour should also be celebrating those local councils that have engaged their citizens directly, by issuing or pledging to issue Local Climate Bonds, including Labour’s newly won council of Westminster. These raise funds directly from residents, paying a fair return to fund council efforts to decarbonise their economy, ranging from solar energy to EV charging, biodiversity to waste recycling. They are democratic finance in action and can transform the political narrative of the transition to net zero. The chaos of the last few months has offered Labour a unique opportunity to bring a consistent and clear message to consumers, businesses and markets that the transition to net zero is not a cost to be borne, but an opportunity to seize. Investment in green infrastructure and support for green businesses (and the solutions they are creating) is the route to sound money and sustainable growth. Bruce Davis, co-founder and joint managing director, Abundance Investment Cirencester, Gloucestershire Books for all Iranian refugee Ali in Reading is quoted as saying: “All I want is an actual book to read but there are none here and there is no way I can afford them” (“English people try to help. Their government does not”, News). He will find a free public library in Abbey Square in that town and many others throughout Berkshire and, despite terrible cuts since the Conservatives came to power, all over the UK. Everyone is welcome in their local public library and in the one where I work, and in many others, we have made particular provision for refugees (eg recently buying books in Ukrainian).

For almost three decades, world governments have met nearly every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), every country is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change” and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC, and the annual meetings have swung between fractious and soporific, interspersed with moments of high drama and the occasional triumph (the Paris agreement in 2015) and disaster (Copenhagen in 2009). This year is the 27th iteration, and promises to be a difficult follow-up to the landmark summit last year, Cop26 in Glasgow. When does it start? The conference will be hosted by the Egyptian government in Sharm el-Sheikh, opening on 6 November. For two days after that, Monday 7 and Tuesday 8 November, world leaders will gather for a series of closed-door meetings, and direct their officials to get the kind of deal needed. They will then depart, leaving the complex negotiations to their representatives, mainly environment ministers or similarly senior officials. The talks are scheduled to end at 6pm on Friday 18 November but past experience of Cops shows they are likely to extend into Saturday and perhaps even to Sunday. Why do we need a Cop – don’t we already have the Paris agreement? Yes – under the landmark Paris agreement, signed in 2015, countries committed to holding global temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, while “pursuing efforts” to limit heating to 1.5C. Those goals are legally binding and enshrined in the treaty. However, to meet those goals, countries also agreed on non-binding national targets to cut – or in the case of developing countries to curb – the growth of – greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, by 2030 in most cases. Those targets – known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – were inadequate to hold the world within the Paris temperature targets. If fulfilled, they would result in 3C or more of warming, which would be disastrous. Everyone knew at Paris that the NDCs were inadequate, so the French built into the accord a “ratchet mechanism” by which countries would have to return to the table every five years with fresh commitments. Those five years ended on 31 December 2020, and at Cop26 in November 2021, countries assembled to set out new targets. Didn’t all this get sorted out at Cop26? The most important development at Cop26 was that countries agreed to focus on the tougher 1.5C aspirational goal of the Paris agreement, acknowledging that the 2C target would allow massive devastation to take place. Research conducted since the Paris agreement was signed has shown a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels would cause changes to the climate system that would be, in many cases, catastrophic, and some of them would be irreversible, so switching the focus to a 1.5C goal represents vital progress. Many countries also updated their NDCs at Cop26, and countries responsible for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions set out long-term targets to reach net zero carbon by about mid-century. However, to stay within 1.5C, the world must not only reach net zero by about 2050 but also halve greenhouse gas emissions, compared with 2010 levels, in this decade. However, the emissions pledges at Cop26 were not adequate to meet that goal. So at the Glasgow summit, countries also agreed to hasten the ratchet mechanism, decreeing that progress on NDCs should be updated every year, and countries were encouraged to come forward this year, and as often as necessary, with new NDCs until they are adequate. What has happened since? No one at Glasgow last year could have foreseen what a changed world we would live in today. Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February was not only brutal but has sent shockwaves around the world. Geopolitics have been upended, alliances and relationships redrawn, and the world has been plunged into crisis. Energy prices were already rising before Putin’s invasion, as the world recovered from the Covid-19 shock, but the Ukraine war has sent gas prices soaring. Putin has shown his willingness to use European dependence on Russian gas as a weapon of war, turning down the taps, threatening to withdraw supplies, then (almost certainly) sabotaging the Nord Stream pipeline. The result has been even higher gas prices and a bonanza for fossil fuel companies, which have been raking in record profits. Faced with record-high gas prices, the EU has taken a series of steps that include an energy efficiency drive, a windfall tax on the excess profits of fossil fuel companies to try to lower household bills and a massive push for renewable energy. But some EU countries have also returned – temporarily, they insist – to coal-fired power generation and embarked on a hunt for new fossil fuel supplies, building liquefied natural gas terminals and seeking deals with countries in Africa and elsewhere to explore new gasfields. The International Energy Agency warned last year that no new fossil fuel development could take place if the world was to stay within 1.5C. If these developments are not swiftly curtailed they could be disastrous for hopes of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown. That’s quite a difficult situation for Egypt And it’s not all. Food prices have also soared owing to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as both are massive producers of grain, sunflower oil and other staples, and also because fertiliser prices have increased – Russia and Ukraine are big producers of fertiliser, and even fertiliser produced elsewhere is more expensive as it requires a lot of energy to produce. This has led to the threat of food shortages, particularly to the vulnerable, and to a cost of living crisis engulfing developed and developing countries. The poor in many parts of the world are facing renewed economic hardship. Finally, to add to the geopolitical woes, relations between the world’s two biggest emitters, the US and China, have plunged to a new low, after the visit of Nancy Pelosi, the third highest-ranking member of the US’s ruling Democratic party, to Taiwan this summer. Last year, at Cop26, China and the US surprised everyone by signing a new bilateral deal to cooperate on tackling the climate crisis. This year, although technically climate negotiations are supposed to be in a “bubble” of their own, unaffected by the wider diplomatic context, in reality the countries have ceased to talk on this issue too. Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister who will chair the Cop27 talks, has offered his services as mediator between the US and China. But his task will be made more difficult by the tense geopolitical situation, the possibility of walkouts in protest at Russia’s actions, and Egypt’s position as an ally of key oil producers such as Saudi Arabia. Isn’t Egypt a dictatorship? Yes, and there is little freedom of the press and virtually no ability to protest. The government is accused of myriad serious abuses of human rights, and the jails are full of political prisoners. One of them, the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, is on hunger strike, and the subject of negotiations with the UK government. Campaigners are concerned that civil society activists will be shut out of the Cop27 conference, or unable to demonstrate effectively. The UN guarantees a right of participation for civil society groups, and in an interview with the Guardian, Shoukry was keen to emphasise that campaigners would be welcome and that 9,000 had registered. But civil society groups are treading carefully, concerned that any work they do with local activists in Egypt could leave those people exposed when the UN Cop27 circus departs. What about the UK? The host country of Cop26 had its own dramas in the past year, running through three prime ministers, as well as the death of the Queen and the accession of King Charles III. While Alok Sharma, the UK president of Cop26, has spent the year trying to shore up the “fragile” deal achieved in Glasgow – he has repeatedly warned that the 1.5C target is “on life support … its pulse is weak” – his ministerial colleagues have often seemed to be working against him. The UK is mooting a new coalmine, has vowed to “squeeze every last drop” of oil and gas from existing fields in the North Sea and is awarding more than 100 new licences for oil and gas exploration. Even the question of who will attend Cop27 has been controversial. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who took office in mid-October, at first said he would not go – a serious snub to the Egyptian hosts and other world leaders. It would be unusual for the leader of a country that hosted a successful Cop to not turn up to the next one to hand over the baton. Sunak was roundly criticised for the snub by developed and developing countries, and even a few of his own MPs, while charities and activists urged him to reconsider. The Observer then revealed that the former prime minister Boris Johnson was planning to go. Suddenly, it seemed that Sunak might be able to find time in his busy diary after all. But even if he does, the prime minister still seems adamant that he will not allow the UK’s new monarch, King Charles, to attend. This is hugely disappointing for many countries, as the king has been an important figure at previous Cops, including the Paris summit of 2015 and Cop26, and he is highly regarded around the world for his work on environmental issues. He is also the head of state of many Commonwealth countries, some of which are on the frontline of the climate crisis, and which got no say in whether he was allowed to go. Are we nearly there on 1.5C at least? No. Even if all the long-term and short-term pledges made in Glasgow were met, temperatures would still rise by about 1.8C above pre-industrial levels, according to the International Energy Agency – a vast improvement on the NDCs submitted in Paris but still far off where the world needs to be. What is worse, those estimates place a lot of emphasis on meeting long-term goals for which most countries have only the barest plans in place, making them highly optimistic. If only countries’ short-term goals – their NDCs, setting out emissions cuts to the end of this decade – are counted, then according to the UN temperatures could rise to about 2.5C by the end of this century. That leaves a lot remaining to be done at Cop27, and the signs are not good so far. Only 24 countries have updated their NDCs between Cop26 and Cop27, far fewer than were hoped for under the updated ratchet system. Of those, many will make little difference. Australia stands out as having made significant progress on its NDC under its new government. Why is 1.5C so important? As part of the Paris agreement, the world’s leading authority on climate science – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – was charged with examining closely what a 1.5C temperature rise would mean for the planet. They found a vast difference between the damage done by 1.5C and 2C of heating, and concluded that the lower temperature was much safer. An increase of 1.5C would still result in a rising sea levels, the bleaching of coral reefs and an increase in heatwaves, droughts, floods, fiercer storms and other forms of extreme weather – but these would be far less than the extremes associated with a rise of 2C. Further findings from the latest IPCC reports, published since Cop26, have underlined these warnings and concluded that there was still a slim chance for the world to stay within the 1.5C threshold but that it would require concerted efforts. Crucially, they also found that every fraction of a degree of increase is important. How far do we have to go? Temperatures around the world are already at about 1.1-1.2C above pre-industrial levels, and greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. Carbon dioxide output plunged during the Covid-19 lockdowns but emissions rebounded as economies recovered. To stay within 1.5C, global emissions need to come down by about 7% a year for this decade. Yet they are still rising. What about net zero? To stay within 1.5C, we must stop emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases – from burning fossil fuels, from agriculture and animal husbandry – which create methane – from cutting down trees and from certain industrial processes – almost completely by mid-century. Any residual emissions remaining by then, for instance from processes that cannot be modified, must be offset by increasing the world’s carbon sinks, such as forests, peatlands and wetlands, which act as vast carbon stores. That balance is known as net zero. Long-term goals are not enough, however. The climate responds to cumulative emissions, and carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for about a century after it is released, so we could reach net zero by 2050 but still have emitted so much in the meantime that we exceed the 1.5C threshold irrevocably. That is why scientists are calling the 2020s the crucial decade for the climate – if emissions can peak soon and be reduced rapidly, we can keep cumulative emissions from growing too much, and still have a chance of staying within 1.5C. Is Cop27 just about 1.5C? The NDCs are a central part of the negotiations but, given the geopolitical upheavals since Cop26, it is unlikely that much further progress will be made on them this year. So at Cop27, there will be far more emphasis on climate finance, adaptation and loss and damage, issues of vital importance to developing countries. Climate finance is the money provided to poor countries, from public and private sources, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. They were promised at the Copenhagen Cop in 2009 they would receive $100bn a year by 2020. That target has been missed: a report at Cop26 found the pledge would not be fulfilled until 2023. There are also problems with how climate finance is allocated: most of the money that flows currently goes to middle-income countries for projects that reduce emissions, such as wind or solar energy. Far less goes to the poorest countries, and only a fraction of the money goes to helping countries adapt to the inevitable impacts of the climate crisis. At Cop26, developed countries agreed to double the amount of climate finance devoted to adaptation. Poor countries will want to see significant progress on that at Cop27, and to see more finance provided in the form of grants rather than loans that can push countries further into debt. Equally important will be the issue of loss and damage. This refers to the most devastating ravages of extreme weather, so great that no amount of adaptation can help with them. Examples include hurricanes and typhoons, the devastating floods that hit Pakistan this summer, or the droughts afflicting swathes of Africa. Recovery from such devastation can take years, if it is ever achieved, and the infrastructure of developing countries, services such as health and education, and their chances of improving the lot of their people, can suffer permanent damage. The world’s poorest countries, which have done least to cause the climate crisis, are most at risk. In the past, some experts characterised loss and damage as a form of compensation or reparations for poor countries from the rich. However, this was unacceptable to developed and large developing countries, which refused to sign legal agreements potentially leaving them liable for unlimited future costs. So the discussion has moved on to loss and damage as a form of rescue and rehabilitation for the countries suffering most, differing from climate finance in that it does not apply to emissions cuts and addresses broader social and development issues as well as the immediate impacts of extreme weather. For years, little progress has been made but at last developed countries have signalled they will discuss new finance mechanisms for loss and damage. Few expect loss and damage to be solved at Cop27 but at least the first steps towards a new settlement should be made. What about China? The world’s biggest emitter, China, produced its NDC days before the start of Cop26 but analysts said it was disappointing. China will aim for emissions to peak by 2030, and reach net zero by 2060, and reduce the amount of carbon it produces per unit of GDP by 65%. But these were the same commitments made by the government before, and experts believe China is capable of doing far more – of peaking emissions by 2025, which would be a significant boost to global efforts to remain within 1.5C. Climate Action Tracker, which analyses global targets, said China’s NDC would mean temperatures were on a trajectory to 2.4C, well above even the upper goal of the Paris accord. China is unlikely to update its NDC before Sharm el-Sheikh but experts have said it is making good progress on switching to renewable energy. This is the 27th Cop – why has all this taken so long? Since the industrial revolution, the modern world has run on fossil fuels. We live in a Promethean age – nearly all of our prosperity and technology has been built on cheap, easy-to-access energy from fossil fuels. Ending their reign will require huge changes, to energy systems, to the built environment, to transport, to our behaviour and diet. Getting everyone to agree on something so complex has not been easy. Developed countries have been unwilling to take on the costs, while developing countries have demanded the right to continue to use fossil fuels to achieve economic growth. There have been wranglings over historical responsibility, over burden-sharing, over costs, over science, and the politics has been influenced by changes of government in key countries – Donald Trump, for instance, withdrew the US from the Paris agreement. On the plus side, the cost of renewable energy and other green technology has plunged in recent years, so that it is cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world. Electric vehicle technology also progressed rapidly, and new fuels such as hydrogen are being developed. The energy crisis and economic woes of the past year could even make Cop27 a turning point towards clean energy and a low-carbon future where governments are no longer in hock to fossil fuel producers – now they have seen where that can lead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/05/australia-will-bid-for-2026-climate-summit-but-still-has-work-to-do-on-emissions-credentials-at-cop27","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T23:31:21Z","webTitle":"Australia will bid for 2026 climate summit, but will face pressure to do more this year at Cop27","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/05/australia-will-bid-for-2026-climate-summit-but-still-has-work-to-do-on-emissions-credentials-at-cop27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/05/australia-will-bid-for-2026-climate-summit-but-still-has-work-to-do-on-emissions-credentials-at-cop27","fields":{"headline":"Australia will bid for 2026 climate summit, but will face pressure to do more this year at Cop27","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian government will use the UN climate conference in Egypt to launch a bid with Pacific nations to host the 2026 summit and pledge its support for some measures that the country’s previous government rejected a year ago in Glasgow. The Cop27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, a small resort city on the Sinai peninsula, is the first since the Labor government led by Anthony Albanese was elected in May. It arrives for the fortnight-long talks as one of few national governments to have followed through on a commitment made in Glasgow that all countries would re-examine their plans with a view to increasing their commitments this year. As promised before it was elected, it has lifted the country’s minimum 2030 emissions reduction target from 26% to 43% (compared with 2005 levels). It recently joined a global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and is expected to announce that it has escalated its support for a global declaration that aims to end deforestation by 2030 by joining a “high ambition” group of countries driving the change. A major focus of the Australian delegation, led by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, will be its bid to host a UN climate conference for the first time. The government initially nominated the 2024 summit, but hosting duties are rotated between five country groups, and Australia’s group – western European and other states – is not due until 2026. Confirming the bid with a joint statement on Saturday, government ministers said they were “committed to working in partnership with Pacific countries to address the climate emergency”. Longtime observers say the push to bring up to 20,000 people to Australia for a global climate change summit underscores a dramatic shift of tone. Albanese, who attended climate summits as an observer while opposition environment spokesperson more than 15 years ago, has declared the world is facing a climate emergency and that Australia “could be a renewable energy superpower for the world if we just seize that opportunity”. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup It is a sharp contrast with where the country stood a year ago. The previous Liberal prime minister, Scott Morrison, had no significant policies to cut emissions, rebuffed repeated calls from global leaders for Australia to raise its commitments for 2030, and was grouped with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Brazil (then under Jair Bolsonaro’s presidency) as nations standing in the way of stronger global action. Unlike Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak, Albanese is not attending Cop27, a decision that has drawn criticism from cross bench MPs including the Greens, and former Kiribati president Anote Tong. Albanese this week said the conference was focused on implementation of previous agreements, not major decisions, and cited other commitments – a sitting week of the Australian parliament followed by a G20 leaders’ meeting in Bali. Experts said Australia’s delegation was likely to receive praise in Egypt for being a significant improvement on what came before them, but that the applause would be qualified. Australia’s updated 2030 emissions commitment still trails many other developed countries – including the US, UK and the EU – and the government supports a continued expansion of fossil fuel exports, albeit with a reduction in public subsidies. Australia is the world’s biggest exporter of coal and a leading gas exporter. More than 100 potential fossil fuel projects are registered with the government. It is expected many will ultimately not prove financially viable as investors increasingly look for cleaner options, but Albanese has said they are free to go ahead if they have the necessary backing and can win approval under national environment laws. Richie Merzian, a former Australian government climate diplomat, now with progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the country’s representatives should expect questions about the government’s continuing support for fossil fuels and whether Australia could rejoin the green climate fund, which Morrison quit in 2018, as it lobbied to host a future summit. He said making that case would be “logistically tough”, but possible. “Morrison was extreme. In comparison, this is a middle of the road government – an Australia with less antagonism, more good faith,” he said. “It is a refreshing change in a number of ways, but still relatively modest in terms of policy.” At Cop27 Bowen is expected to stress the importance of doubling down on renewable energy as the cheapest path through the energy crisis and choppy economic times. The climate scientist Bill Hare, a longtime adviser to developing countries at climate negotiations, said Australia could offer a global leadership role on renewables, and make genuine claims to being a pioneer. Australia’s main electricity grid received nearly 44% of its electricity from renewable energy last week, roughly double the level of five years ago. Solar energy, in particular, is rising fast, with rooftop panels on more than 3m houses. “This is leading-edge rapid development and I know a lot of other countries are watching that,” Hare said. But Hare said Australia had made little progress in cutting emissions in nearly all other parts of the economy, including buildings, industry and transport. It has one of the lowest take-up rates of electric vehicles in the OECD, and a rapid expansion of liquified natural gas production for export over the past decade has cancelled out many of the emissions cuts in the power grid. Hare said Australia should expect pressure, including from the Biden administration, to raise its 2030 emissions reduction target, given it was still not enough for the country to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. He said the landmark US Inflation Reduction Act, which included nearly $370bn in climate measures, had set a new benchmark for what was possible. By comparison, a climate bill pushed through the Australian parliament shortly after Labor took power was relatively modest, including emissions reduction targets, but no new policies or funding. The government has promised measures to cut industrial emissions, drive the uptake of EVs, start an offshore wind energy industry and reach an 82% share of renewable electricity by the end of the decade, but all are still in development. “The truth is that Australia has gone from being a laggard to the middle of the road,” Hare said. “There is still a long way to go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/04/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T12:15:29Z","webTitle":"The climate crisis explained in 10 charts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/04/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/04/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts","fields":{"headline":"The climate crisis explained in 10 charts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The problem: rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere The level of CO2, the main greenhouse gas, has been rising since the Industrial Revolution and is at its highest for about 4m years. The rate of the rise is even more striking, the fastest for 66m years, with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. The causes (I): fossil fuel burning Billions of tonnes of CO2 are still pumped into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. The slight reduction in 2020 as a result of coronavirus lockdowns was no more than a “tiny blip” in the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and emissions have rebounded. The causes (II): forest destruction The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to CO2 emissions. It is also a significant cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth. The causes (III): methane emissions Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and emissions are increasing faster than at any time in 40 years of observations. Farming, especially cattle, as well as fossil fuel extraction and landfill sites, are responsible. Warming wetlands may also be contributing. The consequences: global temperature rise The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population have risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. The consequences: rising sea levels Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually experience their cities being submerged, from New York, to London, to Shanghai. The consequences: shrinking Arctic sea ice As heating melts the sea ice, it reveals darker water that absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America. The upside (I): wind and solar energy is soaring Huge cost drops have helped renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. The cost advantage over fossil fuels is even greater with the price rises following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and to tackle difficult sectors such as aviation and steel. The upside (II): electric vehicles The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast and governments are setting end dates for the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will rapidly dominate. The upside (III): battery costs Renewable energy is intermittent, varying as the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies with longer storage duration, such as green hydrogen, will also be needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/31/renewable-energy-contributes-record-687-of-power-to-australias-main-grid-for-brief-period","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T06:27:12Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy contributes record 68.7% of power to Australia’s main grid for brief period","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/31/renewable-energy-contributes-record-687-of-power-to-australias-main-grid-for-brief-period","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/31/renewable-energy-contributes-record-687-of-power-to-australias-main-grid-for-brief-period","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy contributes record 68.7% of power to Australia’s main grid for brief period","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Renewable energy generation hit a new record on Friday, briefly contributing more than two-thirds of the power in Australia’s main grid. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), the milestone was set at 12.30pm, with a contribution of 68.7%, or 18,882MW, from renewable sources. The figure is 4.6 percentage points higher than the previous record, which was set on 18 September. Of total power in the grid on Friday, 34% came from distributed solar, which outstripped black coal’s contribution of 22%. Renewable penetration rates are measured in 30-minute intervals, and illustrate contributions to the grid within a short period of time. “It’s very different to 100% renewables 24/7,” said Alison Reeve, climate change and energy deputy program director at the Grattan Institute. “Nevertheless, it does show how much the grid is changing.” “Five years ago the maximum that we’d managed to get to was 30%, and five years before that, I don’t know that anyone was even measuring [renewables], it was so small.” Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup One challenge of the energy transition was managing fluctuating contributions from renewable sources, Reeve said. “Once the solar has dropped out [at night], the percentage that you need to ramp up your non-renewables up to is a lot higher,” she said. “One of the things that is gradually driving particularly coal-fired power plants out of the market at the moment is that they can’t ramp up and down that quickly … they’re not good at switching on and off over a couple of hour periods.” Gas and hydro generators are more responsive at short timescales. Because of high gas prices currently, “when those gas generators come on they set quite a high price in the electricity market,” Reeve said. Hydro generators have recently been limited in their operation because of the wet weather on the east coast of Australia, she added. “They can’t send too much water down the river because they don’t want to make any flooding worse,” she said. Another challenge was replacing the “system’s stability” that coal and gas provide to the electricity grid – the ability to drop and raise generation slightly in order to “keep the voltage in the grid balanced”, Reeve said, which will require more long-duration storage infrastructure such as batteries. “Until we figure out a way to get that balancing role done by other things like pumped hydro and batteries, and we have enough of those in the system, there will be a natural upper limit on how much renewables penetration we have, particularly once you move beyond the instantaneous … and start to talk about what we can sustain over four or eight hours.” Reeve described these as “solvable problems”, but which required ironing out of details including costs, storage location and how the services would be valued. A July report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) found Australia was now among the world leaders in cheap solar energy. Behind China and India, in 2021 Australia had the third-lowest utility-scale solar cost in the world, of $0.042 USD/kWh (AU$0.065). This represented a 21% year-on-year drop in price. According to Irena data, the average cost of electricity from utility-scale solar has dropped by 90% in Australia since 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T14:00:30Z","webTitle":"Rather than an endlessly reheated nuclear debate, politicians should be powered by the evidence | Adam Morton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","fields":{"headline":"Rather than an endlessly reheated nuclear debate, politicians should be powered by the evidence","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We should be wary of simple declarations about the increasingly rapid transformation of the electricity grid. The government has been given a sharp reminder of this after leaning too heavily on pre-election modelling that suggested its policies to boost renewable energy could lead to a $275 cut in bills by 2025. You never know when a Vladimir Putin-shaped villain might disrupt international fossil fuel markets, wreck your assumptions and leave you accused of breaking an election pledge. Peter Dutton doesn’t have this excuse. The most generous thing that can be said about his foray into the debate over electricity last week is that he might want to get a broader range of advice. Giving his budget reply speech, the opposition leader said the Coalition wanted more renewable energy, but it just wasn’t possible yet, and it was a mistake for the government to allow ageing and expensive fossil fuel power to be phased out now. More specifically: “The technology doesn’t yet exist at the scale that is needed to store renewable energy for electricity to be reliable at night, or during peak periods. That is just the scientific reality.” To put it mildly, this is not the consensus opinion of experts in the field. David Osmond, a Canberra-based engineer with the global energy developer Windlab, is among those with a markedly different, evidence-based take. For more than a year, he has been posting weekly results from a live simulation tracking what would happen in Australia’s main electricity grid if it relied primarily on renewable energy. Using a live stream of electricity data from Opennem, he adjusted inputs to see what would happen if there was enough wind and solar energy to supply 60% and 45% of demand respectively. He added enough short-term storage, likely to be in the form of batteries, to supply average demand for five hours. The results are encouraging. They suggest close to 100% of demand – 98.9% over a 61-week period – could be delivered by solar and wind backed by existing hydro power and the five hours of storage. Nearly 90% of demand was met directly by renewable energy and 10% had to pass through storage. Achieving it would require a major expansion of transmission, as proposed by Labor under its Rewiring the Nation policy. The 1.1% shortfall mostly came when it was less sunny in late autumn and winter. Other technology would be needed to fill that hole. Osmond believes for now that would probably be fast-starting gas-fired power plants that are already connected to the grid, don’t run most of the time and can be called on quickly. There was nothing to suggest new ones were needed. It means a small amount of fossil fuel generation remaining in the grid, but less gas would be burned than now and, crucially, no coal power would be required. In the longer term, the backup could possibly come from cleaner sources – probably pumped hydro, maybe hydrogen or biofuels. None of these necessarily make economic sense the way solar and wind do – it is hard to justify a plant that would hardly ever be used – but could be needed in the context of the grid. An alternative would be to over-build solar and wind so there was always enough capacity online. By Osmond’s admission, this is a simplified model that assumes, for example, that electricity transmission links between regions can be delivered efficiently. No one should assume that the transition will be straightforward. The point is the technology already exists, and is comparatively cheap. From there it is a matter of design, engineering and, importantly, cost management. The last bit necessary to ensure the lights stay on is likely to make up a disproportionate amount of the overall cost. But the evidence says a renewable energy-dominated system is comfortably the cheapest form of generation if done right. Plenty of other studies have reached similar conclusions. The big one is the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan, a roadmap for the optimal future grid that was released in June. It backed an accelerated build of available technology to reach 83% of renewable generation by 2030, 96% by 2040 and 98% by 2050 as the best, most likely option. Presented with this evidence, Dutton and the Coalition continue to opt for none of the above. They appear to have joined a small band, including many in the usual right-wing media echo chambers, convinced that the evidence presented is wrong. Dutton was mostly dismissive of batteries in his budget reply, and implied small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) – a commercially unproven technology that has been repeatedly delayed and more expensive than promised – could be the answer that ensures cheap energy. No evidence has been presented to suggest SMRs are needed to meet demand in Australia, given the country’s wealth of renewable options. Never mind that no independent evidence has been offered to suggest it could compete on price. If SMRs prove economically viable and safe elsewhere there is nothing to stop Australia considering their use, perhaps at remote off-grid industrial sites. It will be a good thing if they are viable, given not every country has ample alternatives to fossil fuels. But they are not designed to do the job needed here – to turn on occasionally and fill gaps in a system running on cheaper, renewable energy. Rather than an endlessly reheated debate about nuclear – the Coalition is holding another review, so expect plenty more of this – Australians would be better served if its politicians had a close look at a major report last week by the International Energy Agency. For the first time, the IEA forecast that fossil fuel use across the globe would peak in the next few years as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated a shift to clean fuels. It found existing policies would soon lead to coal use falling and demand for gas would plateau by the end of the decade. The declines will be much faster if, as expected, climate action continues to ramp up. Australia has one of the world’s largest fossil fuel export industries. It is supporting massive developments expected to last until late into the century as though nothing much is going to change. The significant climate impact of these developments is still routinely overlooked by the major parties on the grounds the gas and coal are burned overseas, and therefore somehow not Australia’s problem. But what about the economic and social impact of their potentially rapid decline? Now there’s an issue truly worthy of more parliamentary debate and action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T06:35:19Z","webTitle":"‘It’s got nasty’: the battle to build the US’s biggest solar power farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s got nasty’: the battle to build the US’s biggest solar power farm","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When proposals for the largest solar plant ever conceived for US soil started to gather pace – a plan that involves spearing several million solar panels into the flat farmland of northern Indiana – something in Connie Ehrlich seems to have snapped. Ehrlich, 63, is part of a longstanding farming family in Pulaski county, the site of the new solar project, but doesn’t live in the county and previously only rarely dabbled in its usually somnolent local politics. She has carved out a comfortable life in a sprawling mansion set on 10 acres (four hectares) of land, just outside the city of Lafayette, and is known locally for her donations to medical research and her small fleet of deluxe cars with personalized license plates. But to Ehrlich the idea of transferring 13,000 acres of prized farmland to solar energy production seems to have been so unthinkable that it demanded an extraordinary response. Within months of the project being proposed she had mobilized her wealth to fund a flurry of lawsuits, spearheaded a sometimes-vituperative pressure group and spent $3m buying new plots of land, including a cemetery, on the fringes of the project. Ehrlich even acquired an office nextdoor to the solar developer’s own premises – and in its window a cartoon has been placed showing Joe Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers, depicted as pigs in a sty. The solar farm, which could have its goal of completion next year delayed because of the lawsuits, has stirred up strong feelings among some in Pulaski. “It’s got nasty, really nasty,” said Derrick Stalbaum, a hog farmer who also acts as president of the county’s board of zoning appeals. “It’s surprising as we live in a quiet area with a huge sense of community usually.” The opponents of the solar project, a $1.5bn venture appropriately called Mammoth that is set to span an area almost as large as Manhattan, say they are defying an egregious assault on time-honored farming traditions and are standing up to a newcomer that threatens to warp their pastoral way of life with Chinese-made technology. “We need to protect America’s farmland,” Ehrlich wrote in a February post for the Pulaski County Against Solar group’s Facebook page. “Not only from being sacrificed for the inefficient, unreliable energy generation, but from foreigners’ interest!” The ongoing fight is a sobering reminder of how Biden’s ambitions for a mass transition to renewables, aimed at averting the worst ravages of the climate crisis, will in significant part be decided by the vagaries and veto points of thousands of local officials, county boards and Connie Ehrlich-style opposition across the US. Localized battles over new solar projects threaten to proliferate as the industry, buoyed up by the huge tax credits available for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act, seeks to expand. Over the past year, solar projects in Ohio, Kentucky and Nevada have all been delayed or sunk by irked local people. Ordinances restricting solar, wind and other renewable energy facilities have been passed in 31 states. The prospect of solar energy projects occupying a chunk of American land has stirred unease among farmers, and even among some environmentalists, that valuable forests, wetlands and fertile soils may be sacrificed. If the US really is to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050, researchers at Princeton University have estimated that solar production could have to grow more than 20-fold, occupying an area that, put together, would be equivalent to the size of West Virginia. “We are absolutely seeing local opposition to solar arrays across the US,” said Samantha Levy, climate policy manager at American Farmland Trust. “About half of solar development is going on the best, most productive farmland and that is causing some concern because it’s not like we are making more land. We need to have a smart solar buildout and not hollow out these farming communities.” But for developers, the challenges posed by opponents such as Ehrlich are infuriating. “It’s just throw spaghetti and see what sticks,” said Nick Cohen, chief executive of Doral Renewables, the Israeli-founded developer behind the Mammoth project in Indiana. “It only takes one person to file a lawsuit and this feels like a one-person crusade to burn down the town.” Cohen said his dealings with Ehrlich have been “civil but direct” and that Doral holds out hope of being an amiable neighbor to its foe. The project won’t fell trees or disturb any fragile ecosystem, he pointed out. “If people have real concerns we can work it out,” Cohen said. “But the conduct here is so irrational and perplexing. Connie and [a] small group of followers are working against the best interests of the entire community.” The episode is also a demonstration of how an era of toxic politics and vicious online vitriol can quickly sour a community like Pulaski. Some people have left their church because of arguments with other congregants over the solar plant, while even family members have been at odds with one another. Stalbaum, the head of the board of zoning appeals, said while most people in the county are either supportive or apathetic about Mammoth, a faction of people are so outraged they have taken to following and videoing him and other members of the board, or idling in cars outside their homes. Anonymous phone calls, meanwhile, were made to a school where Stalbaum was previously a teacher to cryptically warn that he was not suited to be around children, he said. On Facebook, supporters of the project have been called “roaches” and “traitors” and, in one instance, seemingly compared to Adolf Hitler. “I can only imagine how intimidating he is around children!!” one poster wrote about Stalbaum. “This is no longer really about the solar applications; it’s more about driving the community apart,” said Stalbaum. “I have been attacked pretty hard for this, simply because this project meets our county requirements.” Much of the debate in Pulaski county about solar has become entangled in national resentments, with several unprompted attacks on Biden in public hearings for supposedly forcing through the Green New Deal, or for allowing Mexican immigrants to somehow take precious farmland along with the solar developers. In Pulaski, a county where Donald Trump outperformed Biden four to one in the 2020 election, flags hanging outside homes declaring “Let’s Go Brandon” and, less euphemistically, “Fuck Biden” are commonplace. *** Pulaski county appears to be an otherwise unassuming location for what will be one of the largest solar projects in the world. A rectangular slice of agricultural northern Indiana, Pulaski is home to about 12,000 people, a number that is declining, and a lot of corn. Peppermint is grown here, too, and sold to the Wrigley Company for gum flavoring. A ripple of excitement was felt in nearby Fulton county in 1978 when the partial skeleton of a hulking mastodon was discovered in a drainage ditch, exquisitely preserved in peat. It was this 10,000-year-old specimen that would give the Mammoth project its name, although Doral was more excited by quirks of infrastructure and geology – the area has flat, sandy ground ideal for solar and is a meeting point for two vast electrical grids, called MISO and PJM, that service tens of millions of Americans and will allow Mammoth to dump converted sunlight into both of them for consumption. In July 2019, Cohen was introduced to a farmer named Norm Welker. Welker’s land, Cohen said, was “right on the bullseye, exactly where you’d want to be.” Transmission lines run through Welker’s fields in Starke county and, crucially, Welker himself has been unsentimental about turning away from half a century of planting and harvesting corn on this land. “You couldn’t dream of a better project for us,” said Welker, a 62-year-old who has a short, clipped moustache and is almost more enthused by the idea of solar than the developers themselves. The money helps, of course – Welker’s 1,075 acres in Starke county will be leased for the next three decades at $1,000 an acre a year. “It’s five times what I’d make through corn,” he said. “It’s crazy money.” Construction began on Welker’s land earlier this year and a grid-like pattern of pilings driven into the soil is already in place. Long steel tubes are placed horizontally upon the pilings, with brackets on top to affix the solar panels, which are awaiting clearance for import from Malaysia. Wiring dangles from some of these poles, and cables lie in partly dug trenches, ready to connect the output to an inverter which will then help propel electrons into the grid. The panels will automatically rotate east to west, chasing the sun throughout the day, shaking off snow in the winter. But the whole system is fairly simple to slot together and is shorter than the serried ears of corn Welker would normally grow here. “It’s so passive, I mean, it’s even more benign than wind,” said Kevin Parzyck, a senior project manager for Doral. A few years ago, officials in Pulaski rejected an application to build wind turbines in the county. “With wind you’re actually spinning a generator,” Parzyck said. “The crickets make more noise than these solar panels do.” To Welker, solar is an evolution of farming rather than a betrayal of it. He already harvests the sunlight for his crops, he reasons, and considers fears of food shortages by taking land out of production overblown given that 40% of all US corn is already mashed up for another form of energy – ethanol, which is added to gasoline. Farmers are also routinely paid by the federal government to keep tracts of land free from crops, in order to bolster the price of corn. The rows of nodding metal and glass will contrast with the surrounding fields of corn, but it’s a moot point as to whether they are more unnatural or harmful to the surrounds. Wild grasses and wildflowers are springing up around the metal pilings, bringing back insect life to a landscape that is typically bombarded by pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. America’s corn belt, which stretches from Indiana to Nebraska, produces a fifth of the world’s maize, a stunning feat of agricultural might that has deforested large areas, stripped away topsoil and made the land, by one measure, 48 times more toxic than it was 25 years ago. “I’m gonna retire, I’m gonna restore habitats – it’s likely there’ll never be a cornfield here ever again,” said Welker. He has a further 500 acres in Pulaski county he hopes to give over to solar, too, but there he faces the tenacious obstacle of Ehrlich, whom he knew as a neighbor when she went to community college in Indianapolis and then married Donald “Jerry” Ehrlich, founder of the Wabash trucking company. Now the relationship is somewhat strained. “It blows my mind! It’s my farm – why do I need my neighbor’s permission to do this?” Welker asked, suddenly enraged. “I’m not doing any harm to you. What’s the deal with this woman? These people are nitwits.” The Guardian made multiple requests to Ehrlich and her lawyer for comment. There was no response to these requests. The Mammoth project – which will generate 1.3 gigawatts of renewable energy, enough to power more than 200,000 households annually in coal-dependent Indiana – is split into three distinct areas encompassing dozens of landowners, which looks on a map like a collection of Jenga blocks scattered on to the landscape. Two of these areas are in Pulaski, which has a county ordinance that requires special hearings to consider changing the use of land for solar. This opportunity to stymie the project was seized upon by Ehrlich and her group. The first hearing – by the county’s board of zoning appeals, a five-member body that issues typically mundane decisions about land use – in July 2020 was eagerly anticipated. Outside, people livestreamed proceedings via their phones and speakers were set up so the overflow crowd could listen in. Inside, Stalbaum tried to maintain a sense of order. A procession of local residents stepped up to speak at the microphone, the supporters of solar stressing it would help sustain farms for future generations and raise vital tax revenue for ailing public services. Opponents, meanwhile, were more pointed, often invoking a divine plan for this land and taking aim at local officials who would stray from this. “I don’t want my back yard to be a guinea pig!” exclaimed Riley Cervenka Tiede, Ehrlich’s niece, a recording of the meeting shows. “As a farmer I take great pride in the beautiful land that God has blessed us with and believe it should stay to be used to grow crops.” Tiede warned that property values would decline if solar arrived – there is somewhat threadbare evidence of this – and raised the spectre of a disastrous fire. On the Facebook streamed comments, people pondered if birds and plants would be fried by the glare from the panels, perhaps in response to a different, and unusual, type of solar farm in California that caused some birds to spontaneously combust after flying into its beams of concentrated sunlight. “Firefighters, police, please stand up,” Tiede implored, as applause thundered for the first responders. “Their lives are more important than a few landowners getting money!” When Nathan Origer, head of community development for Pulaski, attempted to explain that revenue from Mammoth could be used to help lower taxes for landowners – Mammoth will plow about $1.5m a year into Pulaski’s coffers, about a fifth of the county’s revenues from income tax – a man off camera shouted, “You’re full of shit!” Mark Cervenka, Ehrlich’s brother who farms land in Pulaski, said locals had been ambushed by a “disturbing, frightening and disgusting” solar plan. “I’m a farmer and always will be. I believe the land should be used the way God intended it to be,” he added. Things get so heated at one point a woman stormed toward the board members and started shouting indecipherably at them while holding up her phone. Stalbaum asked two burly sheriff’s deputies to remove her and muttered, “You’re not helping your cause here.” The board voted unanimously to allow a special exception for the solar project in the wake of the gathering, although with conditions, pushed for by Ehrlich and allied local resident Jennifer Knebel, that new trees will block the sight of the solar panels, noise will be kept to a minimum and wide buffer areas of open land will be kept at the project boundaries. Just 20% of the project area will be covered by the actual solar panels, which are disparagingly called a “sea of black glass” by opponents. Ehrlich has not been sated by this partial victory. According to Knebel, the group has spent “hundreds of hours” pondering the issue, usually coming to hearings with reams of notes to read out. Doral has had to muster a cadre of experts to counter claims the silicon and aluminum panels will give off deadly radiation, or that they will kill sandhill cranes by blinding them or will leach poison into the soil. “I feel like they got just about everything they could get apart from outright banning solar,” said Origer. “But whatever everyone did, it wasn’t enough. I have to conclude that it is at least partially an ideological thing. Ms Ehrlich simply doesn’t think that solar is good.” In a flurry of online posts, op-eds and speeches, Ehrlich has claimed solar developers “prey upon financially struggling counties”, questioned the efficacy of renewable energy and complained that the energy generated won’t be used by the county itself, a striking protest given Pulaski farmers’ routine sale of corn to be consumed across the US. “How can some landowners believe they have the right to do whatever they want with their land while destroying someone else’s property and quality of life?” Ehrlich posted in July last year on her group’s Facebook page. Public records show that Ehrlich has spent about $3m to buy three plots of land in Pulaski since 2020, including a cemetery near the town of Francesville. Some of the land is within a mile of the planned Mammoth project. Meanwhile, Ehrlich and eight other complainants have filed lawsuits to try to overturn the approval of the land use, dispute a tax abatement given to Doral and stop the county’s subsequent move to make it easier for developers to set up in Pulaski county. In September, Ehrlich got some reward for her efforts – the Indiana court of appeals ruled that Mammoth had not submitted a complete application for the project’s zoning. The state supreme court may now be called upon for further judgment, although the developers do not expect to be halted by what they frame as an administrative redo. “It doesn’t make much sense to me that she would purchase land for very high prices in the neighborhood if she thinks property prices will go down because of the project,” said Cohen. “She hasn’t been willing to compromise to discuss a mutual solution. All of the millions of dollars we are spending on lawsuits, that could’ve been put into the community. There’s nothing I would like more than to have them as our friends.” A detente doesn’t appear likely, however, if you take a trip to Doral’s project headquarters in Winamac, a small town that is Pulaski’s county seat. On the main road into Winamac is a huge billboard that reads “No to industrial solar” and, once you get to the Doral office, the opposition is hard for the developers to ignore. Ehrlich spent $100,000 on a former cigar store, public records show, that is a footstep from Doral’s own office. The windows are plastered with anti-solar posters, including the cartoon of Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers depicted as pigs. “Protesting – that’s Connie’s job,” said Welker, as he looked at the strange juxtaposition of the two offices. “Nick and I stopped in one time and tried to have peace talks, but she’s just, ‘No. I’m here to save Pulaski county from solar panels.’ That’s her job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/oct/24/keir-starmer-backs-stiff-sentences-for-climate-protesters-who-block-roads","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T12:16:03Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer backs stiff sentences for climate protesters who block roads","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/24/keir-starmer-backs-stiff-sentences-for-climate-protesters-who-block-roads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/oct/24/keir-starmer-backs-stiff-sentences-for-climate-protesters-who-block-roads","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer backs stiff sentences for climate protesters who block roads","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has said he would continue with Tory plans for stiff sentences for climate protesters who block roads, despite reiterating Labour’s pledge for no new oil and gas licences, as two Just Stop Oil activists caked a waxwork of King Charles. Starmer’s pledge to impose a moratorium on new oil and gas projects puts Labour policy in line with the demands of Just Stop Oil, whose supporters have been blocking roads and carrying out other protests in central London every day this month. Hours after Starmer’s comments on Monday morning, two supporters of the group stepped over the rope barrier separating the public from a waxwork of King Charles at Madam Tussauds in London, before smearing its face with chocolate cake. In comments circulated shortly after by Just Stop Oil, the pair, Eilidh McFadden, 20, from Glasgow, and Tom Johnson, 29, a painter-decorator from Sunderland, said: “The science is clear. The demand is simple. Just stop new oil and gas. It’s a piece of cake.” The action is the latest iconoclastic protest staged by climate activists. The Friday before last, Just Stop Oil made headlines around the world when two of its supporters hurled tomato soup on to Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers in the National Gallery in London. On Sunday, two activists with Letze Generation or Last Generation flung mashed potato on to Claude Monet’s Les Meules or Haystacks, in Potsdam, Germany. Both paintings were behind glass and were undamaged. But Just Stop Oil’s most disruptive actions so far in October have been on the streets. Crews of activists have blocked some of central London’s busiest roads every day this month, enraging politicians, rightwing papers and many members of the public. Speaking on LBC, Starmer confirmed that a Labour government would back proposals to introduce stiff sentences for people who protest by blocking roads. Similar proposals, currently before parliament as part of a new public order bill, would introduce 51-week sentences for “lock on” protests – in which activists use chains, locks, glue or other equipment to attach themselves to immovable objects or each other – a regular tactic of climate protesters. The bill also includes new offences of interfering with key national infrastructure, obstructing major transport works and causing serious disruption by tunnelling. In a phone-in discussion with Nick Ferrari, Starmer said that in his previous role as director of public prosecutions “we always had laws available” to prosecute people taking direct action. But he added: “What we were pushing for in that was longer sentences for those who were gluing themselves to roads and motorways, because that’s where you are putting lives at risk. We didn’t get that through, but that’s what I wanted.” Despite his opposition to the climate activists’ tactics, elsewhere in the interview Starmer promised there would be no new oil and gas licences granted under Labour as Just Stop Oil demands. “We accept there’s got to be a transition, so where there is oil and gas already being yielded that needs to continue as part of the transition, but no new sites, no new fields to be opened,” he said. “We need to transition to renewables. We can do it … we can double our onshore wind, we can triple our solar energy and we can quadruple our offshore wind – and the sooner we do that, the better. I do think that new nuclear, as well, and hydrogen are part of the equation.” The uproar over the latest actions by Just Stop Oil and its sister group in Germany comes as another report reiterated that there can be no new oil and gas projects if the world is to stay within 1.5C of global heating. The report, by the International Institute of Sustainable Development, said there was a “large consensus” across research that “developing any new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C” above pre-industrial levels. It also said global oil and gas production must be slashed by at least 65% by 2050 to remain within 1.5C, identified by the Paris agreement as the limit to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The findings echo the International Energy Agency’s conclusion that any new oil and gas fields are incompatible with its 1.5C pathway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/24/victoria-deserves-praise-for-promising-a-rapid-shift-from-coal-to-renewables-now-comes-the-hard-part","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T15:00:40Z","webTitle":"Victoria deserves praise for promising a rapid shift from coal to renewables.

Now comes the hard part","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Transformations don’t come much bigger than that proposed in Victoria by Daniel Andrews last week. At the time of typing, about two-thirds of the electricity generated in Victoria comes from burning brown coal – basically mud – in old, sometimes failing, generators in the Latrobe Valley. It is the most polluting form of large-scale power generation. If the Andrews Labor government wins a third term at next month’s state election, which seems likely, it has promised to legislate a target that would mean shutting the remaining coal plants and replacing them with renewable energy and back-up generation by 2035 – and probably earlier. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup It would be one of the fastest transitions from a high-pollution power grid to a near zero-emissions system anywhere in the world. Just as significantly, the announcement by the Victorian premier and his climate and energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, accelerated the state’s emissions reduction plans with a promise of a 75-80% cut by 2035 (compared with 2005 levels). Victoria also has a new timeframe in which it is pledging to reach net zero emissions – 2045, rather than 2050. These commitments far outstrip what is promised nationally and could put the state within reach of what is required to play its part in attempting to limit global heating to 1.5C, as national leaders promised in Paris in 2015. There are important questions to be answered about how this will be achieved and what it will mean for households and businesses, but the goals should be acknowledged and applauded. This is the path governments are supposed to be setting. Part of the commitment is piggybacking on other announcements. The rise of cheap solar energy in the middle of the day has quickly been making ageing coal plants less viable, and the owners of two of Victoria’s remaining three generators – Yallourn and Loy Yang A – have already brought forward their closure dates to 2028 and 2035 respectively. It means the new bit in Andrews’ promise of 95% renewable energy by 2035 is really that the final plant, Loy Yang B, will shut by then, and not in 2047 as currently scheduled. This was apparently news to the owner, Alinta Energy, and its staff. But few people following the energy market believe it could have lasted as long as claimed anyway. The coal closures will do a big chunk of the heavy lifting in meeting Victoria’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets, but not all of it. The state will also need to do more in the next term to cut pollution in other areas – transport, industry, manufacturing and agriculture – than currently proposed. And it will also need to rapidly reduce homes and businesses’ reliance on gas for heating and cooking. Probably the least remarkable part of the Victorian promise is the section it chose to emphasise as the most important – the revival of the State Electricity Commission, which owned and ran the coal plants and poles and wires until then premier Jeff Kennett broke up and sold the system in the 1990s privatisation mania. Andrews and D’Ambrosio said this move would be “putting power back in the hands of Victorians”. One newspaper headline went further, saying the premier was “nationalising electricity”. The reality is noteworthy but a bit more anodyne, for a couple of reasons. What is proposed is a much smaller operation than the old SEC, and the government is not (at least at this stage) taking back control of the state’s existing power plants, poles and wires or retailers. The rebooted commission would instead be a new player in the market, effectively competing with private companies. The government would initially kick in $1bn as it starts the process of building 4.5GW of new renewable energy capacity. It expects further investment in SEC projects from “like-minded entities” such as industry super funds, but the government would retain a controlling stake. It is a significant commitment, but just a fraction of what the state will need to replace its coal plants. A major focus appears likely to be the establishment of an offshore wind energy industry in Gippsland. The government has set substantial targets for offshore wind generation, but turbines are more expensive when built kilometres off the coast than in a paddock, and are unlikely to be competitive initially without public support. Ignore the historic connotations of the SEC’s name and the Victorian commitment can be seen as just the latest in a wave of announcements, mostly by state governments, that have upended expert thinking of how the future electricity system would – or should – be rebuilt. The long-held idea that investment in the new clean grid would be driven by an overarching national policy, such as a carbon price, with governments otherwise mostly taking a hands-off approach seems increasingly quaint. It was killed off as the federal Coalition spent years blocking climate action, and isn’t coming back. Instead we have a messy, bottom-up approach in which governments working in the same general direction make their own commitments. Last month, the Queensland government said it would spend an extra $4bn on transforming the energy system, building at least 2,000 more wind turbines and 35m solar panels by 2030 to end its reliance on coal by about 2035. The New South Wales Coalition government is working on underwriting 12GW of new renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage and the treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, has said the state could be out of coal power by 2030. Everyone is choosing their own adventure. The difference since May is that the commonwealth and states are pulling in the same direction, with the Albanese government committing to accelerate the transition by committing billions in funding for new transmission connections, including the Marinus link between Tasmania and Victoria announced last week. It is a process that drives economists and energy market purists slightly mad, but a version of it was probably politically inevitable. Big change rarely comes smoothly, and premiers get votes for building things. Most people won’t care about these structural and ownership issues. The big questions the Victorian government and others will have to answer in the years ahead are more basic. Will the new system deliver the reliable, clean and affordable electricity promised? And will coal-reliant communities be supported through what will be a historically abrupt change? Reliability and emissions reduction goals will not be easy but are technically achievable. Cost is a separate question. New solar and wind are clearly the cheapest forms of energy available and a system that mostly runs on them should lower generation costs, but someone will have to pay for the vast amounts of new transmission being built. Expensive gas-fired power is likely to also push up prices for as long as it is used alongside an expanding storage network to fill gaps in supply. . The cost of a renewably powered electricity grid will be lower than a system that runs on coal or nuclear, but that does not mean it will necessarily be cheap – and consumers will not see that comparison. Governments should be careful what they promise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/22/landowners-call-for-scrapping-of-plans-to-ban-solar-energy-from-englands-farmland","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-22T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Landowners call for scrapping of plans to ban solar energy from England’s farmland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/22/landowners-call-for-scrapping-of-plans-to-ban-solar-energy-from-englands-farmland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/22/landowners-call-for-scrapping-of-plans-to-ban-solar-energy-from-englands-farmland","fields":{"headline":"Landowners call for scrapping of plans to ban solar energy from England’s farmland","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Farmers have urged whoever succeeds Liz Truss as UK prime minister to abandon plans to ban solar energy from most of England’s farmland, arguing that it would hurt food security by cutting off a vital income stream. Truss, who resigned on Thursday, and her environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, hoped to ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land, the Guardian revealed last week. They planned to do this by reclassifying less productive farmland as “best and most valuable”, making it more difficult to use for energy infrastructure. Members of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents 33,000 landowners, told the Guardian having solar on their less productive land allowed them to subsidise food production during less successful years, as well as providing cheap power for their estates and homes in their local area. Mark Tufnell, the president of the CLA, grows oats, wheat and barley on his Cotswolds estate. He said: “We have members who say these are temporary sites if needs be, they are then able to concentrate on growing more food on their other land. “The solar would be on their less good land, and … if that is what they so choose to do, why shouldn’t they be allowed to do it?” He added that the land was not lost to agriculture as the sties were easy to remove, and the area could be grazed with sheep. “There is no reason as to why the area underneath it couldn’t be grazed with sheep, but it could also provide very good habitat for farmland birds and increase biodiversity so help the environment. “I don’t see that saying with the strike of a pen that we are going to exclude this land, I don’t see that it helps, and I think that it is unlikely to help food security in any case.” The real problem with the government’s solar strategy, he said, was how difficult it was to put solar on rooftops. Tufnell said: “There are so many things they could do that they aren’t doing, like incentivising solar rollout on roofs, changing the planning system to allow it. I already have 49kW, and I want to have another 100kW on my buildings, but the hardest thing to do is getting a connection to the grid at a price that is affordable. They are very slow, the price is incredibly high, and in my case I could have to put in a mini substation, which is very expensive. “What I am trying to do is put solar panels on a building which I am converting into offices and workshops, if there is any excess I would like to use it for the houses in the village. But it is becoming so difficult and expensive that it is very off-putting, and if I wasn’t so persistent I would think frankly I can’t be bothered.” Harry Teacher, a fruit and arable farmer in Kent, has a large solar park on his land, which helps bring in income when his farm has a bad year. He said: “We put in a park in 2014, ground-mounted panels on frames on about 61 acres of land. We are a fruit and arable farm but we are quite highly diversified, and any farmer has been encouraged to find sources of income other than arable, and solar panels were part of that diversification. For us it is a source of constant income. It gives our business a greater resilience.” Teacher does not understand all the fuss, adding: “As a proposition they are quite easily hidden by a large hedge. They don’t make noise, there are no moving parts. Carbon is a serious thing we all have to consider now, solar panels have to be part of that. If the argument is that the land is lost for food – you may be aware that the planning applications for solar parks are done on a temporary basis – ours is a 25-year period. If, for whatever reason, we run out of food, which is extraordinarily unlikely, we can pull it all up and restore it to agriculture. “We make unequivocally more from our solar panels than from farming. There is a gut reaction people have to any sort of greenfield development and it is more of a reaction to people’s response to seeing solar parks – I don’t think it’s a real fear for food production.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","type":"article","sectionId":"mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future","sectionName":"Mitsubishi: Tech that drives a better future","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T00:18:40Z","webTitle":"A ‘battery on wheels’: why EVs can do more than just take you places","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","fields":{"headline":"A ‘battery on wheels’: why EVs can do more than just take you places","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s interesting to think of the sun as a kind of vast, patient teacher, waiting for us to work out just how useful it can be, aside from giving us light and making everything on Earth grow. Last century, we got quite excited when we worked out that we could put a couple of panels on our roofs to heat our hot water. Today many houses use solar to provide their electricity and recently we’ve started plugging in our electric vehicles (EVs) to run on sunlight as well. The arrival of the latest generation of smart vehicles, such as Mitsubishi’s Outlander Plug-In Hybrid EV (PHEV) – which can switch between its petrol engine and battery-powered twin electric motors – provides the opportunity to power our lives with clean energy. Imagine a world in which you can charge up your car’s batteries using your solar panels, and then use that power not just for transport, but to run your house for several days – free and clean. Mitsubishi’s PHEVs are at the cutting edge of the latest car tech thanks to vehicle-to-load (V2L), vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, all of which have the potential to transform how we use energy and shine a light on the fact that EVs and PHEVs are, essentially, powerful battery packs on wheels. While V2L will let you charge or operate an appliance via your EV or PHEV’s battery – a blessing if you want to take a fridge, or even a TV, with you when camping – V2H is another thing entirely, allowing you to use the car’s battery to power your home. Laura Jones, a senior analyst at the Australian National University’s College of Engineering and Computer Science, working across its battery storage and grid integration program, believes people need to reframe how they view their vehicles. “If you look at how we use our cars, they tend to spend most of their time parked,” Jones says. “So using V2H is a way of making it so that the car can work for you, even when you’re not driving it.” Using a bi-directional charger that can put energy in your car and then take it back out again, you can power your home via V2H, or help stabilise the electricity grid during periods of high demand, via V2G. “With V2G, if you lose a generator or load somewhere in the energy system, the vehicles will start charging or discharging to counteract that disturbance,” she says. “It’s a pretty critical service for keeping the system stable, because electricity has to match generation and demand continuously in real time.” The concept of V2H and V2G becomes even more attractive when you use free, renewable solar energy, which can be harnessed to charge your EV or PHEV, which in turn powers your home, reducing your energy and fuel bills to zero. “You’ve just got to look at how much solar there is out there,” Jones says. “We’ve got 40% [of homes with] rooftop solar or more in Queensland and South Australia – on a world scale, that’s huge.” Mitsubishi has combined the benefits of V2H, V2G and solar power to create the future-focused Dendo Drive House concept, a home-energy ecosystem that comprises an EV/PHEV, a bi-directional charger, solar panels and a home battery. Tim Clarke, eMobility strategy manager at Mitsubishi Motors Australia, says the Dendo Drive House concept was created to showcase the capabilities of existing technology. “We have such abundant renewable-energy resources in this country, so it totally makes sense for us to use that,” he says. “A home energy system that allows you to capture and store renewable energy when it is abundant, and then use it when you need it in your home or in your car is a great fit for Australians. It will challenge us to think about our day-to-day lives and how energy can be integrated into that.” For those with range anxiety around EVs, Clarke points out that PHEVs, such as Mitsubishi’s Outlander, are a best-of-both-worlds solution, because they can run in pure EV mode, or engage their petrol-electric hybrid drive system for longer trips. “We feel that PHEVs are a really a good solution for Australia right now; the new Outlander Mitsubishi Plug-in Hybrid EV has a 20kWh battery that allows you to travel 84km in all-electric mode, which covers most users’ daily commuting requirements,” he says. “In Australia, we have some of the longest distances between populated areas in the world, and we don’t have charging infrastructure in a lot of those places. Because PHEV is an EV for daily commute, and a petrol-electric hybrid for long distances, current charging infrastructure inadequacies are not an issue. It really gives you the best of both worlds.” With the ability to provide energy to your home or even emergency power in a disaster-relief scenario (all by harnessing free solar, if you so choose), today’s EVs are not only helping consumers with rising energy costs, but also helping the planet. As the sun might say, it’s a bright idea.

But the decision by the business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, to oppose her publicly over solar energy plans is still a dramatic one that leaves her looking even weaker and more exposed. Having previously stressed his support for fracking, and oil and gas drilling in the North Sea, Mr Rees-Mogg used an article in the Guardian to deny that he opposes green energy. While Ms Truss wants to restrict new solar installations on farmland, Mr Rees-Mogg’s deregulatory fervour extends beyond fossil fuels to renewables as well. Ms Truss’s anti-solar scheme is so ill-judged that all voices raised against it are welcome. But Mr Rees-Mogg’s enthusiasm for new oil and gas means that he must never be mistaken for a friend to green causes. He is right to point out that carbon-intensive imports are just as damaging to the atmosphere as UK-based industries. But while his backing for solar and wind may make him a more consistent free-marketeer than the prime minister – who is against red tape except when it blocks something she dislikes – the risks to the environment from all those like him who champion growth at the expense of nature remain huge. Renewed enthusiasm for fossil fuel projects is one aspect of this government’s reactionary and dangerous agenda. Two more are the promises to scrap hundreds of environmental regulations governing areas such as water quality (already shockingly poor), and to remove wildlife protections from new low-tax investment zones. The decision to review a post-Brexit farming payments scheme that took six years to set up – and which has already led to enhanced protection for wildlife in pilot areas – offers further proof of the government’s disdain for all things green. Ms Truss made this explicit when she targeted climate campaigners as part of an “anti-growth coalition”. So far, she shows no sign of paying attention to warnings from senior figures including William Hague that she is on the wrong track. But concern about the government’s new direction is spreading. Ministers are at odds not only with environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace, but also with mass-membership charities beloved of many Tory voters, including the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Paul Miner, from the countryside charity CPRE, described the reversals on fracking and other issues as “a litany of betrayal and broken promises”. Precisely how the anger prompted by these anti-green policies will manifest itself remains to be seen. Already, charities have called on members to contact MPs, and they will be emboldened by a speech from the Charity Commission’s chair, Orlando Fraser, affirming their right to engage in political activity. With another crunch UN climate conference fast approaching, and a new report from scientists pointing to a further decline in animal populations, conservation groups and their supporters are right to be alarmed. It is widely understood by voters in the UK – and judging from polling, by a majority of people around the world – that the next few years offer a final opportunity to prevent climate-linked destruction on an unimaginable scale. Under Boris Johnson, Conservative environment policies were nowhere near ambitious enough. But under Ms Truss, they are already far worse. Her hang-the-consequences short-termism would never have won a general election. The Greenpeace activists who interrupted her conference speech were right that voters do not support the policies she has embraced. They and other groups should take heart from the support they have already received. Ministers may not care about the damage that they are causing, but the public does."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/13/trust-farmers-to-make-the-right-choices-on-solar-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T16:22:05Z","webTitle":"Trust farmers to make the right choices on solar projects | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/trust-farmers-to-make-the-right-choices-on-solar-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/13/trust-farmers-to-make-the-right-choices-on-solar-projects","fields":{"headline":"Trust farmers to make the right choices on solar projects","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The new environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, appears to believe that farmers and local communities are unable to make the right choices about which land should be used to produce food and which to produce energy (Ministers hope to ban solar projects from most English farms, 10 October). This is not a new problem for farmers. In the 19th century, my predecessors chose to produce energy on one-third of my farm and food on two-thirds. Without the oats grown on a large part of the farm, we could not have fed the horses enough energy to allow them to help us to produce human food on the rest of the farm. It may come as a shock to Jayawardena, but modern progressive farmers are constantly seeking to balance not just food and energy production, but also carbon sequestration and biodiversity enhancement. I believe we have the ability, by working together with communities, environmentalists and others, to deliver each of these things in balance, but only if we are allowed the flexibility to choose our own solutions. If we are dictated to by governments with little or no understanding of the complexities or trade-offs involved, it is almost inevitable that we will fail on not just food security and energy security but also climate change and reversing the biodiversity crises. Stuart Roberts Harpenden, Hertfordshire • The environment secretary’s initiative to define more farmland as the “best and most versatile” and end its loss to huge solar farms is overdue. Changing open countryside into large blocks of fenced-off panels should never have been permitted to start. In 2014, the coalition government envisaged solar arrays being on industrial roof space, and its then agriculture minister, Liz Truss, spoke against using farmland. Truss promised in her leadership campaign to see this through. The scale of damage was highlighted in two parliamentary debates earlier this year, on 9 March and 8 June. If Ranil Jayawardena can remove the distinction between grades 3a and 3b in the agricultural land classification, he will doing the nation a wider service. It dates from the 1960s, and farming practice and husbandry has changed so much since then that it is meaningless. All it does is give work to consultants paid by housebuilders and solar energy companies to test soils and report that land is grade 3b or lower, so that it can be developed. Planning restrictions on windfarms have saved many English landscapes from large turbines and made wind energy companies go offshore. Extending the protection of farmland from development by ending the grade 3a/3b distinction would have a similar beneficial effect: keeping our land for food and making solar developers use industrial roof space. Mark Sullivan Campaign to Protect Rural England, West Midlands region • The environment secretary is reportedly opposed to solar farms because they take land out of food production. This need not be the case. Developing agrivoltaic technology is demonstrating that crops can be very successfully grown under raised solar panels. Duncan Forbes Charlbury, Oxfordshire • It’s a common misconception that solar farms are incompatible with agricultural use of the land. Friends in Maine, US, have a photovoltaic farm with 140,000 panels, beneath which graze a flock of 200 sheep.

In doing so, they have even managed to unite the free-market, anti-net-zero Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank with green groups, the energy industry and the Labour party in opposing the plans. Banning solar farms from most of England’s farmland would place Truss squarely in opposition to the policy priorities she set out in her own speech to the Conservative party conference. Under the banner “get Britain moving”, the prime minister said she wanted faster economic growth, lower energy bills, reinforced energy security, more renewables and action to tackle the climate crisis. Yet the solar ban would hold back investment, lead to higher energy bills, lock in continued gas imports, stop renewable growth and stall efforts to reach net zero emissions. Truss said her ambition was to unleash “growth, growth and growth”. This will be news to the investors waiting to pour up to £20bn into new UK solar projects, according to the Financial Times. Her speech decried the “anti-growth coalition” that she said was “always [for] more taxes, more regulation and more meddling”. So farmers looking for more income may balk if Truss bans them from adding to growth by giving their fields over to solar while continuing to graze livestock. She said growth meant “businesses creating jobs”. But perhaps not the tens of thousands of jobs that industry group Solar Energy UK says its sector could be created by 2030. Truss touted her government’s efforts to “shield people from astronomically high [energy] bills”. But her ban would block new solar projects, which are quick to build and generates electricity nine times more cheaply than gas. She talked of “fiscal responsibility” and “bring[ing] down debt” – and yet higher bills will raise the cost of her “energy price guarantee”, which could add as much as £140bn to the national debt. Warning of dependence on “authoritarian regimes for cheap goods and energy”, Truss said she would take “decisive action to reinforce our energy security”. Yet she is also decisively against new solar, each 5 gigawatts of which would cut UK gas imports by 2%. Truss said her government was “delivering more renewables” and in an earlier speech had pledged to “speed up our deployment of all clean and renewable technologies, including … solar”. So she must be disappointed to learn that her officials believe an effective ban would slow things down. Finally, the Conservative leader told the party faithful that she would “deliver on our commitment to net zero [emissions by 2050]” and “tackle climate change”. Her government remains committed – at least as of early September – to a fully decarbonised power sector by 2035. Is this why Truss wants to block new solar? The technology, after all, plays a major role in the net zero pathways published by her climate advisers the Climate Change Committee – and I estimate that each 5GW of new solar would cut UK emissions by 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide. The real reasons for Truss and Jayawardena’s antipathy are unclear. Since they cannot oppose solar on grounds of cost, growth, energy security or climate, they are now citing food security. Yet solar occupies a tiny fraction of the UK, is usually on less productive agricultural land and is frequently co-located with grazing. At less than 0.1% of the country, solar covers a smaller land area than airports, golf courses or Christmas trees. Solar also covers a significantly smaller UK land area than biofuel crops, even though Carbon Brief analysis shows solar delivers 50-100 times more driving distance per hectare. Moreover, the farmland supposedly under threat from solar is facing more serious pressures from elsewhere. “The biggest threat to prime farmland in the UK is not solar farms,” says Prof Richard Betts, technical lead of the third UK Climate Change Risk Assessment report. “It’s climate change.” One of the only remaining possibilities is that the prime minister simply dislikes the way solar farms look. If so, the Liz Truss who says she wants less regulation, more growth, cheaper bills, more renewables, greater energy security and lower emissions may need to have words.

Here’s what you might have missed today: The federal government declared 27 councils in NSW eligible for disaster assistance payments after the floods in the past few weeks. Those LGAs are: Blayney, Bogan, Burke, Brewarrina, Cabonne, Cowra, Dubbo, Edward River, Forbes, Gilgandra, Glen Innes Severn, Greater Hume, Gunnedah, Gwydir, Lachlan, Lithgow, Liverpool Plains, Moree Plains, Mid-Western, Narrabri, Narromine, Tamworth, Upper Lachlan, Walgett, Warren, Warrumbungle and Weddin. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus has said the pursuit of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has gone on too long but has repeated that the Australian government won’t make its case to the US in public. Dreyfus also said he wants reforms to whistleblower protection laws in place before the National Anti-Corruption Commission is up and running. There was a mixed reception to Tourism Australia unveiling a computer generated kangaroo, Ruby the Roo, as Australia’s new tourism mascot. Russian and Belarusian players will be able to compete in the Australian Open in 2023, but not under their country’s flags. It comes after they were controversially banned from Wimbledon. Former deputy New South Wales premier John Barilaro has entered a not guilty plea to assault and malicious damage after an alleged altercation with a Channel Seven camera operator in July. The Australian government said it has signed a $322m contract with Raytheon Australia as part of upgrades to the existing Collins-class submarines. Natasha May will be back with you in the morning. Until then, I hope you have a nice evening. Qantas staff apply to take protected industrial action Qantas domestic cabin crew have applied to the federal industrial umpire to take protected action over fatigue concerns and claims of outsourcing, AAP reports. The Flight Attendants’ Association of Australia (FAAA) says Qantas management “have threatened employees that they will not have access to work on new aircraft unless they sign onto new enterprise agreements that dramatically cut conditions”. In May, Qantas ordered 20 Airbus A321XLR aircraft as part of the first tranche of its domestic fleet renewal which will replace its Boeing 737 aircraft. The association says the airline would extend shifts from 10 to 12 hours for crew on the new Airbuses and cut rest time between shifts. “To force crew to work even longer and harder than they already are with no additional break between shifts would cause more to go off sick with fatigue, causing further disruption to an already chaotic Qantas flight schedule,” said the association’s general secretary Teri O’Toole. But Qantas denies the union’s claims, saying the “grounds for taking this step towards industrial action are misleading”. “The shift length changes we’re asking for are the same that apply to crew working at other domestic airlines in Australia,” a Qantas spokesperson told AAP on Wednesday. They also denied any plans to outsource the attendants’ shifts. “The FAAA signed off on these conditions as part of agreements for those airlines, so it’s bizarre they’re now claiming they’re unsafe.” If the FAAA’s application is successful cabin crew will then vote on industrial action which Qantas says cannot take place before mid-November. Animal Justice party says Ruby Roo ‘would have been shot’ We can add the Animal Justice Party to the list of people who are a bit bemused by Tourism Australia picking a kangaroo as its new mascot. Animal Justice party MP Mark Pearson said: I suppose we should be grateful to Tourism Australia for creating a CGI-animated kangaroo to promote Australia and its iconic animals, because, at the rate the Australian government is allowing kangaroos to be slaughtered for leather and pet food, cartoon kangaroos are all we will have left to show tourists and future generations. If Tourism Australia’s brand ambassador Ruby Roo was real, she would have been shot as part of a government ‘kangaroo management plan’ and hung up by her leg on the back of a ute. Tourism Australia’s new brand ambassador Ruby Roo is a heartrending fiction: the Australian government despises kangaroos. If Ruby Roo was real, she would have been labelled a pest and shot in the head. Where the bloody hell is your sense of hypocrisy, Tourism Australia?” Meanwhile, in Perth. A class action against BHP over a 2015 Brazilian dam collapse that killed 19 people can proceed despite not all of the claimants being Australian residents, after a high court ruling. AAP reports the group of more than 29,000 people held BHP shares on the Australian Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange before the Fundao Dam failure. The village of Bento Rodrigues was wiped out when the dam in southeastern Brazil collapsed, killing 19 and displacing 700. The Australian class action covers a period from October 2013 until the dam failure on 9 November, 2015. The claimants alleged they suffered losses because BHP failed to meet its stock exchange disclosure obligations and because the mining company was misleading or deceptive. BHP argued any claimants who were non-Australian resident shareholders could not legally be part of the class action. But Australia’s high court on Wednesday dismissed BHP’s appeal, ruling the legislation does not restrict a claimant’s geographical location or residence. “BHP’s construction [of the law] ignores the Constitution and the legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament... and rewrites the Federal Court of Australia Act,” the High Court justices said in their judgment. “BHP’s construction would signal a ‘radical departure’ from the accepted bases.” BHP told AAP it remained committed to defending the shareholder class action in Australia. Lawyers from Phi Finney McDonald and Maurice Blackburn, who are representing the claimants, said Wednesday’s decision promoted access to justice. Everyone is getting along very nicely in the new parliament. Richard Boyle hearing adjourned The hearing that will decide whether tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle is immune from prosecution has been adjourned until next Wednesday. Boyle is facing 24 charges including for recording private phone calls and taking photographs of taxpayer information, actions he says were part of gathering evidence as he prepared to make a public interest disclosure about the Australian Tax Office’s actions. Judge Liesl Kudelka will determine whether Boyle is protected by the Public Interest Disclosure Act. If she decides not, he faces a trial and potential prison term. In the past week, Boyle has told the South Australian district court he grew increasingly concerned about what he called maladministration in the tax office. He alleges employees were told to use heavy-handed tactics to recover debts from taxpayers, including by forcing third parties such as banks to hand over money. Vulnerable taxpayers were at risk of suicide, he said, when the tax office ignored their claims of hardship and insisted on pursuing debts. On the other hand, Boyle said, he had been told that usually the ATO wrote off about $1bn every year in debts to reduce their debt level, and that in 2017 that went up to $3bn, which was unusual. He was concerned that taxpayers were having debts written off, but were then receiving tax credits on their income tax, instead of the credit being applied to their written off debt. He described that as a potential breach of the tax legislation. Boyle says he tried to raise his concerns internally, then eventually turned to the media to expose them. This is the first test of the whistleblower laws, and advocates fear the hearing and possibility of a trial will have a chilling effect on other potential whistleblowers. Nicholas Robinson KC, acting for the director of the office of public prosecutions, pressed Boyle on why he couldn’t just take notes of conversations. Boyle’s response was that a tape recording “would be unequivocal and objective evidence, rather than my hand taken notes”, and expressed scepticism that the ATO would produce the written records if needed as evidence. Boyle has told the court that he faced “reprisals” and bullying for drawing attention to the tax office’s actions, that it constituted “psychological abuse” and had left him with post traumatic stress disorder. Lawyers for both sides will now prepare written and oral submissions for the judge. Richard Marles aiming to build friendship with Papua New Guinea during visit The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, says he will “reaffirm our close and enduring friendship with Papua New Guinea” during a visit to the country from today until Friday. Marles, who is also the defence minister, is expected to meet with PNG’s prime minister, James Marape, and other senior ministers. The agenda includes talks about “priorities and opportunities in national security, infrastructure, agriculture, and economic cooperation”. The government said Marles would also “take a friendship walk along part of the Kokoda Track to mark the 80th anniversary of the pivotal Kokoda Campaign during the Second World War”. The trip comes amid efforts by the Australian government to strengthen ties with Pacific countries. Earlier today the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said she would travel to the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Nauru. Marles said: My visit to Papua New Guinea reflects the importance Australia places on our friendship with our closest neighbour, and reaffirms the government’s commitment to partnering with Papua New Guinea through the PNG-Australia Comprehensive Strategic and Economic Partnership (CSEP). I am looking forward to meeting with prime minister Marape and some of his ministers, to discuss our respective priorities and how we can better align our efforts, partnership opportunities, and reaffirm the importance of working with our Pacific family. Many know that I have a close affection for PNG, and am very much looking forward to what will be one of many visits to our close neighbour. Greens Senator Lidia Thorpe says she will be making a complaint to the Australian Press Council over what she alleges was false reporting in the Australian on Tuesday about her meeting former Liberal candidate Warren Mundine about their joint opposition to a referendum on the voice. Thorpe said yesterday she would not be joining the “no” campaign and today confirmed said she would lodge a press council complaint over the alleged false report. She said the meeting with Mundine was a meeting of members of the crossbench to discuss the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Guardian Australia contacted News Corp Australia yesterday about Thorpe’s claim. The federal government services minister, Bill Shorten, and the federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, have announced residents in 27 local government areas are eligible for the disaster recovery allowance following severe storms and flooding in NSW in September and October. The allowance will be available from 2pm tomorrow to the following LGAs: Blayney, Bogan, Burke, Brewarrina, Cabonne, Cowra, Dubbo, Edward River, Forbes, Gilgandra, Glen Innes Severn, Greater Hume, Gunnedah, Gwydir, Lachlan, Lithgow, Liverpool Plains, Moree Plains, Mid-Western, Narrabri, Narromine, Tamworth, Upper Lachlan, Walgett, Warren, Warrumbungle and Weddin. The allowance is available to employees and sole traders who experience a loss of income as a result of the disaster and is payable up to 13 weeks. The payment will also be available to eligible NZ citizens affected by the floods. People can lodge claims through myGov, or call the Australian Government Emergency Information Line on 180 22 66. Only one in eight medical students choosing general practice The health minister, Mark Butler, tells ABC’s Afternoon Briefing patients are saying it’s never been harder to see a GP, and GPs are saying that their businesses are under real threat in terms of financial viability because of six years of Medicare rebate freezes under the former government. He said: It’s not just the pressure today, it’s what I described as a terrifying trend which is only one in eight medical graduates today is choosing general practice as their career. It used to be four in eight. Now it is one in eight. That pipeline of new GPs to replace the baby boomer generation of general practitioners while considering retirement today is not just there for us so that’s why want to talk to medical students themselves. He says he wants to hear from the students what needs to change to attract them to general practice. Tasmanians warned of wild weather The Tasmania State Emergency Service (SES) has warned Tasmanians, particularly those in the north and north-west, to be ready for intense rainfall, damaging winds, and potential flooding from tonight. Tasmania SES acting director, Leon Smith, said: The state is already very wet, which means that rain over the next few days could lead to flooding in the forecast areas. It’s imperative that Tasmanians heed the warnings and take note that intense rainfalls could lead to significant flooding within the north-west, north, and north-east areas of the state. Of concern in the first instance, modelling shows impacts on the north-west townships of Railton, Latrobe, Wivenhoe, Burnie, and Sheffield. This is a dynamic situation of significance that we are monitoring, but inevitably we will see flooding in some areas within the forecast areas over the coming days. If you know that you live in a low-lying area that is prone to flooding; if you were in areas of the north-west in the 2016 floods; and you are aware that your property, or the property of someone you know, has been previously impacted by flood, there is a high chance flood impacts will be seen during this event. Tourism Australia boss defends use of cartoon kangaroo Tourism Australia’s managing director, Phillipa Harrison, is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to speak about the controversial use of a cartoon kangaroo called Ruby to sell tourism to Australia overseas. She says Tourism Australia spent a lot of time researching what overseas markets love about Australia, and at the moment people are still staying close to home, so there needed to be an extra impetus given for people to take those long flights to Australia. She says the research showed people recognised the kangaroo more than anything else, and people loved the “warm and welcoming” nature of Australians, so the campaign is designed to remind people Australia is open and “warm and welcoming”. She says while Australians are very interested in how they’re represented internationally, ultimately the campaign is not marketed to Australians. Disaster recovery allowance available in NSW The federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, has just posted that disaster recovery allowance is now available for people in 27 council locations in NSW. I am just chasing down where those councils are and will bring more for you when I have it. And with that, I am going to hand you over to Josh Taylor who will take you through the evening! Qantas ‘welcomes’ use of luggage trackers by passengers A spokesperson for Qantas said the airline “welcomed” their customers using the trackers and did not have plans to change the rules around their use.

Scientists discover ‘exciting advancement’ in potential Alzheimer’s disease treatment Queensland researchers have forged a path to delivering Alzheimer’s drugs directly to the brain in a major scientific breakthrough, AAP has reported. Scientists at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute created models of the human blood-brain barrier, a wall of cells that protects the brain from pathogens and toxins, and successfully opened it. The barrier works as a natural shield and blocks 98% of disease-fighting drugs from entering the brain. QIMR Berghofer scientists created blood-brain barrier models using stem cells from Alzheimer’s patients and successfully unlocked the barrier using focused ultrasound. “It’s a very exciting advancement in the therapeutic ultrasound field,” researcher Dr Lotta Oikari told AAP. “We are able to model the blood-brain barriers of people who have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease in the laboratory setting and increase the delivery of therapeutic Alzheimer’s antibodies. Federal inquiry hears long Covid clinics inundated Hello everyone – this is Cait Kelly, and I will be with you for the next hour or so. A big thank you to Natasha for taking us through the morning! First up, I have this from AAP: Long Covid clinics across the country are being inundated with requests for assessments from patients struggling with ongoing symptoms, an inquiry has heard. Doctors told the federal parliamentary inquiry into long Covid and repeated Covid infections on Wednesday they are struggling to keep up with demand and waitlists are increasing. At least ten million Australians have been infected with Covid and it’s estimated 3 to 5% will develop long Covid at some point. Long Covid is characterised by long-term health issues including heart palpitations and extreme fatigue, three months from the onset of Covid, with symptoms lasting at least two months, according to the World Health Organisation. “Our waitlist is increasing because what we’ve observed is that it can take some time for the recognition of post-COVID conditions, particularly with the fatigue-predominant types, to reach us,” Royal Children’s hospital Associate Professor Shidan Tosif told the inquiry. Thanks for your attention, that’s it from me for today. I hand you over to the lovely Cait Kelly. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has visited the Multicultural Council of Wagga Wagga (MCWW). In a bit of mid-afternoon blog joy before I sign off, here is the MCWW’s mascot Bennie. Councils like MCWW still need to promote the acceptance of cultural diversity, because we don’t possess the same loving acceptance as our canine friends like Bennie. As Marilyn Munroe quipped: Dogs never bite me. Just humans. Research grants favour men, minister for women says The minister for finance and women Katy Gallagher says the government is committing funding targets to ensure gender equality in research opporunities. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has reaffirmed the government’s view that the pursuit of Julian Assange has “gone on long enough” and has alluded to private talks with the Biden administration about the issue. At the National Press Club in Canberra today, Dreyfus was asked about the US attempt to prosecute the Wikileaks co-founder. Assange is fighting a US attempt to extradite him from the UK to face charges in connection with the publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables. Press freedom advocates and human rights groups have raised fears the prosecution of Assange under the US Espionage Act sets “a dangerous precedent”. When asked today whether he thought it was in the public interest that the prosecution of Julian Assange continue, Dreyfus said: Mr Assange’s case has gone on long enough. The prime minister has said this. The foreign minister has said this. I’ve said this. I will say it again: it has gone on long enough but we’re not going to conduct our representations to the government of the United States in public. I’ll say no more about that. Australians attend Bali bombings memorial service in Denpasar The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, has laid a wreath in Bali as part of a memorial service to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings. The event was held at the consulate in Denpasar’s memorial garden and attended by Australian families of those killed, survivors themselves, diplomatic members of the Australian consulate to Indonesia and members of the Australian Federal Police, who were part of the investigation after the bombing. Watts gave a speech talking about the attack, recognising the courage of the many first responders, rescue teams and volunteers who worked for days to help people affected by the bombings. He said: 20 years later, the pain is still felt. That night remains seared into the national memories of Indonesians, Australians and so many others. We will always remember these 202 innocent people, most under the age of 40, the youngest just 13 years old. Today we pay tribute to those who died. Race to document ancient boab carvings Sue O’Connor, a professor of archaeology at the Australian National University, says it’s “a race against time” to record 12 ancient boab trees bearing carvings that tell the Dreaming story of the king brown snake, or Lingka. No one knows how old these trees are. But if they were 500 years old at the time they were carved, which is conceivable, then they may not live for that much longer.” It’s impossible to know the age of the carvings found on the trees, in a patch of the Tanami straddling the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, AAP reports. But some, high on the bulbous trunks of the slow-growing heritage trees, give a sense of how long they might have been there. Almost all the carvings are of snakes and their location matches the Lingka Dreaming track Indigenous owners speak of, stretching from south of Broome and into the territory. O’Connor says: The Dreaming track is where the traditional owners believe the Lingka, or king brown snake, travelled across the country. Prof O’Connor, colleagues, traditional owners including Jaru woman Brenda Garstone and historian Darrell Lewis have just published a new paper in the journal Antiquity about their two years of field work to document the 12 trees. The carvings on the 12 trees have been meticulously recorded using photogrammetry with the hope of staging a 3D exhibition to offer all Australians a sense of the trees’ history and power. Prof O’Connor believes there are more carved trees yet to be found. She just hopes it’s before they are destroyed by lightning strikes or bushfires, damaged by hungry cattle that like to gnaw on boab bark, or collapse with old age. Garstone, who was also on the mission and co-authored the paper, hopes money can be found to fund another search and save more of her family’s ancestral heritage. She said: I think it’s really important to go to all lengths to be able to preserve this ancient icon, that is a symbol of our ancestral dreaming. It connects to the fact that it’s the oldest living culture. This is another piece of proof that this has been continuously passed down through generations. Bureau of Meteorology releases weather update for Victoria, Tasmania and southern NSW Russian and Belarusian players will be able to compete in the Australian Open in 2023, but not under their country’s flags. It comes after they were controversially banned from Wimbledon. At the launch event today, Australian Open director Craig Tiley confirmed the Association of Tennis Professionals’ ruling that players compete as ‘neutrals’ after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would extend to the Open. At this point, Russian and Belarusian players will be eligible to play in the Australian Open, and they, like every other player, will have to go through the (entry) process. The only difference will be that they cannot represent Russia - they cannot represent the flag of Russia. They cannot participate in any activity such as the anthem of Russia and they have to play as independent players under a neutral name. - with AAP Australian Open organisers will not lobby government for Djokovic visa Australian Open tournament director, Craig Tiley, says he will not lobby on behalf of the unvaccinated Serbian player, Novak Djokovic who was dramatically deported from Australia on the eve of this year’s tournament. The Tennis Australia (TA) boss - who was heavily involved in the saga that saw Djokovic locked up in a quarantine hotel - at the time blamed the changing Covid-19 landscape for miscommunication with federal authorities, AAP reports. The former world No.1 is subject to a three-year ban from entering Australia but can apply for an exemption from new immigration minister, Andrew Giles. Speaking at the launch of the 2023 tournament, Tiley said he would not be involved in the process this time. Tiley told reporters today: At this point ... Novak and the federal government need to work out the situation and then we’ll follow any instruction after that. It’s not a matter we can lobby on. It’s a matter that definitely stays between the two of them and then depending on the outcome of that we would welcome him to the Australian Open. Tiley said he had so far had no communication with the federal government about Djokovic. The tournament director said he spent time with the 21-grand slam title winner at the recent Laver Cup and Djokovic told him he was keen to return to Melbourne Park. He said that he’d obviously love to come back to Australia, but he knows it’s going to be an ultimate decision for the federal government. He’s accepted that position. It’s a private matter between them but we’d like to welcome Novak back - he’s a nine-time champion - provided he gets the right entry requirements into Australia. Tiley said TA had brought on external immigration specialists to help deal with the demand from players and their entourages, with double the applicants of last year. Nine news is reporting that a man has been shot in Sydney’s west, following a separate shooting in Cabramatta last night. Government considering greater transparency measures ahead of referendum, attorney general says My colleague Josh Butler has asked the attorney general Mark Dreyfus at the National Press Club about what is happening about funding with the yes and no campaigns for the referendum on the voice to parliament. Butler: I wanted to ask but the Voice to Parliament, will there be public funding given to the respective sides of the debate and, related, does the Government have concerns about influx of private money into the respective campaigns, potentially from overseas political interest groups, what could the Government due to ensure that voters get transparency about who was bankrolling the respective sides of the campaign? Dreyfus: It’s a great question. We are looking at all of the arrangements about how this referendum on the voice is to be conducted. We have committed to accepting the generous offer made in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, I hope everyone in this room, and I hope everyone in Australia has read the Uluru Statement from the Heart, it is a wonderful national opportunity to recognise our Indigenous Australians in our Constitution and I’m looking forward to the referendum happening. Before that we have to pay attention to the machinery that surrounds the conduct of a referendum. We haven’t had a referendum in Australia since 1999. We haven’t had a successful one since 1977. Ancient history, almost. If you are under 40 you haven’t voted in a referendum. And we need to look really hard and we are looking really hard on these deliberations now within government as to what the arrangement should be. One of those questions is just just goes to your question, Josh, which is achieving transparency in donations, possibly to a greater level than we presently have in the electoral process. Another question, a machinery question is how to make a very antiquated referendum machinery provisions look more like the electoral process that we have in Australia, which is what Australians are familiar with. So that’s ahead. But we will see more in coming months about what the arrangements we are proposing are. Butler reminds Dreyfus about the part of his question about whether the government has concerns about overseas groups funding campaign. He says “it is a concern” because he can’t think of a reason for overseas groups to be funding this campaign. Speculation about soaring electricity prices brightens solar outlook Power prices are in the news again thanks in large part to Jeff Dimery, the head of Alinta Energy warning on Monday (as noted in this blog) that electricity tariffs may rise as much as 35% next year. (Actually, it’s rather early to make so precise a figure, but anyways...) One consequence of such chatter is that more people make inquiries about solar energy, and a portion of those go on to install panels (since the economics are pretty good - not to mention avoided carbon emissions). And that’s what we’ve seen. According to Green Energy Markets, there was a fair uptick in installations in August and lately, September. (Commercial demand picked up even more than residential.) And it’s a pattern across much of the nation. Higher prices for systems had started to hit PV installations, but we should keep in mind demand had soared during the Covid lockdowns when people were spending a lot of time staring at the ceilings at home - and apparently their rooftops. We look more at the market trends in this piece that has just gone live, including how Dimery’s comments have set off another spike in solar PV inquiries, according to SolarQuotes: Separately, given that solar offers some “insurance” against higher bills, it’s worth looking at the latest size of turnover within the National Electricity Market (which serves 80% of the nation’s populace, mostly in the country’s east). Looks like we might be talking about electricity (and gas) prices for some time to come. Greens question government stance on private anti-corruption hearings We brought you what the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has been telling the National Press Club in Canberra a couple posts ago about the National Anti Corruption Commission (Nacc). Greens senator David Shoebridge has taken to social media welcoming the new government’s position in contrast to the previous government, but he questions Dreyfus’s reasoning when it comes to private hearings. The criticism comes after other members of the crossbench also expressed their concerns that the hearings won’t be public. Penny Wong to visit to the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the republic of Nauru The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, will this week travel to the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Nauru. In the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Wong will officially open Australia’s embassy which commenced operations last year. In a statement Wong said: I will also be putting to air the first Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio program on the Republic of the Marshall Island’s national broadcaster in six years. I look forward to meeting His Excellency President David Kabua, Foreign Minister Kitlang Kabua, other members of parliament, and community leaders to discuss climate action and enhance our security, environmental, cultural and economic partnerships. In Nauru, I will meet newly elected President His Excellency Russ Kun to discuss our shared priorities such as climate-resilient infrastructure, connectivity, economic opportunities and pandemic recovery. I will also launch a new partnership with Nauru and the Australian Football League to support young athletes in Nauru, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. This will be Wong’s eighth visit to the Pacific as foreign minister, and the first ministerial visit to the Republic of the Marshall Islands since 2018. Wong says the visit demonstrates “the priority the new Australian government places on our region” and will further strengthen Australia’s ties with “our Pacific family.” Major flooding likely in Victoria’s northern catchments The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra, and knows his audience. He moves onto what the Nacc will mean for press freedom. Dreyfus: Shortly I will be introducing separate reforms to the public interest disclosure act to improve whistleblower protections with the aim of having these reforms in place when the commission commenced operation. Many of those present have a strong interest in press freedom. So do I. For this reason the legislation establishing the national anti-corruption commission contains strong safeguards to protect the identities of journalist sources and to uphold the clear public interest associated with a free press. As attorney general I’m acutely conscious that any newly created power brought onto our statute books must not interfere with the important work of the press in holding those in authority to account. At this point a member of the audience applauds (my colleague Josh Butler who’s in the room informs me this comes from the chief executive of the press club, Maurice Reilly. Thank you, I thought this might be one audience that might appreciate those sentiments. There’s even more! The legislation expressly provides that journalists and their employers will not be required to answer questions or provide information that will enable the identity of their sources to be identified. The commission’s access to search and surveillance powers will be subject to additional safeguards to protect press freedom and the identity of journalist’s sources. And the work does not end there… the Albanese government intends to progress further legislative reform as a priority, including responding to important reports on press freedom from the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security and is Senate standing committee on environment and communications both from the last parliament. Nacc “is not a court”, Mark Dreyfus says Let me be clear, the national anti-corruption commission is not a court. It is an investigative body. Its primary work is rooting out and exposing corruption. At the conclusion of an investigation the commissioner will be able to publish a detailed report. That report would set out the commissioner’s findings and recommendations supported by evidence, including evidence obtained in private hearings, providing transparency and a comprehensive, public account of the commission’s investigation. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is addressing the National Press Club this lunchtime. He is speaking about one of the details in the government’s national anti-corruption commission (Nacc) which has proved most contentious – that most hearings will be private, with public hearings only held in exception circumstances. The experience of state anti-corruption commissions is that a very small proportion of all hearings are actually public, including the well-known New South Wales independent commission against corruption. There are important reasons why some hearings need to be conducted in private, including to avoid prejudicing an ongoing investigation or related criminal proceedings, to protect the privacy of witnesses or to ensure national security information is protected from disclosure. The decision to hold hearings in public or in private will be made by the independent commissioner. The commission will use hearings to question witnesses and obtain critical evidence about alleged serious or systemic corruption on the way to making findings and recommendations. There will be times when the commission’s investigations will be done in public and other times investigations investigations will benefit from being done in private. The Australian government says it has signed a $322m contract with Raytheon Australia as part of upgrades to the existing Collins-class submarines. Defence issued a press release saying the five-year contract contract will ensure “in-service support for the Collins-class submarine combat system during Australia’s transition to nuclear-powered submarines”. Both major Australian parties have long flagged the need to extend the life of the existing submarines given that the new nuclear-powered submarines could be decades away. The Department of Defence’s deputy secretary for naval shipbuilding and sustainment, Tony Dalton, said the support would include a life-of-type extension beginning in 2026, ongoing sustainment, and selected capability enhancements. Dalton said in the statement: The ongoing sustainment and upgrade of these boats will help maintain a capability advantage and ensure our fleet is ready to meet the challenges across our strategic environment. We are committed to working closely with industry to sustain our Collins class submarines, an important task that currently supports over 1600 jobs across South and West Australia. It’s not a new role for Raytheon Australia: the government says the company “has been providing a range of support services for the Collins-class submarine combat system since its introduction into service”. Clive Palmer announces United Australia party’s new Victorian leader The United Australia party founder, Clive Palmer, is trying to get some candidates up in the Victorian state election, and has announced former Liberal MP for Frankston Geoff Shaw as the party’s leader in the state. Shaw hasn’t been in parliament for almost eight years (or two terms). He resigned from the Liberal party in 2013, which ultimately led to the then premier, Ted Ballieu, resigning after facing internal pressure. The turmoil the Liberal party faced resulted in the party being turfed out of office after just one term, and Victoria has now had eight years of the Daniel Andrews Labor government. High fire danger predicted for south-west Queensland tomorrow Kangaroo advocates are claiming Tourism Australia is cashing in on the beloved species to lure tourists to the country, while turning a blind eye to their demise. Tourism Australia today unveiled a computer generated souvenir kangaroom, Ruby the Roo, as the mascot for its “Come and Say G’day” campaign, voiced by Australian actor Rose Byrne. Former Australian Test cricketer and Kangaroos Alive ambassador Jason “Dizzy” Gillespie said the federal and NSW governments are happy to use the iconic animal to promote tourism on billboards around the world, while at the same time, ignoring concerns about the commercial killing of kangaroos. A NSW parliamentary report into the health and wellbeing of kangaroos examined the management of the commercial kangaroo industry, and found evidence of an unsustainable animal welfare crisis which forced the NSW and federal governments to admit no one is monitoring how the animals meet their end. The inquiry recommended greater transparency of kangaroo management plans, programs and practices. Gillespie said: Tourism Australia even said we’re so lucky to have a globally recognisable and adorable icon in the kangaroo. We need to learn to value these international icons and acknowledge that they are worth much more to Australia alive. Our tourist industry relies on them. The kangaroo is on our Australian coat of arms, it’s the Australian made symbol and it is a much loved animal not just here in Australia but all over the world. Queensland researchers unlock Alzheimer’s barrier Queensland researchers have forged a path to delivering Alzheimer’s drugs directly to the brain in a major scientific breakthrough, AAP reports. Scientists at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute created models of the human blood-brain barrier, a wall of cells that protects the brain with pathogens and toxins, and successfully opened it. The barrier works as a natural shield and blocks 98% of disease-fighting drugs from entering the brain. QIMR Berghofer scientists created blood-brain barrier models using stem cells from Alzheimer’s patients and successfully unlocked the barrier using focused ultrasound. In a remarkable breakthrough, the scientists opened the barrier to drugs that can combat Alzheimer’s disease. The group’s leader, Prof Anthony White, said: It’s a major breakthrough in terms of understanding the way that we can deliver drugs to the brain. We’re really on the cusp of being able to make some kind of difference in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Stem cell researcher Dr Lotta Oikari said the results were very consistent and researchers were able to replicate the experiment a number of times. She said the model can potentially identify previously tested drugs that might have failed and attempt to deliver them more efficiently with the new method. Fellow researcher Joanna Wasielewska hoped the research would be a therapeutic breakthrough for Alzheimer’s patients. She said: The very first clinical trials show its safety in human patients. We are really at this last step of breaking the ultrasound-mediated drug delivery to patients suffering from brain disorders. Researchers are already working on developing models for motor neurone disease and childhood dementia. Victoria’s severe weather warning expanded to Melbourne and north-east Indonesian ambassador speaks at Canberra memorial, paying tribute to victims and partnership between two nations Indonesia’s ambassador to Australia, Siswo Pramono, has spoken at the memorial in Canberra marking the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Bali. Twenty years ago today a hideous crime struck and it was one of the saddest days in Indonesian history. Twenty years ago a group of terrorists tried to enforce their belief on to others by way of violence, which resulted in 202 people were killed and 209 people were injured. Pramono acknowledged the Australian and Indonesian victims of the attack, as well as the “overwhelming grief” their loved ones were left with. However, he said that the terrorists couldn’t take away “our love and compassion to others and the idea of people are equal in rights and freedoms”. Pramono also spoke about the cooperation between the nations in the aftermath of the attack to bring the perpetrators to justice: In the days that followed the attacks, Indonesian law enforcement officers assisted by the Australian police put in a relentless effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. Indonesia and Australia are nations of resilience and vigilance rising out of the terrorist attack we have a better and stronger bond among us. Indonesia and Australia developed the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. This reflects the determination of both governments to build a better law enforcement institution and system in Indonesia and other countries as well. This initiative wins active support from partner governments and international law enforcement agencies. The relations between Indonesia and Australia improve from strength to strength. In the latest development, the two countries have managed to further strengthen the bilateral ties and politics on economics, defence, culture, and people to people. The visit of Prime Minister Albanese to Indonesia and the delegation last June has further strengthened this strategy partnership. Indonesia and Australia are not just neighbours, but most importantly we are also partners. As the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, did his media rounds this morning, he revealed Australia is considering offering training to Ukraine troops. We brought you some of his comments earlier on the blog, and now my colleagues in Canberra Amy Remeikis and Daniel Hurst bring you the full story here: Severe weather warning for NSW expanded to include Alps Intense rain and flood warnings for Tasmania People in Tasmania have been urged to prepare for widespread heavy rain and potentially dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding in parts. A severe weather warning is in place for the island state’s north and central regions, and the east coast, which is tipped to be hit by dangerous winds. Heavy rain is expected from Wednesday evening to Friday, with the north expected to cop the worst, including intense local falls. The Bureau of Meteorology says 24-hour totals on Thursday are expected to reach 60 to 120 millimetres, with isolated totals up to 180mm over higher terrain. Potentially dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding, with 100mm of rain falling within six hours, is possible in the Great Western Tiers. The SES says widespread minor or moderate flooding is likely from Thursday and major flooding is possible at some locations. Acting director Leon Smith said: People are encouraged to be aware of the forecast and prepare their property before the rain arrives. This means knowing your flood risk and understanding whether your property is prone to flooding. With the ground being saturated in many areas of Tasmania, rivers will rise quickly over coming days. Heavy rain is tipped in Australia’s east and south in coming days. Readers following the political debate around the voice to parliament will be aware there’s been some confusion over the past 24 hours or so about the Greens. On Tuesday, a report in the Australian newspaper suggested the party’s First Nations spokesperson, Lidia Thorpe, had telegraphed backing the no case to businessman Warren Mundine. Thorpe later told my colleague Sarah Martin that report was false. She would not be backing the “no” case. Throughout this debate, the Greens have signalled it is important for the government to act on the three elements of the Uluru statement – voice, truth and treaty. Thorpe repeated that view yesterday. Today, Thorpe’s colleague Sarah Hanson-Young was asked to clarify the Greens position. Hanson-Young again articulated the party’s position on the three elements, but also made it abundantly clear she and “my colleagues” would be supporting the yes campaign for the voice to parliament. Here, for the record, are her comments in full. Hanson Young: As Lidia Thorpe has said, she is not going to be backing the no campaign and the Greens support the full implementation of the statement from the heart, and we want the parliament to respond to that request from First Nations people to act, to give voice, to give treaty, to give truth. Our party is committed to backing the Uluru statement and doing everything we can to make sure First Nations people are listened to and responded to in the way they have asked [for] out of that statement of the heart. That’s a really important message to the rest of the Australian community. As Lidia Thorpe has said, she’s not backing the no campaign, and I am looking very much forward to supporting the yes campaign. I’m going to be supporting the yes campaign, my colleagues are going to be supporting the yes campaign and we need to make sure this delivers for First Nations people. There are a lot of issues First Nations people deal with every day that this parliament has not dealt with and we need to and our leaders need to. I want to be really clear about this: I support the yes campaign and I’ll be doing everything I can to support it. Penny Wong recognises first responders to Bali bombings The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, has spoken at the Canberra memorial. She acknowledged the 202 lives “so callously taken” including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and citizens of 20 other countries. As well as the victims, Wong acknowledged the contribution of first responders in attempting to save the lives of victims as well as the Australian government in acts like arranging the last phone calls of victims with loved ones. Ultimately, the terrorists failed. Because, while an act of terror might shake us, it cannot change us. Those who attacked us wanted to divide Australia and Indonesia, to shatter the bonds between two great democracies, painstakingly built on multi-faith, multicultural foundations. And to strike at what makes us all human. But the worst of humanity brought out the very best. Out of that dark acts, were bored such radiant acts of courage and of love. The story of that night is also one of great courage and resilience, a story that many of you here know so well. Survivors became saviours, somehow overcoming their pain. First responders, among them medical staff, police, embassy and cultural officials, and local volunteers, ran towards the devastation. Rescuing everyone they could. Going back time and time again to help the injured and comfort the dying. In the face of exhaustion and horror, hospital staff in Bali worked around the clock to save lives and treat catastrophic injuries. There were outstanding contributions that night and afterwards from across the Australian government. People like Australia’s consular general advice consul David Chaplin both with us today. They were among the first of the scene. They comforted the victims, including those who could not be saved, desperately arranging phone calls so loved ones could speak with them in their final moments. Civilian and military aircraft mobilised to transport the victims regardless of nationality to Perth, Darwin and other specialised bird units. Australian medical staff including Dr Fiona Wood undertook life-saving surgery at medical treatment on the many dozens of seriously injured victims, keeping them alive when hope seemed lost, and blessing them through their pain. Attack failed to drive Australia and Indonesia apart: John Howard At the same time as that memorial in Sydney, another is taking place in Canberra. Former prime minister John Howard, who was the country’s leader at the time of the Bali bombings, has reiterated the message of solidarity with Indonesia like Anthony Albanese. Albanese returns to the heavy toll the attack took and the difficulty of grief which does not abate with time, 20 years after the attacks. But they did take life. They left survivors to rebuild themselves physically and mentally. They left families and friends struggling with loss. For them, and for so many people here today, the world could never be the same again. 20 years on, so pretty hearts are still tethered to that cool night. Every beach tempered by an abiding sorrow. Many currents were stopped in the great river of life that night. Some are still stranded on the back, unable to walk away. Grief is its own creature. Grief does not travel in straight lines. Grief may soften with time, but it does not fade. As my predecessor Julia Gillard put in a decade ago, “Bali is a place like London and Gallipoli were something of the Australian spirit dwells upon another shot.” It is a beloved shore. Indonesian people have reached out to generations of Australians as friends and neighbours. They felt our great pain that night and we felt there … families, friends and community. Its three parts are bowed in sorrow but they hold each other because, it unity, we find strength and we find hope, and we find love. We find each other. And that is how we come together, including today. Our hearts filled with everyone who never came home and card to be with us. It feels also with everyone who never came home the same, everyone who still carries the loss and every survivor that we have lost since. We hold onto their names and faces, and we will never let them fade. Let them live in eternal peace. After Albanese’s speech, Coogee local Joe Sullivan performed You will never walk alone, with many in the audience at the memorial breaking down in tears at the emotional rendition. Bali bombing terrorists could not defeat Australian ideals, PM says Albanese goes on to pay tribute to those people who stepped up amid the horror: We think of those who survived, and we think of those who helped. What they saw that night will never leave them. In a minute, all the very worst of circumstances brought out the very best in people. It brought out compassion, selflessness, it brought out heroism. That night, the terrorists could not achieve their aim stop what they struck, they could not defeat, because what they struck at was the idea of us. The great fabric of dreams and ideals and compassion and fairness that make us who we are as Australians. Indonesians, Australians, people from all over the world, they struck at the friendship between us, they struck at the joy of a free people. They struck at humanity, but we remain. In the end, they reminded us of what is so important to us, and to not take for granted what we have built and nurtured over generations. They sought to create terror, but people around towards the terror to do what they could for friends and strangers alike, because what drove them was a higher, more human instinct than those who attacked them. What the architects of this slaughter achieved was to make us reflect on what we must truly value, and to hold onto its more tightly than ever before. No terrorist could take this from us. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking in Sydney where a commemorative service is being held on the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings. He acknowledges the other leaders who are present, including opposition leader Peter Dutton, but says he wants particularly to acknowledge the family and friends of those who lost loved ones 20 years ago today. Albanese highlighted the effects the attack had on many Australian sporting clubs whose members were in Bali during the attacks. The service in Sydney is being held in Coogee, where the rugby league club the Coogee Dolphins lost six members. 20 years ago, the shock waves from Bali reached our shores. 20 years ago, and acts of malice is calculated depravity robbed the world of 202 lives, including 88 Australians. 20 years on the ache does not diminish. For most of us, what happens on that fateful night is beyond imagining. The sudden, terrible light followed by the sudden, terrible darkness. The awful postscript of fire, alongside the local workers and residents were teammates, enjoying the end of season holiday. Members of the Kingsley football club, the Sturt football club, the Southport Sharks and the players from my electorate. I know that Debbie Borgia’s husband is here today who lost his wife, and the youngest victim, his daughter, in that tragedy, Abbey Borgia. And of course the Coogee Dolphins, in an act of remembering teammates. We think of them with the ache of knowing that they should still be here. That senses filled with everything that we feel now. The salty tang of the air, the sea, in its ancient rhythm, primary against beach and cliff, the tapestry of voices for which they were all such an electrical part. So many futures were stolen on that night. We think of every conversation ever had, every moment of love never known. Nine News have some images of how bad flooding is in Victoria. Meteorologist Jane Bunn posted this map which shows the extent of the further heavy the deluge on the way for the state: Man dies in NSW flood waters The body of a missing man has been found in his submerged car in the state’s central west following flooding. The death of the 46-year-old comes as much of New South Wales braces for further inundation, with more than 100 flood warnings in place, AAP reports. The man was last seen at Essington, south of Bathurst, about 11am on Sunday, with a search launched when he failed to return home on Monday. About 10.30am on Tuesday a police helicopter crew found his car fully submerged in Campbells River at Charlton and State Emergency Service crews recovered the vehicle with his body inside. Parts of already sodden NSW are predicted to cop as much as another 65mm of rain by week’s end. The Bureau of Meteorology says a trough approaching from the west is expected to bring thunderstorms to the central and southern inland on Thursday and Friday as it crosses the state. Senior forecaster Jonathan How said from late Thursday into Friday, heavy rain would push into Victoria’s north-east and across the western slopes of NSW. This may cause renewed flooding along rivers in parts of the central west and southwest from Friday, many of which are already full due to heavy rain in recent months. How told ABC TV today: But thankfully for those flood-affected communities including Bathurst, Gundagai and Forbes ... the heaviest rain will be further south. But of course, we are expecting to see some local creek and river rises. SES volunteers have responded to more than 1,000 calls for help since Friday evening. RBA outlines how it determines elusive ‘neutral’ interest rate The Reserve Bank of Australia this morning has opened up on how it works out the “neutral” interest rate. It’s effectively the Goldilocks rate that is neither contractionary for the economy nor expansive, Luci Ellis, an assistant governor, says. But we’re not at the neutral rate just yet. The cash rate is at 2.6% after last week’s surprisingly small rise of 25 basis points rather than the 50 basis points most economists expect. Investors have been again lifting their expectations of how high the rate will go, and are toying with a 4% rate in about a year’s time. Anyway, back to that Nirvana of cash rate neutrality – the RBA targets that elusive level over time. Given the expectations of where inflation is going lately, it’s good that they take a long lens. Ellis says: Current inflation is very high, and expected to stay high in the short term. But beyond the next year, inflation expectations remain well anchored inside the target range, both here and overseas. If that anchor were to loosen, that’s another story. In recent decades, the neutral rate has been sinking, for some interesting if unclear reasons. One issue, post global financial crisis, is that prospects for global growth over time have dimmed, so businesses saw little incentive to invest in expansion (and bought back their own stock instead). (If China ends up in a real estate derived funk, there goes the dynamo that kept Australia and much of the world’s economy humming after the GFC.) Ellis says economic theory tells us the neutral rate is “real” because inflation-adjusted interest rates matter for people’s saving and investment decisions. People look through the expected inflation component of nominal rates; lenders expect to be compensated for it, and borrowers expect to have to provide that compensation. Not surprisingly, there is no magic number that tells us what the neutral rate is, or will be, since conditions are always shifting. So where does it leave us? To the RBA, the neutral rate is just “a pole-star to guide us”. “[A]s we navigate the narrow path to our intended goal, we welcome any faint light that those stars may cast,” Ellis says. Former deputy New South Wales premier John Barilaro has entered a not guilty plea to assault and malicious damage after an alleged altercation with a Channel Seven camera operator in July. In a brief hearing at Manly local court on Wednesday morning, at which Barilaro was not required to appear, his lawyer, Danny Eid, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Barilaro was charged with assault and malicious damage following an alleged run-in with the cameraman, Matt Costello, at Manly on 23 July. Outside court on Wednesday Eid said Barilaro would “definitely” be defending the charges. He said: We’re not laying low on this one. Despite reports Barilaro also faced a civil suit brought by Costello over the alleged damage of his camera equipment, no case has yet been brought, and Eid said he was “not aware of any civil proceedings”. The case is due to return to the court early next year. Australian leaders pay tribute to Bali bombing victims and survivors The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, will say in a major speech tonight that opponents of a voice to parliament will make “false claims” and peddle misinformation ahead of the referendum on a voice to parliament. Speaking about the voice to parliament and why it matters to Australians, Burney will use a keynote speech to the 25th anniversary dinner of Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation to outline the steps ahead for enshrining the voice in the constitution in this term of government, including proposed changes to the Referendum Machinery Act. Burney said she is often asked what the voice is, and that fundamentally it “means consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about the matters that affect us”. It’s a once in a generation opportunity to create lasting change Burney said there was already misinformation about the voice in the media, pointing to “myths” that it will operate as a third chamber to parliament and have veto powers. Let me warn you, our opponents will make more false claims about the voice to parliament as we get closer to the referendum. Burney will also say that the referendum working group and referendum engagement group, made up of more than 60 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will meet again in late October in Canberra to consider changes to the Referendum Machinery Act 1984 and the wording of the question that will be put to the Australian people. The act needs changing to “modernise how we conduct referendums in this country”, she will say, with the law pre-dating the internet age, and including provisions for written pamphlets for each side of the campaign. Burney will say the critical question to answer is “why” the voice is needed, pointing to the omission of Indigenous Australians in the constitution as something that can not be accepted. The constitution is our founding document, the rule book for how we are governed, and since its inception in 1901 it has not included Indigenous Australians. Despite inhabiting this land for more than sixty thousand years – we have no place in the constitution. It’s like we never existed. Never mattered. Never counted. Unfairness and discrimination was built into our systems – that’s how they were designed. The voice to parliament will mean that governments of all persuasions will need to consult and listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the issues that affect them. I want to take this country forward – opponents of the voice want to hold Australia back. Teachers around New South Wales are today protesting against the state government’s plans for a new three-year award, which they say amounts to a tangible wage cut. In a statement released this morning, the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the government wants to secure pay increases of 2.53% a year at the Industrial Relations Commission. However, the new award would be “far below” the rate of inflation running at around 6%. Gavrielatos pointed to a NSW upper house committee survey that showed 60% of teachers want to leave in the next five years because of the “crippling workload” combined with uncompetitive salaries. Water market reforms broadly supported While the federal government will introduce legislation and a mandatory code of conduct to deliver integrity safeguards, the states will still maintain some responsibility and will need to take action to ensure transparency. Daryl Quinlivan said that in his consultations with basin states, the advisory group and affected stakeholders, the reforms were broadly supported, despite the adjustments that will be needed. As part of the reforms the Bureau of Meteorology will design new data standards and a new national water data hub and website, which will automatically capture, transfer, and publish existing and new data to improve transparency and inform trade-related decisions in water markets. The inspector general of water compliance will take on responsibility for the regulation of water market data. The federal water minister, Tanya Plibersek, said on Tuesday: We want to ensure that the markets are fair for buyers and sellers, that there is clear information, and that water is going where it should be – that the market is not dominated by speculators buying up water in the hope of making a quick buck. The water market reforms are likely to be the least controversial of the agenda items at the meeting, which will also be discussing the future of the Murray-Darling Basin plan and the likely failure of NSW and Victoria to meet their obligations. Federal takeover of water trading markets Unlike Australia’s financial markets, water markets, which trade about $2bn of water entitlements each year, are poorly regulated and lack the features that make comparable trading markets work effectively and transparently. For example, unlike in financial markets, there is no regulation around broker behaviour, insider trading, no prohibitions against market misconduct, and few reporting obligations. This lack of regulation, transparency and data means that farmers and irrigators are unable to be sure that they are dealing with brokers who are acting in their best interests. There are also few penalties for bad behaviour. A report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission identified failings in the market in 2020 and suggested a federal takeover of water markets. The government then asked Daryl Quinlivan to design a roadmap to implement the findings. Water trading markets will be pulled into line with the standards of other financial markets after the federal government committed to reforms designed to ensure greater transparency, better broker behaviour and fairer markets. The federal water minister, Tanya Plibersek , said she had agreed to all 23 recommendations of former bureaucrat Daryl Quinlivan, and will seek the support of states and territories to implement the shared recommendations at the Murray-Darling Basin ministerial council meeting today. Victoria and NSW prepare for heavy rainfall The New South Wales Bureau of Meteorology says Thursday will be the day of heaviest rainfall over a wet next four days, which will see renewed river rises. Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, has warned Victorians, particularly north of the divide, to prepare for the deluge. Government ministers will today be commemorating the Bali bombings at different services across the country for the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will attend a service at Coogee in Sydney, while the minister for foreign affairs, Senator Penny Wong, will host a memorial service at Parliament House in Canberra. In Canberra, victims’ families, survivors and first responders will be joined by the governor general, David Hurley, and John Howard, who was the prime minister at the time of the attacks. The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, will attend a commemorative ceremony at the Australian consulate general in Bali. In a joint statement, Albanese, Wong and Watts said: We recommit to the ongoing work shared by Australia and Indonesia to counter the scourge of violent extremism, and reaffirm the respect and cooperation between our peoples. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has also paid tribute to the 88 Australians and 38 Indonesians were among the 202 people murdered, as well as the many who survived and still live with the scars of those bombs. ‘We renew our resolve to thwart acts of terrorism’, Peter Dutton says The leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, has released a statement paying tribute to the victims of the Bali bombings on 12 October 2002, the largest loss of Australian lives from a single terrorist attack. As well as remembering the victims, Dutton highlighted the role played by Australian health professionals, police, the department of foreign affairs and the defence force. As a place of holidaying became hell, strangers of all nationalities helped care for the wounded and transport them to Indonesian hospitals. Australians in the AFP, Dfat and the ADF provided support on the ground and from home, working hand-in-hand with their Indonesian counterparts. Doctors and nurses in Australian hospitals, especially in Darwin and Perth, worked heroically around the clock to treat patients and conduct life-saving procedures. Those darkest hours forged new collaborations and enduring friendships. To the families who lost loved ones, and to the survivors of the Bali bombings: Most Australians will never be able to comprehend what you have gone through, what you are going through today, and what you will endure for the rest of your lives. But we are inspired by how you have lived your lives in spite of your suffering, your loss and your heartbreak. Every day of endurance is a magnificent blow to an odious ideology. Every year of courage is the confident roar of freedom in defiance of cowardly evil. And every decade of achievement is a triumph over terrorism. On this 20th Anniversary of the Bali Bombings, through remembrance we pay our respects to those Australians who tragically lost their lives. Through commemoration we commit to never forgetting this national tragedy. And through tribute we renew our resolve to thwart acts of terrorism whatever form they take. Training Ukraine troops would take place ‘outside of Ukraine in Europe’: Albanese As mentioned earlier on the blog, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has spoken with Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, overnight. Ukraine’s president urged Australia to provide more security assistance to his country, including a request Australians help train Ukrainian soldiers. Albanese told ABC News Breakfast: Well, the suggestion isn’t going into Ukraine. The suggestion is whether Australians could provide support for training outside of Ukraine in Europe, and we’ll give consideration to that as we’ll give consideration to the other requests. President Zelenskiy asked for me to convey the thanks of him and the Ukrainian people for the Australian bush masters, for the other support that Australia has given up to now. New Australia Tourism campaign draws on tradition of g’day-themed ads The tourism and trade minister, Don Farrell, earlier told ABC Radio that Tourism Australia’s new mascot, Ruby the Roo, is “the new Paul Hogan”. I’m not sure how Hogan would feel about being compared to a computer generated kangaroo, but Farrell might have been drawing on the fact the two ads use the same g’day tagline. Hogan urged tourists to “come and say g’day” – though it was the “shrimp on the barbie” line that stuck, of course. US security expert says chances of Putin using nuclear weapon are “small” During his visit to Canberra, the chief executive of the Washington-based thinktank the Center for a New American Security, Richard Fontaine, weighed in on the US president, Joe Biden’s recent comments that the world could face “Armageddon” if Russia’s Vladimir Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon to try to win the war in Ukraine. Biden said last week that Putin was “not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming”. Fontaine said: I seriously doubt that anybody handed the president a set of written talking points that had the word Armageddon on it. On the other hand, there is very grave concern about the rattling of the nuclear sabre, because the chances, I think, of Russia using even a tactical nuclear weapon are small, but they’re higher than they were. And they’re probably higher than any time since 1962 with the [Cuban] missile crisis. The use of nuclear weapons is one of these low probability, extremely high consequence events. So even if the probability is relatively small, the consequences would be so grave. If they were to do this, we would wake up in a different world the next day. A former senior US national security official says Washington would welcome a move by Australia to help train Ukrainian troops. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said yesterday that training Ukraine’s military forces was “one option that’s on the table” for further Australian support – effectively repeating comments he made more than a month ago during a visit to the UK. In an exisiting operation conducted in the UK, a number of nations including New Zealand are assisting with training. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said if there were to be a training mission it would not involve Australian troops going into Ukrainian territory. Dutton said the Coalition would support Australian trainers going to “adjoining or adjacent countries or third countries otherwise, where we could deliver assistance to Ukraine soldiers and to those on the ground to help them get the most out of the equipment that we are delivering to try and keep people safe in that part of the world”. The chief executive officer of the influential Washington-based thinktank the Center for a New American Security, Richard Fontaine, said during a visit to Canberra that further Australian contributions “would be welcomed in a significant way”. Fontaine is a former foreign policy advisor to the late Republican senator John McCain and has worked at the State Department, the National Security Council and on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Asked whether Washington would welcome Australia stepping up in into the role of training Ukrainian troops, Fontaine said: Yes, absolutely. Every country really has a dog in this fight, because what we’re talking about here is a violation of the fundamental rules of international order, the cardinal element of which is the prohibition against territorial conquest by force. And that’s exactly what we’re seeing here. Tourism Australia says new brand ambassador will help country ‘stand out’ The new Tourism Australia’s global campaign ‘Come and Say G’day’ has been unveiled to the world on a major digital billboard in Tokyo, kick-starting a world tour introducing the new brand ambassador, CGI kangaroo Ruby the Roo. Tourism Australia’s managing director, Phillipa Harrison, said the new campaign will support the tourism industry as it rebuilds post-pandemic by “converting the pent-up demand for an Australian holiday.” We know that Australia consistently ranks high on people’s consideration list but we need to get travellers to take that critical next step and book their holiday to Australia to experience everything we have to offer. Harrison said this new instalment of Tourism Australia’s “There’s Nothing Like Australia” global brand platform “will cut through and make Australia stand out today and in the long term”. Tourism Australia’s chief marketing officer, Susan Coghill, said the campaign will remind travellers of Australia’s iconic destinations and friendly faces. Why a CGI kangaroo? The use of an animated character in Ruby was a deliberate move that aims to cut through the clutter of destination marketing internationally and it is backed by research. In Australia, we’re so lucky to have a globally recognisable and adorable icon in the kangaroo and to bring that to life through CGI animation creates a uniquely Australian brand ambassador in Ruby, who translates across both English and non-English speaking countries. If it’s looking familiar, there is a passing resemblance to this classic tourism campaign from the 1980’s “G’day from WA”. A computer generated kangaroo is following in the footsteps of Paul Hogan, Lara Bingle and Chris Hemsworth. Ruby the Roo, voiced by actor Rose Byrne, has been unveiled as Australia’s new tourism mascot. The trade and tourism minister, Don Farrell, is speaking to ABC Radio about the news: Ruby the roo is, if you like, the new Paul Hogan. We have in the past had very, very successful campaigns to attract overseas tourists to Australia. We now need to do that again. Farrell is speaking from Japan, where he says Ruby is already featuring on billboards in the country newly opened up to tourists but that the “full official launch” will be in New York next week. Farrell says the price for US tourists coming to Australia remains a barrier, but is one of a “combination of issues” seeing less tourists from America. Angela Lansbury dies aged 96 Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has paid tribute to his cousin Angela Lansbury after the beloved stage and screen actress died, aged 96. The Australian defence force does not have the capacity to rapidly deploy its planned new infantry fighting vehicle to overseas conflicts, a report warns. The army wants to acquire up to 450 infantry fighting vehicles at a total cost probably between $18bn and $27bn. The government is expected to decide in coming months between proposals from German contractor Rheinmetall and South Korean contractor Hanwha. Dr Albert Palazzo, an adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales Canberra and formerly a director of war studies for the Australian Army, looks at the project in a report published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute today. He says the government faces “a big decision” on the project – known as LAND 400 Phase 3 – because the vehicle chosen and the number purchased “will affect the combat capability of the army for a generation”. The project aims to replace the army’s fleet of ageing light armoured vehicles, including the M113 armoured personnel carrier. The army has used the M113 since 1965 – including in the Vietnam war – but this older vehicle is now “hopelessly obsolete for contemporary combat conditions”, the report says. Palazzo raises broader logistical challenges associated with the project. He says the ADF “lacks significant sea and air lift with which to deploy the army” and it may need to obtain additional capacity from hired commercial vessels or from the US. But there’s no guarantee that the US will be able to meet such a request because it will naturally meet its own needs first ... To guarantee the availability of shipping, one option would be for Australia to create a national fleet of merchant ships suitable for conversion to military use and at call for government service. The ships would be available for take-up by the government, as was done in the two world wars and the Vietnam War. It’s hard for a defence force to predict how it will fight in the future, because a nation never knows the kind of war it will face. Wars come in a multitude of forms with many levels of intensity and danger, ranging from the risk of nuclear annihilation to wars such as those fought in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. What’s consistent is that no one ever gets the war they want or expect. Those who believe that Australia will never need to fight a major war against a peer competitor are likely to be wrong; no one would want a resumption of the Korean War, but the potential for the conflict’s resumption can’t be ignored. Budget to see spending cuts some could consider ‘risky’, Albanese says On ABC radio RN, Anthony Albanese says there will be spending cuts in the budget and concedes that some, as the treasurer said yesterday, could be considered “risky”. He said: Well, of course any cut is a risky decision and there will be spending cuts in the budget. It will be a responsible budget. As we’ve consistently said we’ve gone through line by line in order to ensure that what you don’t need at this time is monetary policy and fiscal policy working against each other. And and that’s why in the inflationary period, which is a global inflationary period that we’re seeing we’ve seen the fastest synchronised tightening of monetary policy that we’ve seen from central banks in decades. And that of course, is is a response to those international circumstances and the Australian government has to respond to that as well in a way that’s consistent. Australians more conscious of terrorism threat after Bali bombings – PM October 12 is the 20th anniversary of the Bali bombings, an event Anthony Albanese said made Australians much more conscious of the threat of terrorism. He said: The ache hasn’t dimmed from that 20 years on. Albanese told Patricia Karvelas the “nature of the threat has changed but the need to be diligent has not”. There are still of course, threats from the terrorist organisations that you’ve named but there are so many others offshoots and we see a rise as well of the individual act. Getting information online putting together weapons and carrying out these cowardly attacks against humanity. What has occurred over the 20 years is that our security agencies really have done a remarkable job to keep us safe. Albanese sends condolences to Ukraine in overnight meeting with president The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, overnight in what he said was a “very good discussion”. There have been reports Australia could help train Ukrainian soldiers. Albanese did not confirm that but said Australia is considering “all requests”. I conveyed to him but the condolences of the Australian people for the quite horrific actions that were taken against civilian targets by Russian forces in recent days. And I also conveyed to him our ongoing commitment to give every support that we can to Ukraine will give consideration to all requests that are made. This is a struggle not just about Ukraine and its sovereign borders. This is a struggle about the international rule of law, about whether it is respected. And that is why the struggle of the Ukrainian people is so inspirational against a much larger country with a much larger military, but they are determined to defend their nation and they are making great sacrifice to do so. And that’s why democracies both in Nato and outside of Nato are providing training. On the request for additional Bushmasters, the armoured vehicles Ukraine forces have been using as part of their defences against Russian invaders, Albanese said a decision would be made in the coming days. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has spoken with the president of the Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, overnight. Albanese did not confirm reports Australia could help train Ukrainian soldiers, but said Australia is considering “all requests” on ABC Radio this morning. The request is about training and we’ll give consideration to that and make an announcement at an appropriate time. The prime minister also paid tribute on the 20-year anniversary of the Bali bombings, ahead of attending a memorial service in Sydney. He said the attack’s shockwaves “reached our shores” making Australians more conscious of the threat of terror. Commemorations will be held in Bali, Canberra and Perth, as well as other memorial services around the country. Water ministers will meet in Canberra today to finalise the Murray-Darling Basin plan where it is expected that South Australia will call on the government to buy back water. More data from the 2021 census was released today. Taken during the pandemic, the second release of its results showed more Australians were working from home. You can read about some of the other more surprising trends to emerge from my colleague Caitlin Cassidy here: A new report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warns the Australian defence force does not have the capacity to rapidly deploy its planned new infantry fighting vehicle to overseas conflicts, suggesting our country may need its own fleet of merchant ships. My colleague Daniel Hurst will bring you more on that shortly.

","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In her back pocket, Ana Diaz carries a smooth grey pebble she calls her “knock-knocker”. She uses it to get a loud rap on the front doors of the South Phoenix neighborhood where she is canvassing for the Democrats ahead of November’s crucial midterm elections. It’s 110F (43C) in the early afternoon sun, and Diaz is aiming to knock on 80 doors in this largely Latino neighborhood and speak to at least 20 people, encouraging them to vote. Diaz, a Los Angeles-based bartender and Unite Here union member, is a familiar face to many in this working-class area. In her T-shirt that reads “Worker power” she has been knocking on these doors since 2018. Voters are all talking about the economy. Diaz, too, worries about inflation: her grocery bill is so high she thinks she may have to stop buying beef. But for her, the Democrats and good union jobs are the answer. “When we get together, we can make them change,” she says. “Donald Trump called us ‘the crazies’. Well, we kicked him out,” she says as we walk the block, chugging water and looking for shade. Not many people were in. Diaz and her colleagues will be back. “We’re not going to stop.” Joe Biden narrowly won Arizona in the 2020 election, beating Trump with 49.4% of the vote to Trump’s 49.1%. As in neighboring Nevada, campaigners like Diaz who got out the Latino vote were crucial to that victory. It’s going to take every vote this time too for the Democrats to hold the state – where a crucial Senate seat is up for grabs and with it control of Congress. But Democrats enter election season with two major handicaps: the incumbent party historically loses seats in the midterms and the economy – the top issue for voters – is a mess. For the first time since 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in a landslide, inflation is a major electoral issue. For decades the specter of inflation had seemed vanquished – hovering around 2% in the US. Now the shadow of soaring prices hangs over everything. In Phoenix, the inflation rate hit an annual rate of 13% in August, a record for any US city in data going back 20 years. The national average is 8.3%. History tells us that the economy is usually the deciding factor in US elections. But whose economy? If there is one word economists are using to describe the current state of the US economy, it is “weird”. Inflation is at a 40-year high and yet unemployment is at a 50-year low. There were more than 10m job openings in July in the US, over one and half jobs for every person currently looking for work. Interest rates are rising sharply, the once white-hot housing market looks like it could fall, loan rates are rising, and yet consumers are still spending. Phoenix maps all the contradictory signals the economy is sending. The city’s long economic boom continues. About 200 new residents have moved there every day in recent years, attracted by a lower cost of living and by businesses moving for less regulation and lower taxes. It’s not enough. The construction industry alone needs to add 265,000 qualified workers. Healthcare, financial services, all are struggling to fill vacancies. This pressure-cooker environment has led to soaring rents in the city – up 46% over the year – but still lower than many other US cities. The situation is particularly hard for lower-wage workers and long-term residents now competing with more moneyed migrants from nearby California and elsewhere. For many, wages are failing to keep up with the cost of living crisis as inflation pushes up the price of everything from gas and food to construction costs. “As cross-currents buffet the Arizona economy, it looks different depending on the lens used to view it,” University of Arizona professor George Hammond wrote in his latest report on the state of the state. Hammond is expecting slower growth in 2022 and 2023, which could help with costs but also cost people their jobs. Over the long term, he expects Arizona’s economy will still outpace the rest of the country. Diaz believes the Democrats are best placed to navigate these strange seas. “People are like, ‘I really don’t care who gets in.’ But you should. Your streets need cleaning, you have no lights, your alleys are full of trash, we have a problem with homelessness. If we don’t choose the right people to make these changes, it’s not going to happen,” she says. In Scottsdale, Phoenix’s affluent neighbor that is rapidly being absorbed by Phoenix’s sprawl, others have different views. “Biden is a nut,” says Jim Baumann, 60, shopping in Whole Foods in his orange Harley Davidson T-shirt. “He screwed this up.” His grocery bill now averages $300 to $350 a month he says, up from $200 before inflation bit. “I didn’t like Trump’s mouth, but he was better than Biden.” Like so many other issues in the US, views on the economy are fractured, filtered by political and personal views and not always in line with today’s party doctrine. Immigration is a major issue for Republicans, and one that has big economic consequences in the area. Kari Lake, the Trump-backed candidate for governor, has said the Central American migrants now entering the US “could be terrorists, they could be murderers and they are most likely hardcore criminals”. Blake Masters, running for Senate, has accused Democrats of being pro-immigration to “change the demographics of our country”. Privately, some local, Republican-leaning business leaders are embarrassed by the rhetoric and see immigration reform as essential to solving their worker shortages. At the same time Latino voters are not a monolithic bloc and shifted slightly right in 2020, a factor that could decide the race this time. Then there is abortion. Few decisions have greater economic consequences than the decision to have a child. In recent elections Republicans have paid the price for the supreme court’s decision to end the constitutional protection of abortion even in deep red states like Kansas. Last month an Arizona judge revived a highly restrictive law, that dates back to 1864, banning almost all abortions. Polls show the majority of Arizonans (Republicans and independents included) are in favor of keeping abortion legal in the state in most cases. All this complexity is exacerbated by the weirding of the economy. “Strange would be an understatement,” says Greg Ayres, president of Corbins and chief operating officer of Nox Group, construction companies that specialise in water and waste management, data centers and work for the semiconductor industry. Prices have soared for the construction industry, talent is in short supply, wages are rising and pandemic-related supply chain issues are still rippling through and causing delays. “Everything is so volatile,” he says. “Almost every project is over budget.” And yet business is good. His biggest immediate issue is finding enough people for all the projects he has on the go. The company employs 750 people at present, up from 650 before the pandemic. He would like to be at 1,000 within the year. “But it’s really competitive.” To attract workers, Corbin has upped its training programs, benefits and wages. Across the street from his office is a cavernous gym, recreation and health center with a full-time trainer on staff, added to attract and retain talent. Salaries are rising too. With overtime, Ayres says, a mid-20s journeyman, could make over $104,000 a year. The company will train up as many competent workers as it can get its hands on, he says. It’s the same story across the Valley of the Sun, says Todd Sanders, president of business lobby group the Greater Phoenix Chamber in 2009. “It’s almost like we are defying the laws of physics.” The area is suffering from high inflation like the rest of the county but companies are still moving there in large numbers, he says. “By and large we are seeing an economy that is still very strong. It’s an interesting time.” For some low-wage workers buffeted by these economic riptides “interesting” doesn’t even begin to describe it. People know Jarvis Johnson in Phoenix. He went viral for his high-octane audition on reality show So You Think You Can Dance, and again for his dedication to Black Friday bargain shopping. His friends describe him as a “ball of energy” and an “eternal optimist”. But when I catch up with him between jobs he seems tired. It’s not surprising. Johnson, 32, has been working three jobs to support his wife and his three young children. His day starts at 3.30am at a Covid testing center, and at 11am he starts his shift at a senior living center. Often he isn’t home before 8pm. He also puts in shifts at a local gas station, and is hoping to increase his hours there now that the Covid work is tapering off. All of the jobs pay better than Arizona’s minimum wage of $12.80 an hour. The testing job paid $25 an hour during the worst of the pandemic, and at one point Johnson was working there 40 hours a week. But even then, his wages were barely keeping up with the cost of living. Two years ago, when he moved into his apartment, he was paying $960 a month in rent. Now it’s close to $1,500. Gas prices have fallen in Arizona, as they have across the US, but are still about $4.90 a gallon, up from just over $3 a year ago. The couple have two cars and it costs $160 to fill them. Food is more expensive. His wife could go to work but daycare costs would wipe out her wages. “It’s crazy. Everything has got more expensive,” he says. “It’s hard. It’s hard right now. I’m just trying to keep my head up and not let my kids see I’m struggling. I have to work my butt off to make it. I’m getting by, but it’s still not enough.” Biden has promised a fairer, more equitable, economy. His administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which will increase taxes on the US’s largest companies and cut prescription drug prices. He’s also pouring money into solar energy and silicon chip production – both of which will benefit Arizonans. But will it be enough to persuade voters he really has a plan to steer them through this strange economic landscape? Johnson says he will vote Democrat but he doesn’t believe either party has the solution. “They can’t do nothing for me. These employers, they need to pay their people,” he says. “People are struggling.” He wants to start his own business – a hot-dog food truck. “I think I’d make more money working for myself, to be honest,” he says. At the moment he has about $1,000 saved, but it’s not enough and he’s worried that an incident, a broken car or worse, could wipe out his savings. “Anything can happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/10/ministers-hope-to-ban-solar-projects-from-most-english-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ministers hope to ban solar projects from most English farms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/10/ministers-hope-to-ban-solar-projects-from-most-english-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/10/ministers-hope-to-ban-solar-projects-from-most-english-farms","fields":{"headline":"Ministers hope to ban solar projects from most English farms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ministers are planning to ban solar farms from most of England’s farmland, the Guardian can reveal. The new environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, is understood to oppose solar panels being placed on agricultural land, arguing that it impedes his programme of growth and boosting food production. To this end, say government sources, he has asked his officials to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. Currently, most solar farms are built on and planned for 3b land, so this move would scupper most new developments of the renewable energy source. Extending BMV to grade 3b would ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land. Much of grade 4 and 5 land is in upland areas that are unsuitable for solar developments. During her speech at the Conservative party conference last week, the prime minister, Liz Truss, reeled off a list of “enemies”, including green campaigners, who make up what she characterised as the “anti-growth coalition”. However, green campaigners say blocking the building of renewables would make her government part of such a group. Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK, said: “The UK solar sector is alarmed by attempts to put major planning rules in the way of cheap, homegrown energy. Solar power is the answer to so many needs and policy demands: it will cut energy bills, deliver energy security, boost growth and help rural economies. Ranil Jayawardena’s opposition to solar farms must surely make him part of the anti-growth coalition.” To get this policy over the line, Defra would have to get signoff from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. It is understood that BEIS ministers are against the move, as they are trying to show that they are not only deregulating the oil and gas industry and fracking, but also renewable energy. However, No 10 is understood to be sympathetic to the idea, with Truss having vowed to block solar farms on agricultural land during her election campaign. Dustin Benton, policy director at the thinktank Green Alliance, said: “It would be odd to redefine ‘best and most versatile’ agricultural land to include soils that aren’t of high quality, just to block solar farms. It sounds like a tactic that the ‘anti-growth coalition’ might employ. “The UK desperately needs to expand renewables so we don’t have to pay the extortionate cost of gas. Solar is one of the fastest energy sources to be deployed, so we should move quickly to build more in light of the gas crisis.” Andy Mayer, chief operation officer at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: “The government cannot on the one hand declare war on ‘the anti-growth coalition’, while on the other enforcing a right to veto developments, or waste time and money with excessive regulation. “Farmers and green entrepreneurs are itching to provide solutions to the false claim that energy and food security cannot coexist. The City of London is ready to fund them. Long-term solutions to grid congestion and storage are possible. Market reform can provide a level-playing field for competition. Communities can benefit through more personal rewards from permitted development. “That is what a supply-side revolution to encourage growth while supporting a transition to a cleaner greener future looks like. Not rigid rules, plans and targets that confuse, contradict and encourage opposition to change.” Ed Miliband, shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, said: “If the government goes ahead with blocking solar energy, it will be yet more unilateral energy disarmament from a government that has a 12 year record of driving up bills by blocking clean power. The blame for this plan lies squarely with the prime minister who has repeatedly opposed solar energy, the cheapest, cleanest, quickest form of power–and it will be the British people who pay the price in higher bills, higher gas imports and energy insecurity.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to deny this change was on the cards, simply saying the government had been looking at options to support farming and economic growth while protecting nature and delivering on net zero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/oct/09/beam-me-down-can-solar-power-from-space-help-solve-our-energy-needs","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T11:00:55Z","webTitle":"Beam me down: can solar power from space help solve our energy needs?

","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In late November, a top-level meeting of European science ministers will convene in Paris. Their job is to decide the next priorities for the European Space Agency (Esa), of which the UK is still a member, and one of the items on their list to consider is a proposal for testing the feasibility of building commercial power stations in orbit. These huge satellites would bask in the sunlight, converting it to power and beaming it down to Earth to be fed into the power grid. The proposed project, known as Solaris, would determine whether the idea can contribute to Europe’s future energy security – or if it is all still pie in the sky. If the study gets the go-ahead, it will be like coming home for the space industry, which has always been at the forefront of solar power development. A year after the Russians launched the battery-powered Sputnik 1 in 1957, the Americans launched Vanguard 1. This was the fourth satellite in orbit and the first to generate its power using solar energy. Since that time, solar panels have become the primary way of powering spacecraft, which has helped to drive research. Vanguard 1’s solar cells converted just 9% of the captured sunlight into electricity. Today, the efficiency has more than doubled, and continues to increase, while the cost of fabrication has been falling. It’s a winning formula. “The cost of solar has been decreasing rapidly over the past 20 years, and faster than most players in the industry expected,” says Jochen Latz, a partner at management consultant McKinsey &amp; Company. So much so, that in the Middle East and Australia, solar power is now the cheapest way to generate electricity. According to Latz, as the technology continues to develop, this will become true in the mid-latitude countries too. “In 2050, we expect more than 40% of the energy in the EU to come from solar power – if the countries achieve their committed targets,” says Latz. That would make solar power the single largest contributing energy source to the EU. However, there are obvious problems that need solutions if we are to fully utilise solar panels on Earth. For one thing, what do we do at night? In May, Ned Ekins-Daukes, associate professor at the school of photovoltaic and renewable energy engineering at the University of New South Wales, Australia, and his team of researchers demonstrated a solar cell that could generate electricity from the emission of infrared rather than from the absorption of sunlight. This works perfectly at night because the Earth stores energy from the sun in the form of heat, which it then radiates back into space as infrared radiation. The prototype device is based on the same kind of technology used in night-vision goggles and at present it can only generate a few milliwatts of power, but Ekins-Daukes sees the potential. “This is the beginning – it’s the world’s first demonstration of thermal radiative power,” he says, indicating that the team is aiming for a finished product that is “10,000 times more powerful”. At those levels, it is possible that a rooftop installation of such devices, probably fabricated in some way as an additional layer to conventional solar panels, would capture enough energy to power the house overnight – that is, keeping the fridge, wifi router and so on running. While that is a modest saving for each household, multiplied across a country’s population, it becomes significant. Another obvious issue with solar power is that some days will be cloudy. To alleviate this, excess electricity generated on sunny days needs to be stored in batteries but storage capacity is currently woeful. “The EU will need about 200 gigawatts [GW] of battery storage by 2030, but as of 2021 there was only 2.4GW of storage in place, so a massive increase will be needed,” says Aidan McClean, chief executive of UFODrive, an all-electric car rental company. To help with this shortfall, McClean champions a scheme called vehicle-to-grid – V2G – which uses the battery in an electric vehicle (EV) to store excess energy generated by a home’s rooftop solar panels and then transfer it back into the house when needed in the evening, or even sell it on to National Grid at other periods of high demand. “If V2G becomes widely adopted, the expected storage capacity of all the EVs will vastly exceed any expected storage requirements the grid will require going into the future,” says McClean. A recent V2G trial in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, showed that participants saved money and cut their carbon footprint by using an “intelligent” charging system that topped up the batteries when renewables were generating electricity. Another approach is to use solar power not to generate electricity but to produce sustainable vehicle fuels. Virgil Andrei of the department of chemistry at Cambridge University and his colleagues have developed a thin “artificial leaf” that draws its inspiration from photosynthesis. In plants, photosynthesis takes in sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) and converts them into oxygen and sugars. In the artificial leaves, the output is syngas, or synthetic gas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used to produce a number of fuels via various industrial processes. It is even possible to produce petrol and kerosene. “We envisioned using CO2 from the atmosphere or other industrial processes and pouring that into these types of systems to create green fuel. Instead of releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere, we just have a circular carbon economy,” says Andrei. In effect they would piggyback off carbon-capture plants, which are currently being deployed to harness CO2 from industrial processes, and “recycle” it into sustainable fuels. The team first made an artificial leaf in 2019 but it was a bulky construction of glass and metal that sat on a bench top. This year, however, the team announced the results of a smaller, actual leaf-like structure that the researchers floated on the River Cam. The leaf was sealed inside a transparent plastic bag with the precursor gas and water and then left on the river for a number of days. The team then opened the bag and tested what gases had been produced by photosynthesis. The artificial leaves themselves are composed of materials called perovskites. The archetypal perovskite is a naturally occurring mineral of calcium titanium oxide – also known as calcium titanate – which was discovered in 1839 in the Ural mountains of Russia by German mineralogist Gustav Rose and named after his Russian counterpart Lev Perovski. Modern perovskites can have different chemical constituents and some have shown that they can function as solar cells. “These materials are very new and very exciting,” says Andrei. Laboratory tests show that they can be more efficient than the silicon used in conventional solar panels. Perovskites could even replace silicon in the solar panels of the future as they can be fabricated more easily and in thin, flexible layers. Another bonus is that these materials produce higher currents and voltages than their silicon counterparts, which allows more energetic processes such as the reactions that were used in the artificial leaves study. *** As promising as all this sounds, though, there is one insurmountable problem when generating solar power from the surface of the Earth: the atmosphere. The molecules in our atmosphere scatter about half the sunlight out of the direct beam. This scattered light bouncing around is what creates the blue sky we are so familiar with. In space, there is no atmosphere, so the sun’s light is undiluted. And as the aerospace engineers at the beginning of the space race found, put a solar panel in orbit and it will automatically generate about twice as much power as the equivalent panel on Earth. Unsurprisingly then, engineers and visionaries have been dreaming of putting solar power-producing satellites into orbit for decades. The basic principle is simple. A fleet of spacecraft with giant solar panels collects sunlight, before converting it into power and then beaming that energy back to Earth. How do you wirelessly beam energy across space? It turns out we’ve been doing it for decades. Every telecommunications satellite since the 1960s has used a solar panel to generate electricity, which is then converted into a microwave signal and sent to Earth. On the ground, antennas convert the microwaves back into electrical energy and read the signals. “The physics involved in that whole chain is exactly the same for space-based solar power, but the scale of it is completely different,” says Sanjay Vijendran of Esa, who is coordinating the proposed Solaris programme to study the feasibility of space-based solar power. Every few decades since the beginning of the space race, the idea of space solar power has been investigated. On every occasion, the story has been the same: the cost of launching such large satellites is prohibitive. But now, things are different. “In 2015, a miracle happens. The Falcon 9 reusable rocket flies for the first time,” says John Mankins, a former Nasa physicist who is now president of Artemis Innovation Management Solutions. Mankins is an expert on solar-power satellites, having worked on many of the feasibility studies over the decades. With the advent of a truly reusable rocket, the cost of sending equipment into orbit is tumbling. Instead of costing about $1,000 to launch every kilogram into space, Mankins now expects the price to come down to closer to $300 a kilogram. “That’s the holy grail for space solar power. It is not just possible some day – it’s inevitable in the next five or seven years,” he says. Others are similarly optimistic. In September 2021, the Frazer-Nash Consultancy published a report for the UK government that concluded: “Space solar power is technically feasible, affordable, and could both bring substantial economic benefits for the UK, and could support net zero pathways.” In late August, Esa released its own studies on space-based solar energy, which arrived at a similar conclusion for the whole of Europe. As a result, the agency will request in November that its member states fund a three-year feasibility study into solar-power satellites to examine in detail whether such a system might become commercially viable. “Solaris is a bridge to check that this is really doable and that it would really help before we ask for billions of euros,” says Vijendran. Whether or not such satellites go into orbit, there can be no doubt that solar power is set to dominate the energy landscape of the future. And as the current Ukraine crisis shows, that could lead to better energy security as well as reducing our carbon output."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/09/australia-news-live-floods-nsw-evacuation-insiders-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-politics-tax-cuts","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T07:11:05Z","webTitle":"Extinction Rebellion protesters glue hands to prized Picasso – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/09/australia-news-live-floods-nsw-evacuation-insiders-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-politics-tax-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/09/australia-news-live-floods-nsw-evacuation-insiders-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-politics-tax-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Extinction Rebellion protesters glue hands to prized Picasso – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s it from me Graham Readfearn and for our live news coverage for today. Thanks to Royce Kurmelovs for his work for the bulk of this Sunday. Here’s what happened: Ten places in NSW have been given advice to evacuate as most rivers in regional areas are under flood warnings. Forecasters say more rain will hit already bulging rivers in NSW later this week. Police in Western Australia are looking for a 4WD driver after an elderly man on his electric bike was hit and killed near Perth. Two Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested at the National Gallery of Victoria after they glued themselves to Pablo Picasso’s Massacre in Korea. The protesters were not charged and XR says the painting was not harmed. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, stressed his government’s position on the stage-three tax cuts “hadn’t changed”. Former NT chief minister Michael Gunner, who resigned in May, has taken a role with mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s clean industry and hydrogen venture Fortescue Future Industries. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he did not agree with calls for his party’s vice-president, Teena McQueen, to resign. McQueen had said party members should “rejoice” at the defeat of some of the party’s moderates in the last federal election. Thanks for being here, and if you’re anywhere threatened with flooding then please stay on top of the warnings from the SES and the Bureau of Meteorology. Stay safe. Someone in Dubbo took their dog out in a kayak to look at the flooding. Just four paramedics on standby at Indonesian football disaster, says official Only four paramedics were on standby inside the football stadium in Indonesia where 131 people were killed in a crowd crush, with a further 12 nearby, the head of the local public health office has said, promising a thorough evaluation of the response. The match was not considered to be a high-risk event because only fans of Arema, the home side, were present, said Wiyanto Wijoyo, the head of Malang regency public health office. Supporters of the opposing team, Persebaya Surabaya, who won the match, had been banned as a precaution to prevent violence between rival fans. Anyone in inland NSW can stay up to date with the many flood warnings here at the Bureau of Meteorology’s summary page of warnings. The NSW SES have issued another evacuation request along the Hawkesbury River, this time for areas in the town of Richmond north-west of Sydney. The evacuation alert affects parts of Cornwallis and eastern part of Richmond Lowlands. People on the Hawkesbury River bounded by Kurrajong Road, the back of Francis Street, the back of Dight Street, Percival Street and Rickabys Creek are being asked to evacuate before 11.45pm. This includes Bensons Lane; Cornwallis Road; Cornwells Lane; Cupritts Lane; Gow Lane; Ingolds Lane; Old Kurrajong Road; Onus Lane; Percival Street; Powells Lane; Ridges Lane; and Triangle Lane. The SES says if people cannot find alternative accommodation they should go to the evacuation centre set up at Castle Hill RSL. The river level at Windsor could go above moderate flood levels this evening, reaching 8.1 metres on Monday afternoon. PM rides Perth’s first airport train In amongst pushing away questions about tax cuts and the nuclear threat from the Ukraine conflict, prime minister Anthony Albanese squeezed on a train for a selfie with WA premier Mark McGowan and the state’s transport minister Rita Saffioti. Albanese rode the first train of the new $1.86bn Metronet airport line when it pulled out of High Wycombe station this morning, alongside 40 “lucky” lottery winners. The new airport line goes underneath the Swan River and Perth airport and adds 8.5km to the city’s rail network. The Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in ongoing, with reports that at least 17 people have been killed in shelling in the city of Zaporizhzhia. The NSW SES says people living in an area of Sackville should evacuate before 11.45pm tonight as the Hawkesbury River rises. The agency says properties near the intersection of Sackville Road and Tizzana Road should evacuate with dangerous flooding expected. Anyone who can’t find alternative accommodation with family or friends should go to the evacuation facility at the North Richmond Community Centre. A route along Sackville Road and then Kurmond Road should be taken, as some roads could also flood tonight. The evacuation request for the locality is the eighth to have been issued across the state since yesterday. Police in Western Australia are looking for the driver of a four-wheel drive involved in a fatal crash that killed an 86-year-old man riding an electric bike, AAP reports. The man was hit on the Mitchell Freeway, near Perth, just before 5am today near the Hepburn Avenue exit. Police believe a silver Mitsubishi four-wheel drive struck the man but did not stop. The man died at the scene from critical injuries. The car involved would have significant front end damage, particularly on the left-hand passenger side, police said. An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson has told Guardian Australia that a Picasso painting in Melbourne had not been damaged when two activists glued themselves to it. The spokesperson said the Picasso painting, Massacre in Korea, at Melbourne’s NGV was “perfectly OK”. Only the clear plastic covering over the painting had been damaged, the spokesperson said. We’ve heard about flooding in New South Wales, a new green job for former NT chief minister and two activists have glued themselves to a Picasso. Here’s a summary of what’s been happening today. Most inland rivers in NSW are under flood warnings after torrential rain overnight. River heights are still rising in many places with a forecast of more heavy rain from Wednesday. Residents across the state have been asked to be vigilant, not to drive through flood waters and stay across SES warnings. Two Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested at the National Gallery of Victoria after they glued themselves to Pablo Picasso’s Massacre in Korea. The painting had a protective cover. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, stressed his government’s position on the stage-three tax cuts “hasn’t changed” during a press conference in Perth. Former NT chief minister Michael Gunner, who resigned in May, has taken a role with mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s clean industry and hydrogen venture Fortescue Future Industries. Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he did not agree with calls for his party’s vice-president, Teena McQueen, to resign. McQueen had said party members should “rejoice” at the defeat of some of the party’s moderates in the last federal election. On we go. Thanks to Royce Kurmelovs for guiding us through our live news coverage. I’m Graham Readfearn and I’ll be keeping things going for the rest of the day. If you’re travelling in regional parts of New South Wales, be careful on those flooded roads. Man in stable condition following shark attack A man in his 30s who suffered serious injuries to his arm from a shark bite remains in a stable condition in the Royal Perth hospital. Early reports suggested the man had been spear fishing near Port Hedland yesterday morning when he was bitten by an unknown species of shark. A Royal Flying Doctors service spokesperson said yesterday the man’s left arm had been almost severed by the shark. The hospital confirmed the man was still in a stable condition. Fox News reports that 22 out of 28 cars have either been off track or been involved in some sort of incident during the Bathurst 1000. Whether it’s bushfire smoke or torrential rain, the moment is a good reminder of how climate change threatens the future of sport. Two Extinction Rebellion activists have glued themselves to a Pablo Picasso work at the National Gallery of Victoria. Photos posted to social media show two protesters glued to Picasso’s Massacre in Korea – a 1951 anti-war expressionist painting – in the gallery on Sunday afternoon. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion told Guardian Australia the two protesters had been arrested and taken to a police station in Southbank. The spokesperson said a conservator from the gallery used acetone to remove the superglue used by the protesters. The climate activist group said it targeted the high-profile painting to urge all governments, corporations and institutions to take action on the environmental crisis. A Victoria police spokesperson said they believed three protesters entered the gallery on the ground level before a man and a woman glued themselves to the protective covering of the Picasso painting. The spokesperson said a 49-year-old NSW woman and a 59-year old Footscray man were removed from the painting just after 2pm. The pair and a 49-year-old Williamstown man have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries. ‘It is a dangerous time’: PM on risk of nuclear escalation in Ukraine The prime minister will not be drawn over concerns about the growing risk of nuclear escalation in Ukraine saying: “It is a dangerous time.” What we know is that this is a dangerous time. One of the pressures on the budget of course is defence expenditure. We do not think that there would be a land war in Europe like we are seeing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We hoped that was something we had put in the past. After speaking of his time in Ukraine meeting president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Albanese said the situation could be resolved if Russia withdrew from Ukraine. They’re fighting for the international rule of law and they’re fighting to uphold the principle that nation states’ borders should be respected. President Putin can fix this by just withdrawing. By withdrawing from this aggressive act that is totally against international law. His comments echo those of Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin who said Russia “leaving Ukraine” was the only way the conflict would end. Albanese is attempting to water down speculation over which way his government will go on the future of stage-three tax cuts ahead of the 25 October budget saying: “Our position hasn’t changed.” Albanese has repeated the line several times while also preparing Australians for potential cuts: We are triaging a budget where there is a trillion dollars of debt and frankly not much to show for it. Federal government ready to offer flood assistance to NSW Prime minister Anthony Albanese says the federal government is ready to offer assistance to the New South Wales government if required following the floods across the state. Speaking from Perth, Albanese said the government has been preparing since Friday to ensure it is able to help. Virtual elder care in SA to free up emergency departments Thousands of elderly South Australians will avoid unnecessary trips to hospital following the expansion of a virtual health service trial. Following a successful test run, SA’s Virtual Care Service is being rolled out at more than 150 residential care facilities, which are home to more than 11,000 residents. The program will also help reduce demand on the state’s under-fire ambulance service and emergency departments, the health minister Chris Picton said. The trial, undertaken at 11 Eldercare aged care homes, found about 80% of patients treated by the service could receive care within the home, avoiding the need for hospital and an unnecessary triple-zero call. The service provides direct access to specialist medical, nursing and paramedic clinicians. Facilities can instead organise video link consultations to assess, monitor and determine care options, which can often be provided in-house. Approximately 35 SA aged care residents are taken to metropolitan emergency departments each day. Due to their age and sometimes complex needs, they often end up admitted to hospital unnecessarily. Picton said on Sunday that the service will ensure older South Australians and vulnerable patients can receive “the care they need outside of hospital”. It will deliver better care for more residents and their families in a comfortable and familiar setting, freeing up emergency resources across the health system. The service is expected to receive approximately 18 referrals per day – calls that would otherwise have resulted in an ambulance call-out. It is estimated every aged care resident who avoids a trip to the ED frees up at least six hours there and two hours for the state’s ambulance service. SA’s most serious emergency cases increased by more than 6% in September compared with the same time a year ago. There was also a 2.3% jump in these cases compared with August. – from AAP Australia to form new supercontinent – in 300m years Australia will merge to form a new supercontinent about 300m years from now, according to research by two Perth-based scientists. Curtin University’s Dr Chuan Huang and Prof Zheng-Xiang Li estimate the configuration of “Amasia” will form as the Pacific Ocean closes in roughly 200m to 300m years from now. Using a supercomputer to simulate the scenario, they found that because Earth has been cooling for billions of years, the thickness and strength of undersea plates reduce with time. This would make it difficult for the next supercontinent to assemble by closing “young” oceans like the Atlantic or Indian. Australia is expected to play an important role, first colliding with Asia and then connecting it to America. “By simulating how the Earth’s tectonic plates are expected to evolve ... we were able to show that in less than 300m years it is likely to be the Pacific Ocean that will close, allowing for the formation of Amasia, debunking some previous scientific theories,” Huang said. Still covering 30% of the planet’s surface, the Pacific Ocean is what is left of the Panthalassa super ocean that started forming 700m years ago when the previous supercontinent started breaking apart. Currently open to a dimension of about 10,000km, it’s been shrinking since the time of the dinosaurs at a rate of a few centimetres a year. Li says the presence of a single continental mass will dramatically alter Earth’s ecosystem and environment. “The sea level is expected to be lower and the vast interior of the supercontinent will be very arid with high daily temperature ranges,” he said. “Currently, Earth consists of seven continents with widely different ecosystems and human cultures, so it would be fascinating to think what the world might look like in 200m to 300m years.” – with AAP First Australian Crankworx concludes in Cairns The first-ever Australian leg of Crankworx, the leading global mountain biking competition, concludes today in Cairns. The multi-day event ends with the dual slalom races, as two riders battle side-by-side against each other and the clock. Australian riders have already enjoyed a strong Crankworx, with Canberra’s Harriet Burbidge-Smith winning gold in the speed and style final on Thursday. Burbidge-Smith was a BMX world champion before switching to mountain biking in her early 20s. “Haz” is on a mission to get more women into the sport. Cooke: NSW government to ‘press on’ with plans to raise dam wall Cooke is back and asked whether the state government needs to reconsider development plans for low-lying areas in the flood plain. “The NSW government is taking these matters very seriously,” the emergency services minister says. She says the government has accepted all recommendations of a recent inquiry and will “press on” with plans to raise the wall of the Warragamba dam. York is also asked what the state of the wall of dam is, given it has been under pressure for a significant period of time. She says that is a question better directed to Water NSW. ‘All floods are dangerous’: York York says that “all floods are dangerous”: Some floods are slower moving and some in western parts of New South Wales, you can get little warning time. It does not mean there is any more time to avoid flash floods and that is what we’re really concerned about. The water will build up and create a flash flood. And it will cut off roads. It will cut off or raise the risk for livestock as well. York: people who stay may put emergency staff at risk York is asked about people who chose to stay making the circumstances more difficult for first responders, and she says it does, particularly coming out of “two, three” years of drought. It is a completely different picture across New South Wales. It is saturated and there is nowhere for the water to go except across the land and to any properties on its way. York: I would caution people who make that decision who think to stay safe in their homes, it is much better to move out when you have time and that is not traffic on the road. You can get to safety and higher ground and go back to the house when it is high and dry and call at two o’clock in the morning when we may not be able to get there, depending on how many calls for assistance [we have]. And the weather conditions, if it is raining, it makes things very difficult. [We] can’t get helicopters up and you are putting emergency service personnel lives at risk. We try to give as much notice as possible so they can evacuate in an orderly fashion and get somewhere safe. SES warns NSW residents to evacuate early The NSW State Emergency Service has issued 94 warnings issues across the state, with the commissioner Carlene York warning residents to evacuate early and take extra precautions. It is very dangerous out there on our roads. We are seeing a lot of flash flooding and as we have said the rivers are still rising. York asked people to pay attention to evacuation orders and said evacuation centres have been opened to accomodate them. When you ask people, if you have to evacuate or are planning to evacuate, reach out to family and friends first and if you can’t do that, we will make sure of the right evacuation centres you can go to. BoM: Low pressure system moves off the coast Jane Golding from the Bureau of Meteorology says several regions are being monitored, including Gunnedah. In summary, from this recent rain we’ve seen over the last week, it looks like the low pressure system that caused the rain over last night has now moved off the coast. Though Golding said the rain has stopped, flooding will continue through the week. Now we’re turning our eyes towards the next system. ‘Completely saturated landscape’: NSW emergency services minister The New South Wales emergency services minister Steph Cooke is giving an update now on the situation facing the state. Cooke says the state has a “completely saturated landscape” with the risk of trees falling in strong winds and landslips as the state’s dams fill to capacity. We know that in our inland New South Wales regions, the flood waters will continue to be a problem for communities not just for the weeks ahead, but for months. Flood warnings for rain-soaked parts of NSW The Bureau of Meteorology says areas hit by heavy rain are expected to reach major or near major flood levels over the coming days. Those areas include: Warren on the Macquarie River Nanami, Cottons Weir, Jemalong, Euabalong, Forbes on the Lachlan River Gundagai on the Murrumbidgee River Weilmoringle on the Culgoa River Tilpa on the Darling River The bureau also advised some catchments east of the divide were experiencing new flooding, including the Hawkesbury and Nepean. Rain will ease throughout the rest of Sunday with no significant rainfalls expected for the next few days but conditions will worsen again from Wednesday to Friday. Speaking of wet conditions… Three cars have been totalled and ruled out of the race in a chaotic start to the Bathurst 1000 at Mount Panorama. The safety car was deployed twice within the opening five laps on Sunday. James Moffat lost pole immediately off the start to a surging Lee Holdsworth and when the pack rounded turn one, Jamie Whincup and Jack Perkins were spun around. Zak Best’s car 55 was the mountain’s first casualty and towed off the circuit after veering into the barriers. When the race restarted on lap five, Zane Goddard left the track attempting an overtake and lost control rejoining the tarmac. He veered across the track and was smashed into by Dale Wood in the R&amp;J Batteries entry, with Matt Campbell joined the pile-up. All three cars were totalled. Campbell reported a sore ankle, groin, neck and wrists while Wood and Goddard walked away unscathed. Racing in his 20th Bathurst, 2103 champion Mark Winterbottom got tangled up and spun out but narrowly avoided any major damage in the incident. Wood was seen crying back in pit lane after the incident, with only one of Brad Jones Racing’s cars left in the race. Dry track conditions and fine weather prevailed as the Bathurst 1000 got under way, with the majority of teams opting for their co-drivers to begin the 1,000km race. The only main driver among the top 10 starters was retirement-bound Holdsworth, who held the early lead. – from AAP Michael Gunner ‘finally seeing the light’, say campaigners Environmentalists have congratulated the Northern Territory’s former chief minister Michael Gunner “for finally seeing the light” after he revealed earlier today he had taken a role with mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s clean industry company. Gunner, who resigned as chief minister in May, will lead a new northern Australia team at Fortescue Future Industries. Co-director of the Environment Centre NT Kirsty Howey said Gunner’s new role was in contrast to his support for fossil fuels during his time as chief minister that had left behind “a legacy of climate-wrecking projects”. Howey said: The Environment Centre NT congratulates former chief minister Michael Gunner for finally seeing the light on climate and looks forward to working with him in his new role with Fortescue Future Industries. However, Territorians can’t forget the devastating legacy of climate-wrecking projects that the former chief minister leaves behind. No one has pushed harder for new fossil fuel development in the Territory than Mr Gunner. Howey said during Gunner’s tenure, the territory government had approved fracking in the Beetaloo Basin, supported Santos’s Barossa gas project and pushed for a petrochemicals precinct. It’s well past time for the Northern Territory Fyles government and the Albanese government to abandon plans for the three new mega gas projects in the Northern Territory: the Beetaloo Basin, the Barossa gas project and the petrochemicals precinct at Middle Arm, including the billions in federal subsidies thrown at these projects. Madeleine King: ‘no plans’ to change stage-three tax cuts The prime minister Anthony Albanese is likely to be asked about the fate of the stage-three tax cuts later today amid growing expectations the government will stop short of making changes in this month’s budget. Albanese is due to appear in public in Western Australia about 10.30am Perth time (1.30pm AEDT), followed by a press conference at 2.15pm AEDT. Ahead of his press conference, no one has disputed reports from Sky News and the ABC that the government is highly unlikely to make changes to the stage-three tax cuts in the budget due to be handed down on 25 October. That does not close off the possibility of changes in the next budget in May. Albanese said on Friday that the government’s position had not changed but did not rule out amendments, following a week of debate fuelled by the treasurer Jim Chalmers saying the government would be prepared to make tough decisions reflecting the economic times. In an interview recorded late in the week but broadcast on Sky News this morning, the resources minister Madeleine King said the government had “no plans” to change the stage-three tax cuts but there was a “conversation going in the community”. King added that it was “OK to have an open conversation” about tax and budget issues. Michael Gunner joins Andrew Forrest’s green energy firm The Northern Territory’s former chief minister Michael Gunner has landed a new job with a green energy company owned by mining billionaire Andrew Forrest. The former NT Labor leader has been hired to head up the northern Australia team at Fortescue Future Industries as the company looks to develop new projects in the territory and across Western Australia’s north-west. Gunner said in a statement that he looked forward to working on projects aimed at addressing climate change and said he made the move “for the kids”. The pitch from Dr Forrest and FFI was simple and straight to the heart – do it for the kids. By going hard commercially at real zero, at FFI we help make the genuine impacts on climate change that the world needs. My message is clear: FFI is committed to aggressively reducing emissions and FFI is here now. Forrest said in a statement that Gunner’s experience “working hand-in-hand with the people of northern Australia” would make the new hire a “valuable asset to FFI”. We see enormous potential in the Northern Territory, with abundant wind and solar energy, and a community enthusiastic to embrace renewable energy and the employment-intensive industries that come with it. The industry-leading decarbonisation strategy we unveiled in New York in September provided clear evidence that Fortescue is leading the world in its transition to a global, green renewable and resources company. Gunner is not the only former Labor leader to pick up a new gig with Forrest. The former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill has been appointed as chief executive of the mining billionaire’s charity, the Minderoo Foundation. Bathurst 1000 under way amid fine weather Dry track conditions and fine weather prevailed as the Bathurst 1000 got under way, with the majority of teams opting for their co-drivers to begin the 1,000km race. After three days of rain and overcast conditions, the sun finally arrived over Mount Panorama on Sunday with the weather set to be favourable throughout the day. Australia’s biggest domestic motorsport prize is up for grabs and the Tickford Racing pair of Cam Waters and co-driver James Moffat started from pole following the cancellation of Saturday’s top-10 shootout. Waters qualified fastest in Friday’s first qualifying for his second Bathurst pole, but it was Moffat who got first crack at the mountain. The pair were looking to go one better after consecutive second-placed finishes in the race in the previous two years. Moffat was one of 19 co-drivers who started, with nine of the grid’s top 10 all co-drivers. The only lead driver among the top 10 starters was retirement-bound Lee Holdsworth in his 19th consecutive Great Race. Fans swarmed the grid for Bathurst’s first maximum-capacity event since the pandemic began. Motorsport officials notified drivers in the two-minute warning that the circuit was still wet on the exit of turn one. – from AAP More rain for western and southern NSW Bad news for those living in western and southern New South Wales – more rain on the way later in the week. Fifth-highest September rainfall in NSW since 1900 New South Wales has experienced the fifth-highest September rainfall since records began in 1900, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Some regions recorded their highest September daily rainfall ever on the 18th or the 16th, when strong cold fronts moved across the state, or on the 3rd, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, or 29th, following offshore low pressure systems. Political fundraisers axed ahead of budget Political fundraisers at Parliament House are due to be canned in the lead-up to the federal budget, AAP reports. The prime minister Anthony Albanese wrote to the parliament’s speaker and president asking for the ban. It’s understood the House or Representatives speaker Milton Dick and Senate president Sue Lines agreed and it will come into effect on 17 October, a week ahead of the federal budget. The shadow treasurer Angus Taylor told Sky News on Sunday he was yet to see the detail but branded the move “a political stunt”. Political fundraising is part of our system. It’s how it works. [The Coalition] don’t have the ability to rely on the unions the way Labor does. So for us, it’s actually about going out to hardworking Australians and getting their support. And we have to do that all the time. Frankston to be boom gate free by 2029 if Labor government re-elected The Andrews government has pledged to make Melbourne’s Frankston boom gate free by 2029 by removing seven level crossings. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews made the announcement on Sunday morning. As part of the project, there will be two road closures and new stations built at Highett, Mordialloc, Aspendale and Seaford. Andrews said the pledge would ease road congestion and improve safety: To be level crossing free means you can run more trains more often. It’s safer and of course the road network is improved with people not being held up. New South Wales state emergency services conducted 21 flood rescues overnight with the majority involving people who became stuck while attempting to drive through flood waters. Speaking to ABC News this morning SES assistant commissioner Dean Storey urged residents of NSW to be cautious as rain eases across the state especially as conditions may be “deceptive”. Know the sun may be out in some locations, the rivers are still on the rise in many areas. [We’re] happy to see that the rain eased across much of the state, but that flooding risk remains in play. A lot of water on the ground across roads. So [we’re] urging people who are out on the roads in the coming days to be vigilant of that fact. Drive to conditions. Storey said the SES is working with community members to help support them as they grappled with a “widespread flooding event”. We know there’s been major flooding and will continue to be major flooding in inland NSW and the west and the south for the coming days, weeks and months. Labor opposition promises overhaul to labour laws if elected in NSW The NSW Labor party has vowed to modernise the state’s employment law to better protect gig economy workers, if it is elected in March next year. NSW Labor leader Chris Minns announced on Sunday that the party would introduce worker’s compensation and what it called “a portable entitlement scheme” for gig workers and others in insecure employment. They would also amend the Industrial Relations Act so that workers in the transport industry and food delivery services could access minimum rates and conditions, and establish enforceable codes of conduct for WHS work performed by on-demand platforms, among other measures. In a statement, NSW Labor said the laws were designed to prevent more workers falling foul of “an out-of-date workers compensation system” that denied the families of four food delivery riders who died in NSW in 2020 any statutory compensation, as they were not hired as employees by the companies they worked for. The policies would also assist workers in the disability, community and care sectors, Labor said. Minns said in a statement: The rise of the gig economy has revolutionised the way people can access work. But that shouldn’t mean workers should be left more vulnerable. Every single worker in New South Wales has the right to feel safe and supported at work. Shadow industrial relations and workplace safety minister Sophie Cotsis said: After 12 years of this Liberal and National government we have seen an erosion of basic rights and entitlements of a growing segment of the working population, particularly women in these key care sectors. For many have felt abandoned by this government which has created employment insecurity and hardship and feel deprived of basic entitlements which affects their ability to get a loan, secure rental accommodation and support their families. NSW Labor’s policy provides security, dignity and acknowledges the significant contribution of these workers to our society. NSW Labor’s election pledge comes in the wake of the federal Labor government promising to establish minimum pay and conditions for gig workers, saying they would legislate to give the Fair Work Commission the power to set minimum standards and allow them to bargain collectively for entitlements. More rain and high winds are predicted for Sunday. Residents of Gronos Point have been told to leave ahead of flooding. On that last question, for those who missed what happened during the week it is worth reading the full story by Guardian Australia political reporter Josh Butler. Dutton on the stoush between Tina McQueen and Simon Birmingham Following comments by McQueen that the party should “rejoice” that the party’s moderates were defeated at the last election. Dutton: There is a desire here to win the next election. We will only do that with discipline and the party that I lead is frankly having grown up under John Howard and Peter Costello and that’s the approach that I take. A winner-takes-all approach in the Liberal party or Labor party doesn’t work on a broad range of views. Speers asks Dutton about the comments by Birmingham that McQueen should resigned. No, I don’t agree with that. She has expressed a view, she has made a mistake. I’ve made it clear it won’t happen again. Did McQueen apologise? That’s what I expect on both sides. Speers then asks whether McQueen should apologise. I’m not going into internal matters beyond that. Dutton on whether Essendon should reinstate Andrew Thorburn Andrew Thorburn resigned over his links to a church that is anti-abortion and considers homosexuality a sin. After backing in Thorburn who Dutton said “distanced” himself from the comments of his pastor, Speers asks: Should organisations be able to hire and fire based on someone’s sexuality? Dutton: Well, I don’t support discrimination on any basis, to be honest. Speers: So religious schools shouldn’t sack a gay teacher? Dutton: Again, we’ve had these debates over the last couple of years and... Speers: What do you think? Dutton: Go into Chris Bowen’s electorate, obviously a lot of comment from local mayors there this week about different issues. Islamic schools, Jewish schools, Christian schools in our country who want to teach their faith and they should be free to do so. If they have children enrolled in that school by their parents, the parents expect that there will be an adherence to that doctrine... Speers: So you don’t support discrimination on any basis, except for religious schools and gay teachers? Dutton: Again, David, if you are a person of a Jewish faith and you are sending your child to that school, it is for a reason. You’ve made a decision to send your child there to receive religious as part of a more general education and that should be unhindered, so any thought that somebody could be discriminated as in the circumstance of Mr Thorburn is completely unacceptable. Bringing children home presents a security risk: Dutton Dutton says there is a chance “indoctrination has occurred”. He is then asked why it was OK for the Morrison government to bring a child home but not Labor – and his own track record on this issue. Dutton: As much as I feel for those families, those kids, they are horrible scenes, and the fact that someone has taken their children or wife or family member into that theatre of war is tragic, but I’ve also got to think about the safety and security of other toddlers and families here, and if we think the threat has gone away, that they couldn’t act out, that there wouldn’t be an explosion in our country, that is a naive approach to what is a very difficult situation. Dutton on whether bringing home families of Islamic State fighters is a security risk Dutton is now asked on the plan to bring home the family’s of Islamic State fighters who are stuck in refugee camps in Syria. He is specifically asked about whether he was told that bringing these family’s back to Australia would be a security risk. It’s built on what I received when I was in the National Security Committee not that long ago, and it is clear to me that on what I know and what I’ve read and what I’ve heard and been informed on, that we can’t provide the level of surety to the Australian public. Now, is it a terrible situation for the families? Absolutely. Dutton goes on to express empathy but then highlights the cost of security. If you are a parent or grandparent of a daughter … in that situation, of course you would want to bring them back home. Any person would have that feeling or emotion, that’s perfectly logical, but we have to be careful of children and people in that setting, and mixing with people of terrorist attacks over a period of time. It costs $3.8m a year and 300 police officers to 24/7 monitor one individual. Labor’s instinct on economy is ‘always the wrong one’: Dutton Dutton is again challenged to see if there’s room to negotiation, but it seems he’s leaving no room to negotiate at all in this interview – it’s the Coalition’s way or no way at all. On taxation, on economic policy is all wrong. This is the problem. Governments have to deal with events as they come along. Labor’s instinct on the economy and on the budget is always the wrong one. Dutton on his answer to filling the gap should stage-three tax cuts go through Dutton: If you look at even post lockdowns on a month by month basis, you can see months where we’ve gone back into surplus, so the settings we have in government, our instinct as Liberals, as a Coalition when it comes to budget management are vindicated. When you look at where we are with a 50-year low unemployment, when you look at the strength of the underlying indicators here in Australia, that is a very significant contrast to where the UK or US budget is, and this government inherited a very strong position after nine years of Coalition management. PM needs to ‘honour his commitment’ to Australians: Dutton Speers asks Dutton about whether he would provide any support to pare back the stage-three tax cuts. Dutton: David, we went to the last election with a promise and I’m not in the business of breaking promises. The prime minister can contemplate it. He looked the Australian public in the eye and it seems he wasn’t so genuine and that he was prepared to make that statement. Speers tries to knock Dutton off his messaging and pin him down to an answer by asking whether, if the tax cuts were pared back, the Coalition would see it all returned. Dutton: I want to see the prime minister honour his commitment and not lie to the Australian people. Opposition leader Peter Dutton is speaking on ABC Insiders now answering questions on the subject of – you guessed it – stage-three tax cuts. Dutton is working hard to reframe the debate not one about the future of the stage-three tax cuts or how much funding for services may be lost and about whether Australians can trust Anthony Albanese. What we’ve seen this week is a real split between the prime minister and treasurer and the treasurer has demonstrated his inexperience. He is obviously close to Wayne Swan and studied Paul Keating very closely. He has been out there purring a particular argument and the prime minister I think sensibly has abandoned that. He might be instinctive to abandon, but this is not about tax cuts, but whether you can trust Anthony Albanese and the Labor party […] I think most Australians would be astounded that Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of betraying them or may do in the next budget or the one after. Growing number of Australians want stage-three tax cuts scrapped, poll shows Public support for the stage-three tax cuts continues to fall, with polling showing increased support for scrapping the $243bn plan. The last stage of the Morrison government tax reform is not legislated to come into effect until July 2024, but a downturn in the economy has put increased pressure on the Labor government to make a decision on whether it will keep the cuts in place. The Australia Institute’s most recent poll, conducted between 4-7 October, found support for repealing the stage three cuts jumped 7% from the previous month. Support for repealing the tax cuts now sits at 48%, with those opposed to the move unchanged at 22%. Those who were unsure or didn’t know about the tax cuts had fallen from 37% to 30%. For more on the results of this poll read the full story by Guardian Australia’s political reporter Amy Remeikis. The ABC is now also reporting that it is highly unlikely that the Albanese government will change the stage-three tax cuts in this month’s budget. The government had always maintained that its position had not changed – but the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had allowed a debate to run in public about whether changes might be needed. The ABC Insiders host, David Speers, reported today that no final decision had been made but he had been told it was now highly unlikely there would be any change, “at least not the budget to be delivered in just over two weeks”. Sky News had a similar report this morning. We are chasing confirmation but the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is likely to speak in Western Australia later today. ABC Insiders host David Speers has opened his program saying the government is “highly unlikely” to abandon the stage-three tax cuts in the upcoming budget. After a week of intense debate, it now looks like the stage-three tax cuts will remain untouched – for now, anyway. This morning I can reveal the prime minister is likely to stick with his promise and keep the tax cuts in this month’s budget. This is the same talking point that’s been repeated across multiple media outlets this morning – suggesting someone has been busy. Scrapping stage-three tax cuts would be a ‘war on aspiration’: Angus Taylor The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has welcomed a Sky News report today that the government is unlikely to unveil changes to the stage-three tax cuts in this month’s budget – but has called on the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to confirm this. (The government has allowed this debate to run the past week, but it has never been a sure thing that such changes would be made in this budget, given that there is still a while under the tax cuts are due to come into effect.) Appearing on Sky News, Taylor said scrapping stage-three tax cuts would be a “war on aspiration”. Taylor welcomed the report that such changes were unlikely in this budget was encouraging – but said it “doesn’t count” until Albanese stands up in public and rules it out: It’s very clear it’s in Labor’s DNA to tax Australians more. ‘No plans’ to change stage-three tax cuts: King Resources minister, Madeleine King, has reiterated that the government has “no plans” to change the stage-three tax cuts. She stuck closely to the government line in her Sky News interview, noting that the tax cuts were already legislated. But she said there was a “conversation going in the community” and it was “OK to have an open conversation” about tax and budget issues. Government prepared to intervene if gas prices don’t come down The resources minister, Madeleine King, has put gas producers on notice that she is prepared to intervene if gas prices don’t come down. King last month announced a deal with the three major gas exporters on the east coast aiming to ensure sufficient supplies of the fossil fuel are available to avoid a potential shortfall next year. During an interview with Sky News broadcast this morning, King was asked about the effect on prices. She said gas prices would “continue to fluctuate” but the gas agreement should deliver “downward pressure” on prices. King said if prices did not come down “there will be more for the government to do in that regard”: If they fail to do that, the government always has other levers. More broadly, the resources minister denied she working at cross purposes to Chris Bowen, the climate minister: Not at all – we’re working together to the same ends. King said the previous government “probably did” have too many fossil fuel subsidies. She said of new coal and gas fields: If they’re not financially able to stand on their own two feet, there shouldn’t be government injection of cash into them – that does not make sense, especially in these constrained times. And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. New South Wales state emergency service have carried out 21 rescues and responded to more than 343 calls for help overnight as residents in some parts of the state have woken up to evacuation orders. Rising flood waters have forced residents in Gronos Point and western Plane Tourist Park in Dubbo to be evacuated with Australia Defence Force personnel are on standby. Speculation over the fate of the stage-three tax cuts continues ahead of the 25 October budget as the Labor government tests the waters on whether to carry them through. Faced with the prospect to carry them through in full, pare them back or scrap them entirely it is expected the government will make its position known ahead of the budget. I’m Royce Kurmelovs, taking the blog through the day.

Based in a region with virtually no access to fresh water, it is going to rely on desalination – the practice of debrining saltwater so it is drinkable. It seems like an elegant solution – but the problem is that desalination, which is projected to boom by 37% across the Gulf region in the next five years, has huge environmental costs, in terms of the fossils fuels used to carry out the process, and the marine environment. But without it, how can the arid region possibly quench its thirst? Forty-three per cent of the world’s desalination capacity comes from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Despite the scarcity of water, the GCC are among the highest consumers of it in the world, and heavily dependent on desalination plants. The United Arab Emirates has one of the highest per capita water consumption rates in the world, with people using roughly 500 litres a day – 50% above the global average. Yet many GCC countries such as the UAE are still keen to promote water-rich lifestyles through desalination efforts. Manicured lawns and waterparks are commonplace across cities, and at the Dubai fountain show, every half hour throughout the day more than 83,000 litres of water shoot up as high as a 50-storey building. But with populations rising, the region’s water industry is facing increasing pressure. “These plants essentially have rivers running through them. If you look at the desalination capacity across the GCC as a whole, the volume of water flowing through that is about four times the amount of water flowing down the Thames,” says Will Le Quesne, the Middle East programme director for the UK Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. Maryam Rashed Al Shehhi, an assistant professor of civil infrastructure and environmental engineering at Khalifa University in the UAE, says: “Desalination is our main source of fresh water. It’s a very arid region, and annual rainfall has decreased. So it’s very scary to think about any other sources of water.” Since the 1950s the GCC have been at the vanguard of desalination. The southern coasts of the Gulf are dotted with more than 300 desalination plants – mostly in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain. Powering the world’s greatest concentration of desalination requires a significant amount of energy. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, makes up a fifth of the world’s output, with roughly 30 desalination plants burning through 300,000 barrels of crude oil a day. In fact, most desalination plants are oil or gas powered, operating with either thermal processing technology, which collects steam from boiling water and condenses it, or the more modern reverse osmosis technology, which relies heavily on electricity produced using natural gas to power pumps that force water through very fine membranes, essentially straining out the salts in the water. “Either way, you need quite a lot of energy. That can be derived from a lot of sources including by burning fossil fuels,” says Le Quesne. So although Qatar maintains the World Cup will be carbon-neutral, climate organisations are already expressing doubts. The water demands alone are eye-watering. The tournament will need to manage pitches across eight stadiums, and more than 130 additional training grounds. The delicate and complicated process of creating the right turf for football in the Qatar climate just as the weather begins to cool means the groundsmen have to mimic winter, expert Haitham Al Shareef told Reuters, blowing chilled air over the grass and watering the pitch with at least 10,000 litres of desalinated water. And for emergencies, “a 425,000 sq metre reserve of grass – some 40 soccer pitches worth – is growing at a farm north of Doha”. The water consumption of that patch is not recorded. And despite national commitments to reducing carbon emissions and meeting net zero targets, the region is expecting to do more desalination, not less, with capacity planned to expand 37% by 2027. This could be devastating for the Gulf’s marine ecosystem, says Le Quesne. Desalination is one of the worst marine pollution drivers around the world, producing brine, a highly saline waste fluid usually released into the sea as saltier, toxic and warmer seawater. It can contain chemicals such as chlorine, heavy metals, and anti-foaming agents that are added during the desalination process, which can harm coral reefs and smaller marine organisms that live on the seabed. Along with water, smaller organisms also risk getting sucked into the system and can get impinged, crashing into the screens of the intake pipes, or entrained, travelling with water reaching the plant, resulting in severe injury and death. “The microscopic plants of the sea, things like fish eggs, will all get drawn into the system and experience very high levels of mortality. Most of them are typically destroyed on their way through the system,” says Le Quesne. With growing environmental concerns, GCC countries including the UAE and Oman are exploring methods involving solar energy. By far the most ambitious plan is Saudi Arabia’s solar dome, the world’s first zero-brine discharge desalination plant. Announced in 2020, the project is now being prototyped as part of Neom, the outlandish $500bn (£447bn) planned megacity. Partnering with a London-based company, Solar Water, the 20-metre high dome made from glass and steel is proposed to be surrounded by mirrors that will collect sunlight to heat up the seawater, condense it in a separate chamber, and distill it into fresh water. “The dome itself will be illuminated by this strong sunlight. It’ll look like a sparkling jewel in the desert,” says Christopher Sansom, a professor of concentrating solar power at the University of Derby and a director at Solar Water. But although the solar dome will, the designers say, be cheaper to build and operate than conventional plants, it will also produce significantly less water. Though Saudi Arabia has no shortage of sunlight, solar-powered desalination can have its limitations, says Sansom. Any interference with clouds or wind can stop the power from being generated. Dust is another factor that can hinder the technology. In a desert environment such as Saudi Arabia, solar panels need to be wiped clean. While promising, Al Shehhi says desalination plants running completely with solar energy is not yet practical and more research is needed into implementing more renewable energy into the desalination process. “It’s a challenge. The amount of water pumped every day from the Gulf to be desalinated is huge,” she says. And that is before a World Cup is added into the equation. • This article was amended on 10 October 2022. An earlier version referred incorrectly to “144 pitches across eight stadiums”. The headline was also changed to more accurately reflect that the Qatar World Cup is part of the water strain issues affecting the Gulf region, rather than the sole cause of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/oct/07/australia-news-live-economy-stage-3-tax-cuts-budget-jim-chalmers-floods-rain-nsw-greens-carbon-credits-offsets","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Flood warnings for eastern states as Melbourne receives half a month’s rainfall in one hour – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/oct/07/australia-news-live-economy-stage-3-tax-cuts-budget-jim-chalmers-floods-rain-nsw-greens-carbon-credits-offsets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/oct/07/australia-news-live-economy-stage-3-tax-cuts-budget-jim-chalmers-floods-rain-nsw-greens-carbon-credits-offsets","fields":{"headline":"Flood warnings for eastern states as Melbourne receives half a month’s rainfall in one hour – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And with that, we are going to put the blog to bed.

I have an update on today’s shark attack from AAP: A man’s arm was almost severed when he was attacked by a shark while spearfishing off the Pilbara coast in Western Australia. Paramedics were called to Port Hedland on Friday to treat the man aged in his 30s, who sustained serious injuries. He was taken to shore by boat and an ambulance rushed him to Hedland Health Campus under priority one conditions. Fisheries officials said the man had been bitten after spearing a fish, but the species of the shark was unknown. A Royal Flying Doctor Service spokeswoman said the man had sustained multiple injuries and his left arm had “nearly been severed”. A crew will be dispatched from Meekatharra to collect the man in Port Hedland. He is expected to arrive in Perth for treatment on Friday evening. The WA Country Health Service said the man was in a stable condition at the Hedland hospital. NT bans use of ‘inhumane and dangerous’ spithoods on youths in police custody From AAP: The announcement on Friday has divided opinion while bringing the NT into line with other Australian jurisdictions. NT minister for police Kate Worden said the hoods would continue to be used on adults in watchhouses when required and police would adopt a safer version of the device. The NT Council of Social Services said it was a step in the right direction but the change needed to be legislated for children and adults. “It is an inhumane and dangerous practice,” chief executive Deborah Di Natale said. The Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory agreed the ban needed to be legislated and said it should be extended to cover people in custody and detention. “There is no place for the use of spithoods in a modern justice and corrections system, full stop,” chief executive John Paterson said. Opposition leader Lia Finocchiaro said the ban would lead to more police being spat on while on duty. “It is a dark day for our police and another win for the lobby groups and criminals,” she said. Walkley Foundation appoints counsel to advise on award for Andrew Laming story The Walkley Foundation has appointed William Houghton KC to provide independent legal advice about the status of the 2021 Walkley award for TV news which was awarded to Channel Nine journalists Peter Fegan and Rebeka Powell. The story, about the former MP Andrew Laming, has been the subject of legal action by the ex-Liberal/National politician, who has reached a confidential settlement in a defamation case he brought against Nine over a broadcast in March last year. Nine Entertainment agreed to pay Laming an undisclosed amount and apologise for the story on Nine News Queensland which falsely accused him of taking an “upskirting” photograph of a woman while she was on her knees stacking a bar fridge. “The Walkley Foundation considers that there are particular circumstances to be considered in respect of this award and subsequent litigation concerning one of the reports. Interested parties in relation to this particular award have been invited to provide materials in respect of whether the award should be revoked, annulled or there should be some other outcome,” it said in a statement on Friday. Money from fuel subsidies could be used to install more than 72,000 electric vehicle charging stations, Climate Council says From AAP: With the federal budget two weeks away, the Climate Council is calling on the Albanese government to replace $11.6 billion spent on fossil fuel subsidies with “structural” environmentally friendly investments that could lower costs for households. In a report released on Friday, the Climate Council says the government could use money from fuel subsidies to install more than 72,000 electric vehicle charging stations – one for every 12 kilometres of road – or install solar panels to power 1.5 million low-income households. Climate Council advocacy head Dr Jennifer Rayner said the organisation based its figures on fossil fuel subsidies paid in the 2021-2022 financial year and five projects it considered “better bets”. In addition to solar panels and EV charging stations, Dr Rayner said the funds could be used to replace all diesel buses in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, create 138 renewable energy storage facilities similar to Victoria’s Big Battery in Geelong, or fund another 15 pumped hydro projects to shore up the energy grid. Dr Rayner said each of the projects was environmentally friendly and some would offer cost savings to households under financial pressure. “If we’re giving solar panels to lower-income families, that’s going to help with their bills and reduce the cost of living,” she said. “This is an opportunity to make big structural changes.” Richard Marles: Australia’s focus is on delivering ‘current contribution’ of military supplies to Ukraine The Albanese government says it is considering further ways to support to Ukraine “over the long term” but its current focus is on delivering the military supplies it has already promised. Guardian Australia understands an announcement about another round of defence support is not imminent. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told the Lowy Institute last night he was “very grateful” that Australia was preparing “a significant package” that would include “not only small arms but some heavy weapons as well”. When asked today about the issue, a spokesperson for the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said: Whilst Ukraine is a long way from Australia, we are committed to protecting the rules-based order. At the moment the Australian government is committed to delivering on its current contribution to Ukraine, including 60 Bushmasters and 28 M113AS4s Armoured Vehicles. Work across government is continuing to look at how Australia can best provide support to Ukraine over the long term. It is understood the majority of the promised Bushmasters have arrived in Ukraine, but officials are not revealing the exact numbers for operational security reasons and some of them have not reached the country yet. Deliveries of the other armoured vehicles are also ongoing. The opposition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said lives depended on the assistance arriving quickly: Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a bloody and brutal reminder of the threats to peace and prosperity posed by desperate authoritarian regimes like Russia ... In government, we responded quickly and strongly to Ukraine’s requests for assistance – Mr Marles has for some time foreshadowed additional assistance for Ukraine, what is holding up this assistance? This government and Mr Marles must confirm today what this assistance will look like and when it will be delivered – lives depend on it. AAP reports some suburbs received 30 millimetres of rain in as little as 20 minutes on Friday. As of 4.30pm, authorities were concerned about two dams in Craigieburn in the city’s north, with fears a large private dam could collapse and affect local roads. There were also moderate flood warnings for the Murray River downstream of the Hume Dam in the state’s north and the Loddon River at Laanecoorie, near Bendigo. Authorities are bracing for major flooding on Saturday along the Avoca River at Charleton, north-west of Bendigo. The Friday deluge followed a night of wild weather, with the SES receiving more than 600 calls for help in 24 hours. The Avoca and Maryborough areas in regional Victoria received 50 to 65mm in an hour, which is roughly one month’s worth of rain. Areas around Frankston, Bayside, Woodend and the Maryborough district were also hard-hit. Kyle Sandilands apologises for slurs Radio announcer Kyle Sandilands and radio network ARN have apologised for comments made by the presenter on his leading FM breakfast program, which included the slur “spazzes”. “ARN does not endorse or condone the comments made by Kyle Sandilands, nor the language that was used or the context with which it was spoken during a segment broadcast on Thursday 29th September,” the network said on Friday. Campers in for a wet weekend at Bathurst 1000 Campers at the Bathurst 1000 are bracing for muddy, stormy and potentially dangerous conditions as a large rain band crosses central and eastern NSW, AAP has reported. A trough and cold front moved across the state on Friday, bringing further widespread rain to the eastern half of NSW, including the western slopes and ranges, central NSW and the south coast. The weather bureau has placed many eastern catchments on flood watch, including Hunter and the Greater Sydney regions, as it waits to see exactly where the most intense rainfall occurs. “Behind the rain band, there is a lot of convection which means we’re getting some really decent thunderstorms,” a bureau spokesperson told AAP on Friday. Up to 100mm of rain could fall at motorsport mecca Mount Panorama over the weekend, potentially leading to flooding along the Macquarie River in Bathurst. Man fined for destroying trees on NT sacred site A NT court has fined a man $32,000 after he backed his truck into dozens of trees in a sacred site as part of road works in remote Arnhem Land. On September 10, 2020, William Hayes was working near Mount Catt as part of his company Hayes Enterprises (NT) Pty Ltd when he drove a front-end loader onto Aboriginal Land Trust land and knocked down more than 60 trees inside a sacred ceremonial site. Hayes pleaded guilty to conducting the works without approval under the NT Aboriginal Sacred Sites legislation. Dr Sophie Creighton, A/CEO of the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA) said landholders can not “recklessly” clear country. “The immense suffering and harm done here could have been avoided. Pastoralists need to listen, and to work with custodians to protect these cultural places of national significance.” Senior custodian Kenny Murray said in the statement by AAPA that he welcomed the conviction but the damage is irreparable. The site is a culturally sacred ceremonial ground for the Gunapipi peoples and holds special meaning for many people connected across Arnhem Land. “The damage that has been done to our trees, it is like physical harm to our family because the spirits of our elders are in those trees,” Murray said. Not sated by his tilt at AGL (see earlier post), Mike Cannon-Brookes has added another renewable-energy feather to his hat (or is it baseball cap?). Already a “cornerstone” investor in Sun Cable, the company planning to build giant solar farms in the desert to power Darwin and Singapore (and possibly Indonesia) via a giant cable, MCB has now taken on the role of a director and inaugural chair. Sun Cable’s projects could be worth as much as $30bn, and investors such as MCB have already agreed to tip in at least $210m. Not just whimsy, in other words. “Mike is a visionary leader whose demonstrated passion and commitment for the energy transition strongly aligns with Sun Cable’s mission,” said David Griffin, founder and CEO of Sun Cable. MCB is similarly upbeat as you might expect, referring to the main PowerLink project as “world-scale infrastructure”. “It will unlock incredible value for all countries involved, work to decarbonise three major economies and transform how giga-scale solar energy gets built,” he said. Just over a week after AGL announced it was bowing to demands from investors by bringing forward the closure date of its coal-fired power station in Victoria, another battle is brewing with the company’s biggest shareholder Mike Cannon-Brookes. The Atlassian billionaire has amassed an 11.3% stake in Australia’s largest electricity generator and last month issued through his family company, Grok Ventures, a list of the four directors he wanted added to AGL’s board. Since the board has five members now (surprisingly few for a firm so big), accepting MCB’s Fab Four potentially would have given him control. One of the current five, Miles George, is seen as particularly renewables friendly for this past role as head of Infigen Energy, a windfarm operator. Anyway, AGL has rejected that three of the proposed members, telling shareholders today it would only recommend Mark Twidell, a solar veteran whose roles have included a stint with Tesla, for the board. Adding all four “would not add to the overall effectiveness of the board”, it said. Since the board can only have a maximum of ten members, taking on all of MCB’s picks could also limit AGL’s ability to lure talent with “priority skills”, AGL said. Those overlooked are Kerry Schott, the industry veteran who until recently chaired the Energy Security Board, as well as John Pollaers and Christine Holman. Not surprisingly, Grok isn’t impressed and plans to engage “directly” with AGL’s 150,000 shareholders in the lead up to its 15 November Annual General Meeting “to explain the merits of looking to fresh faces to provide a broader mix of skills and experience - as well as additional capabilities to undertake the monumental amount of work required by the board”. “It makes no sense to us – or a growing list of shareholders – that the board is rejecting highly qualified, independent directors who are committed to helping them make AGL the leading green gentailer in the world,” Grok said. Somewhat ominously, Grok said the rejection was “yet another poor decision that doesn’t seem to be rooted in logical business decisions and certainly ignores the threats and opportunities facing AGL”, adding to previous comments that it had “reservations” about the appointment of Patricia McKenzie as AGL’s chair. AGL’s share price, meanwhile, was down almost 3% for the day in late trading compared with a 0.5% decline in the benchmark ASX200 index. I have a bit more information for you on the shark attack in WA here: Guardian Photographer Ellen Smith was just down at Dights Falls in Melbourne and, oh boy, look at these pics! Australian athlete Georgia O’Callaghan was down there too, having some serious fun: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has left the door open to potentially amending the already legislated stage-three tax cuts, not expressly ruling out making any changes when asked point-blank if reforms could be considered. Treasurer Jim Chalmers also said his upcoming federal budget would be about “following the responsible path; not the path of least resistance”, as the Coalition braces for a fight if the government looks to tinker with the Morrison-era tax changes. Albanese has kept a low media profile this week as debate raged publicly and privately inside the government on the $244 billion stage-three changes, which will go to taxpayers earning over $45,000 but will overwhelmingly benefit those on higher incomes. After just one solitary radio interview since last Friday (when he was asked about cricket and Midnight Oil, not the news), Albanese told a brief press conference that the government’s view hasn’t changed. “There’s been meetings, obviously, this week about [the expenditure review committee] and our processes. We’ll continue to get on with making sure that we deliver a budget that is responsible, that acknowledges the pressures that are on it,” Albanese said, when asked about the tax debate. When asked if he would guarantee no changes to the stage-three tax cuts, the PM responded: “what I have said is that the Government has not changed our position.” He did not rule out making changes in future. In a speech in Brisbane, Chalmers said the government would “have to make some difficult decisions with this budget. Difficult decisions for difficult times.” He didn’t speak specifically about tax cuts, but said the government would make “the right calls for the right reasons... We must be serious about rebuilding our budget buffers – particularly given the deteriorating global outlook.” There are concerns a private dam in Melbourne may burst, with the road currently closed between Greenvale and Craigieburn. The Department of Transport’s Chris Miller told 3AW that the SES and police were on the scene. “The concern is that the bank will actually burst and obviously if that gives way, huge amounts of water will come out,” he said. Unconfirmed reports of shark attack in WA Emergency services are attending to an incident at Port Hedland, in Western Australia, that has been reported - although not confirmed – to involve a shark. Details are scant at this stage but emergency services confirmed to Guardian Australia that the person involved is alive. Multiple agencies are on the scene. Experts from WA’s Department of Primary Industries are investigating the incident and if it is confirmed to be shark-related, will issue a “shark watch” alert as soon as possible. Victorian emergency services received 600 requests for assistance A member of the Victorian SES (who was not introduced by name) has said they have received 600 requests for assistance: With that rainfall that we’ve seen in the storms overnight, SES volunteers and our emergency services have now responded to over 600 requests for assistance. Some of the busiest areas for that has been around Frankston and the bayside suburbs, also across Woodend and the Maryborough districts. Over 330 of those have related to flash flooding impacts or leaking roofs and the like. We had over 120 requests for assistance representing to building damage associated with some of the damaging winds with those storms and thunderstorms and we have seen a further 100 requests for assistance for trees down. He says they have seen people drive through floodwaters: We know the single largest death or cause of death in flooding is people attempting to drive through floodwaters. In the last 24 hours, we have seen 15 people attempt to drive through floodwaters both here in metropolitan areas and also in the areas of Maryborough… and the like. Again, we can’t appeal enough to people that driving through floodwaters could be the last decision you make. We are just heading to Victoria where authorities are giving an update about the weather Hello everyone this is Cait Kelly, before we get going – a big thank you to Natasha for her great work this morning taking us through all of the headlines. First up, I have this important story from Lisa Cox: I leave you now in the very excellent hands of Cait Kelly, so I can watch Fat Bear Week’s livestream unfettered by political pressers. Huge lineup of contenders for Fat Bear Week In exactly the news Australians needed following those grim economic predictions from the treasurer, Fat Bear Week is under way with the lineup of contenders confirmed. Each year, Alaska’s Katmai National Park celebrates how well its brown bears have packed on the weight ahead of winter hibernation, with fans invited to vote for which bear “is the fattest of the fat”. I will be backing Bear 164, a small adult male because I can’t resist an underdog – or underbear as the case may be. Katmai National Park says that, “instead of competing for established fishing spots like most bears, 164 invented his own”. You can check out who the contenders and find out a bit about each bear’s biography here, and see them in action hunting and catching pink salmon around Brooks River and Falls thanks to the park’s live stream. Treasurer announces series of investor roundtables, starting with social and affordable housing The treasurer Jim Chalmers is delivering that speech which Guardian Australia’s chief political correspondent, Sarah Martin, previewed on the blog earlier this morning. Further to outlining the five biggest pressures on the budget (interest payments on servicing government debt, aged care, disability care, hospitals and defence) he has also announced the government will host a series of investor roundtables. Today, I can announce that the government will host a series of investor roundtables from November 2022 to September 2023. Each one – held every three to four months – will focus on a different area of national priority investment. The first, in November, will address social and affordable housing. To make sure our conversations are targeted, productive and have a degree of continuity, the roundtables will have twenty core participants. They include the CEOs of our big four banks, along with the heads of some of our largest superannuation and investment funds. Participants in the roundtables represent institutional investors, including super funds, with over $2 trillion in assets under management. And all participants have the smarts, insight, and diverse range of experiences, to make these roundtables a success. Cars skidding off wet track as Bathurst 1000 goes ahead despite flooding The Bathurst 1000 supercars event is going ahead today despite the town in central west NSW being one of the worst affected by flooding from the intense weather system moving across the east of the country. Up to 100mm of rain could fall at Mount Panorama over the weekend, potentially leading to flooding along the Macquarie River in Bathurst. Event organisers released a statement yesterday saying the event would go ahead as normal despite conditions. Today, footage from the event shows cars sliding off a very wet track. - with AAP Despite speculation the government could be considering scrapping the stage-three tax cuts in its upcoming October budget, Albanese and Chalmers, in respective press conferences in Sydney and Brisbane, say the government hasn’t changed its position. Just circling back to Albanese’s presser, here’s what the prime minister had to say. Reporter: The Opposition has accused you of going missing on the issue of tax cuts this week. Could you clarify once and for all whether you plan on seeking to amend the stage-three tax cuts? Albanese: The Government hasn’t changed our position … and I’ve been out and about this week. This weekend, I’ll be in Western Australia. I’m here in western Sydney today. It appears that the Opposition haven’t got quite the memo. They’re still looking for areas of disagreement, of playing the old politics. What we’ve been about is development, there’s been meetings obviously this week about ERC and our processes. We’ll continue to get on with making sure that we deliver a budget that is responsible, that acknowledges the pressures that are on. Reporter: Is that a guarantee there will be no changes to the stage-three tax cuts? Albanese: That is exactly what I have said is that the Government has not changed our position. Football Australia has handed a life ban to a second Sydney United 58 fan who was caught performing “a fascist salute or similar gesture” during their Australia Cup final loss to Macarthur FC last Saturday night. National Premier Leagues NSW side United were the first second-tier outfit to reach the knockout competition’s decider, but the achievement was overshadowed by the behaviour of a section of supporters, who performed Nazi salutes and chanted songs with fascist links. Some also booed through the Welcome to Country. It comes two days after FA gave a life ban to another fan for the same offence. Both are now banned from attending any matches sanctioned by FA, including NPL, A-Leagues, Australia Cup and national team matches. “The ban is effective immediately,” the governing body said in a statement. “As with the first ban issued by Football Australia on Wednesday, the conduct in question relates to a fascist salute or similar gesture conducted during the match and captured on the host broadcast.” FA also expects to receive submissions from United on Friday in relation to a show-cause notice issued because of crowd behaviour during the Cup final. It’s official - the Covid pandemic is ending in Victoria. Kind of. Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, on Friday has confirmed the state’s pandemic declaration will end at 11.59pm on 12 October. This is in line with national cabinet’s decision to end Covid-19 isolation from October 14. Andrews said in a statement: Victorians have done an amazing job over the last three years – and this new framework will give people the choice to do what is right for them and their community following the unanimous decision taken at national cabinet. We’re making sure there are still requirements in place to protect our dedicated healthcare workers and vulnerable Victorians in high-risk settings like aged care, disability settings and hospitals Victorians will no longer be required to isolate after testing positive to Covid-19 but isolation is strongly recommended. Some healthcare workers, aged care and disability care workers will continue to be required to isolate if they test positive to Covid-19 and will be financially supported by the government to do so. The department of health will also issue directions to ensure healthcare workers are vaccinated against Covid-19. These directions – which are already used each year to require healthcare staff to be vaccinated against the flu – will allow for vaccination requirements in public, denominational and private hospitals, as well as public sector aged care facilities, day procedure centres and throughout ambulance service. Powers also exist under OH&amp;S laws to require vaccinations for people in workplaces. ‘We don’t need more development on flood plains’: Albanese We’re going back to Albanese in Sydney where the prime minister is holding a media conference after delivering his speech. He’s fielded a question about the Warragamba Dam. Reporter: Premier Perrottet said that he wants to raise it and says that it is a critical state infrastructure project. Do you consider that a waste of money if developments don’t start in the first place? Albanese: Quite clearly, we don’t need more development on the flood plains or indeed, in flood plains in general. It makes no sense to do that. With regard to an economic case, that needs to be made. Melbourne rain leaves two people stranded on car roof We’ve been bringing you news about the wild weather lashing the east of the state. In Melbourne, flash flooding has left two people stranded on the roof of their car under the York Street bridge in South Melbourne. Treasurer thanks retiring APRA chair on behalf of government and community And on Wayne Byres stepping down as chair of the Australian regulation prudential authority (APRA), Chalmers said: I’ve had the opportunity this morning to meet with Wayne Byres, the outgoing chair of the Australian regulation prudential authority. I had the opportunity to thank Wayne for a remarkably long period of dedicated service to the nation as chair of APRA and before that as well. That’s not an easy job, being the chair of APRA, given what the financial system has been through the last couple of decades. But he’s done a really quite remarkable job. We’re very grateful to Wayne Byres for the contribution that he has made over a long period of time now. He’s been supported and appointed by governments of both political persuasion, and he’s decided to move on and to do other things. I really wish him well. And I’m glad I got the opportunity today to thank him. On behalf of myself, but on behalf of the government and on behalf of the broader Australian community as well, for all of that effort and all of that dedication and diligence that he has provided regulating our financial system. ‘Every Australian heart goes out to the parents’ in Thailand: Treasurer I mentioned in that first post Chalmers had paid tribute to the shooting and stabbing in Thailand. These were his words: Can I say about that horrific tragedy in Thailand, how heartbreaking, how heart-wrenching it is to think all of those little kids dropped off at childcare that day who won’t be going home - I think that every Australian heart goes out to the parents, the families and the communities impacted by what is really an unspeakable and unfathomable tragedy. And I know that that community and those families will be going through a horrific time as they contemplate the loss, the thieving of those little souls, and what that means for those who’ve survived it. Treasurer says government hasn’t changed its position on stage-three tax cuts Chalmers is asked: Can you categorically state you may scale back or change those stage-three tax cuts? Treasurer: I’ve been clear throughout the course of the week. We haven’t changed our position on those tax cuts. What I’ve tried to do is to level with the Australian people about the complex combination of challenges that we confront as we put the finishing touches on the budget. And no responsible government can ignore the fact that the risks to the global economy are rising rather than decreasing, the pressures on the budget in a persistent structural way are growing rather than dissipating, and the pressure on household budgets from interest rates is putting on more, not less, pressure. Treasurer says the ‘world economy is a dangerous place right now’ The treasurer Jim Chalmers has begun speaking in Brisbane at an investor event. He begins his speech acknowledging the tragedy in Thailand and thanks Wayne Byres as he steps down as chair of the Australian regulation prudential authority. He moves onto saying there have been “two important developments overnight” as the government finalises its budget to be delivered later this month. Overnight, the IMF managing director has pointed out that the risks of a global recession are intensifying. She has warned against the ongoing damage that would be done by a prolonged recession around the world. We share the IMF managing director’s concerns about the deteriorating global economy. The global economy has deteriorated significantly even over the course of the last few weeks. And that’s been reflected in the increasingly concerned and concerning commentary from the IMF managing director overnight. The world economy is a dangerous place right now. The storm clouds are gathering in the global economy. And no response government could ignore that as they finalise a budget. This morning as well, the Reserve Bank has put out their financial stability report and, in doing so, they have made what I think is an obvious point - and that is that the higher interest rates go, the more they will sting ordinary Australians. Some Australians have a buffer in their personal finances, but many don’t. And so, six consecutive interest rate rises in six months - which began before the election and continued after the election in expected-but-still-difficult ways will, and is, having an impact on the finances of ordinary Australians. The backdrop for the budget that I hand down in less than three weeks’ time will be high inflation and rising interest rates, a deteriorating global economy, and persistent structural pressures on the budget which will not be compensated for by higher commodity prices. And in this environment of high and rising inflation, difficult global economic conditions, and persistent spending pressures, we will put a premium on what is responsible and affordable and sustainable, and best targeted to this complex combination of economic conditions that we confront. Albanese said he was approaching the upcoming budget “responsibly and methodically” and was willing to make difficult decisions that take into account global and domestic challenges. He said: Our priority is an economy that works for people, not the other way around and this is why my colleagues and I are approaching the upcoming budget responsibly and methodically, taking full account of the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook and recognising the long-term fiscal pressures of funding vital programs... as well as the growing costs of servicing a record national debt, when interest rates are rising. We will make sure we do what we can to help families with their cost of living in a way that doesn’t push up inflation or add pressure to demand. We are prepared to make difficult decisions, to get Australia through hard times and to ensure our fiscal policy provides a sustainable path forward in the immediate circumstances, as well as the longer term. There were 2,720 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and three people are in intensive care. There were 7,970 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and two people are in intensive care. PM backs moving SBS to western Sydney The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has thrown his support behind moving multicultural broadcaster SBS to western Sydney in a speech at Accor Stadium on Friday. He said the feasibility study on the move commissioned by the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, would first have to be completed. Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue, he said: We’ll wait and see what the study says but it certainly makes sense for such a fast-growing, multicultural community to be the home of the broadcaster that celebrates and serves Australia’s diversity. It would be an important cultural investment in western Sydney. Migration is about more than skills shortage, prime minister says Albanese says people in western Sydney “instinctively” understand reforming migration is about more than solving skills shortages; it’s about helping people put down roots. Albanese said New Zealand and Australia both closed their borders during the Covid pandemic. But while our neighbours encouraged migrants to stay with supports, Australia encouraged migrants to leave and then “wondered why there’s skills shortages when we wanted to open up the economy again.” ‘Take the politics out of planning’: Albanese The prime minister has also reiterated the importance of better planning for infrastructure projects in western Sydney, including taking into consideration the risks presented by floods and other natural disasters. Albanese said the development of a western Sydney expert panel would help with this. He said: We need to better plan our infrastructure. We need to take flood and other extreme weather events into account when planning infrastructure investments. To guide future decision making and to take the politics out of planning we will establish a western Sydney expert panel to review and report on western Sydney’s infrastructure needs. There were 536 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and one person is in intensive care. Western Sydney airport more than a third complete Albanese says: Western Sydney is the centre of aspiration in this country and we all benefit from it … but we need to get the planning right. Infrastructure isn’t an end in itself, we don’t build for the sake of it. Albanese then brings these remarks back to western Sydney airport, saying it will bring prosperity to a range of sectors, as well as jobs for the population. He says the project’s progress is tracking well – it’s more than a third complete and on time. Albanese said that the airport will be as important as the advent of Western Sydney University. Anthony Albanese speaking in western Sydney The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is giving a speech at the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue. He says that western Sydney is home to the largest Aboriginal populations in urban Australia and thanks Western Sydney Dialogues for being one of the many organisations backing the constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament. Our constitution is our nation’s birth certificate and it is inadequate. Cyber breaches risk weakening banks: RBA The central bank is warning that significant cyber breaches like the one levelled against Optus have the power to send shock waves through Australia’s financial institutions, AAP is reporting. The Reserve Bank of Australia says the threat of further cyber incidents remains high and has the potential to destabilise the financial system by increased fraud. Financial fraud from stolen data could then undermine confidence in banks and the banking system, the RBA says in a report. The recent Optus breach and other large-scale hacks of personal data highlight the need for regulators and financial institutions to continue strengthening their cyber resilience, it says. In response to the Optus breach, the government is moving to reduce red tape on the sharing of information with banks to allow them to implement better safeguards and monitoring systems. The changes, announced on Thursday, would let the telcos temporarily share key information such as driver’s licence, Medicare and passport numbers with financial service firms. Optus would also be able to share identifiers with Commonwealth, state and territory agencies to prevent fraud. The changes are due to be presented to the governor-general on Friday. RBA report sheds light on future prospects for China and climate Two other quick takeaways from the RBA’s report is some pessimism about China’s prospects - important of course for the price of Australian commodity prices (plus, of course, the livelihoods of 1.4bn people). Despite government efforts, “the property sector remains under considerable stress,” the RBA said. This threatens to expose longstanding vulnerabilities affecting local governments, the shadow banking sector and small banks. And just in case you thought the RBA was worried about the here and now: [C]limate change and extreme weather events have the potential to affect economies and societies on a global scale, and thereby present a systemic challenge for private institutions and policymakers,” it said. “Both physical and transition risks could result in large losses for financial institutions that are yet to put in place adequate risk controls and resilience strategies. On second thoughts, given the storms in Victoria today and the worsening flood situation in NSW, perhaps those concerns are about both the here and the now. What will tighter financial conditions mean? The impact, of course, would worsen, along with interest rates. Were the cash rate to increase by another 100bp (as indeed investors are now betting), the share of households forking out at least 30% to repay their mortgage would rise to about one in four, the RBA says. For now, there’s a similar tale of businesses coping with higher rates ... although the construction sector is among those doing it tougher (as indicated by that earlier post about a record rise in material costs). An indication, though, that the squeeze is yet to trigger much of a rise in bankruptcies is that banks have been reducing the amount they are setting aside for bad debt. As for those global conditions, things could “tighten further” the RBA says, not least because of rising inflation, slowing growth, “heightened geopolitical tensions” – and so on. Should that tightening happen, there’s the potential for increased financial stability risks, “including the potential for a disorderly decline in asset prices and for high leverage and liquidity mismatches in some investment funds to amplify strains in global funding markets”. (There’s even one mention of troubled Swiss investment bank, Credit Suisse, which the RBA notes is facing investors wanting more protection against a possible default.) Of course, most Australians are focussed on the home front, and what the RBA thinks about household pain as interest rates rise. For context, they provide this handy chart, which shows where real estate prices are falling - and where they aren’t, yet. Households, companies and banks are generally in a “a strong financial position” as they enter “this more challenging environment”. But resilience is “unevenly distributed”, as you’d expect. The Covid lockdown period allowed some folks to save a lot more and make early payments on their mortgages. About a quarter, though, have little buffer at all. The RBA said: A small number of borrowers have both high debt relative to their income and low saving and equity buffers; these households are particularly vulnerable to shocks. The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting up to 25mm of rain to fall across Melbourne today, with flood warnings issued in parts of Victoria. You can check the warnings here: Rescuers try to free whales caught in QLD shark nets Rescuers are attempting to free two humpback whales entangled in a shark net off a Sunshine Coast beach, AAP has reported. The whales - reportedly a mother and her calf - became trapped in the same net as they made their annual migration south. Humane Society International marine biologist Lawrence Chlebeck said the current migration season had involved about double the number of entanglements seen in previous years. “A mother and calf in the same net, stressed and tangled, is a worst-case scenario,” he said in a statement on Friday. Animal rights groups have previously warned of increased risk as the migrating humpbacks head south with their newborn calves and want the shark nets removed. “The shark nets must be removed in favour of new technological solutions, already successfully trialled by Queensland and New South Wales governments, that can better reduce the risk of shark bite without endangering migrating humpbacks and killing dolphins and turtles,” Mr Chlebeck said. “There’s a better way.” For everyone not in Melbourne right now, let me tell you – it is very wet: Six new solar farms approved for Victoria Six solar farms to power 300,000 homes across Victoria will be built, as the state pushes on with plans to power all government operations with green energy, AAP reports. Energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said six new solar farms and four big batteries were approved as part of Victoria’s second renewables auction. The projects in Bridgewater, Fulham, Ouyen, Traralgon, Horsham and Glenrowan will generate 1460 gigawatt hours of energy each year, enough to power 300,000 homes. Victoria aims to power its entire public sector infrastructure – including government schools, hospitals and the entire Melbourne train and tram network – with renewable energy by 2025. D’Ambrosio told reporters in Glen Waverley: The projects will also deliver $1.5 billion in investment and will create almost 1000 jobs right across the state. It comes a week after energy giant AGL announced it would close its brown coal-fired Loy Yang power plant by 2035, up to 10 years earlier than planned. NSW Young Liberals express ‘strong disagreement’ with Teena McQueen The criticism of Liberal Party vice president Teena McQueen continues overnight, with word that the NSW Young Liberal council called on her to resign and the party’s executive to take “appropriate action.” McQueen told the CPAC conference that attendees should “rejoice” at the defeat of “lefties” in the party at the last federal election - which has been interpreted to mean celebrating the loss of moderates like Dave Sharma, Tim Wilson and Trent Zimmerman. Sharma and Wilson fired back yesterday, while shadow foreign minister Simon Birmingham said McQueen should resign. We’ve contacted McQueen through the Liberal Party several times for comment but heard nothing back. We’re told the NSW Young Liberals passed the following motion overnight: That the NSW Young Liberals: 1. Express its strong disagreement and disappointment with the comments made by Liberal Federal vice president Teena McQueen’s at the recent CPAC conference. 2. Note that the comments made by Ms McQueen are not representative of the NSW Young Liberals or the NSW division. 3. Remind Ms McQueen that the role of federal executive members is to work towards the election of endorsed Liberal candidates and a Federal Coalition government. 4. Call on Chris Stone and the federal and state executives of the Liberal party to investigate the comments and take appropriate action to prevent any further damage to the party’s reputation and electoral chances. 5. Call on Teena McQueen to resign from her position as federal vice president. MPs asked to weigh into Essendon saga Sky News is asking Hume and McAllister about the Essendon saga. McAllister says she isn’t going to weigh into the matter (unlike the opposition leader – see Josh Butler’s earlier blog post) but she does remark Australia as a nation has been “pretty intolerant of intolerance”. You want a country for people to be able to get ahead no matter who they love, where they live or who they worship. She highlighted an inclusive society was the key message of the prime minister’s speech on the night of his election victory. Labor MP says government will not be ‘lectured’ by opposition on stage-three tax cuts Sky News has shadow finance minister Jane Hume squaring off against assistant climate change minister Jenny McAllister. The topic is stage-three tax cuts. Hume is coming out with her new favourite verb “crab-walk” to describe Labor’s speculated U-turn, which she was using in her media round yesterday too. However, crabs usually walk sideways, not backwards but no one seems to have asked Hume to explain what she actually means by the term then. If Labor crab walks away we’ll see their true colours. McAllister says that the government is “working through all those issues” on stage-three tax cuts. Two days away from the 10th anniversary of Julia Gillard’s anti-misogyny speech, McAllister has echoes of the former Labor leader when she responds to Hume: We’re not going to be lectured to people who were unable to make an energy policy, address the skills crisis for 10 years. NCA bomber Perre jailed for life National Crime Authority bomber Domenic Perre has been jailed for life and will be in his 90s before becoming eligible for parole after being sentenced for the 1994 Adelaide attack, AAP reports. Perre faced the South Australian supreme court today with Justice Kevin Nicholson confirming his mandatory life sentence for the murder of Detective Geoffrey Bowen and the attempted murder of lawyer Peter Wallis. With Perre already behind bars for drug offences, Nicholson extended his existing non-parole period by 30 years and seven months. That means the 65-year-old will be aged over 95 before being able to apply for release. Nicholson said Perre’s targeted murder of a serving police officer was violent, barbaric and ruthless. The judge said: Your conduct was brutish. That is totally devoid of any human sensibility. Your conduct was motivated by matters that do you no credit. It was not just premeditated but intricately devised and planned over a lengthy period of time and was executed in cold blood. Bowen died from horrific injuries, including the loss of his left arm, when a parcel bomb built and sent by Perre exploded in his office. Wallis, who was standing nearby, lost an eye and suffered severe burns in the blast. He died in 2018. Handing down his guilty verdicts in June this year, Nicholson found that Perre had intended to kill Bowen or anyone else who happened to open the package or be close by when it detonated. Perre was first charged with murder soon after the bombing but the case against him was dropped six months later because of a lack of evidence. He was arrested again in 2018 after a joint investigation, lasting more than two years, by a number of state and federal authorities including the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. In an incredibly detailed and complex case, prosecutors argued the bombing was a personal attack on Bowen. They said Perre’s hostility towards him had grown because of their interactions following the seizure of a multimillion dollar cannabis crop in the Northern Territory in August 1993. Bowen’s son Simon, who followed his father’s footsteps into the police force, was just seven at the time of the blast. He told Perre in a victim impact statement last month: I struggle with the motive and relevance of your actions. You caused so much irreparable damage and suffering all so you can grow some dope and walk about South Australia like a would-be gangster with your big black glasses. Bowen’s widow Jane Bowen-Sutton said her husband was killed on their ninth wedding anniversary and she had experienced never-ending grief. That day I told my seven and five-year-old sons that their much-loved dad had been killed and we would never see him again. I’ve relived that conversation for 28 years. Genevieve Wallis, who was eight years old when her father was injured, said the attack had left him traumatised, depressed and debilitated. Wallis said: The bombing had torn any sense of safety, belonging and privilege of being a child and it sickens me that a blatant disregard for human life can exist within another human. In defence submissions, Perre’s lawyer Gilbert Aitken told the court that his client sympathised with the families of the victims but maintained his innocence. He has lodged an appeal against his convictions. Melbourne Zoo marks 160th anniversary with pledge to continue fighting wildlife extinction RBA financial stability report to reveal rate-increase stresses We’ll soon get the Reserve Bank’s semi-annual financial stability review, which should update the central bank’s assessment of how households and businesses are coping with the higher interest rates. Their last such report landed, of course, before they started lifting the cash rate in May, with the increase now reaching a round 250 basis points with last Tuesday’s hike. While we await the report, CoreLogic has released September quarter data tracking how much more it is costing to build a new home. Their Cordell Construction Cost Index (CCCI) showed such costs were rising at a record rate in the 12 months to September – if you exclude the bulge in costs after the GST was introduced by the Howard government in March 2001. According to index, residential construction costs increased by 11% over the 12 months to September, quickening from the 10% annual pace for the June quarter. On a quarterly basis, the jump was 4.7% or about double the 2.4% increase in the April-June period. So much, then, for the easing of Covid restrictions producing some relief on the home-building front. The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has said Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, “is well and truly past his use-by date,” in a stinging attack over the issue of Essendon football club and Andrew Thorburn. He also flagged the Liberal party, under his leadership, would more strongly speak out about social and culture issues like freedom of speech. Dutton appeared on Sky News last night, where he was asked about the Thorburn case, where the former banking executive quit as Essendon CEO after just a day following the surfacing of sermons from the church that he chaired likening abortion to concentration camps and claims that “practising homosexuality is a sin”. Andrews criticised Thorburn, Dutton then criticised Andrews, then Andrews criticised Dutton for criticising him. In the next round of the circular sledging match, Dutton took aim back at Andrews again last night. Dutton told Sky host Andrew Bolt: If ever there was a time for a change of government, it’s now in Victoria. I hope and pray that they can change government down there because Daniel Andrews is well and truly past his use-by date and the gratuitous comments that he provides, I mean, there’s nothing substantive in what he says. He doesn’t argue the merit, you’ll notice, he attacks the person and that’s how he gets away with skating over the issues where he’s had a complete failure. Dutton again called on Andrews to throw his support behind Thorburn: “He would say that he’s in favour of inclusion, he would say that he’s in favour of freedom of choice and freedom of speech and instead he’s supported a decision which has crucified somebody for their religious beliefs.” The opposition leader flagged he would have a big focus on social and cultural issues such as the Thorburn case – and more broadly, freedom of speech and individual rights – as this term of government plays out. He said: The Liberal party has very strong values, particularly around the rights of the individual and I’ll take every opportunity to assert those because people will know by the time of the next election that there is a big difference between the Liberal party and the Labor party – not just on social issues, but on economic and national security issues as well. The Australian defence force’s contribution to the national response to Covid-19 concludes today, as the ADF announces an official end to “Operation Covid-19 Assist”. The pandemic saw over 19,000 ADF personnel deployed at border checkpoints, testing and vaccine hubs, quarantine hotels and aged care facilities. The ADF said in a statement that across more than 26,000 deployments helped assist the “most vulnerable to the effects of the virus” as well as critical supply chain management. Deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, had these words of thanks for the ADF: We are extremely proud of Defence’s response to the pandemic which tested the resilience of all those involved. As it did during the outbreak of Spanish influenza over a century ago, the Australian defence force rose to the challenge imposed by Covid-19, offering a significant capability to deal with the impacts of the disease. Defence personnel enhanced services, provided relief to organisations under pressure, increased the effectiveness and speed of the national response and, importantly, provided reassurance to a concerned public. I thank our Defence personnel for their commitment, compassion, patience and professionalism during one of the most challenging periods in Australia’s contemporary history. Sydney’s Warragamba spill to pick up this weekend More rain is falling today across the sodden inland regions of NSW. The coast, though, including Sydney, will feel dry, certainly compared with the 91mm in the 24 hours to 9am Friday that tipped the city into wettest-year-ever territory with about a lot of 2022 to set a new high bar. The lull, however, won’t last, with the weekend looking damp, particularly on Saturday when as much as 50mm will fall in Sydney and 70mm in the city’s west. For the Warragamba Dam region, falls should approach 60mm on Saturday and as much as another 30mm on Sunday. The dam has again been a focus of attention, with the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet this week repeating his determination to lift the dam wall even though it’s highly contested. (With the bill likely to top $2bn, the NSW government will be hoping half the funds will come from the feds. A tad unlikely.) According to WaterNSW, Warragamba has so far been spilling only about 8 giga (or billion) litres a day since last Thursday (continuing an off and on again spill pattern for months). Warragamba’s expected peak outflow will reach 275GL/day (based on a relatively low 25% chance), likely by Sunday PM. As of 6am today, inflows were at 36GL/day, and the spill was 30GL/day. The dam, which is about 80% of Sydney’s capacity, holds 2000GL, and since March 2021 has received enough water to fill 2.2 times. Since November 2021, WaterNSW has made controlled releases of 1,000GL (or two Sydney Harbours’ worth). As for the big inland NSW dams – Burrendong, Wyangala, Copeton and Burrinjuck – they have enough spare capacity with only modest spills based on the current forecasts. Those spills, of course, would be larger if conditions turn out a lot wetter than predicted, WaterNSW said. They’ve been helped by the midweek rain being less than has been forecast, giving WaterNSW a chance to release water in those dams to gain “air space” to accommodate what’s coming in the next 48 hours. Large policing operation supporting Bathurst 1000 event amid flooding Superintendent Bob Noble also spoke at that press conference about the Bathurst 1000 event going ahead amid the threat of flood: Obviously we’ve got a very large event in Bathurst this weekend. It is really important from an economic and social point of view, not just for this district but for the whole state. We have a very large policing operation around that support the event. On the mountain itself, in and around Bathurst and on our roads in surrounding districts and that is to ensure that we have a safe event, everyone does well and everyone get as way safely. What we don’t need is people entering flooded causeways and water across the road. It wasn’t very long ago that we had a five-year-old boy, not far from here who was killed, drowned in a car washed off the bridge. You can imagine how devastating that is for that family. It is a terribly hard way for a lesson to be learned by society. NSW SES receive 24 calls for assistance, including four flood rescues SES operational readiness officer, Joshua Clark, is providing an update: We are looking at quite a significant weather event that is moving across the state from the west to the east at the moment. The areas of impact and concern for the SES are Gunnedah, Bathurst, Forbes, Warren and most of inland New South Wales. This weather event has the potential to bring some significant heavy rainfall and as a result New South Wales SES and our partner agencies have provided and pre-positioned resources right across inland. We have here in relation to Bathurst, we have an additional flood rescue team from fire &amp; cue, we have PolAir based out of Orange with helicopter support, aviation assets across New England and the north-west and a lot of those activities are reply and, resupply and flood and rescue support as and when required. Thankfully, only 24 calls for assistance over New South Wales. Of note, four have been flood rescues. A press conference is happening in Bathurst giving an update about the state’s deteriorating weather conditions expected over the next 36 hours. Paul Toole, the deputy premier and member for Bathurst, one of the areas being hit by flooding, is the first to speak: Over the coming days, we are expecting to see consistent rainfall across various parts of New South Wales. We are expecting to see significant rainfall around the Bathurst area, the Gunnedah area and also around Forbes. Please, everybody, do the right thing over this weekend as we are continuing to see significant rainfall across the state. Toole also warned drivers returning from school holidays to prepare for traffic: We are expected to see congestion on the Great Western Highway, on the Princes Highway and on the M1 Motorway. We are asking people to plan their trips, to take their time. There will be congestion. It means that people will have delays. We also want people to drive to the conditions. There will be wet weather, so therefore when you’re braking, it will take extra distance to actually brake before you come it a stop. The timing of the severe weather is also particularly bad for Bathurst, which is holding their annual supercar event which kicked off yesterday and continues through this weekend. Toole said: I also want to point out that here in Bathurst, we have a major event this weekend as well. This is the Bathurst 1000. We are expected to see thousands of people here in the city enjoying the car race. But, again, we want to remind campers to not set up alongside the river. Do not set a campsite up underneath a tree. This is for your safety. NSW emergency services minister Steph Cook said: We are in the middle of two wet-weather systems at present and the next 24-36 hours we are likely to see increased rainfall across southern inland places like here in Bathurst and also across Sydney. So here we are expecting weather conditions to deteriorate over this time and on that basis, we are asking communities to work with us over this time, and particularly those communities in the Hawkesbury-Nepean area – we are very aware of the fact that your communities have experienced four floods within an 18-month period and acknowledge the anxiety that some of you will be feeling at this time. I want-to-reassure communities across New South Wales that the SES are very well prepared. Poll shows over-50s feel ageism pain On ageism awareness day, national polling has been released showing nearly 70% of people over 50 agree that ageism against older Australians is a serious problem. Australians in their 50s and 60s are significantly more concerned about ageism than older people, AAP reports. Nearly three-quarters of over-50s believe Australia is not doing enough to raise awareness about ageism and fight against it, while 58% want a government awareness campaign. However, people in their 50s and 60s are more likely than those in their 80s or 90s to think ageism is a serious problem, according to the research by RedBridge Group for the EveryAGE Counts campaign. Nearly three-quarters of people in their 60s believe ageism is a serious problem, and 37% of people in that age bracket are most likely to have experienced ageism in the past year. That was compared with about a quarter of over-50s generally, and 15% of people in their 80s. EveryAGE Counts campaign director Marlene Krasovitsky said: The way most polling has traditionally lumped ‘older Australians’ together into one monolithic group is ageist in and of itself. What this new research shows is that attitudes to ageism and experiences of ageism vary significantly across a very diverse ‘over-50’ group. Nearly 30% of people over 50 have been ignored or made to feel invisible, according to the research. Among those in their 50s, 28% had been rejected for jobs because of their age, and a quarter of people in their 50s and 60s had been made to feel like they are too old for their work. Krasovitsky said those in their 80s and 90s, conversely, are more likely to report experiencing ageism in the health system, either by being denied treatments or by being ignored in favour of a carer. The research was based on a representative national sample of more than 1,040 Australians. There were 9,230 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and nine people are in intensive care. There were 10,767 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 23 people are in intensive care. Australian army chief warns Putin’s nuclear threat must be taken ‘very seriously’ Australia’s new army chief Lieutenant General Simon Stuart has warned the prospect of nuclear war in Europe must be taken “very seriously”, as the world enters a strategic era different to the past 80 years. In an interview with the ABC Stuart was asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent threat to use nuclear weapons was a real possibility. He said: I think we have to take it very seriously. We live in an era of strategic competition where the great powers are nuclear-armed is something that we need to understand, because it is different to the strategic environment we’ve been living in for the past 80 years. Earlier this week, during the Land Forces conference in Brisbane, Stuart said that restoring trust in the army following the Brereton inquiry is one of his immediate priorities in his new role. You can read Guardian Australia’s defence correspondent Daniel Hurst’s most recent revelations regarding inaction on the Brereton inquiry here: Weather warnings for Victoria Here are the warnings that Victorian emergency services have issued for the Melbourne area, and northern parts of the state. Flood watches are also in place for a number of Victorian rivers, including the Yarra. Australia’s peak medical body has warned it’s “too early” to scrap Covid-19 isolation requirements, with the nation set to be hit by another wave of infections, AAP reports. National cabinet agreed to dump the five-day isolation period for positive cases at their last meeting in September. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the changes will come into effect on 14 October. Australian Medical Association president Prof Steve Robson told AAP it was “too early” to ease these protections for the community. All the signs are that we’re looking at another wave of Covid. We’re coming out of one of the biggest waves of Covid yet and it has absolutely crushed [the] hospital workforce and left us with a massive logjam and backlog in hospitals at the moment that has to be dealt with. If we have another wave over the holiday season, then it spells bad news for the country because we can’t tackle that backlog. Robson said information from the northern hemisphere showed the newer variants won’t be affected by immunity from previous infection or from vaccinations. We’re seeing a major wave beginning again in the northern hemisphere, we’re very concerned that this doesn’t happen in Australia. The federal health department will release its weekly Covid-19 case notifications report on Friday. Dutton accuses government of not giving straight answers in throwback to Rudd and Gillard The defence minister, Richard Marles, followed by the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, spoke to Nine News this morning. Marles was asked whether the government would “break the promise” of its commitment to stage-three tax cuts. He said: Our position hasn’t changed. We are facing a really difficult situation in terms of the budget. Every dollar of debt that Peter left us from the former government are now costing the budget a whole lot more. Dutton then criticised the government’s lack of a clear answer on the question: Richard’s words this morning – he couldn’t give you a straight answer, which is exactly how Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard behaved, and we’re seeing echoes of that, which should be deeply disturbing. Feminist writer Clementine Ford is speaking to ABC Radio about how romantic love has been oversold to women as a project to get them back into the home post-WW2. What a vibe. Australian politicians react to Thai massacre Condolences are flowing in from the Australian parliament following the horrific massacre in Thailand overnight. Prime minister Anthony Albanese earlier tweeted “it’s impossible to comprehend the heartbreak”. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong said she was “devastated”. Opposition leader Peter Dutton called it a “senseless massacre” and “difficult to comprehend”. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek, shadow foreign minister Simon Birmingham and Nationals MP Michael McCormack also shared messages of condolence. Assistant treasury minister Andrew Leigh called the incident “evil”. Independent MP Allegra Spender has called for the Labor government to announce a tax system review as part of this month’s federal budget, as debate over the fate of the $244bn stage-three tax cuts continues to rage. Spender, the member for the affluent Sydney seat of Wentworth, tweeted this morning that it would be “courageous” for treasurer Jim Chalmers to start a “balanced discussion” about tax settings. She previously told the Sydney Morning Herald she supported the stage-three tax cuts but has long called for a review of income, company and payroll taxes. She tweeted: The treasurer is right to highlight cost pressures in the budget, but government also has control over how to spend money smarter. The government hasn’t decided on any changes to the stage-three tax cuts, which will overwhelmingly benefit high-income earners when they come into effect in 2024, and may eventually decide to make no changes at all to the settings legislated by Scott Morrison’s government. However, there are some in Labor agitating for changes, with calls for some of the large benefits to the richest Australians to be pared back. The Coalition opposition is already setting this up as a test for the Albanese government, pointing out that the now prime minister repeatedly promised not to touch the tax cuts during the election. Here’s Coalition frontbencher Dan Tehan: Albanese says trust between Australia and Solomon Islands vital The prime minister’s office has released some images of Anthony Albanese hosting Manasseh Sogavare at The Lodge in Canberra for dinner on Thursday night, after his formal meeting at Parliament House earlier in the day. At that meeting, Albanese said “building up trust” between the two nations was critical. He said Australia regards itself as being part of the “Pacific family”: Like families, we won’t always agree on every single item but what we will agree on is common interests wherever we can. Climate Council issues pre-budget wishlist With the federal budget less than two weeks away, the Climate Council is calling on the Albanese government to replace $11.6bn spent on fossil fuel subsidies with “structural” environmentally friendly investments that could lower costs for households, AAP reports. In a report released today, the Climate Council claims the government could use money from fuel subsidies to install more than 72,000 electric vehicle charging stations – one for every 12km of road – or install solar panels to power 1.5 million low-income households. Climate Council chief executive Dr Jennifer Rayner said the organisation based its figures on fossil fuel subsidies paid in the 2021-2022 financial year and five projects it considered “better bets”. In addition to solar panels and EV charging stations, Rayner said the government could use the funds to replace all diesel buses in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, create 138 renewable energy storage facilities similar to Victoria’s Big Battery in Geelong, or fund another 15 pumped hydro projects to shore up the energy grid. Rayner said each of the projects was environmentally friendly and some would offer cost savings to households under financial pressure. Climate Council economist Nicki Hutley, who prepared the report, said investing the funds in electric vehicle charging sites could also make it easier for Australians to avoid rising petrol prices. Australia has a network of more than 3000 public electric vehicle charging stations but, with an $11.6bn investment, Hutley estimates the country could roll out 72,500 EV chargers - one for every 12km. By comparison, Norway has an EV charger for every 50km of roads at 17,000. KPMG has flagged climate change as a key concern in the October budget. Western Sydney to receive 70mm of rain Saturday alone The federal government has today announced that the budget blowout and unanswered questions of the $14.5bn inland rail project be investigated in an independent review. This is a project which was the subject of a major investigation by Guardian Australia’s rural network earlier this year: The federal government today announced former Energy Security Board chair Kerry Schott would lead the review. Infrastructure minister Catherine King and finance minister Katy Gallagher have released a joint statement this morning: The Coalition left Inland Rail in a mess. We inherited a project over budget, behind schedule and with no plan for where it will start or end. The review will consider the process for selecting the Inland Rail route, including stakeholder consultation, and assess the project’s scope, schedule and cost. The review will also assess options for the new Inland Rail intermodal terminals to be built in Melbourne and Brisbane, and improving rail links to the ports in these cities. The review will have regard to existing studies, such as the Toowoomba to Gladstone Inland Rail Extension Business Case. Inland Rail is an important part of building additional capability and capacity to increase the resilience of Australia’s freight supply chain and meet our growing freight task, which is forecast to grow by up to 35% by 2040. Moving freight off the roads and on to rail will help with the task of decarbonising while helping regional cities grow by providing more opportunities for jobs and industries. The independent review is necessary because Inland Rail is too important to stuff up. The project has already gone over budget and a senate inquiry was told final costs for the infrastructure project could surpass $20bn. ‘Impossible to comprehend the heartbreak’: Albanese sends condolences to Thailand The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has expressed his condolences to Thailand on behalf of Australia following the news of mass stabbing and shooting at a preschool. Thirty-seven people have been killed, most of them young children, in an unprecedented gun and knife attack at a preschool centre in the country’s north-east. Bandt says systemic cost of living relief will help Australians more than stage-three tax cuts RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas now turns to asking Greens leader Adam Bandt about the stage-three tax cuts, amid speculation the government could be reconsidering their commitment. Bandt has been outspoken about the need to scrap the tax cuts which will largely benefit the wealthiest Australians, arguing that the savings could be better spent on Greens policies like bringing dental under medicare. Karvelas asks Bandt if he would support changes to the stage three tax cuts so people on lower incomes keep the tax cut. However, Bandt’s argument is that the government spending on “systemic cost of living relief” is what will best serve Australians. The proposed tweaks that the government has been floating ... still result in billionaires getting thousands of dollars a year in tax cuts – our view is there are better ways of dealing with the cost of living crisis. People who are on low and middle incomes need cost of living relief, in the form of government support to reduce the cost of living, getting dental into medicare. The concern is that with wages going up so slowly and the cost of everything rising quickly, a small tax cut today is gobbled up by energy prices tomorrow. This is about what government can do to make peoples lives better. Greens to push government on safeguard mechanism in the Senate Greens leader Adam Bandt is now speaking to ABC Radio. My colleague Sarah Martin brought you the news a little earlier about that new analysis out from the Greens which shows that big emitters can easily pay for their emission offsets instead of reducing them. Bandt: The government has said that … they’re now going to take steps to put a new rule in place to cover the coal and gas corporations. What we’re concerned about that under the discussion paper the government has released, these big corporations that are bringing in billions of dollars a year in revenue won’t actually be forced to cut their pollution instead they’ll just be able to pay to offset it. [Our analysis] suggest that many of these big polluters won’t have to cut their pollution at all and given that call and gas is what’s fast tracking the climate crisis, that is a real concern to us. The government’s safeguard mechanism has to deal with this question of new coal and gas projects … the government has said it would … if we come up with a scheme that allows new coal and gas to keep opening then it’s going to make the climate crisis worse. Are the Greens willing to hold up other legislation to strengthen the safeguard mechanism? They’ll need the safeguard mechanism to have the support of the Senate.. so this is where we will push the government to tackle this question of coal and gas. This is an area I think we can get the government to shift, that’s why a record number of people voted for us. Fifty-seven flood warnings in place for NSW as SES receive 800 calls for help NSW SES assistant commissioner Dean Story is speaking to ABC News Breakfast this morning about “a concerning couple of days ahead” for the state’s weather: There is currently 57 advice or watch and act warnings in play from the SES effecting a large part of the state. That number is set to increase in the next 24 hours as well. We’re really asking the communities and those effected areas to stay informed, monitor your local weather forecasts and the warnings. A lot of people on the roads with the school holidays ending and events taking place around the state. Avoid unnecessary travel if you are in the effected areas. If you need to travel, plan your trip accordingly. You can use live traffic.com as a good tool to do that and never drive through flood waters. Story says there have been “almost 800 requests for assistance” since Monday. SES volunteers have responded to 24 flood rescues during that time also. The rainfall forecast over the next 24 hours is really concerning from a flash-flooding risk. Where the flood waters and people attempt to go drive through them, particularly in the city areas, can really ramp up that activity and increase that risk. We’re urging the communities to stay vigilant and make the smart safety decisions for themselves and their families and one of the smartest decisions they can make is never drive through floodwaters. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says Australia is facing the possibility of a new “global slowdown” and the 25 October budget must be framed to prepare for any coming economic shocks. Amid the debate over whether to proceed with the stage-three tax cuts, Chalmers said the budget would include “difficult decisions for difficult times” amid a worsening global economic climate and spending pressures domestically. He will say in a speech at the Queensland government’s investment showcase later today: The right calls for the right reasons – following the responsible path; not the path of least resistance. We must be serious about rebuilding our budget buffers – particularly given the deteriorating global outlook. So, we’ll put a premium on affordable, responsible, sustainable, spending. Not fancy or flashy – but fair and future-focused. Above all else – this budget will be about responsible economic management at home at a time of uncertainty around the world. The budget will show that Treasury’s global growth forecasts have been downgraded by 0.75 of a percentage point in 2022, 1 percentage point in 2023 and a 0.5 of a percentage point in 2024. He says: This means that global output will be around $2tn lower in US dollar terms by the end of 2024 than previously expected. We aren’t being spared from the deteriorating global outlook and we shouldn’t hope to escape further storms unscathed. Chalmers will say that the global financial crisis became a demand shock, the Covid pandemic crisis became a supply shock, and the third would be “an inflationary shock and a hard landing brought about by rapidly tightening monetary policy.” Each is different in meaningful ways; the response should be different too. This time our response will be more targeted, more measured, and more supply-side focussed so it isn’t counterproductive and doesn’t put extra pressure on the independent RBA. He will also use the speech to highlight the spending pressures facing the government, with interest payments to grow at around 14% per year on average over the next four years, defence spending to grow 4.4% each year, the NDIS 12.1%, hospitals 6.1%, and aged care 5%. The Greens are releasing new analysis today looking at how big polluters could “easily pay for offsets” under the proposed changes to the safeguard mechanism mooted by the government. The analysis, informed by research from the parliamentary library, shows that at current and forecast prices of carbon permits, the biggest emitters in the coal and gas sector would only have to pay “the tiniest fraction of their profits” to offset their emissions. This will lead big polluters to buy carbon credits rather than investing in real emission reductions at their own facilities, the party claims. Using the Capcoal thermal and metallurgical coalmine in Queensland and the North-West Shelf LNG project as case studies, the analysis looks at two measures of possible liabilities as envisaged in the government’s consultation paper: a minimum 3.5% annual decline in emissions out to 2030 or a maximum 6% decline. Under either scenario, the cost of abatement would range from as low as 0.014% of annual profits to 1.35% of just one year’s profit for a five-year obligation. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the liability would amount to “just coins down the back of the couch” for these coal and gas corporations. He says: Coal and gas are the main causes of the climate crisis, but Labor’s proposed scheme lets coal and gas keep polluting by paying a pittance. Under Labor’s proposed scheme, new coal and gas mines can still go ahead. Coal and gas corporations make obscene profits and pay very little tax, and on the current proposal, they’ll easily buy their way out of the scheme. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today outline the five biggest pressures on the budget he is due to hand down on 25 October. The interest payments on servicing government debt tops the list, alongside aged care, disability care, hospitals and defence. The Australian Financial Review is reporting the treasurer will use the occasion to “escalate his push to pare back the stage-three tax cuts.” In other political news, the Greens are releasing new analysis today showing how big polluters will choose to pay for rather than cut their emission offsets under the proposed changes to the safeguard mechanism mooted by the government. The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, will be speaking with ABC Radio shortly and we’ll bring you what he has to say. In weather news, wild conditions continues to lash eastern Australia with flood warnings in place across several states. There are 55 flood warnings across in NSW, 14 of which are watch and act. More than a dozen rivers set to flood with concern for inland towns in the state’s north and central west. There are also warnings for heavy rainfall, thunder and flooding in Victoria, as well as a flood watches in Queensland and Tasmania.

The crisis poses fundamental questions for the economy; it affects public health and jobs, and its threats range from food security to national security. That is why it will be among the central concerns of my government and why I believe any responsible world leader must make it a priority. Climate change drives the droughts that affect the provision of water; destroys lives and livelihoods; cripples food production, and destroys our homes and infrastructure. Extreme temperatures affect migration patterns and exacerbate conflicts as hundreds of thousands flee to seek alternative livelihoods for survival. Our response to this crisis cuts across every issue, from the sources of our energy, to how we transport ourselves, from the jobs that will sustain us in the future, to the quality of the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink. The climate emergency is here and now. Across Kenya, communities today are suffering the consequences. Millions of Kenyans and millions more from the Horn of Africa are on the brink of famine due to devastating drought. It is not too late to respond, but to tackle this threat we must act urgently to keep the increase in global heating to below 1.5C (2.7F), help those most in need, and end our addiction to fossil fuels. Africa is the continent most affected by climate change and yet the least responsible for it. Despite this, the continent has the opportunity to lead the world and show that we do not need to destroy the climate to prosper. We have immense potential for renewable energy, and this abundance of wind and solar energy can power the development of Africa. Rather than trudging in the fossil-fuel footsteps of those who went before, we can leapfrog this dirty energy and embrace the benefits of clean power. Kenya is home to the continent’s largest windfarm and our electricity supply is already 92% renewable, with 74% of our overall energy use powered by clean energy. I am reaffirming our commitment to move this to 100% clean energy by 2030. We call on all African states to join us in this journey. Plummeting costs make clean energy the most economical choice. A report by the International Energy Agency published last month showed that there are already more jobs globally in clean energy than fossil fuels, and its forecasts are for this gap to grow as more countries decarbonise. A transition to clean energy is a no-brainer. It will create jobs, protect local economies and accelerate the sustainable industrialisation of Africa. As Africans, we will call for a rapid and just transition – delivering on the commitment by heads of state to double Africa’s installed energy capacity through renewables by 2030. Together, we can deliver energy access to almost half of Africa’s people, who remain underserved by the dirty energy systems of yesterday, by transitioning rapidly to the clean energy systems of the future. As members of the international community, we will support a successful Cop27 international climate summit in Africa this November by demanding delivery of the finance and technology needed by Africa to adapt to climate impacts, support those in need, and manage the energy transition. At this meeting, we must move decisively from talk to on-the-ground action that benefits every African. Among the outcomes from this global gathering must be a financing framework that enables Africa’s planned and orderly transition from fossil fuels; supports our workers, communities and national economies; and advances our development. Finance and technology must be provided to our developing countries while enabling all African countries to accelerate our transition to clean energy. The global transition to clean energy is now more urgent than ever. The current energy crisis, partly caused by the war in Ukraine, underlines the need for less reliance on fossil fuels and much greater investment in renewables. As the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, said, renewables are “the energy of freedom”. The wind cannot be stockpiled to drive up its price; the sun’s rays cannot be switched off by a single person wishing to weaponise energy. Wind turbines and solar panels are quick to construct and can generate and deliver power far more quickly and easily than a new oil rig, and with much less harm to our fragile climate. Already renewables are the world’s cheapest form of new energy. The energy crisis is a wake-up call that fossil fuels are the opposite of freedom, yet the world has become shackled to them. We need to break free from those chains, to accept there is a better way to power the world’s economy. It is one that is fairer, cheaper and less destructive to ourselves and our communities, to our families’ future, and to the natural environment on which we all depend. This is a crossroads in history.

Andrew Forrest, a billionaire turned philanthropist who made his fortune in mining and minerals, is turning his vast iron ore extraction operation, Fortescue Metals Group, into a zero carbon business. Unlike most companies, Fortescue is not seeking net zero greenhouse gas emissions but what Forrest described as “real zero”. To achieve net zero, many companies use carbon credits, awarded for projects such as planting trees or preserving existing forests, to count against their greenhouse gas emissions. Forrest thinks this is a mistake and instead plans to use entirely renewable energy and zero-carbon technologies to transform his business. “Companies think they can continue piling emissions into the world, and cover their tracks with carbon offsets,” he said. “But carbon credits are really questionable,” he told the Guardian in an interview in London. “We are pushing beyond carbon credits.” Having examined the market for carbon credits, Forrest has concluded that only about 10% to 15% of available credits represent real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. “I am an ecologist and I have seen how these credits get valued. Some are from just planting trees where trees would have been growing anyway,” he said. “Carbon credits are dangerous.” They are being relied upon increasingly as companies seek to become net zero but questions about the market for offsets are intensifying. Earlier this week, the airline Easyjet announced it would no longer use carbon offsetting to reach its net zero goals, but will invest further in low-carbon technologies for aviation. The Guardian conducted a wide-ranging investigation of the market for forestry credits last year and found numerous problems, including “phantom credits” and questions over whether credits awarded for preserving and planting trees represented genuine “carbon sinks”. Forrest said the carbon markets merited deep investigation. “There are all sorts of cranks out there selling carbon credits,” he said. “This abuse must stop.” Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation charity targets plastic pollution , modern slavery and the climate crisis. Nicknamed Twiggy, he has announced plans to give away most of his $27bn fortune, has been criticised in Australia for controversial proposals on welfare for low-income people, for mining on Indigenous land, and by those who argue that tax is a better redistribution of wealth than philanthropy. Fortescue, whose profits topped US$6bn (£5.5bn) last year, will use solar and wind power, electric vehicles, hydrogen and hydro-electricity with pump storage to make its operations zero carbon by the end of this decade. Surplus renewable energy would be used to pump water uphill during times of excess generation, to be released to generate power when needed. Forrest insisted the strategy was not only technically feasible but could be achieved at a profit, thanks in part to the plummeting cost of wind and solar energy, and the soaring price of fossil fuels. “The biggest cost saving is on buying the fossil fuels,” he said. “Wind and sun don’t send you a bill at the end of the month. We have seen [from the Ukraine war and global gas crisis] how foolhardy it is to rely on fossil fuels.” Heavy industries, such as mining, have long been regarded as among the hardest sectors to decarbonise, but Forrest said the falling costs of renewable energy generation and the rapid development of technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen, meant there was little excuse for the sector not to move swiftly. He urged other companies to follow his lead. “The question is not why are we doing it – it’s why everyone else is not doing it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/28/mike-cannon-brookes-to-back-new-agl-board-members-in-bid-to-clean-up-climate-polluter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T09:52:00Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes to back new AGL board members in bid to clean up climate polluter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/28/mike-cannon-brookes-to-back-new-agl-board-members-in-bid-to-clean-up-climate-polluter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/28/mike-cannon-brookes-to-back-new-agl-board-members-in-bid-to-clean-up-climate-polluter","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes to back new AGL board members in bid to clean up climate polluter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tech billionaire and climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes will back four new members to the board of AGL in his latest bid to steer Australia’s biggest power generator and carbon polluter towards a lower emissions future. Cannon-Brookes, who in May used his clout as AGL’s largest shareholder to block AGL’s plans to split into two companies, will support the four independent non-executive directors to transform the company, according to a media release by his family company, Grok Ventures. The four include Kerry Schott, the former chair of the Energy Security Board, Prof John Pollears, CSR board member, Christine Holman, and solar energy veteran, Mark Twidell. “Grok believes the AGL Board needs to expand to include a broader range of skills, expertise and capabilities to reset the strategic direction and culture of this historic company,” the statement said, referring the 185-year-old firm. “In Grok’s view the current board of five would benefit greatly from new directors who bring different and much needed skills to undertake the urgent transformation of AGL,” it said. The missive came on the eve of AGL’s plan to release its updated strategy to the sharemarket on Thursday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cannon-Brookes, whose fortune derives mostly from his co-founding of software services giant Atlassian, earlier this month objected to the choice of Patricia McKenzie as the new chair of AGL “given her involvement in the failed demerger”. AGL has faced a year of turmoil include seeing off a takeover bid led by Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset manager Brookfield in February and March. The company had sought to demerge into a mostly retail arm and a company with its remaining coal-fired power plants. AGL’s Liddell power plant in the New South Wales Hunter Valley will fully close by next April. According to plans announced in February, the neighbouring Bayswater plant was to close “no later than 2033” while its Loy Yang A power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley would run until 2045. Cannon-Brookes has said he wants AGL to exit all coal by the mid-2030s. The four new board candidates would be voted on at AGL’s annual general meeting, planned for 15 November. AGL chair, Patricia McKenzie, said the company shared “the ambition of our many shareholders for decisive action on climate change as well as a strong and sustainable AGL”. “AGL respects the right of shareholders to nominate candidates for election as directors.” She said the board’s recommendation on each resolution to be considered at the AGM will be published in October. Two other shareholders, Sentient and Snowcap, issued statements in support of the board nominations. “Sentient considers that businesses and governments are underestimating the complexity of accelerating the energy transition,” a spokesperson said. “We believe there are tremendous opportunities for AGL in the energy transition and as impact investors we wish to see the company succeed,” the spokesperson said. “To do so however, it is important that AGL brings in new board directors with the right experience to enable it to manage the orderly closure of stranded assets, grow its business, while responsibly meeting the needs of customers, staff and the community.” Similarly, Chris Kinnersley from Snowcap, said AGL’s board “urgently requires fresh ideas and a renewed culture of excellence” “We believe the shareholder nominees provide the relevant experience critical for navigating a successful turnaround,” he said. AGL’s share price rose almost 3% on Wednesday to $6.60, outperforming the overall market, which slid by 0.5%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/sep/28/our-bid-for-more-solar-panels-was-left-out-in-the-cold","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Our bid for more solar panels was left out in the cold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/sep/28/our-bid-for-more-solar-panels-was-left-out-in-the-cold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/sep/28/our-bid-for-more-solar-panels-was-left-out-in-the-cold","fields":{"headline":"Our bid for more solar panels was left out in the cold","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We had solar panels fitted in 2019 as part of the Solar Together initiative, and this year wanted to add to them. We chose Green Energy Together as it had done Solar Together projects with our council. We paid a £1,340 deposit. There was then a rather odd silence, but finally scaffolding and two installers appeared. The installers hadn’t been told the panels had to be fitted in addition to those already there, so the kit they had brought was inappropriate. Since then, in spite of daily phone calls and promises from the company that someone would ring back, nothing has happened. We eventually cancelled our order by phone and email, and asked for the return of our deposit and the removal of the scaffolding. Again, there has been silence, even from the company director we emailed directly. We are concerned that this company has over-reached itself while holding on to our money (and that of a lot of other people, if Trustpilot is to be believed). We are also concerned that the scaffolding is still on our house and is a security risk. Solar panels are an obvious route amid an energy crisis, and it is worrying this path seems to be made so difficult and full of obstacles. AJ, London The irony is the Solar Together scheme promises to make solar energy more accessible and more affordable to households who might not otherwise risk the investment. Councils group buy the best available deal from a vetted company at auction, and households who have registered an interest are sent a quote. Many households have benefited from the concept, but some installers, who auctioned their services, may have accepted more work than they can handle. Green Energy Together’s Trustpilot page makes for alarming reading, not just because 69% of reviews rate the company as bad or poor for the same reasons you cite, but because Trustpilot itself warns that it’s had to remove fake reviews. Trustpilot tells me that the company had ignored a formal demand to cease its “abuse” of the platform after “multiple suspected fake four-and five-star reviews” were detected. It says: “Ultimately, this enforcement action did not deter the business and, as a result, in June we terminated its paid subscription with Trustpilot. We also placed a warning banner on its Trustpilot page alerting consumers to its abuse of our platform.” So far, so bad, for a company whose website declares it keeps alive the “principles and values” of the late Queen. I put this alleged abuse – and the details of your ordeal – to Green Energy Together’s director, Nick Elbourne. He blames supply chain shortages and claims customers were sent a newsletter advising them of delays until the end of October. As for the Trustpilot abuse, he says that the platform had not provided enough information about the fake reviews for him to “diagnose the issue”. Over then to iChoosr, which runs the Solar Together scheme, and claims to vigorously vet the suitability of installers it works with. It also insists it caps the number of households which can apply for a quote if its installers reach full capacity. It told me Green Energy Together has, so far, completed 2,000 installations, but Covid and Brexit had created “unprecedented issues” with supply chains and staffing. “We are aware of some customers who have not had such a smooth journey, as we run our customer services alongside those of the installers that win our auctions, and we are working with Green Energy Together to resolve issues,” it says. Green Energy Together got in touch with you after I’d alerted iChoosr to your plight. The scaffolding was removed within three days but, two weeks after a promise that the deposit would be refunded, you’re still waiting for your money. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

Under the targets, Victoria would reach 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 gigawatts of storage by 2035 – enough to power about half of Victoria’s current homes at their peak energy usage. If re-elected in November’s state election, the government would introduce the legislation to parliament next year. Andrews said adding more renewable energy supply would create downward pressure on household power bills, boost jobs and provide certainty to investors in the sector. “We intend to continue delivering more and more renewable energy,” Andrews said. “We need the storage capacity to sit alongside that so you can soak up that energy when it’s in plentiful and abundant supply and then dispatch that out to households and businesses when it is needed.” He said the storage goals would make it more likely the state will meet its target of halving emissions – using a 2005 baseline – by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Victoria also has a legislated a target of 50% renewables by 2030. “We are keen to not only meet our 2030 targets, but if we can exceed them, then obviously that’s a good thing for jobs, good thing for households and a pretty good thing for the planet as well,” Andrews said. Last week, the state’s greenhouse gas emissions report revealed Victoria’s emissions fell to 30% below 2005 levels in 2020. This drop followed the closure of the Hazelwood coal plant in 2017 – due to not being economically viable – which cut the state’s emissions output by about 10%. Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the storage targets were a crucial part of transition to renewables. “Doing that early, doing that with ambition, doing that with guidance from government is so important for investors to get on and actually deliver the projects that are going to ensure that we manage the energy transition,” she said. The targets will complement Victoria’s investment in wind and solar energy by soaking up the energy and dispatching it back into the grid when needed. Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said the targets would increase energy storage, thereby allowing more investment in solar and wind energy and lowering power prices. “The more of something you put into the grid, the lower the prices,” he said. “The significant jump in storage planned between 2030 and 2035 is the latest recognition that Victoria’s remaining coal generators are unlikely to last much beyond 2030.” The storage targets will include short and long-duration energy storage systems – which can hold more than eight hours of energy – including batteries, hydroelectricity and hydrogen technologies. In March, the Andrews government unveiled Australia’s first offshore wind targets that could generate enough energy to power 1.5m Victorian homes by 2032. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said the government’s pledge was “not a bad suggestion” but stressed that Victorians needed immediate cost of living relief. The state government predicted the storage targets would create and maintain 12,700 jobs and underpin $1.7bn in investment between 2023 and 20234. To support the targets, the Andrews government has also committed to investing $119m from its $540m renewable energy fund in a 125-megawatt battery and grid-forming inverter – to help stabilise the grid – between Bendigo and Red Cliffs. The opposition on Tuesday vowed it would invest $1m in creating a fuel price comparison app – similar to NSW’s model – if it won the state election. The app would require fuel stations to publish their prices and provide consumers with real-time information on petrol prices near them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/sep/25/flood-warnings-in-nsw-as-geelong-celebrates-10th-afl-grand-final-win-follow-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T07:01:26Z","webTitle":"End of fuel excise discount will be tough, Labor admits – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/sep/25/flood-warnings-in-nsw-as-geelong-celebrates-10th-afl-grand-final-win-follow-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/sep/25/flood-warnings-in-nsw-as-geelong-celebrates-10th-afl-grand-final-win-follow-live","fields":{"headline":"End of fuel excise discount will be tough, Labor admits – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time has come to wrap up the blog.

Australian PMs and former PMs to attend Shinzo Abe’s funeral The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will travel to Japan on Monday to attend the state funeral of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. Joining Albanese will be former prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, all of whom worked with Abe during his two terms in government. Abe was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, serving between 2006 and 2007 and then again between 2012 and 2020. He was assassinated in July. Abe visited Australia five times as prime minister, the last of which was in 2018. Albanese called Abe “a reassuring figure of certainty” during a condolence motion moved in the Australian parliament in July: Our friendship with Japan is one of the central elements of Australia’s international relations. There is warmth at the heart of our friendship, there is respect and there is trust. Mr Abe embodied them all. – from AAP Police find body in North Parramatta A sad update to some news we brought you earlier: police have found the body of a man who went missing after being hit by car in western Sydney. The man’s body was found in a lake in North Parramatta by police divers. Emergency services were called to James Ruse Drive in North Parramatta about 9.40pm on Saturday after the man was struck by a sedan. The driver of the sedan stopped at the scene but the injured man ran off. As police were responding to the crash, they received reports a person was in distress at nearby Lake Parramatta Reserve. The police air wing and dog unit, officers and State Emergency Service personnel started a search on Saturday night. Those efforts were suspended but continued on Sunday morning before divers located the body at about 12.30pm. The body is yet to be formally identified but police believe it is that of the missing man. Investigations are continuing and police have urged anyone with information to come forward. – from AAP Back to football for a minute: winner winner chicken dinner. NSW election polling favours Labor The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, concedes the next state election will be “very close”, after a Newspoll and Resolve poll released on Saturday showed NSW Labor is on track to claim government for the first time since 2011. AAP has the story. Perrottet told reporters: It’s not for me to commentate on polls … What I will say is that the next election will be a very close election. The premier urged voters to look at the government’s track record in dealing with the aftermath of droughts, bushfires, floods and the pandemic. He denied the John Barilaro New York job saga had taken some of the shine off the Coalition’s record. Perrottet acknowledged some decisions made during the coronavirus pandemic weren’t popular with people in areas such as western Sydney, who lived through some of the strictest lockdown rules in Australia: It has been a difficult time ... for every single person across our state, and we stood side by side with them during that period of time. Whilst we may have not got every decision right during the pandemic, I believe in the main that we did.” The state election is locked in for March next year. The Newspoll showed NSW Labor had 40% of the primary vote against the government on 35% and was ahead on a two-party preferred basis, at 54% to 46%. The Resolve Strategic showed Labor on 43% of the primary vote, compared to 30% for the coalition. But the Resolve also showed the Labor leader, Chris Minns, was running equal to Perrottet on the preferred premier stakes, with both on 28%. The Newspoll was conducted between September 19 and September 22 and the Resolve poll on September 18. Dead whales moved from mass stranding site The Tasmanian department of natural resources and environment has provided an update on the pilot whales that were stranded near the town of Strahan, on the state’s west coast, earlier in the week. With the assistance of local aquaculture companies, department staff have removed the majority of whale carcasses from Ocean Beach, west of Strahan. Around 230 pilot whales were found stranded at Ocean Beach on Wednesday, exactly two years after another mass stranding in the same area. The carcasses were towed out to sea today and released in deep open water, where they are expected to initially drift south and eventually sink and decompose in the Southern Ocean. Incident controller Brendon Clark said the retrieval and removal of the remaining whale carcasses from nearby Macquarie Harbour is now the authorities’ focus: Yesterday, we undertook extensive aerial surveillance of the area, before moving into this part of the operation. During that exercise we located some live whales in Macquarie Harbour and were able to refloat and release these in deep waters. This follows the successful refloating and release of about 44 live whales over the past few days. Members of the public are asked to report any sightings of whales or whale carcasses, which may wash up on local beaches in coming weeks. The whale hotline is: 0427 WHALES. It is an offense to interfere with or possess any part of the deceased animals, so people are urged to stay away from carcasses if they spot them. Thanks Christopher Knaus.

Australian government to announce new security measures for data breaches The ABC is reporting that the government will announce new security measures following the massive Optus data breach this week. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, is expected to pursue reforms to speed up notification for banks and other institutions in the event of a breach, where it is relevant to their customers. The ABC reports O’Neil met with the Australian Signals Directorate and the Cyber Security Centre to discuss the Optus breach. The changes being contemplated mean banks and other institutions would be told immediately of such events in the future, allowing them to better protect customers. But as my colleague Josh Taylor points out, such changes may not have changed much in the Optus case. The company went public within a day of the breach. Australian government to give $2.3m boost to elite rugby league in PNG The Australian government will use $2.3m to boost support for high performance rugby league in Papua New Guinea. The international development minister, Pat Conroy, and the sports minister, Anika Wells, announced the government will partner with the Queensland Rugby League to support the PNG Orchids and Kumuls, the women and men’s teams, enhance opportunities for female players, and develop home-grown high performance expertise. The countries’ prime ministers, Anthony Albanese and James Marape, will attend the prime minister’s XIII rugby league matches tonight in Brisbane. Conroy: Australia is a steadfast partner and friend to Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbour. We are bound by rich historical ties, shared values and our love for rugby league, which has been a binding force in our relationship for over a half a century. The Australian Government has supported rugby league in PNG since 2013 through the community-driven League Bilong Laif program. This new investment extends our support to the high performance level for both men and women. Asked whether the government will extend the relief from the fuel excise introduced by the last government, Jones says: Labor can’t keep going around doing what the former government did, which is write billion-dollar cheques to solve every political problem ... We know that this is going to be tough on motorists. We know we’ve got to make some tough decisions. And I think Australians understand, they can expect the government to take some tough decisions that will be necessary, not only to get us through this period … Over the next few months, where inflation is going through the roof, we have got to have a process where we are working hand-in-hand with the Reserve Bank to ensure the fiscal policy and monetary policy is working hand-in-hand. But I think Australians understand that we cannot keep writing, as the former government did, billion-dollar cheques and letting the debt mount up and up and up. The fuel excise relief is due to end on Wednesday. Assistant treasurer slams opposition for ‘giving up on forming policy’ The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, spoke to reporters in Sydney a little earlier. He slammed the shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, for saying the opposition has no policies because it is not in government. An admission from the opposition finance spokesperson this morning that the opposition has no policies. They gave up on governing and now it appears they are giving up on forming the policy basis for a new government. If the Coalition hasn’t got any policies of its own, they should get out of the way of the government [and] limiting its policies. We have got some big challenges. Next week, Jones says the government will be introducing affordable childcare legislation, a bill for the federal integrity commission, and will be attempting to “repair the $1tn of debt and the mess in the budget that the former government has left us”. He says Australia is facing “very tough economic circumstances”. We have got the United States economy, the biggest economy in the world, in all sorts of trouble. The war in Ukraine is pushing up the prices of energy and all other goods. Europe and other economic strife. It is impossible that these things will not impact on Australia. Despite all of these changes, Labor is committed to implementing our election policies, which is to put in place repair to the budget, including dealing with a structural deficit we have inherited from the former government. Selwood mulls future after record-breaking fourth premiership appearance Geelong captain Joel Selwood will take time to contemplate his AFL future, intent on not making an emotional decision in the wake of his latest premiership. Selwood made a record-breaking 40th finals appearance in the grand final thrashing of Sydney – one more than Hawthorn legend Michael Tuck. And the resounding victory made the 34-year-old the first Cats player to feature in four flags. It would be the perfect way for Selwood to sign off, after 355 games across a decorated 16-year career. But coach Chris Scott fanned the flames of possibility on Sunday, impressed by his skipper’s influential display against the Swans. I make it a rule not to speak for our players, and certainly not for our captain, but I didn’t see any problem with the way he played yesterday. Selwood, who debuted in 2007, was the oldest player in Geelong’s grand final line-up as they fielded the oldest team in AFL/VFL history. A decision on the veteran midfielder’s playing future could be made within days. Selwood said: We’ll talk throughout the week with the club and there’s a bit to go through. I’ll speak with people who have been watching me and seeing how I’ve been going. It’s not just a decision for myself. - from AAP Victoria to expand program to help patients with disabilities leave hospital The Victorian government will expand a program helping patients leave hospital while waiting for an NDIS plan. The program is designed to reduce bed block in the state’s hospital by helping those with a disability to transition into home or “home-like” accommodation when they are deemed medically fit but are still waiting on NDIS-funded accommodation. The Victorian government piloted the program in Melbourne. It freed up 3,000 hospital bed days, according to the government. It will now be expanded into regional areas. A statement issued by the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said: Following a successful pilot in metropolitan Melbourne which saw more than 3,000 hospital bed days freed up, the program will expand into regional Victoria for the first time – helping more people with a disability regain their independence and spend more time with their families. After years of NDIS neglect from the Morrison government, delayed discharge times for patients with a disability rose to an average wait of five months, with some spending as long as 600 days waiting for discharge. Australian businessman denies threatening to sell Conflict Islands to China The owner of 21 tropical islands off the coast of Papua New Guinea says he never threatened to sell them to China and his main aim is to save the turtles that nest there. Ian Gowrie-Smith, an Australian businessman and investor, bought the Conflict Islands, which lie less than 1,000km from the Australian coast, almost two decades ago. The largely uninhabited atolls are a nesting ground for critically endangered hawksbill and green turtles, whose breeding season begins within weeks. Some then migrate to the Great Barrier Reef. Gowrie-Smith had been talking about selling the islands or developing partnerships to support the conservation work for several years, and hoped the Australian government could work with PNG, or by supporting a charity, to protect the breeding grounds. The “atoll custodian” told Guardian Australia he contacted the office of the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in June to discuss the future of the land, but grew frustrated waiting for a response. “Here’s an opportunity to protect not only the area but the Great Barrier Reef’s conservation – that in itself should have been enough of a reason for someone to reply and say this is a pretty important site,” he said. In August that frustration led him to appear on A Current Affair, which focused on the “danger” if the islands should “fall into Chinese hands”. But Gowrie-Smith said any suggestion he was threatening to sell the islands to China was entirely wrong. “I don’t have any intention of selling these islands to the CCP,” Gowrie-Smith said. Federal Icac legislation to include public interest test for public hearings Sky News is reporting that the integrity commission legislation, set to be introduced next week, will include a public interest test to determine whether public hearings are appropriate for individual investigations. The issue of public hearings has been a key point of contention. Integrity advocates say public hearings are crucial in both promoting government transparency, deterring misconduct, and attracting witnesses and whistleblowers. But opponents say they unfairly tarnish the reputations, before any finding of wrongdoing is made. NSW’s independent commission against corruption also includes a public interest test for conducting public hearings. It’s been a bumper weekend for football, and another Australia vs New Zealand game has just begun at Eden Park – barely a day after an Australian defeat in a different code (poor, humiliated Wallabies). The Socceroos are taking on the All Whites, and you can follow live updates from my colleague Emma Kemp here: Defence minister says timeline for nuclear submarines being prepared amid reports US will expedite delivery to mid-2030s The defence minister, Richard Marles, who spoke earlier today about the war in Ukraine, has also said an interim report on Australia’s military capabilities and a timeline for nuclear submarines are being prepared. Marles says initial reports will be provided to him in November but they won’t be made public. The Wall Street Journal reported the White House is in talks to expedite the delivery of the subs to the mid-2030s by building the first ones in the US in a bid to counter China’s growing military might. A spokesperson for Marles reiterated his comments, saying: It’s important to get the capability as soon as we can. We are still doing the consultations to set out the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire the capability. Marles told Sky News the original timeline for receiving the submarines in the 2040s would have opened a military capability gap: What we’ve sought from the process that’s under way with Aukus right now is not simply to answer the question as to what platform we run with ... but how soon we can get it. Cost would also be considered in the bringing forward of any construction or acquisition, he said. – from AAP Two NSW towns are likely to be isolated for days as the NSW flood emergency continues. State Emergency Service workers performed six rescues and answered 112 calls for help between 6am on Saturday and 6am on Sunday. The towns of Warren and Wee Waa, in the state’s north, are cut off by road and expected to remain that way for days. Emergency services are using aircraft to delivery water, medicine, food and other supplies to residents. The town of Gunnedah continues to be impacted by major flooding as of Sunday morning, however water is slowly receding. The Namoi River peaked at the major flood level of 8.24 metres on Saturday and SES workers were on the ground to assess the damage as it became clear. - from AAP Cycling road race favourite Van der Poel charged with assault Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel, who was the favourite going into the UCI Road World Championships elite men’s road race in Wollongong, was arrested and charged with common assault on Saturday night following an incident at his hotel. He started the race on Sunday morning but retired after less than an hour of racing. Van der Poel is understood to have gone to sleep early ahead of the race, the biggest one-day event on the annual cycling calendar, only to be repeatedly woken by two teenage girls knocking on his door at the hotel in Brighton-Le-Sands, in Sydney’s south. A spokesperson for New South Wales police told Guardian Australia that late on Saturday night, an unidentified 27-year-old man was allegedly involved in a verbal altercation at the hotel. It’s further alleged the man then pushed both teenagers, with one falling to the ground and the other being pushed into a wall, causing a minor graze to her elbow. Hotel management were notified of the incident, who then called police. Officers from St George police area command attended and arrested a 27-year-old man shortly after. The individual, understood to be Van der Poel, was taken to Kogarah police station and charged with two counts of common assault. He was granted conditional bail and is due to appear on Tuesday at the Sutherland local court. NSW premier: ‘close to 60 flood rescues’ NSW premier Dominic Perrottet says the Bureau of Meteorology and the State Emergency Service are working around the clock to support the state through the ongoing flood crisis. We have had over 800 requests for assistance and close to 60 flood rescues during this period of time. I want to continue to stress for people across our state, please follow the instructions of the SES. If there are instructions of evacuation warnings in place please get ready to evacuate, if there are evacuation orders in place, please leave immediately, and if it is flooded, forget it. We say it every time. Please do not drive through floodwaters. Australia’s golden opportunity to expand solar manufacturing Australia has a golden opportunity to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity as the industry booms and nations scramble to cut their over-dependence on China, a report by the Australian Australian PV Institute Institute says. The country is installing 4GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity a year already but meeting just 3% of that from a local supplier, Adelaide’s Tindo Solar. That annual installation tally, though, is predicted to triple by 2050, particularly if Australia becomes a major supplier of hydrogen produced by renewable energy for export. “We have a pressing need, we have the natural resources and we have a very sizeable market,” the report said. “Unless Australia gains control over the most strategic parts of the PV value chain, the development of any ‘green’ export market will be completely dependent on foreign powers.” Renate Egan, the APVI secretary and head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said China would remain an important supplier of panels to Australia but it was important to diversify supply, including by using local firms. “You can liken it to Europe’s reliance on gas from Russia,” Egan said, referring to shortages and soaring gas prices after Moscow imposed export curbs in retaliation to sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world is relying increasingly on solar energy generation for the energy transition [from fossil fuels],” she said. “They’re becoming aware of the risks … in that over 90% of the tech comes from China.” Indigenous Australian objects to be returned by New Zealand museum Four objects from the Warumungu people will be returned from a New Zealand museum to country in the Northern Territory. Two hooked boomerangs (wartilykirri), an adze (palya/kupija) and an axe (ngurrulumuru) were collected by well-known anthropologist Baldwin Spencer and telegraph operator James Field. In the early 1900s, the men amassed more than 6,000 items from central Australia that have since been dispersed around the world. The four objects now in the Tāmaki Paenga Hira Auckland War Memorial Museum will be returned to the Warumungu people later this year. Senior Warumungu man Michael Jones said: They been taken away before us, but we know that they belong to Warumungu people as the new generation. - from AAP Charlie King: Hawthorn racism scandal ‘the low of the low’ Gurindji man and ABC broadcaster Charlie King has spoken out about the Hawthorn racism scandal. He describes the allegations as “the low of the low point” for racism in the AFL. He told ABC’s Offsiders: I had to catch up with other First Nations people and have a bit of a chat about it to try and get my head around it and I’ve had a couple of days to think of it and I’m still reeling thinking, ‘how is this - how is this possible in 2022?’ King said Indigenous Australians of the past had learned to live with racism in the game. But now he says it’s time to draw a line in the sand. I just think we need to understand that there has got to be a place somewhere in discussion for First Nations people. They want to stand up to say, ‘we have had enough’. This has gone on in all our lives. Some of us are getting on in years and we have been children, wrote, played the game and saw racism when we were young and grew up with it and learned to deal with it. It’s a terrible thing. You stand on the ground and you hear racist comments. What do you do? This is not a sentence I thought I’d ever write: A cow has disappeared into the night with Geelong Cats player Jeremy Cameron’s premiership medal. Police search for man hit by car in Sydney New South Wales police are searching for a man who was hit by a car and then fled the scene. He was later seen in distress in a lake at North Parramatta overnight. Police say: A search will resume this morning for a man believed to have gone missing in waters at North Parramatta overnight. About 9.40pm yesterday, emergency services were called to James Ruse Drive, North Parramatta, after reports a person had been hit by a car. Police had been told a man was seen running across the road when he was hit by a sedan. The driver of the sedan stopped to render assistance, before the injured man ran from the scene on foot. As officers were responding to the crash, police were called to nearby Lake Parramatta Reserve, after reports of a person in distress in the lake. Officers from Parramatta police area command – with assistance from PolAir, the dog unit and NSW SES – commenced a search operation to locate the man. The search was suspended and will resume today, with assistance from additional resources including the marine area command and police divers. Inquiries continue. Sticking with the AFL grand final, we’ve just received the ratings from Channel 7. They say they had 3.06 million viewers nationally for the grand final. The full figures are: 3.06 million total viewers nationally; reached 4.74 million on broadcast Presentations: 2.54 million viewers; reached 3.77 million on broadcast On the ground: 2.33 million viewers Pre-match entertainment: 1.05 million viewers Post match: 351,000 viewers That’s actually down on last year, when there were 3.91 million viewers nationally, with 3.01 million in the capital cities. Cats fans celebrate grand final triumph Geelong fans are celebrating their team’s thrashing of the Sydney Swans at Kardinia Park, the Cats’ home ground, today. Looks like a good turnout for the team’s supporters day, which began at 11am. Fans will thank players, hear from the club’s chief executive, coaches, and enjoy live music and entertainment. My colleague Cait Kelly has examined the Melbourne-based Brothers of Italy candidate, Joe Cassari, who is trying to help the far right party win power by taking a vast overseas electorate that takes in Asia and Oceania. Melbourne leads fall in auction numbers Thursday’s public holiday and the AFL grand final caused a significant reduction in auctions this week, according to Corelogic. The company’s weekly property update said just 1,323 auctions were held across Australian capitals. Melbourne led the decline with a 86.9% reduction in auction activity in the Victorian capital. Corelogic says: Preliminary clearance rates across the combined capitals held above the 60% mark for the fourth consecutive week, with 60.6% of the 1,028 results collected so far recording a successful result. Last week’s preliminary clearance rate (62.5%) was revised to a final clearance rate of 60.1%, the highest since mid-May (61.3%). This time last year 80.6% of capital city auctions recorded a successful result. Littleproud backs Wong on Ukraine stance The Nationals leader David Littleproud and social services minister Amanda Rishworth were on Channel Nine a little earlier this morning. They were asked about the government’s response to the war in Ukraine and the increasingly inflammatory rhetoric from Russian president Vladimir Putin. Littleproud praised foreign minister Penny Wong for her handling of it. I think you’ve got to give credit where credit’s due. Penny Wong has handled this very well and she’s right to try and engage the global community to call out Putin, who’s becoming increasingly desperate. I mean, he’s calling up an extra 300,000 troops from civilians. I think it’s important that when we’re given the platform on the global stage to call them out and to call those influencers out that can actually hold Russia to account, hold Putin to account, I think it’s important that Penny Wong took that opportunity. She did the right thing here. And she has the support of the opposition in what she’s done and what she will continue to do in making sure that we stand up to a bully and this is what this guy is – he’s a bully. Rishworth was asked whether next month’s budget will offer support to Australians to deal with cost-of-living pressures. She said Labor was dealing with a “very difficult” set of budget circumstances and said “we do have to act responsibly”. The government’s been very clear that we are dealing with a very difficult set of circumstances. The Liberal and National party’s trillion-dollars’ worth of debt, rising interest rates and inflation presents for a very difficult circumstance. We also have in the budget, it has been revealed a whole lot of programs that should have been ongoing spending in the budget but were tricky games played by the previous government. So there’s funding cliffs as well. So we will be doing our best to make sure that we are addressing cost of living. It was interesting to see David mention childcare. It was only Labor that went to an election that actually talked about reducing the cost of childcare. And we will be implementing that election commitment along with our other election commitments as a government. So we do have to act responsibly though. We can’t act irresponsibly. And to be honest, that is what Labor is focused on. How do we get the balance right in paying down our debt, which was left for us, as well as supporting responsibly families when it comes to the cost of living and delivering on our election commitments. The defence minister and deputy prime minister Richard Marles says Australia is preparing to support Ukraine in a protracted war against Russia and will continue to provide military support. He has also condemned the nuclear threat made by Russian president Vladimir Putin as “appalling”. Marles told Sky News: What we understand is that Ukraine is going to need support over a long period of time [and] that’s very much the sense when I was in Europe and speaking to Nato countries – Germany, UK, France. All of those countries are really steeling themselves for this being an effort which needs to be undertaken over a long period of time, and that the importance of standing with Ukraine and enabling Ukraine to be empowered to resolve this on their own terms is fundamentally important. Because the Russian aggression that we have seen, and certainly the comments that we’ve seen from Vladimir Putin in the last few days, which speak to the behaviour of Russia, it cannot be allowed to stand. He said the comments made by Putin had caused “anxiety”, and described his decision to mobilise 300,000 reservists as a “step in completely the wrong direction”. They are appalling comments to make. I mean, it is clearly an appalling thing to do to place that potential on the table. Russia needs to stop and Russia needs to leave Ukraine. I think the scenes that we’ve seen from Russia over the last few days, of people seeking to leave the country, of obvious distress for those being called up and being asked to serve in the Russian forces in respect of this says everything about where public opinion is actually at within Russia. Marles said that Australia needed to “stand with Ukraine” and would continue to offer military assistance, in response to the country’s calls for more vehicles and missiles. We’re working with the Ukrainian government about how we can provide support over the long term. That didn’t take long … Road World Championships resume It’s a beautiful sunny morning in Wollongong on the final day of the 2022 UCI Road World Championships. The men’s elite road race is due to begin at 10.15am, with the peloton taking on an epic 266.9km course taking in almost 4km of elevation, from Helensburgh to central Wollongong. The race is expected to finish just before 5pm. For Australia, all eyes are on Michael Matthews. The Canberran won the under-23 road race last time the world championships were on home soil, in 2010. Since then he’s twice finished on the podium, but never been crowned elite world champion. Is today his day? Yesterday, in the women’s road race, Dutch star Annemiek van Vleuten stunned the peloton with a late solo charge to win the world champion’s rainbow jersey for the second time. It was a jaw-dropping effort from Van Vleuten, who had fractured her elbow on Wednesday. Despite animating the race at the pointy end, the Australian riders could not make the final selection and did not challenge for the medals. The best local finisher was Alexandra Manly in 15th. The shadow finance minister Jane Hume has refused to say whether she supports an extension of the cut to fuel excise, which ends on Wednesday night, during an interview on ABC Insiders. She said the Coalition’s policy when in government was to support it as a temporary measure, but it was now a decision for the Labor government. That temporary excise cut was welcomed by Australians that were feeling the pinch in their pockets. My view is that the government will make its decision. What it does need to do is address the other cost-of-living pressures that are facing Australians. She also said the Coalition was reserving its position on supporting the government’s changes to the childcare subsidy and its new federal integrity commission bill, which will come to parliament this week. On childcare, Hume said the opposition wanted to “check out” whether the measure would improve productivity and participation. On the integrity bill, she said that the opposition would support “anything that will stamp out corruption in public life”. We’ve always said we supported the introduction of a federal Icac. This is really important legislation to get right, because if you get it wrong, it has dire consequences. We haven’t seen the details of Labor’s bill yet, so we want to ask those questions. Will there be procedural fairness and natural justice? Will hearings be in public for private? When will they be one or the other? Hume said she was concerned public hearings could be weaponised and this might deter good people from entering public life. That would be a disaster. We want the best and the brightest to join, but if the risk to your professional reputation, if the risk to your bank balance, the risk to your life and livelihood is there, just because you can politicise a corruption charge, well, why would anybody enter public life? Search to resume for man seen in the water in Darling Harbour Police say they are responding to reports that a man was seen in the water off King Street wharf at Darling Harbour in Sydney in the early hours of this morning. The man had not resurfaced, according to reports to police. Police say: About 1.20am [on Sunday] emergency services were called to King Street wharf at Darling Harbour, after reports a man was seen in the water but had not resurfaced. Officers attached to Sydney city police area command, with assistance from the marine area command, commenced a search for the man. The search was suspended and is due to resume this morning, with the assistance of police divers. Inquiries into the incident are continuing. Getting integrity commission law wrong will have ‘dire consequences’ On the integrity commission, Hume is asked whether she supports the body having public hearings – a key point of contention. She says the Coalition will support “anything that will stamp out corruption in public life”. But she says she will wait to see Labor’s legislation before articulating the opposition’s position. We’ve always said we supported the introduction of a federal Icac. This is really important legislation to get right, because if you get it wrong, it has dire consequences. We haven’t seen the details of Labor’s bill yet, so we want to ask those questions: will there be procedural fairness and natural justice; will hearings be in public or private; when will they be one or the other? Hume: Coalition won’t back cut to EV taxes Hume is asked whether the opposition will support Labor’s attempt to increase childcare subsidies. She says: We do believe that childcare is a really significant cost and a really important service for many Australian families When we were in government, we did the largest reform to childcare in 40 years, and in fact reduced the cost of childcare and made sure that families were subsidised, particularly those who were working, those who were studying and volunteering. She says they will wait to see Labor’s legislation before deciding whether to offer support. But Hume is less equivocal about the plan to reduce taxes for electric vehicles. We won’t be supporting that legislation because it is really poor policy. The electric vehicles, reduction of the FBT on electric vehicles, the government couldn’t explain whether it would actually reduce emissions. The industry couldn’t explain whether it would take up the electric vehicles. It is enormously costly, runs to billions and billions of dollars and if you can’t prove the effect of a policy decision. Coalition went to ‘2019-20 budget essentially in balance’: Hume Hume is asked whether she accepts the Coalition left the budget in structural deficit. She says: Not at all. In fact, in 2019, because of the time we had been in government, we made sure there were budget offsets for new expenditures and we grew the economy. We could also decrease taxes and we went to the 2019-20 budget essentially in balance. She says they had a “credible plan back to surplus” despite a $30bn deficit. After the forward [estimates], but it was a credible plan back to surplus. Hume calls on Labor to cut fiscal spending Hume is asked about what Australia should be doing to avoid going into recession, following her leader’s prediction that the US will do so. She is asked whether the government should be cutting fiscal spending. Hume responds: Well, the Labor government came to government promising higher deficits than the Coalition. In fact, it promised $45bn of off-balance-sheet spending and $18bn more of on-balance-sheet spending. I think it’s time that the Labor government consider the priorities and whether it is a good idea to go ahead with it at a time when winding back your fiscal priorities, winding back your fiscal wish list to make sure that your fiscal policy is in line with your monetary policy would be a better solution. When we were in government, we made sure we managed expenditures and grew the economy at the same time as lowering taxes. In an interview on ABC’s Insiders, shadow finance minister Jane Hume has just made a rather interesting claim. She was being pressed on whether the Coalition supported the temporary fuel excise coming to an end. She said it was now Labor’s policy to manage. She said: We don’t have policies, we are in opposition, not in government. That will be news to many, including Insiders host David Speers, who responded: You do, you have policies on aged pension. The Tasmanian government is scaling down its operation at the site where hundreds of whales were stranded on the state’s west coast. In a statement last night, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said its staff will continue to monitor a “small number of whales” in Macquarie Harbour following the mass stranding this week. Incident controller Brendon Clark said there were no living animals at the main stranding site. Plans to remove the carcasses were progressing well, he said. Through extensive aerial and vessel surveillance of Macquarie Harbour we have identified a small number of whales within the harbour precinct. A number of those are still free swimming. However, we do have a couple that are stranded in shallower waters. We currently have crews responding to those animals and we aim to free them and get them swimming out of the harbour throughout the course of the afternoon. The carcass disposal operation is set to start this morning, depending on the weather. The SES has warned that a new trough and associated low pressure system is forecast to enter western New South Wales on Monday. The trough will progress westwards on Tuesday and Wednesday bringing more rain and the chance of thunderstorms “in many areas”. The SES says: Given the current flooding, saturated catchments and full dams, this forecast front will likely exacerbate the current riverine flooding with multiple systems anticipated to see prolonged or renewed minor to major flooding. With catchments wet and many dams at capacity, waterways are very sensitive to rainfall, and further river rises and renewed flooding are likely for the inland catchments. Ongoing operational activity can be expected to continue in these areas. The SES will be liaising closely with the Bureau of Meteorology to determine the impact areas of the forecast weather. ‘I am pessimistic about seeing a republic achieved any time soon’ Trent Zimmerman, a longtime republican and former Liberal MP, has warned that King Charles’ accession will not make the Australian republican cause any easier. In a piece for the Guardian, he writes: I have supported Australia becoming a republic since my early 20s. For me, it’s about a simple proposition – should we have an Australian as our head of state – a head of state whose only loyalty is to our own nation. Some monarchists have tied themselves in knots arguing the monarch is not our head of state – quite treasonous of them really – but that proposition does not really pass the pub test, let alone constitutional scrutiny. Yet today, as I have been for some time, I am pessimistic about seeing a republic achieved any time soon. It will certainly not be advanced to the stage of a vote during this term of parliament and I suspect not until a future federal government is more than confident of its success. The State Emergency Service has responded to 825 requests for assistance and performed 59 flood rescues in New South Wales in the past 11 days. The SES this morning released new data on its workload in the recent flooding across the state, particularly in the central west and southern parts of the state: statewide requests for assistance: 825 flood rescues: 59 Previous 24 hours up to 6am 25 September 2022: statewide requests for assistance: 112 flood rescues: six A spokesperson said the flooding was continuing in western and southern NSW, with a number of flood warnings current. The spokesperson said Wee Waa and Warren will remain isolated for “many days” and that major flooding was still affecting Gunnedah. Many communities are experiencing continuous or repeat flooding. Currently minor to major flooding is present in several catchments across the state as flood peaks move slowly downstream. Major flooding is still impacting Gunnedah. The river peaked at 8.24 metres yesterday morning. It is expected to remain at major level for the remainder of the weekend; however, it is slowly receding. As the water recedes SES personnel will be on the ground to conduct rapid impact assessments. Wee Waa and Warren will remain isolated for many days. We are conducting numerous resupply operations to residents with essential stores such as water, food and medicines and have deployed aircraft and high clearance vehicles. My colleague Tamsin Rose has investigated the booming demand for cosmetic injectables in Australia, which has prompted experts to warn of the risks of serious mental and physical harm. You can read her piece here: The river near Gunnedah, in NSW’s north-east, peaked at 8.24 metres yesterday. Emergency services say they’ve had “a busy few days” in the area. Child dies in Melbourne fire A child has died after a fire took hold of a shed in Melbourne’s east. Emergency services were called to reports of a blaze at a home in Ringwood about 6pm on Saturday. Once firefighters had put out the blaze, the young child was found dead inside the shed at the rear of the Belle Vue Avenue property. The child is believed to be a resident of the house. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined and an investigation continues on Sunday. – from AAP ‘Considerable’ rainfall expected next week in NSW Inland New South Wales will remain on high alert for flooding, despite a short reprieve from heavy rain. Bureau of Meteorology forecasters are now turning their attention to early next week, with “considerable” falls expected on Tuesday and Wednesday in southern and central inland parts of the state. Senior meteorologist Jake Phillips told AAP: It’s a bit early to know exactly how high the flood peaks will get as a result of that rain, but it’s definitely something that our hydrology team will be checking out pretty closely over the next day or two It definitely will exacerbate some of those flood peaks and could send some of them either into prolonged major flooding, or raise them from moderate into major, potentially. Among places authorities were concerned about on Saturday was Gunnedah, where the Namoi River peaked at the major flood level of 8.24 metres in the morning. State Emergency Service spokesman Greg Nash said people downstream of places like Gunnedah on the river should keep abreast of the latest flood information. It’s anticipated that water will move downstream slowly and may isolate some areas. Wee Waa was isolated by road on Saturday, but the emergency service deployed resources to the town. Nash warned against attempting to cross floodwaters in cars, saying: We have some very resilient communities and some communities that are very much aware of their flood risk. [However] we want people to drive to the conditions, and if you find a flooded or a damaged road as a result of flooding, to stop, turn around [and] find another away – it’s not worth the risk to push on. In the 10 days to Saturday, the emergency service had fielded more than 800 requests for assistance in NSW, which included nearly 60 flood rescues. In the 24 hours to about 5.30pm on Saturday, the emergency service received 120 requests for help and five flood rescues. – from AAP We’re waking to the horrible news that a five-year-old boy has died in the NSW floods. He was separated from his family on Friday night when their car was submerged in floodwaters on McGrane Way near Tullamore, in the state’s central west. Emergency services were called to the scene late on Friday, finding two younger children and their parents, who were clinging to trees. The five-year-old was missing. Fiona Aveyard, a local farmer and Rural Fire Service member, told the ABC she had been one of the first to arrive on scene. She said: It was a miracle they even got a signal to call for help. We arrived in the dark in water that was backed up a couple of hundred metres from the crossing. The water at the low-level crossing was up about a metre and a half. They [the family members] were downstream in the creek clinging to trees – a mother, a father and two young children. The parents were able to free the two younger children from the car but the five-year-old was trapped in the car as it submerged. Police have since announced that they’d found the five-year-old’s body on Saturday afternoon. Ch Insp David Maher told the ABC: The family were very distraught in relation to the incident. The family are Sydney residents but they do have a property in Tullamore. Tullamore is a very small community, very close-knit and it’s had a major impact on the whole community. Good morning and welcome to our live blog for Sunday 25 September. We’ll keep a close eye on the flooding in New South Wales, particularly in the central west. Tragically, emergency services have found the body of a five-year-old boy, who was separated from his family on Friday night when their car was swept away in floodwaters. Heavy rainfall is set to ease in the state’s north today, but will continue in other areas. We’ll bring you all the latest developments as they happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-24T21:00:14Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer unveils green growth plan to counter Liz Truss’s tax cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer unveils green growth plan to counter Liz Truss’s tax cuts","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Keir Starmer will pledge to deliver a new era of economic growth and permanently lower energy bills by turning the UK into an independent green “superpower” before 2030, through a massive expansion of wind and solar energy. Announcing details of the plan exclusively to the Observer, the Labour leader says he will double the amount of onshore wind, triple solar and more than quadruple offshore wind power, “re-industrialising” the country to create a zero carbon, self-sufficient electricity system, by the end of this decade. Starmer says the move – far more ambitious than any green policy advanced by the Tories and the most far-reaching of his leadership so far – would release the British people from the mercy of “dictators” such as Russian president Vladimir Putin over energy bills. It would also, he says, cut hundreds of pounds off annual household energy bills “for good”, create up to half a million UK jobs, and make this country the first to have a zero-emission power system. Labour’s new approach is unveiled as the government’s blueprint to boost economic growth through a sweeping programme of tax cuts – announced by Kwasi Kwarteng, the new chancellor, on Friday – encounters mounting criticism. Yesterday thinktanks and leading economists said the Conservative plan would mainly help the richest and benefit the more prosperous south of England, rather than provide assistance to struggling households and parts of the country which are more deprived. It also spooked the financial markets. In the hours after Kwarteng addressed MPs in the Commons, the pound slumped more than 3% against the dollar to levels last seen 37 years ago and the cost of government borrowing suffered its biggest one-day rise since 1991. These initial reactions have fuelled fears of more carnage when markets reopen on Monday. Some economists believe the Bank of England could be forced to hold an emergency meeting to consider further interest rates rises to prevent a rout. Former Bank policymaker Martin Weale said markets were “frightened” by unfunded tax cuts being pumped into the economy at a time of high inflation. “It is hard to see this policy [of tax cuts] ending happily.” He added: “I expect sterling will continue falling next week, and if it does the Bank of England may need to step in with even higher interest rates.” Starmer made clear that his alternative approach to boosting growth involved tackling three crises jointly – the climate, the cost of living, and the wider economy. Party aides said history showed Labour was at its best and most successful when it captured a sense of “modernity and the future”, as in 1964 when Harold Wilson became prime minister with a vision to create a new Britain in the “white heat” of “scientific revolution”. Starmer said that while the Conservatives were indulging in “casino economics” and “gambling the mortgages and finances of every family in the country”, Labour was looking to create a secure future for everyone, both economically and in the face of climate change. “The British people are sick and tired of rocketing energy bills and our energy system being exposed to dictators,” Starmer said, before Labour’s annual conference which opens in Liverpool on Sunday. “They want long-term solutions to cut bills for good. A central mission of my government will be to turn the UK into a clean energy superpower. “This is a plan that will drive jobs, tackle the cost of living, and protect our homes for future generations by tackling the climate crisis.” Starmer, along with Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for climate change, has been working for months on what they call their green prosperity plan. The idea at its core is to build a self-sufficient power system run entirely by cheap, homegrown renewables and nuclear, by the end of the decade. This, they argue, would also allow the country to become a major energy exporter. In the interview, Starmer said the arrival of Liz Truss as prime minister had created a clearer ideological divide between the Conservatives and Labour that was evident in the way the two party leaders approached challenges over the cost of living and energy prices. There was, Starmer said, “a big divide on the economy and the question of who grows the economy”. While Labour wants to create growth by putting working people at the heart of a green economic revolution, he said Truss wanted her tax cuts to benefit “those at the top, therefore she wants trickle-down economics, to make the rich richer, give them tax cuts. So there is a huge ideological gap there.” The Labour leader added that his party could now fight the next election on issues outside its traditional “comfort zones” such as the NHS. It was now in a position to present a more credible argument to the electorate than the Tories on economic policy as a whole. Starmer said that following the new government’s mini-budget on Friday it was clear that “the roles are switched” and that Labour was now the party of “fiscal responsibility”. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer today, taken mainly before the chancellor’s tax-cutting announcements and the first since Truss entered No 10, shows no boost to the Conservatives from the change of leader and prime minister. It shows Labour leading by 5 points (up 1 point compared with three weeks ago) on 39% while the Tories are unchanged on 34%. Commenting on Labour’s energy plan, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics Rebecca Newsom said: “The only way out of this mess is a moonshot mission to roll out a renewables based energy system that can lower bills, cut emissions, create jobs and break our dependence on gas markets and fossil fuel autocrats. “Labour seems to have understood that, the Conservatives don’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-24T20:00:14Z","webTitle":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","fields":{"headline":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity as the industry booms and nations scramble to cut their over-dependence on China, a report by the Australian Australian PV Institute Institute says. The country is installing 4GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity a year already but meeting just 3% of that from a local supplier, Adelaide’s Tindo Solar. That annual installation tally, though, is predicted to triple by 2050, particularly if Australia becomes a major supplier of hydrogen produced by renewable energy for export. “We have a pressing need, we have the natural resources and we have a very sizeable market,” the report said. “Unless Australia gains control over the most strategic parts of the PV value chain, the development of any ‘green’ export market will be completely dependent on foreign powers.” Renate Egan, the APVI secretary and head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said China would remain an important supplier of panels to Australia but it was important to diversify supply, including by using local firms. “You can liken it to Europe’s reliance on gas from Russia,” Egan said, referring to shortages and soaring gas prices after Moscow imposed export curbs in retaliation to sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world is relying increasingly on solar energy generation for the energy transition [from fossil fuels],” she said. “They’re becoming aware of the risks … in that over 90% of the tech comes from China.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Covid pandemic helped spur demands for more local manufacturing capability when Australia struggled to secure supplies of vaccines and medical equipment. Ongoing supply chain disruptions, particularly as China maintains its Covid-zero policies, have given added impetus to calls for more domestic production capability. A spokesperson for the industry and science minister, Ed Husic, said solar was “clearly going to be a big part of Australia’s renewable energy future”. “The Albanese government will deliver dedicated support through Powering Australia – a $3bn co-investment stream as part of the National Reconstruction Fund,” he said. “A big part of its focus will be on renewables component manufacturing and low-emissions technologies, including production of batteries and solar panels. “By 2030, the government aims to have 82% renewables in the national electricity market. To achieve that, we will need to produce much more solar capacity on shore as well as having a diversity in our international supply chains.” The present trade tensions between Australia and China exacerbated “the potential threat to supply restrictions or sudden price changes”, the APVI paper said. “Adding to this risk is the growing concern over the possible use of forced labour in parts of China, where much of the silicon, wafers and steel used in PV components are produced,” it said. Egan said Australian technology was used in 90% of PV panels made today, underscoring the country’s scientific pedigree in the field. The country wouldn’t need to make all of the components in modules but could specialise. Local firms could make glass, aluminium frames, polymers or the electronics such as inverters, while leaving production of polysilicon – a key raw material – to others. “I think it’s at the top end of silicon refining and then module assembly,” Egan said. “We need to be making some smart decisions and deploying at scale.” The paper cited existing suppliers including Selectronic – one of the world’s oldest makers of inverters. SunDrive is a firm considering commercial-size silicon-based solar cell fabrication in Australia, while 5B is aiming at fast low-cost PV deployment to supply some of the multi-gigawatt-sized solar farms planned for northern Australia. “To succeed on a global scale, these emerging companies would benefit from market certainty and a coordinated effort to reach scale,” the paper said. Customers could include Sun Cable, a venture supported by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, that aims to build a 12,000-hectare solar precinct in the Northern Territory with 17-20GW capacity and 36-42GW-hours of energy storage. Forrest’s Fortescue group said last week it was planning 2-3GW of renewable energy using solar and wind plants between 2024-28. It was also working to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the global supply of decarbonisation technologies and was building the world’s largest electrolyser facility for the production of hydrogen in Gladstone as part of that effort."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘We have not recovered’: Puerto Rico’s water supply remains vulnerable to hurricane fury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","fields":{"headline":"‘We have not recovered’: Puerto Rico’s water supply remains vulnerable to hurricane fury","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hurricane Fiona was the second time José Oyola Ríos served as an emergency drinking water provider, after gusting winds and heavy rains battered Puerto Rico on Sunday, causing mass flooding and power outages. Oyola Ríos serves as a community leader in rural, inland Caguas, in the central mountain range, where he maintains water tanks that store thousands of gallons, known in the area as the “community oasis”. When Hurricane María battered the island in 2017, hundreds of residents from surrounding towns would drive up the mountainous road to Caguas to get a few gallons of water. Almost exactly five years later, Oyola Ríos activated his plan once again to distribute potable water to communities left without running water after deadly Hurricane Fiona passed through as a Category 1 storm in the Atlantic hurricane season and swept on with its destructive path towards other Caribbean communities. “These atmospheric events demonstrate that we haven’t been able to recover,” Oyola Ríos told the Guardian, adding that Fiona “aggravated that reality”. Slow progress in modernizing Puerto Rico’s water infrastructure has left many residents reliving the trauma experienced when the Category 5 María devastated the 3 million-strong US territory. Several water filtration systems across the island were inoperable post-Fiona due to turbidity or electrical failures, leaving thousands with an interrupted service because of flooding and outages. More than 760,000 customers were still without water service on Tuesday morning, according to the government’s portal. More than half of the water authority’s dams and filtration plants were affected by the hurricane, the president of the Puerto Rico aqueduct and sewer authority, Doriel Pagán, said at a press conference. Water pumps across the island also depend on electricity to distribute water in elevated areas. Pagán said the water authority continues to place power generators across their systems. In preparation for the latest hurricane, many residents stocked up on water, canned food, medication and other essentials. It’s unclear how long customers now without utilities will remain without power or water, and whether supplies at home will last. “This is where a family’s judgment comes in,” said Adamaris Quiñones Rodríguez, president of Puerto Rico water &amp; environment association, a non-profit that focuses on promoting infrastructure rehabilitation. “You might sacrifice a cleaning task in order to have enough water to drink or bathe with.” Yeseida Garay Cotto, 36, lives in Caguas and depends on a well to obtain potable water because the official water service doesn’t reach her house. When the storm hit on Sunday, all she could hear for hours were rocks tumbling that came from several hillside collapses caused by the torrential downpour. One of the collapses damaged the well’s pipeline that she, her family and several others in the community depend on. “We don’t have much clean water, so we’re using the rainwater to wash the dishes and stuff like that,” Garay Cotto told the Guardian. “We have some water we can drink, which should last until we can fix the well.” In contrast, the island is also prone to severe droughts, further necessitating water infrastructure fit for purpose. Puerto Rico’s latest drought was as recent as this summer, when water sources and reservoirs in the north-eastern part of the island were particularly low. Some of the reservoirs leak, which the water authority proposed to fix, and water rationing was mandated. But community leaders like Oyola Ríos lamented that the system is still operating with a vulnerable electricity grid and flawed water system. The US government’s federal emergency management agency (Fema) assigned about $13.2bn for the recovery of the electrical grid after Hurricane María. Only $40m of those funds have been disbursed so far, Anne Bink, associate administrator of the Office of Response and Recovery at Fema, told a congressional hearing last Thursday. “While the start could have been faster, we’re starting to see that pivot toward more work, more shovels in the ground,” she said. Obtaining safe drinking water can be arduous after an atmospheric event of the scope of hurricane. People must disinfect their water supply by boiling it or using liquid chlorine bleach. Hurricane María exposed the threat of drinking contaminated water after 26 people died of leptospirosis – a potentially deadly bacterial disease largely spread by rats. Ironically, people who lived closer to a large canal had a higher risk of being infected, a study led by researchers at the Yale school of public health found. José Ríos Meléndez oversees a group of community aqueducts that provide potable water to areas with unstable water systems. He said he saw a spike in the construction of such fixtures, especially after Luma Energy, a Canadian-American private company, took over Puerto Rico’s energy transmission and distribution system in 2021. But frequent power outages in the last year have left communities which rely on electricity to operate the pumps without an efficient water system, as well as basics like lighting and refrigeration, where many store medication as well as food. Disruptions have been accompanied by repeated increases in electricity bills. Hundreds of protesters gathered last month to demand the cancellation of the contract of Luma Energy, leading to violent clashes with police. More than 240 community aqueducts, equipped with tanks that hold thousands of gallons of water, are scattered around the island and supply water to thousands of people, and more than 100 of these systems run on solar power. Many Puerto Ricans are switching to solar for residences and businesses. Oyola Ríos believes solar energy is an efficient choice, especially as storms become more frequent and fierce. “If I didn’t had solar panels, I wouldn’t have been able to operate,” Oyola Ríos said. “Even with a power generator, there’s a low supply of diesel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/16/zambia-debt-lenders-urged-to-cancel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-16T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Lenders urged to cancel Zambia debt as country faces economic collapse ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/16/zambia-debt-lenders-urged-to-cancel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/16/zambia-debt-lenders-urged-to-cancel","fields":{"headline":"Lenders urged to cancel Zambia debt as country faces economic collapse ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 100 economists and academics have urged international lenders to crisis-stricken Zambia to write off a significant slice of their loans during financial restructuring talks this month. Zambia is seeking up to $8.4bn (£7.3bn) in debt relief from major lenders, including private funds run by the world’s largest investment manager, BlackRock, to help put its public finances back in order. In the run-up to what are understood to be tense negotiations involving the Chinese, French and British governments, the anti-poverty charity Debt Justice said that only a major debt write-off could save the Zambian economy from complete collapse. Led by the Columbia University economist, Jeffrey Sachs, and Jayati Ghosh, the chair of the Centre for Economic Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, the 100-plus global group of economists and experts said in a letter to the creditors’ negotiating committee that Zambia should be given a waiver from debt interest payments due until 2023. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1.3bn loan to the country, which defaulted on its $17.3bn of external debt after a collapse in its public finances during the pandemic. Funds run by BlackRock are among the largest private owners of Zambia’s bonds, holding $220m. Some are worth almost half the value they were sold at. Eurobonds worth $1bn that mature in 2024 plunged 6.3% in the last week to less than 56% of their face value. Debt Justice, formerly known as the Jubilee Debt Campaign, has estimated that BlackRock could make 110% profit for itself and its clients from Zambia if debt interest payments are paid in full. The country has three main private sector bonds that pay an average 8.1% in interest. The letter said: “Because of the high interest rates and the fact Zambia’s bonds have been trading at well below face value since 2018, many bondholders stand to make huge profits at the expense of both Zambian citizens and creditor countries if paid at face value. “It is therefore imperative that BlackRock and other bondholders agree to fully engage in a large-scale debt restructuring, including significant haircuts, in order to make Zambia’s debt sustainable.” Tim Jones, the charity’s policy head, said the IMF loan gave the country some breathing space, but the $8.4bn of interest payments due over the next couple of years should be “cancelled permanently, not rolled over to the 2030s to fuel another debt crisis next decade”. Chad and Ethiopia applied last year for debt relief under the G20’s common framework, but Jones said negotiations have yet to get off the starting blocks. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have also asked for bailouts under IMF schemes to support countries devastated by the climate crisis. Zambia, which has cut health and social care spending by a fifth in the past two years to balance its budget, has seen its debts soar in recent years to fund infrastructure projects, many to help the country supplement drought-affected hydropower plants. Solar energy projects have made the country almost self-sufficient in electricity, but the high cost of borrowing, local corruption and the coronavirus crisis have crippled the country’s finances. Further loans from the IMF have been tied to commitments to end fuel subsidies to households and businesses, pushing the inflation rate above 20% last year before it eased to 9.8% in August. Of Zambia’s external debt, 46% is owed to private lenders, 22% to China, 8% to other governments and 18% to multilateral institutions. China is among the government lenders to agree a longer debt repayment schedule that private lenders, including banks, have so far resisted, Debt Justice said. A BlackRock spokesperson said it wanted “a sustainable long-term outcome for Zambia” but disputed the charity’s claim it would profit from a rescheduling of debt interest payments, saying it was likely to make losses when the bondholdings mature. It said: “We regard it as our obligation to play our part responsibly, alongside all other creditors, in ensuring there is a path towards a sustainable outcome for sovereign debt issuers in distress. “As an asset manager, we are a fiduciary to our clients, people from all walks of life. The money we invest on their behalf is not our own and we are obligated to act in our clients’ best financial interests at all times.” Jones said BlackRock had likely bought Zambian bonds at rock-bottom prices when it was clear the country was already in trouble. BlackRock added that with Zambian bonds trading below their sale value and interest payments suspended since September 2020, “our clients have already experienced losses with respect to their holdings of private sector sovereign debt of Zambia”. The Zambian Civil Society Debt Alliance, Global Justice Now, Action for Southern Africa (ACTSA), Christian Aid, Cafod and Jubilee Scotland are also campaigning for BlackRock and other private lenders to cancel the debt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/sep/12/chevron-newspaper-local-news-permian-proud-site","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T06:00:06Z","webTitle":" ‘Wildfire of disinformation’: how Chevron exploits a news desert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/sep/12/chevron-newspaper-local-news-permian-proud-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/sep/12/chevron-newspaper-local-news-permian-proud-site","fields":{"headline":" ‘Wildfire of disinformation’: how Chevron exploits a news desert","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The dire state of local journalism in the US has been well documented in recent years, as the closure of hundreds of local newspapers has created American “news deserts” where people struggle for information on local politics and happenings. It has also created openings for companies and political groups to swoop in, serving up a mixture of local news and propaganda, with the latest being Chevron, in Texas’ news starved – and oil-rich – Permian Basin. The launch of Chevron’s “Permian Proud” site, in August, was first reported by Gizmodo. The banner at the top of Permian Proud does state that the site is “sponsored by Chevron”. But at first glance, the sponsorship seems like a benevolent grant. On Wednesday Permian Proud’s front page included stories about an upcoming air show and a storytelling workshop – typical local newspaper fare. But interspersed with news of livestock sales and processions is a series of stories lauding Chevron’s achievements in the Permian Basin, a sprawling area covering parts of west Texas and east New Mexico, where the company operates numerous oil fields. “New solar energy field in Permian Basin to lower Chevron’s carbon intensity” is one. Another headline reads: “Independent analysis gives Chevron highest environmental rating in Permian Basin.” Gizmodo reported that content on the site has been written by Mike Aldax, who works for a San Francisco-based PR firm. Since 2014, according to Gizmodo, Aldax “has also written for a Chevron-funded newspaper in California called the Richmond Standard”. Chevron’s Texas offering has echoes of other dubious “local news” sites that have emerged in recent years. Locality Labs and Metric Media, both operated by the same ex-journalist, have opened hundreds of “news” sites, which purport to represent local communities, since 2019. The sites, which include the Great Lakes Wire and the Illinois Valley Times, masquerade as local news outlets, but in reality are funded by Republican and conservative groups. Last November an investigation by Popular Information found that rightwing operatives had used the sprawling network of fake news sites to target crucial state elections, including the Virginia governor’s race in 2021. As the Virginia election loomed, 28 sites, all run by Metric Media, published almost 5,000 articles about critical race theory in schools, a frequently misrepresented issue that has become a call to arms, and to the ballot box, among the right wing. The rise in fake sites coincides with a crisis for local journalism. Since 2005 the US has lost more than a quarter of its newspapers, according to Northwestern University’s Medill School, and is on track to lose more than a third by 2025. The closures have created “news deserts” – where people have either limited access, or no access at all, to reliable local reporting. “The local news desert situation is an absolute crisis, and it’s getting worse. It’s a crisis for communities and it’s a crisis for our democracy, I think, ultimately,” said Tim Franklin, the John M Mutz chair in local news at the Medill School. “And so, what’s happening now is you’re seeing opportunists, whether they be political parties or companies, in some cases, coming in to try to fill that void with their own messaging.” In an email Chevron told Gizmodo that Permian Proud is “aimed at providing regional communities with information that is important to them, specifically focused on highlighting the good work so many people are doing and showcasing why the Permian communities are a great place to live and work”. It is unclear, however, how many people reading the site will be able to tell the difference between local information and Chevron’s PR fluff. A message on Permian Proud reads: “Our focus will be on news and information that makes us all proud to live here. Permian Proud will highlight and uplift such efforts, not just for its community partners, but for anyone wanting to get the word out to the public on local events, fundraisers, initiatives and more.” It’s a message that overlooks the fact that some of Permian Proud’s news content has been pasted, unchanged, from Chevron press releases. “We’re already in a misinformation, disinformation wildfire in this country. What this is doing is fanning the flames of that wildfire of disinformation that is already infecting our civic debate,” Franklin said. He believes that as newspapers continue to close, more companies, or political groups, will move into the local news industry. “In a self-governed democracy, accurate news and information is the oxygen for citizens to be able to make good decisions at the ballot box, or good decisions about how to live their daily lives. “So I think the implications of this are very serious for our democracy and for the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-uk-politics-news-live-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T16:26:13Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss energy plan ‘needlessly inefficient and expensive’, says thinktank – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-uk-politics-news-live-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-uk-politics-news-live-latest","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss energy plan ‘needlessly inefficient and expensive’, says thinktank – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Liz Truss will freeze energy bills at an average of £2,500 a year for two years from 1 October, and has pledged to tackle the root causes of the problems in the UK energy market through plans to increase supply, including the resumption of fracking. My colleagues Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker have the story here. And Rupert Jones has a summary of what the plans involve. Liz Truss raised more than £420,000 in donations for her successful Conservative leadership bid, with the biggest single contribution made by the wife of a former BP executive. The prayers of the nation are with the Queen, the archbishop of Canterbury has said, as Britain’s leaders sent messages of support to the monarch, who was put under medical supervision after doctors became worried about her health. There is ongoing coverage of this story on our separate live blog. From ITV’s Robert Peston The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, another thinktank, has published its assessment of the energy price plan. It is a bit more critical than the IFS (see 2.56pm) and the Resolution Foundation (see 3.59pm). NIESR argued for a sliding price cap, where the cost of energy per unit would go up the more energy a person uses, and it says the government’s plan is “needlessly inefficient and expensive”. Max Mosley, an NIESR economist, said: The prime minister’s energy plan is appropriate in terms of scale and ambition, but is needlessly inefficient and expensive. Its untargeted nature makes the currently unfunded proposal wasteful, which will put pressure on public finances, and for an unknown amount of time. There are better options, including a variable price cap that would gone further in lowering the bills for the poorest and could have even paid for itself. My colleague Peter Walker has written a good analysis of the energy bills announcement. Here’s an extract. There are two main things to note about Liz Truss’s energy costs package. First, there is much detail to come. Also, it is an undeniable paradox that the first move of a prime minister surrounded by former Taxpayers’ Alliance staff is a £150bn state effort to fix commercial prices … An early Truss campaign interview with the Financial Times even airily dismissed the idea of “handouts”. Future campaign messaging was less clear, but still resistant to what was disparagingly referred to as “Gordon Brown economics”. As it has turned out, Truss has ended up doing more or less what Brown argued for in early August, a call for a freeze on prices that pre-empted not just the government but even Brown’s own Labour party. What changed was the sheer weight of political and, what you might even term moral, pressure. Truss was told by an array of experts that failure to take bold action would create a humanitarian disaster, with millions of households cold or hungry or both, businesses collapsing en masse, with the impact on the economy, and especially on public health inequalities, felt for a generation. And here is the full article. The Department for Businesss, Energy and Industrial Strategy has published a factsheet giving a tiny bit more detail of the energy plans announced by Liz Truss earlier. The section on support for business illustrates how vague the plans are at this stage. Full details of how the plan will work for households are not available, but the scheme for businesses is even more sketchy; it seems to be more of a wishlist than a plan, and, with a small typeface, you could literally print it on the back of the metaphorical fag packet. But the factsheet does include this chart, showing the notional savings for households, by housing type. Martin Lewis, the consumer champion, has a good video guide to the energy announcement that you can watch here. He thinks the chances are 50-50 that the government will also cut VAT on fuel bills in its emergency budget later this month. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has published its own assessment of the energy price guarantee. Like the Institute for Fiscal Studies (see 2.56pm), it welcomes this as a substantial intervention that will avert catastrophe for many people this winter, but one that will not stop them facing a very tough winter anyway. Both thinktanks stress that this does not offer a permanent solution. Torsten Bell, the chief executive at the Resolution Foundation, said: Households should be reassured that the winter ahead will not be as bad as feared, but policymakers need to recognise it will still be very tough indeed. The energy price guarantee does a good job of targeting those households facing the highest energy bills but, because it is not well targeted at those on low and middle incomes, comes with a large price tag. Liz Truss is asking future taxpayers to pick up a large and very uncertain bill on behalf of today’s energy bill payers, but declined to set out the cost of this huge package. It could end up surpassing the bank bailouts at the height of the financial crisis, with new support for households alone on course to total around £120bn. It goes without saying this can’t be the permanent answer to higher energy bills. The Resolution Foundation is also critical of the proposal to negotiate new, long-term contracts with low-carbon energy suppliers. Echoing the argument made by Ed Miliband (see 10.09am), it says this “risks delaying but locking in those windfalls, rather than removing them”. Union leaders have criticised the energy announcement from Liz Truss, saying that it should have included a windfall tax and that ministers should have acted earlier. Here is a roundup of some of their reaction. Frances O’Grady, the outgoing TUC general secretary, said: The prime minister is making the wrong people pay. She should have imposed a much larger windfall tax on profiteering oil and gas giants, and she should have required all firms getting help with energy bills to commit to no lay-offs for the lifetime of the help, to protect livelihoods. Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said: It is quite frankly remarkable that the prime minister is asking workers to pay for massive energy company profits. The economy is broken and workers will see through this plan to boost profiteering yet again. I don’t think the irony escapes many. The reason we are held to ransom now by an over-reliance on non-domestic energy is that a Conservative government privatised our energy. Andy Prendergast, national officer at the GMB, said: The Tories have been in office for 12 years. Their failures to build new nuclear power stations, to protect and utilise our gas storage capacity and willingness to engage in political groupthink on domestic on and offshore resources, means we are playing catch-up in the race to defend ourselves against the global energy crisis. And Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary, said: At long last, the government has acted. A bill freeze should have happened months ago. Instead, millions have endured sleepless nights terrified of the winter ahead. The companies raking in billions from soaring energy costs should pay their share. Another windfall tax would be fairer than handing huge debts to future generations. The Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders, has welcomed the government’s energy plan. But Jonathan Geldart, the IoD’s director general, said it was important to get an assurance that the plan would not weaken the public finances. He said: What we need now is an external reassurance that the scale of the intervention does not jeopardise the public finances. That’s why it’s crucially important that the Office for Budget Responsibility can swiftly produce its independent assessment of the impact on government debt and the wider macroeconomy. During first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the UK government’s “very belated action on energy bills” but said people would still have to pay more. She said: It does not represent a halt to the rise in energy bills. Average energy bills right now are just under £2,000, a cap of £2,500 will still see people pay more for their energy. People are still seeing soaring energy costs because of a broken energy market and the utter incompetence of this UK government. Conor Murphy, the Sinn Féin finance minister in Northern Ireland, said the UK government needed to provide “urgent clarity” as to how it will meet its promise to ensure that households in Northern Ireland get the same help as households in Britain. In a statement on the energy package he said: While the British government has said the energy policy changes will apply here, they have failed to outline what exactly that means. This will bring little comfort to individuals who are having to decide between heating and eating. Likewise, businesses trying to plan ahead for the winter months have no certainty as to when support will be forthcoming. The absence of a functioning executive will require a workaround. At a time of crisis for citizens, businesses and public services, this is completely unacceptable. I am calling for urgent clarity on how energy support will be delivered locally. The power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland is not functioning because the DUP says it will not participate until the government abandons the Northern Ireland protocol in its current form. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published its assessment of the energy plan announced by Liz Truss today. It says that capping the average household energy bill at £2,500 a year would cost £60bn over the next year and that just over half of that would go to households in the top half for income distribution. But while poorer households will gain less in cash terms, they will gain significant more as a proportion of what they spend, the IFS says. “The energy price guarantee will save a household with typical energy use in the lowest-income tenth an amount equivalent to 14% of their household spending, compared to 5% for the highest income tenth,” it says. The IFS also says that, if other European countries subsidise bills in the same way, this could increase the risks of a bidding war. It explains. Prices are high because Europe faces severe gas shortages in the coming months. To correct the (large) mismatch between supply and demand, some users of energy – whether households, businesses or governments – will have to reduce their energy use. The less UK households reduce their energy demand, the greater demands placed on others. If other European countries also attempt to subsidise household or business use of energy, the result could be a bidding war that raises the cost of providing support in all countries. It also risks a situation where there is simply not enough energy to go round, which would require rationing or increase the risk of blackouts. Charities say Liz Truss’s energy support package will not do enough to protect the poorest families. Here is a roundup of reaction from some of the leading voices in the sector. Imran Hussain, the director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, said this was a “big intervention with a big hole in it”. He explained: We desperately need more targeted help through benefits for the low-paid and those who have lost their jobs or cannot work because of disability, illness or caring responsibilities. Even with a freeze, energy bills will still be double what they were a year ago, the price of other essentials continues to soar and the true value of benefits has been cut. Becca Lyon, the head of child poverty at Save the Children, said the plan would not stop many families reaching crisis point this winter. She said: How can it be right that multimillionaires will get the same support as the most vulnerable families? If there is enough money to pay the energy bills of the rich and not ask energy giants to pay a penny more, surely there should be enough money to make sure no family has to choose between heating and eating this winter. James Taylor, the director of strategy for the disability charity Scope, said the plan was just a “sticking plaster” for disabled people. He explained: Life costs more if you are disabled. This universal approach brings some relief, but disabled people often rely on higher energy use. It’s important to remember that this cap does not limit what you pay. For many disabled households their bills are still skyrocketing. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition also said the plan would be an “expensive sticking plaster” without further investment in improving energy efficiency of homes worst affected by fuel poverty. The coalition coordinator, Simon Francis, said: While many households will breathe a sigh of relief, the prime minister offered no detail of additional support for the millions of households who will be left behind in fuel poverty this winter. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Radio 4’s World at One that he expected the government’s “energy price guarantee” to cost at least £100bn. He said: The cost will be very, very uncertain. It will depend on what happens to gas prices over the next two years, it will depend on whether this scheme is extended. I would be surprised if over the next 12 months it didn’t cost more than £100bn. The uncertainty gets much greater the further out you go. This expires in two years’ time. On current expectations, that will make it a very painful winter in 2024-25. I think that does open the question about whether this scheme will get extended or not, just as the [Covid] furlough scheme got extended and extended again and again. Bloomberg’s Alex Wickham said this morning that, on the basis of a government document he had seen, he expected the figure to be much higher than £100bn. Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says that, by not imposing a new windfall tax, the government has ensured that “our public services and communities to pay for this through lower investment”. She explains why in a Twitter thread starting here. In his speech in the energy debate Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said Liz Truss was in effect imposing a “Truss tax” on people who would have to pay more for energy. He explained: Freezing prices wasn’t really a choice. It’s the only political option. And when the current price cap stands at 2,000 with a 54% increase since spring, and many people are already unable to pay, setting the cap at 2,500 isn’t an actual freeze. After all the waiting, it couldn’t be any clearer, [the prime minister] set it out very brazenly. The prime Mminister’s plan means that the public pays. She has made the political choice to tax families instead of companies, to put profit over people. Instead of a windfall tax, she has chosen a new Tory tax, the Truss tax. The Truss tax that means that in the months and years ahead households and businesses will be punished with higher bills, higher interest rates and higher mortgage costs. A Truss tax means that cuts to the vital public services rely on and which are used to support the most vulnerable. A Truss tax means a threat to the Scottish budget, which the Scottish government is using to protect our population and shield workers and public services as best they can. Sam Coates from Sky News has a good analysis of the “energy price guarantee”. He says there are five big unknowns: 1) no costings; 2) no detail about how average bills will be capped; 3) no clarity about what might happen after the two-year guantee expires; 4) no clarity about how people will get help in Northern Ireland, where the energy regime is different; and 5) uncertainty about what support business will actually get. And Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, is also surprised by the decision not to give any costings for the policy. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, says he is staggered that Liz Truss announced her “energy price guarantee” without saying how much it would cost. (See 11.47am.) Politicians have been issuing statements expressing their concerns about the Queen’s health, and their best wishes for her recovery. My colleague Miranda Bryant is covering all the developments on that story on a separate live blog. It’s here. The government has now sent out a press release about the “energy price guarantee” announced by Liz Truss earlier. It does not seem to be available online yet, and so here are some excerpts. Help for households Under new plans, a typical UK household will pay no more than £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years from 1st October, through a new ‘energy price guarantee’ which limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas. This takes account of temporarily removing green levies, worth around £150, from household bills. The guarantee will supersede the existing energy price cap. This will save the average household £1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October. It comes in addition to the announced £400 energy bills discount for all households and together they will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today. The new guarantee will apply to households in Great Britain, with the same level of support made available to households in Northern Ireland. Those households who do not pay direct for mains gas and electricity – such as those living in park homes or on heat networks – will be no worse off and receive support through a new fund. Today’s action will deliver substantial benefits to the economy - boosting growth and curbing inflation by 4-5 points, reducing the cost of servicing the national debt. Help for business As businesses have not benefited from an energy price cap and are not always able to fix their energy price through fixed deals, many are reporting projected increases in energy costs of more than 500%. A new six-month scheme for businesses and other non-domestic energy users (including charities and public sector organisations like schools) will offer equivalent support as is being provided for consumers. This will protect them from soaring energy costs and provide them with the certainty they need to plan their business. After this initial six-month scheme, the Government will provide ongoing, focused support for vulnerable industries. There will be a review in 3 months’ time to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support. Reforms to energy market The government will provide energy suppliers with the difference between this new lower price, and what energy retailers would charge their customers were this not in place. Schemes previously funded by green levies will also continue to be funded by the government during this two year period to ensure the UK’s investment in home-grown, secure renewable technologies continues. Whilst the intervention will be funded by the government, action is being taken to significantly reduce the cost over time, including: A new energy supply taskforce – led by Madelaine McTernan who headed up the UK’s successful vaccine taskforce – has begun negotiations with domestic and international suppliers to agree long-term contracts that reduce the price they charge for energy and increase the security of its supply. The taskforce and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy will negotiate with renewable producers to reduce the prices they charge as well. HM Treasury are announcing a joint scheme, working with the Bank of England, to address the extraordinary liquidity requirements faced by energy firms operating in UK wholesale gas and electricity markets. [The Treasury has published details of that here.] Measures to increase energy supply Learning from the mistakes of the past, the government is taking action to accelerate domestic energy supply, increase our energy resilience and achieve our ambition to make the UK an energy exporter by 2040: Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, expected to lead to over 100 new licences. Lift the moratorium on UK shale gas production. This will enable developers to seek planning permission where there is local support, which could get gas flowing in as soon as six months. Drive forward the acceleration of new sources of energy supply from North Sea oil and gas to clean energy like nuclear, wind and solar. Continue progressing up to 24GW of nuclear by 2050, with Great British Nuclear helping to set direction of getting new nuclear projects online in the UK. In the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, has just interrupted Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, who is delivering a speech in the debate, to comment on an announcement from Buckingham Palace. Hoyle is referring to this. Hoyle says: I know I speak on behalf of the entire house when I say that we send our best wishes to Her Majesty the Queen, and that she and her family are in our thoughts and prayers at this moment. He says he is not going to say any more at this point. My colleague Caroline Davies’s story about the Queen is here. Starmer says fracking and a dash for gas in the North Sea will not cut bills or strengthen energy security. And he says Truss should remember what Kwasi Kwarteng said about fracking in an article for the Mail on Sunday earlier this year. Kwarteng wrote: Even if we lifted the fracking moratorium tomorrow, it would take up to a decade to extract sufficient volumes – and it would come at a high cost for communities and our precious countryside. Second, no amount of shale gas from hundreds of wells dotted across rural England would be enough to lower the European price any time soon. And with the best will in the world, private companies are not going to sell the shale gas they produce to UK consumers below the market price. They are not charities, after all. He also says Kwarteng’s own department produced a Q&amp;A saying future extraction from the North Sea would not “materially impact on the global price of gas”. He ends by saying the UK needs a fresh start, not the fourth Tory leader in six years. Theresa May, the former Conservative PM, intervenes, and asks Starmer why no new nuclear power stations were build under Labour. Starmer says he remembers Tony Blair declaring his support for nuclear, and mocking David Cameron for being able to say what his policy was. Doubtless Starmer “remembers” this because the clip has been widely circulated on social media recently. Starmer says Labour did approve new nuclear power stations in 2009. But they were never build after the Tories too power, he says. Starmer says the government banned onshore wind in 2015. That cost the UK the equivalent of the energy it imported from Russia. That was a “policy disaster”, he says. And he says Truss has consistently opposed solar energy. When she was environment secretary she cut subsidies for solar, and the market crashed, he says. Keir Starmer is speaking now. He says Labour called for a price freeze earlier in the summer, and was criticised for doing so. He says he is pleased there is action being taken today. But the key question is will pay for this. The energy companies are making £170bn in windfall profits over the next two years, he says. He says Labour wants to tax this, but Li Truss is opposed. He goes on: Every pound the government refuses to raise in windfall taxes … is a pound of extra borrowing. It’s that simple. This is what Liz Truss has announced. A typical household will save on average £1,000 a year from her two-year energy price guarantee, she claims. An average energy bill for a typical household will be no more than £2,500 a year for the next two years from 1 October under the plan. This figure takes account of the removal of green levies (worth around £150 per household) and it will supersede the existing energy price cap. The policy applies to households in Britain, but in Northern Ireland (where the energy regime is different) households will get the same amount of support. Households who do not pay direct for gas or electricity from the mains will receive support from a fund, and will be no worse off, Truss says. Businesses will get equivalent support, under a scheme lasting six months. After this there will be ongoing support, particularly for vulnerable industries. The package is expected to reduce inflation by up to 5 percentage points from where it otherwise would have been. Truss says that for too long the government has ignored the need for energy security. She says she will address this. She wants to make the UK a net energy exporter by 2040, she says. That’s it. She has finished. Truss says that, to improve long-term energy security, she is announcing two reviews. First, there will be a review of energy regulation. And, second, there will be a review of how the government can reach net zero “in a way that is pro-business and pro-growth”. She says this will be led by Chris Skidmore. Skidmore, a former energy minister, is one of the Tory MPs most committed to net zero. In response to a question from Sammy Wilson (DUP), Truss says she can assure him that this policy will benefit people in Northern Ireland. Truss announces another plan that she says will curb prices. I’m announcing today that, with the Bank of England, we will set up a new scheme worth up to £40bn to ensure that firms operating in the wholesale energy market have the liquidity they need to manage price volatility. This will stabilise the market and decrease the likelihood that energy retailers need our support like they did last winter. By increasing supply, boosting the economy and increasing liquidity in the market, we will significantly reduce the cost to government of this intervention. In the Commons Truss says today’s intervention will curb inflation by up to five percentage points. This will cut the cost of servicing government debt, she says. The written ministerial statement is now available online. It is from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, and it is here. This is what it says: HM Government is acting to protect British households from the spiralling costs of energy. The Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) which will give people certainty with their bills. The EPG will apply from 1 October and will discount the unit cost for gas and electricity use. This guarantee, which includes the temporary suspension of green levies, means that from the 1st October a typical household will pay no more than £2500 per year for each of the next two years. This will save the typical household £1000 a year. It comes in addition to the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme. The scheme will start on the 1st October 2022, when Ofgem’s new price cap is due to come into effect. Cost projections for the delivery of the EPG are uncertain as they depend upon usage levels (which are highly dependent on weather patterns) and, for future three-month periods, the wholesale price of energy. The new guarantee will apply to households in Great Britain, with the same level of support made available to households in Northern Ireland. HM Government will also support all business, charities and public sector organisations with their energy costs this winter, offering an equivalent guarantee for six months. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will set out the expected costs as part of the fiscal statement later this month. Truss is now talking about how they might “defray” the costs of this. First of all, the government will do this by ramping up supply. A new energy supply taskforce has been set up. They are negotiating new contracts with electricity and gas suppliers. The government will also launch a new licensing round for North Sea extraction, which could lead to more than 100 new licences being awarded. She says providers will move to contracts for difference, so that they price they get is not pegged to gas. This will further bring down costs, she says. (See 10.09am.) Richard Burgon (Lab) says the government can do better than this. Why is Truss putting profits ahead of people? Truss says she is doing the important work to help people get through this winter and the next winter, while fixing the energy supply problems. She goes on: This is the moment to be bold. We are facing a global energy crisis and there are no cost-free options. John Redwood (Con) says we are too short of energy, but have too many taxes. If we have too many taxes, we will have less supply of the things we are taxing, he says. Truss says Redwood has made a good point. She goes on: The reality is that we can’t tax our way to growth. Truss says she recognises that people are worried. That is why she has brought forward this debate. Emergency legislation will be brought forward to deliver the policy. Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, will give details of the costs when he makes a fiscal statement later this month. But Truss says she will not accept Labour’s call for a windfall tax. The written ministerial statement setting out this plan should be available here, but it isn’t. Some MPs are angry about not being able to read the details. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says copies are being printed out by the vote office now. He seems furious. Truss says her plan means a typical household will pay no more than £2,500 a year for energy for the next two years from October. A typical household will save on average £1,000 a year from her two-year energy price guarantee, she claims. An average energy bill for a typical household will be no more than £2,500 a year for the next two years from 1 October under the plan. This figure takes account of the removal of green levies (worth around £150 per household) and it will supersede the existing energy price cap. Liz Truss is about to open the debate. But Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts by complaining that the written ministerial statement setting out the plan was not published earlier. It is only just available, he says. This is discourteous to the house, he says. The new version of the register of members’ interests also clarifies who paid for Boris Johnson’s recent party to celebrate his wedding last year. It was held at the mansion owned by the JCB chair and Tory donor Anthony Bamford, and Bamford donated the equivalent of almost £24,000, it says. The declaration reads: Name of donor: Lord Anthony and Lady Carole Bamford For my wedding celebration, hire of Marquee; portaloos; catering; waiting staff; flowers; ice cream van; smoke and braai; total value £23,853. According to George Grylls from the Times, the biggest single donation to Liz Truss’s leadership campaign came from the wife of a BP executive. In the Commons Penny Mordaunt, the new leader of the Commons is still taking business questions. But she is expected to wrap up soon, within the next few minutes. When she finishes, Liz Truss will deliver her statement on her energy bills package, which will take the form of a speech opening a general debate on energy costs. Swing voters have reacted warmly to Liz Truss, according to the results of a focus group conducted by James Johnson, a pollster who used to work in Downing Street for Theresa May. The House of Commons has published its latest updated version of the register of members’ interests, and it includes details of who donated to Liz Truss’s campaign for the Tory leadership. Until now she had not released those names. The full details are here. I’ll post more on it soon. This is from the Labour MP Chris Bryant, replying to what Simon Clarke said on the Today programme this morning. Although Liz Truss is sticking to her opposition to a further windfall tax on energy companies, in most respects her announcement today marks a huge shift from the ideological stance she was taking on energy bills earlier this summer. A small state libertarian, she insisted that the best way to help people with rising prices was through tax cuts, rather than Rishi Sunak-style government intervention. “The way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts,” she told the Financial Times in early August. From what we know of the announcement coming later, she will not be offering cash handouts to households. But she will be putting a limit on the amount bills can rise through handouts to energy companies, which will have a similar effect. This has alarmed some of her libertarian allies. On Sunday Mark Littlewood, who runs the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) thinktank and who has been a friend of Truss’s since they were fellow Liberal Democrats at Oxford, wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph saying she was the last person who would want to fix a price for energy. He said: As a convinced market liberal, [Truss] will recoil at the idea that more state involvement is the best strategy to deal with any given problem. Her approach to date on the energy crisis is a classic example of this. Whilst politicians of all stripes seem to want the government to take even more action to fix the price of energy, Truss’s starting position would be to allow the price mechanism to operate freely and then consider how one might mitigate the effects. She would rather offset the soaring price of utility bills through meaningful tax cuts, than appoint a central committee to pronounce on the exact price we should all be paying per kilowatt hour. That didn’t age well, and last night the IEA issued a press release criticsing the plan being announced today. Andy Mayer, energy analyst at the thinktank, said: Targeted welfare and tax cuts are better than price freezes. The expected energy price freeze, which will limit typical bills to between £2-2,500, is estimated to cost between £90-£170bn. It would be better and cheaper to focus on targeted welfare and tax cuts. Price controls don’t work. By suppressing the price signal and subsidising energy use, more energy will be used, inefficiently, prolonging the crisis, and limiting investment in energy saving. According to the BBC, the government is considering a plan to change the way energy companies are paid for electricity generated from sources other than gas. At the moment prices are pegged to the price of gas, which has led to producers generating energy from nuclear, or renewables, making soaring profits on the back of rising international gas prices. The idea is backed by the industry body Energy UK, which explains it in a briefing here. My colleague Alex Lawson explains what is proposed in a story here. In his interview on the Today programme, Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, claimed this would be “terrible” for consumers. He explained: This is a proposal from Energy UK, and let’s be clear about this proposal: This would lock in massive windfall profits for these electricity generators. Let me explain why: what Energy UK have said is we’ll accept slightly lower prices now, so we can have much higher prices over the following 15 years. This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a terrible deal for billpayers. It is much better - if there are these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do, the fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these companies, but to do a windfall tax. In an interview with Times Radio Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, also criticised the appointment of Jacob Rees-Mogg as business secretary because of his approach to the climate crisis and net zero. He said: Jacob Rees-Mogg has a record, which deeply disturbs me … He has questioned the science of climate change. Now, that’s not just bad in relation to climate change or the climate emergency; it is but if we’re going to lower energy bills, there is one overriding thing we’ve got to do - which is get off fossil fuels. All this nonsense about lifting the ban on fracking. That’s not a solution to this problem. Because fracking, the fracked gas, even if it isn’t dangerous, will cost exactly the same as the gas we’re currently importing. There’s only one way out of this, which is renewables, nuclear, offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, which Jacob Rees Mogg, I fear has set his face against. And here are some more lines from what Simon Clarke, the new levelling up secretary, said on his morning broadcast round. Clarke defended the government’s decision to act on the grounds that the economy would suffer “enormous damage” if it did nothing. Liz Truss is instinctively a small state Tory, and during the Tory leadership campaign she criticised what she described as Gordon Brown-style government interventions. But Clarke, one of her closest allies, said on this occasion a big intervention was essential. He said: If we fail to act, if we don’t protect the economy against the shock of the size and scale we are talking about, then there is going to be enormous damage. In these circumstances I think the country will say and I think markets will respect that this is the most sensible thing to do. The government is clear that a fiscally responsible approach sits at the heart of our plans but we cannot fail to respond to the magnitude of the moment. He said the plan announced today would provide certainty “in the medium term”, and would not just be a “sticking plaster” solution. He said: We are not looking here at sticking plaster solutions. We want a lasting settlement that provides both comfort and clarity for both households and businesses. This is a major attempt to draw a line and provide energy certainty for everybody in this country about energy usage in the medium term. He rejected suggestions that the increase in borrowing being announced today would be excessive, or that it would alarm the financial markets. He said: If you look at the UK’s most recent round of debt issuance, that was well-covered. There was much more demand for our debt than was needed to cover the latest auction. We are paying around three per cent for our debt. That is a perfectly sustainable level. The UK is obviously a very stable, very strong economy, subject to a very clear regulatory system and the rule of law. We are a safe bet and a safe haven as we always are, frankly, in these kind of situations. He came close to confirming that Truss will announce an end to the ban on fracking today – but he stressed that this was not a “miracle solution” to the energy supply crisis. Simon Clarke, the new levelling up secretary, was on the morning interview round on behalf of the government this morning. Echoing what his boss said at PMQs yesterday, he said imposing a new windfall tax on energy companies would be a mistake. He told LBC: These firms are the people we are going to be absolutely relying on to deliver that next generation of oil and gas extraction on the route to energy self-sufficiency. We need to go much, much further in getting new fields on line. That is why we need these companies to be ploughing that investment into the North Sea. We cannot do what Labour would do, which is just tax, tax, tax. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, was also on the Today programme this morning where he restated Labour’s call for a windfall tax to be used to part fund a rescue pacakge for energy bills. He said the government’s argument that this would deter investment was “bogus”. And he said Truss’s decision to rule out the idea showed the government had shifted to the right. He said: This investment argument is completely bogus; that it would have a damaging effect on business. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, says it wouldn’t have a damaging effect. This is a dogma, and I’m afraid we see a pattern here. This is a shift to the right by the Conservative party under Liz Truss. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak actually eventually ended up agreeing with our idea of a windfall tax. Now we have a government that is setting its face against it purely on the basis of dogma. Good morning. Liz Truss has been prime minister for less than 48 hours, but she is about to make an announcement that could define her premiership. If her plan to prevent energy bills soaring backfires or crashes, then it is hard to see how she recovers. But if it gets a positive reception, then Truss, whose ratings with the public at large are very poor, and her party, which is trailing badly behind Labour in the polls, could be on a path to recovery. Here is our overnight splash setting out what we are expecting. And here is an analysis from my colleague Archie Bland, who has examined the plan in his First Edition briefing. This morning Labour has renewed its attack on Truss for failing to considing using a windfall tax to part fund the energy rescue package. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, told the BBC: We know from the Treasury that there are £170bn of excess profits being made by the energy companies. We believe a windfall tax must be part of the solution to that, that is the fair thing to do, that is the right thing to do. I am afraid that Liz Truss is making a terrible mistake by setting her face against that, because in the end, higher borrowing will have to be paid for somehow and it will end up falling back on the British people, and she’s leaving money on the table that these companies are making. But there was a much more encouraging response for Truss from Martin Lewis, the consumer champion and founder of the MoneySavingExpert website. Lewis is the go-to expert on consumer issues – the equivalent of John Curtice on elections, or Paul Johnson on the IFS on budgets – and he has been described as one of the most trusted men in Britain. An endorsement from him really counts, and on the Today programme this morning he gave a qualified welcome to what Truss is doing. He said: I have said we have a catastophe coming in winter. By January we expect to see the [energy] price cap to be 120% higher than it is right now, more than double. And my great call has always been that we need to have political will to do something. Well, I think we do now have the political will. And I very much welcome the plans that are being rumoured to come out today. They are not perfect. Then again, I’ve not seen any solution that’s perfect. They are not the panacea. But they will meet millions, if not tens of millions of people, will breathe a sigh of relief that will be they will be able to afford their energy bills this winter. But clearly there will need to be some further work done looking at the very poorest in society to make sure that they can get through this. We need clarification on whether the remaining payments on benefits, the payments for those disabilities that were planned and announced in May, are still going to come through. But I think we have to be fair here. And as someone who has has been begging and pleading that more help comes out, well, this is more help. The great benefits of this policy is that it helps everyone. The great problem with this policy is that it helps everyone. It means wealthy people like me also get our bills cut. But, absolutely big picture, I think we need to welcome that something is being done, and that the political will has changed. I will be focusing almost exclusively on the Truss announcement today. It will come after 11.15am, when Truss will unveil the plan in a speeech in the Commons opening a general debate on energy costs. Unusually, she has chosen to make the announcement in this format rather than through a normal ministerial statement – which would have required her to answer questions about her plans for more than an hour. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.
