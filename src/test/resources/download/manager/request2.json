Now, sadly, we get to discover which of us was right.' That kind of divided feeling about the peace with Jordan reflects the worry on the Israeli street. Outside the Jerusalem bus station David Berger observed: 'The king is the one who wanted the peace more than his people. But the peace is a real peace.' However, the more popular view was that voiced by Esther Levy: 'The king donated a lot for the peace because of his personality. Everything is due to the king. He shaped it. I don't think it's a real peace between our two countries.' This may have been the first time Israelis could watch their leaders joining as a matter of course in a Middle Eastern event with such avowed enemies as President Hafez al-Assad of Syria - even though 20 years have passed since Israel's initial Arab peace breakthrough with Egypt's late president, Anwar Sadat. Israel's relations with the Arab world is still likely to be the issue - more than economic problems and personality contests - in the acrimonious campaign now beginning for the May 17 general election. Most important, it is the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who is the key mover in the efforts to push the debate in that direction. While yesterday's funeral went on in Amman, Israeli flags were lowered to half mast as a tribute to a past enemy who became a symbol of peacemaking. To ordinary Israelis, Hussein was more than a peace partner and friend; they saw him as something of a father figure. Some even referred to him as 'our king'. Any lingering ambivalence about him had long been laid to rest. He won Israeli hearts with a moving euology at the 1995 funeral of their assassinated prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and few Israeli eyes stay dry when they see reruns of news footage of the way two years ago the king knelt in homage before a bereaved Israeli mother whose daughter was one of seven schoolgirls shot dead by a Jordanian soldier while on a school outing. Nor has the political significance of the Israeli leaders' participation in the funeral and the future of Israeli-Jordanian strategic ties escaped notice. Solidarity and continuity are as much key words on Israel's side of the Jordan River as they have been in Amman whenever in the past three weeks the question of what Hussein's death might mean has come up. Mr Netanyahu continually makes the point that he believes the new king's declaration of readiness to preserve his father's legacy. He has also reminded interviewers repeatedly that the strategic relationship is as much in Jordan's as in Israel's interest. But he conveniently sidesteps questions about another facet of Hussein's political message. The late Jordanian ruler may have won an unchallenged reputation as the Middle East peacemaker par excellence, but he also consistently chided Mr Netanyahu and his government for delaying peace and not living up to their obligations in the accords which the king helped the Americans to bring about. Any underlying Israeli concern about Jordan at present has less to do with the kingdom remaining a stable buffer for the foreseeable future than with whether King Abdullah might choose to continue voicing the same public complaints about Israeli foot dragging as his late father. The Jordanian drama has been consistent front-page news in Israel for the past three weeks. Yesterday Israeli television carried live the entire the six-hour funeral. Some see that kind of focus on an Arab king as an integral part of the Israelis' continuing struggle to find their place in the Middle East. 'Psychologically this could turn out to be something of a watershed,' said Chemi Shalev, a political analyst. 'Israelis grieving for an Arab monarch and identifying with the mourning of an Arab nation is something that has never happened before. Long term it could have a profound impact on the Israeli psyche.' But he added: 'It is most unlikely to affect Israeli attitudes or voting patterns in the coming election.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/feb/09/uk.politicalnews6","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-09T01:26:09Z","webTitle":"Reform of nursing watchdog 'will offer greater degree of protection'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/09/uk.politicalnews6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/feb/09/uk.politicalnews6","fields":{"headline":"Reform of nursing watchdog 'will offer greater degree of protection'","bodyText":"The Government is to scrap the nurses' disciplinary body, the United Kingdom Central Council, and the four national boards that oversee education because they are perceived not to be safeguarding the public, the Guardian has learned. They will be replaced by a single organisation with a substantial lay membership dedicated to protecting the patient and the professional. Today the Department of Health will publish a report commissioned two years ago following an outcry over revelations that the UKCC had let convicted sex offenders return to work as nurses after being debarred for a few years from the register. More recently, there have been serious concerns about the inability of the UKCC to take any form of action against Deborah Parry, one of the two nurses accused of the murder of 55-year-old Yvonne Gilford in Saudi Arabia, who is now working in a private hospital in Surrey. Because the Saudi authorities did not provide any proof of her conviction, said the UKCC last autumn, it was powerless to act. It is now considering what to do about Lucille McLauchlan, following her conviction for stealing from a patient in Scotland. Ministers will today accept most recommendations of the report, from J M Consulting, which proposes that not only the UKCC, which regulates nurses, midwives and health visitors, but also the four national boards, which rule nursing education, be scrapped. The UKCC has 60 members at present. The new body will have up to 27, and not more than two-thirds of those will be professionals. The rest will be lay members. The report says present arrangements do not properly safeguard patients, and criticises the UKCC for being too large and unwieldy. The level of proof needed before any nurse can be struck off the register is too high, the report suggests, saying it is stacked in favour of the professional rather than the patient. At the moment, no nurse, midwife or health visitor can be struck off unless the charges against them are proved beyond reasonable doubt. Yet, as far as the test used in the civil courts - the balance of probabilities - is concerned, a nurse or doctor may be maiming their patients but still be considered fit to practise by their regulatory body. The report suggests that the criminal test should apply if it is a matter of striking a nurse off the register, but that if the case is proved on the balance of probabilities, the disciplinary body should be able to administer a reprimand. The Government wants to consult on this proposal. The new body should have a wider and more flexible range of powers than the UKCC currently possesses, says the report. It should be able to subpoena documents at the investigating stage, which it cannot do currently. It should have powers of suspension and conditional registration. The four national boards, says the report, should go because they have produced contradictions and a lack of clarity about the education of nurses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/feb/11/11","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-11T05:22:55Z","webTitle":"Smuggling costs £1bn in lost tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/feb/11/11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/feb/11/11","fields":{"headline":"Smuggling costs £1bn in lost tax","bodyText":"The total tax lost through cross-Channel alcohol and tobacco smuggling rose by more than 20 per cent during 1998, breaking through the £1 billion barrier for the first time, figures showed yesterday. On the most recent data, only 5 per cent of smuggled goods were detected by Customs &amp; Excise. Between 1997 and 1998, duty and VAT lost through imports of bootleg tobacco shot up by 27 per cent to £1 billion, while that lost through alcohol smuggling rose 22 per cent to £220 million. These figures do not include occasional large-scale bootlegging operations involving bulk freight loads, nor do they take into account smugglers travelling by air or smuggling via the illegal diversion of cargo allegedly bound for elsewhere in the European Union. The figures were published in a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), the Government's spending watchdog, which highlighted the scale of the roaring black market in duty-paid goods brought in from the Continent, where tax rates on drink, cigarettes and tobacco are much lower than those in the United Kingdom. The illicit trade has been made possible by the European single market, implemented in 1993, which allows consumers to bring in unlimited quantities of such goods for private consumption. NAO chief John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, noted that 100 additional Customs officers have been deployed both at ports and inland to battle with the bootleggers. But the outlay behind this initiative - £35 million -to pull in an extra £80 million in revenue over the same period would yield just £2.30 for every £1 spent, well below the Inland Revenue average of £39.43 brought in for every £1 spent on anti-dodging measures. But it is lower even than the £5.31 yielded by every pound spent in fighting benefit fraud by the Department of Social Security. Customs said it expected comfortably to exceed the £80 million target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/feb/13/features.jobsmoney26","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-13T03:13:45Z","webTitle":"Another mountain to climb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/13/features.jobsmoney26","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/feb/13/features.jobsmoney26","fields":{"headline":"Another mountain to climb","bodyText":"Pippa Wicks is on the move again. She hit the headlines six years ago when, aged 30, she was appointed as Courtaulds Textiles' new finance director. Next month, after being head-hunted by media group Pearson she is to lead their Internet training team. Ms Wicks is a high achiever in every sense. She is the kind of executive who takes up the kind of intimidating pursuits to match her job. She's not only climbing the slippery slope during business hours, she enjoys real mountains, like the Himalayas, in her time off. \"I love to travel. I've recently been to the kingdom of Bhutan via India. I liked it there and was impressed by the local people and got interested in Buddhism.\" One glance tells you she's no Glenn Hoddle. Her reincarnation started at Oxford, where she was studying for a degree in zoology but made the \"difficult decision\" to give up scientific training and switch to management consultancy. With a science degree: \"I wasn't afraid of numbers,\" she says. She was ready to make the switch. That's when she decided to join management consultants, Bain &amp; Co, in 1984. She already had the taste for exotic travel as her research had sent her and a team to Jamaica for four months. The project was to try to save the parrot population which the locals were selling for up to $3,000 apiece. The trouble was that the local entrepreneurs were cutting down 200-year-old trees to get at the birds. \"We had a success at raising awareness at what was going on,\" she says modestly. \"But,\" she adds, \"I wanted to work with people, not animals, and so I joined Bain. I liked it at Bain because it was a total meritocracy. We worked with a lot of industries and I gained a variety of experiences for a total of eight years. It was not a case of sitting in an office and thinking of how to solve a problem but getting on and doing it.\" But the big break came with the move to Courtaulds. \"I wanted to get into general management and run a business and make contact with customers. I nearly passed out with surprise when I was offered the job of finance director at Courtaulds. I had been used to working with numbers and profits and sales reports were no mystery to me,\" she says. The company said that she was chosen because she was young, female and was not qualified for the job, an unlikely set of requirements. But it appears to have worked out for both parties. \"In the past two and a half years we have had a new boss and a new team running the place. We have focused down and sold off 20 businesses. We have sharpened the cutting edge and done it in a controlled fashion.\" Ms Wicks has sharpened her fashion sense too since being there. \"Remember, Marks &amp; Spencer is our biggest customer and I have changed my dress sense. I'm a bit more fashionable and a bit less the boring businesswoman,\" she says. Like many other high-flying businesswomen, who dine at the smart restaurants and frequent chic wine bars, she is dedicated to her career. Colleagues describe her as dynamic, very decisive and with the ability for lateral thinking. Pearson has four offices up and running - as far apart as the US and Kuala Lumpur - using traditional teaching methods as well as the Internet and e-mail. Ms Wicks says: \"I am going there because Pearson felt right. The new operation will combine the group's existing FT Management business, including the Open College and the Heriot-Watt University distance-learning MBA course, with its 8,000 active students. It also boasts the large range of management titles Pearson acquired when it bought Simon and Schuster last year. \"Pearson is the right place to be,\" she says. \"My grand plan for the new job, is to make our logo for long-distance education just as recognisable as that of Microsoft. When you want to get a degree or upgrade one, or when a company wants to send a team on a training course, I want you to think of FT Management. Furthermore, it's a global business, stretching from here to the US and Asia and back again.\" Ms Wicks, unlike a lot of business executives, actually goes out to the cinema and theatre and has already got her travelling plans set in her head. Next stop is the Shetlands and then maybe Peru and she is looking forward to the move. \"My offices will be in Covent Garden,\" she says. \"I'm really looking forward to that. It's a nice place to be and Pearson is the right place to be.\" She says: \"I believe in education. I think it's important, very important to believe, really believe in education.\" I believe her."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/1999/feb/13/saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-13T03:14:48Z","webTitle":"Car licence in sight for Saudi women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/13/saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/13/saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Car licence in sight for Saudi women","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia may soon allow women to drive, which could be the most significant advance for women since girls were allowed to go to school in the 1960s. Rumours that the shura council, (parliament) is debating the issue are so strong that some believe the government has leaked the news to test whether the sexually segregated Saudi society is ready for such a controversial step. A senior diplomat in Riyadh said recently that specific conditions were being discussed, such as allowing only married women over 35 to drive, between 7am and 7pm, with the written authority of their mahram - male guardian. 'The process of building consensus for taking the decision appears to be under way,' the diplomat said. How the state can end the ban while keeping the strong religious hierarchy and opposing liberal forces happy remains to be seen, but many women say they will take whatever comes their way. just to be able to get behind the wheel. 'I have hoped for this for years,' one said. 'All the women I know want it but it's not in our hands. This is the first time it has been discussed so seriously. I hope they will allow us to start driving, even with conditions, rather than rejecting the idea without even trying. 'People here have grown up with the idea that women don't drive. When they go abroad, children are shocked when they see women driving. Men aren't used to the idea. The problem will be getting society to accept it, particularly men. We're a closed, segregated society which doesn't accept the idea of women going out on their own.' Saudis say the state may have been prompted to start discussing the idea by the money that could be saved by sacking 500,000 foreign chauffeurs at a time when weak oil prices have lost the kingdom $15 billion in income. Many Saudis say the ban has more to do with the country's traditions than its Islamic faith, pointing to the fact that women used to ride camels in the Prophet Mohammed's time. Women say it would be better from a religious standpoint to drive their own cars than have to be alone with a strange man. The ban is particularly frustrating to working women, who complain that they are left at the mercy of their drivers. 'When I came here I felt I had become crippled,' said a recently arrived expatriate woman. Saudi women's grumbles have grown as the number in work has increase. An estimated 240,000 have jobs and the number is likely to grow. There are 600,000 foreign women working in Saudi Arabia, which has a population of 14 million. 'I used to drive when I lived in Cairo and London,' a Saudi woman said. 'But here I have a driver. 'It's hell when he goes on holiday. There's no reliable public transport system and I could stand on the corner of my street for a month before I see a taxi. It's not like London, where I used to call a cab on my mobile.' Buses do not run regularly and have only a couple of rows of seats for women at the back. The driving ban is just one manifestation of the impact on women's lives of Saudi Arabia's strict Wahabi sect of Islam. Women must be covered and must be accompanied by a male relative in public, education is sexually segregated, and women are encouraged to seek work in fields traditionally reserved for them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/1999/feb/15/artsfeatures","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-15T02:49:03Z","webTitle":"Opera review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/feb/15/artsfeatures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/feb/15/artsfeatures","fields":{"headline":"Opera review","bodyText":"Wagner called it a Buhnenweihfestspiel - a 'festival drama to consecrate a stage' - and performances of Parsifal have been special events ever since. ENO's new production is the first in Britain for 11 years, and the first in two generations here that gets anywhere near to measuring out the full complexity of this unclassifiable work. There is profound thoughtfulness behind every detail of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's staging, while under Mark Elder the music takes on the numinous glow that Parsifal uniquely demands, and the cast led by Gwynne Howell's masterly Gurnemanz, Kathryn Harries' intense Kundry and Kim Begley's lucid, unforced Parsifal, has no weak links whatsoever. Lehnhoff purges the work of many of its Christian trappings: there is no grail, no rite of communion at the end of the first act. The knights belong to an unnamed cult that seems to have transported itself to the alien, threatening world conjured up in the bleak masonry of Raimund Bauer's sweeping set; Parsifal's appearance, with his war paint and animal skins, suggests he comes from a native people, part of the outside world from which the grail knights have removed themselves. Not everything in that long, intense first span of narration (articulated by Howell with immense intelligence and care for the meaning of every word of Richard Stokes's exemplary translation) quite works; details sometimes jar. Why, for instance, is Amfortas's wound in his side, pointing up the Christ parallel when so much else plays down such symbolism, and why, as Gurnemanz tells Parsifal about travelling through space and time to the Grail Hall, do they sway together in time with the music like two old soaks on a boozy night out? After that, though, the grip on the dramatic trajectory is as clear as Elder's control of the musical one. Klingsor's Flowermaidens are a frumpy, unsexy lot - in grey, shapeless frocks with petaloid sleeves and curious headgear which might be more botanical imagery but equally could replicate the testicles that Klingsor (Peter Sidhom, commanding of voice, slightly camp of demeanour) has traded to gain his magical powers. But the whole act builds effortlessly towards the confrontation between Kundry and Parsifal. Harries here is magnificent: she too is hampered by her costume - curious carapaces, which she sheds periodically as her efforts to seduce Parsifal get more desperate, yet which seem designed to minimise her allure - but every phrase is invested with such passion, and her stage presence is so consistently vital that the most complex and troubling character in the whole of Wagner for once gains a whole human dimension. When Parsifal destroys Klingsor's magic kingdom, only wasteland remains, and the third act becomes an endgame of Beckettian bleakness. The grail knights' disintegration is complete; Gurnemanz keeps watch by a pit that holds the mummified remains of his colleagues, while a railway track leads off the stage into infinity. Even Parsifal's arrival offers no quick fix - he may be crowned king, and Amfortas (Jonathan Summers, committed if a bit histrionic) is released from his suffering, but the final moments make it clear that this is only a temporary remission. As Parsifal places his crown on the rotting corpse of Titurel (which Amfortas has desperately cradled earlier in the act), he signals that the knights have lost their leadership for ever. As the curtain falls, he and Kundry lead them all off along the railway track into oblivion - her future now seems entirely dependent on his, and their steadily evolving relationship has been one of the most fascinating and moving aspects of the third-act ritual. Every element of this imagery feels right, and takes on enormous significance. For once in this opera, what happens on stage provides a real counterweight to the power of the score. And Elder's unflagging control of all that musical apparatus - the offstage instruments, the extra choruses dispersed around the Coliseum, the lustrous tone he draws from the orchestra, the natural pacing of every section - puts the seal on one of ENO's most notable achievements in recent years. \u0095 Performances of Parsifal continue at the Coliseum until March 19.

There are no grounds for assuming that because one genetically manipulated potato produces toxic effects that all genetic manipulations will prove similarly toxic. Dr Puzstai's potato was deliberately manipulated to produce lectins which were known to be toxic. How on earth can that work then be a justification for a general moratorium on all genetically modified plants. We already have arrangements to regulate laboratory practice, to assess toxicology, to assess the environmental impact of genetically modified crops and to assess the impact as food through the Advisory Committee on Novel Food and Processes. That regulatory process stands between a laboratory observation and the consumer. Monsanto has been wrong and stupid to try to bludgeon its way through to the market place. Genetically modified food should be labelled, no matter what the regulatory safeguards, so that people have a choice. The whole regulatory process needs to be more open and receptive to objections. That is very different from the blanket moratorium that is being called for. All we are hearing in the present debate is the negative aspect of biotechnology. There is the potential, for example, for plants to be created that enable arid and saline soil to be cultivated. In the future, the nutritional value of crops may be enhanced and pharmaceuticals and other chemicals may be grown and harvested in sustainable regimes. In all this, Britain is one of the leaders. We should not sacrifice that as a result of a frenzy of unreasoned assertion. Nigel Beard MP. Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology. You report that there are calls for an independent ethics commission on genetically engineered food.

Hilary Jolly, a retired typesetter from Cambridge, won the competition jointly with Paul Bryan, also from Cambridge, whose composition, entitled St Paul's Cathedral, accompanies Mrs Jolly's hymn, Through the Darkness of the Ages. Presenting the prizes, the dean of St Paul's, the Very Rev John Moses, announced there would be an eight-hour bell peel to welcome in 2000, inadvertently prompting the idea of a mass exodus on New Year's Day in the minds of central London residents. The bell ringers were excited, he said. Local residents, anticipating millennium-sized hangovers, may be less so. The dean said the millennium would be a turning point for Christians, and that the hymn competition was only one part of the cathedral celebrations. 'We want to enter 2000 in prayer and in celebration,' he said. 'The single most important thing that the church does is to worship God, and if the millennium is not a good reason to commission new hymns, then I don't know what is.' The winners were chosen from 553 entries from the United Kingdom and overseas. Entrants from the United States numbered 51; there was one from Belgium. Canon Michael Saward, who chaired the judging panel, said the chief disappointment had been the lack of winning lyrics and tunes from those under 35, suggesting a generation had grown up more familiar with informal songs of worship. All entries had to be in double metre, and 'look backwards and forwards with hope'. Mrs Jolly said that though she felt positive writing the hymn, she had strongly negative feelings about the millennium. 'I am sickened by the hype, which is pagan and most unpleasant,' she said. Of the Millennium Dome she commented: 'It is a temple to man and some of the less pleasant things that humanity comprises. 'I'm particularly distressed that the centrepiece is a giant human figure, when the millennium is about God not man.' Mr Bryan, the director of music at St John's College School, Cambridge, said his music offset major and minor keys to create contrast. 'The image I had was one of a great ceremony. I aimed to write with space and dignity.' He felt the music suited Mrs Jolly's words. However, the poet, Roger McGough, thought that the winning words represented a missed opportunity. The first stanza begins: 'Through the darkness of the ages/through the sorrows of the days/strength of weary generations/lifting hearts in hope and praise', before concluding on a more hopeful note: 'When, as lightning leaps the heavens/you return to lead us home.' 'The hymn is very traditional,' said Mr McGough, 'We can open any page of the Victorian hymnal and choose the words used from there, lots of sorrow and lightning striking. It is safe within the confines of this century, and people will feel safe with it. But it doesn't spark the poet.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/17/6","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-17T04:09:34Z","webTitle":"The blood-drenched dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/17/6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/17/6","fields":{"headline":"The blood-drenched dream","bodyText":"Kurds climbing on roofs, taking hostages, tussling with the police and occupying embassies in a dozen countries across Europe yesterday threw an unusually bright spotlight on this nation without a state. Turkish attempts to track down 'Apo' Ocalan, the fugitive secretary-general of the PKK, have generated much heat - about terrorism, double standards, national liberation and international law. There will be more as he tries to use the dock of an Ankara military court as a platform to speak out for his people. Not since the mass flight of Iraqi Kurds from a vengeful Saddam Hussein in the terrible aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War has so much attention been paid to a people who, in their famously self-pitying but accurate phrase, have 'no friends but the mountains.' Kurds are used to anonymity. Their numbers (between 20 and 25 million) disputed, they have found it hard to impress their distinct identity on a world in which they are split by geography between five countries and politically and economically marginalised within them. But it is hard to imagine, awareness of their unfulfilled statehood heightened amid affirmations of the rights of minorities, that the Kurds will sink again into the romantic, baggy-trousered obscurity they once enjoyed. 'Today they have emerged not quite yet as a coherent nation,' says their historian, 'nevertheless as an ethnic community that can no longer be ignored'(1). Kurds are not an 'imagined community', though their sense of identity, unlike that, say, of the rebellious ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, is not based on unity of language or religion. The southern and northern Kurdish dialects, Sorani and Kurmanji, are not mutually understandable, while there are several million speakers of more distantly related dialects, closer to Farsi, the language of Iran. Most are Sunni Muslims, but many Turkish Kurds belong to the heterodox Alevi sect. Unsurprisingly, this scattered people of warriors, nomads and small farmers have never enjoyed national independence. The concept was unthinkable in the Ottoman empire, where most lived in 'mountainous irrelevancy' from the 16th to the early 20th century. The Kurds' best-ever chance of freedom came in 1918, when President Woodrow Wilson's support for self-determination re-drew the map of the post-Hapsburg and post-Ottoman world, but was defeated by the British, French and Turks, who all had their own ideas. Tribal, regional and sectarian differences ensured that the Kurds, known for their 'irrepressible tendency for feuding', remained weak and divided, though British-ruled Iraq in the early 1920s provided their first guarantees of partial cultural freedom, a tradition continued by the Arab nationalist and Ba'athist regimes that followed the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958. In Turkey it was a different story from the start. Kemal Ataturk, father of the modern state, swept aside the Allied demands for freedom of language and culture that had been written into the Treaty of Lausanne. Then, as later, Turkey's political and strategic importance (for containing the Soviet Union) overrode other considerations. In the chaotic interlude between the end of the second world war and the onset of the cold war, Iranian Kurds set up the short-lived, Soviet-backed Mahabad republic, only to see it quickly crushed by the central government in Tehran, which afterwards, under shah and ayatollah alike, effectively suppressed all Kurdish political aspirations. Kurds have had a bad 20th century. 'Isolation, ignorance, government manipulation and barely imagined repression, bad luck, bad faith and outright treachery all figured in the reckoning,' writes one recent chronicler. 'So did economic migration, political deportation and underdevelopment, which weakened traditional ties' (2). Fragmented and weak, they have been particularly vulnerable to manipulation by outside powers with far wider agendas. Iran and Syria have both backed Kurdish groups in Iraq and Turkey - Ocalan's enforced flight began when Syria's President Hafez al-Assad suddenly dropped him last autumn. Iraq has backed Iranian Kurds. Iraqi Kurds have been financed, armed and trained by the United States, Israel, and more recently by the US again. The Americans tried to use them, with huge cash expenditure but little lasting success, in the unending struggle against Saddam Hussein. But it's inside Turkey that the Kurdish struggle has been most complex and costly, giving Ocalan his notoriety and reinforcing hatreds and suspicions that have been exported with the Gastarbeiter to Germany and the heart of Europe. Turkey is enormously sensitive to these issues, berating its critics for being soft on terrorism. The PKK has routinely murdered innocent Kurds, especially alleged collaborators, as well as Turks -but for their part the Turks have largely ignored or under-played well-founded evidence of routine torture and other human rights abuses. The country's powerful military and security apparatus has succeeded, crucially, in keeping violence out of the cities and convincing the rest of the world that what happens in Diyarbakir does not affect the stability of the state itself(3). Turkey was winning its military war against the PKK before Ocalan was captured, and his failure to find long-term refuge in Europe testified eloquently to international wariness about harbouring such a hot potato. But though Ocalan's demise could be a fatal blow to the PKK, it by no means puts an end to Turkey's Kurdish problem. Ankara may now try to isolate the PKK from moderate Kurds, though recent harassment of members of the autonomist - and legal - Hadep party do not augur well. Turkey's success in getting its man may paradoxically now make it easier for critics to drive home their concerns - the same ones which lay behind the European Union's refusal to consider Ankara's application for membership. Kurds have lowered their expectations. Few, if any, now expect ever to have their own 200,000 contiguous square miles of independent, sovereign Kurdistan. Ocalan used to mock the Iraqi Kurdish leaders, Mustafa Barzani and Jalal Talabani, for their readiness to discuss autonomy with Saddam Hussein, even meeting the notorious 'Chemical' Ali Hassan al-Majid, who gassed the Kurds at Halabja in 1988. But Ocalan himself moved away from his original vision of a Kurdish state several years ago, settling instead for self-rule or cultural rights for a national minority - far more relevant to the three million Kurds living in Istanbul than a dream of a kingdom that the regional and international powers will never accept. In that sense, little has changed this century. As a Manchester Guardian leader put it in 1925, just after the suppression of a big Kurdish revolt: 'The rising has been put down but its consequences are still alive. Undisciplined tribesmen were not to be expected to offer any serious resistance to a big-scale campaign. But they remain in defeat Turkish citizens, and therefore, a Turkish minority problem.' Of the two largest groups of Kurds, Iraq's face an uncertain future as long as Saddam Hussein rules in Baghdad. And while the Ocalan trial will allow Turkey to display his crimes, it will be miscalculating if it believes the Kurdish issue can be criminalised out of existence.

Regulations have been changed to allow teaching as an official occupation which holidaymakers from the ages of 17 to 27 can take up while they work their passage through Britain. As a result, one of the main teaching agencies in London now says it has more than 1,000 working holidaymakers in London alone employed as supply teachers, according to Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman. Previous Foreign Office regulations banned holidaymakers from the Commonwealth taking teaching jobs. It was stipulated that teaching was more than 'incidental to the holiday' and for more than 25 hours a week. Another rule also barred people developing their professional career while on holiday in Britain. Now official figures show that there are 12,280 occasional teachers in England, with 2100 in London. Mr Foster said yesterday: 'Three years ago working holidaymakers could be thrown out of the UK for pursuing a teaching career fulltime over here. Now the education service in London is dependent on them. This is an illustration of the recruitment crisis which has developed in our schools, especially in London and the south-east.' Official figures from the Department for Education show that the London boroughs with the highest number of occasional teachers include areas where there has been a traditional shortage of staff. They include Newham, Barking, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, and Haringey. Outside London areas include Birmingham, Bristol, Merseyside, Leeds and Devon. Mr Foster has tabled questions to Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, demanding to know the full extent of the number of visas that have been issued to working holidaymakers in the United Kingdom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/feb/17/kurds4","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-17T15:22:24Z","webTitle":"The blood-drenched dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/17/kurds4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/feb/17/kurds4","fields":{"headline":"The blood-drenched dream","bodyText":"Kurds climbing on roofs, taking hostages, tussling with the police and occupying embassies in a dozen countries across Europe yesterday threw an unusually bright spotlight on this nation without a state. Turkish attempts to track down 'Apo' Ocalan, the fugitive secretary-general of the PKK, have generated much heat - about terrorism, double standards, national liberation and international law. There will be more as he tries to use the dock of an Ankara military court as a platform to speak out for his people. Not since the mass flight of Iraqi Kurds from a vengeful Saddam Hussein in the terrible aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War has so much attention been paid to a people who, in their famously self-pitying but accurate phrase, have 'no friends but the mountains.' Kurds are used to anonymity. Their numbers (between 20 and 25 million) disputed, they have found it hard to impress their distinct identity on a world in which they are split by geography between five countries and politically and economically marginalised within them. But it is hard to imagine, awareness of their unfulfilled statehood heightened amid affirmations of the rights of minorities, that the Kurds will sink again into the romantic, baggy-trousered obscurity they once enjoyed. 'Today they have emerged not quite yet as a coherent nation,' says their historian, 'nevertheless as an ethnic community that can no longer be ignored'(1). Kurds are not an 'imagined community', though their sense of identity, unlike that, say, of the rebellious ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, is not based on unity of language or religion. The southern and northern Kurdish dialects, Sorani and Kurmanji, are not mutually understandable, while there are several million speakers of more distantly related dialects, closer to Farsi, the language of Iran. Most are Sunni Muslims, but many Turkish Kurds belong to the heterodox Alevi sect. Unsurprisingly, this scattered people of warriors, nomads and small farmers have never enjoyed national independence. The concept was unthinkable in the Ottoman empire, where most lived in 'mountainous irrelevancy' from the 16th to the early 20th century. The Kurds' best-ever chance of freedom came in 1918, when President Woodrow Wilson's support for self-determination re-drew the map of the post-Hapsburg and post-Ottoman world, but was defeated by the British, French and Turks, who all had their own ideas.

This is the fifth in a series of articles about living with the Net Seek and ye shall find,\" says the New Testament. Internet users often find only frustration. If choosing between the Excites, Yahoo!s, AltaVistas and Googles isn't enough, you have to wade through pages of \"matches\" that don't. The answer is to understand how the search engines operate and then make them work for you. There are three types of search available: directories, like Yahoo!; search engines, like AltaVista; and specialised services such as Research It! The key is to know which one to start with, and that means taking a look under the hood. Internet directories, of which Yahoo! is the best known, are built by people. They are WWW Yellow Pages, with sites organised into sections called categories. Each category represents a specific type of information, say Firearms Retailers or French Philosophers. Web site operators ask the directory to include their site. The directory owner checks out the Web site and eventually adds it to the appropriate section. Adding your All Saints' fan site to Yahoo! is as simple as finding the appropriate category, say Rock and Pop, clicking the Suggest a Site button and typing in its Web address or URL (uniform resource locator). You can find The Guardian's Web site listed in the section Regional: Countries: United Kingdom: News and Media: Newspapers on www.yahoo.co.uk. There's even a review of the paper's Web site included. The reviews can help you choose from a long list of apparently similar sites. Yahoo! is great for finding a specific company or group. For example, finding the Virgin Megastore is as simple as typing \"Virgin Megastore\" into the search box. The quotation marks tell Yahoo! to look for the exact phrase \"Virgin Megastore\". Without them Yahoo! can choose to take the words you type in any order. When searching Yahoo! use as many words as possible. Just asking for \"Virgin\" brings up sites on the Virgin Islands, the Virgin Prunes and Vestal Virgins. The more specific you are, the better the match up to a point. If you're not getting any matches, try dropping a few words. If you can't find a specific site, try guessing its category, then search for that category - just like using the Yellow Pages. Try searching laterally if you can't guess the category. Suppose you want to find The Guardian's site but can't spell Guardian. Search for another newspaper, for instance \"Financial Times\", and Yahoo!'s results will show the FT's category. Click on the category and you've got a list of all the UK newspapers Yahoo knows about. AltaVista's database of Web pages is built without human intervention. A program called Scooter trawls the Web looking for changes to Web sites. Its daily bounty of about 10 million pages is merged with a database of more than 140 million pages. Scooter is just one of a number of so-called spiders that crawl around the Web looking for pages. When a page is found its text is read, the words in it are indexed and the results stored in a database. When you visit AltaVista, your search is compared against the database to give a list of relevant pages. AltaVista attempts to order its results by assuming that you are more interested in pages that have your search words in their title, or when they appear very frequently, or close together. You can give AltaVista hints. Put title: in front of your search words and it returns only Web pages which have them in the title. Put link: followed by the URL of a Web site and you get a list of all pages linked to that site. And, just like Yahoo!, enclosing a phrase in quotation marks narrows the search. Read more at www.altavista.com/av/content/help.htm To find anyone who's declared their love for Geri Halliwell, type \"love geri\" into AltaVistafor a list of all Web pages containing that phrase. Or to find Tony Blair's birthday so you can prepare his horoscope, enter \"tony blair\" followed by a space and then birthday. Notice how all these searches are in lower case? Most search engines ignore case, so you can save your shift finger by not bothering with it. The hardest job for search engines is giving you the results in the most relevant order. Newcomer Google orders sites by the number of other sites that link to them. The assumption is that if others link to it, you'll find it more useful. Others like Inference take your search words and pass them to multiple search engines in parallel. These meta-search engines do the finger work for you by querying the likes of Yahoo!, Lycos, AltaVista, InfoSeek and Excite all at once. They then sort out the results and serve up a single page of matches. Sometimes general approaches aren't useful. If you know the type of information you are looking for, specialised engines are handy: www.shareware.com specialises in listing shareware, www.download.com is a good place to look for a piece of software or a driver or patch for your existing machine, www.musicsearch.com has all things musical and there's the excellent but hard to say www.wwwomen.com Search \"Search Engines\" on Yahoo! to find others. Still need help? Surf over to Research It! where you can look up the meaning of words, translate languages, search the Bible, track a package or convert your pounds to euros. Often the simplest way to find a company on the Net is to guess. You can take a company name, tack on a www. and a .com or .co.uk and get the site without ever touching a search engine. Your friends will think you're an Internet wizard. Just don't tell them I told you how."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/feb/18/5","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-18T04:26:55Z","webTitle":"Island haven fears EU tax disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/18/5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/feb/18/5","fields":{"headline":"Island haven fears EU tax disaster","bodyText":"As the Isle of Man prepares to do battle with a United Kingdom government it sees sliding inevitably towards monetary union in Europe and the changes that would entail, local financiers are warning of the devastation the island would face if its buoyant financial sector collapsed. \"The finance sector keeps the island alive,\" said Sir Quentin Agnew-Somerville, baronet and insurance consultant. \"Without it, the Isle of Man would be like the Isle of Arran. It's about the same size as the Isle of Man but what has it got? A few seedy boarding houses and old hotels. \"If, for whatever reason, money was not allowed to come to the island and enjoy certain tax privileges, no one would come here. The island would just wither on the vine.\" Worried by ominous European noises about VAT harmonisation and tax havens, islanders have been engaged in fevered talk of the Isle of Man, a crown dependency which is not part of the EU, breaking its constitutional links with the UK and going it alone. Ministers in the island's government have sought to play down calls for independence - while acknowledging there could be big trouble ahead. Home affairs minister Alan Bell has warned that the British government could sell out the island's interests as it fights to protect its own in Europe. The fear is that Tony Blair would choose to defend financial institutions on the mainland rather than go to the stake for those trading offshore in and around Athol Street in the island's capital Douglas. That could spell disaster for the island, where one in six of its workers is employed in the money business, which generates almost 40 per cent of the local gross domestic product. \"While the UK is trying to defend its position, particularly to protect the City of London and its level of business, places like the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands may well be sacrificed to protect the greater good of the UK,\" said Mr Bell. \"There is a great deal at stake. If financial services go, the whole social fabric of the island could change very quickly.\" His warning comes as some islanders say the only answer may be independence. Earlier this month, the House of Keys, the lower house of the 1,000-year-old Manx parliament Tynwald, discussed a motion tabled by former treasury minister David Cannan calling for contingency plans for independence and for the Manx pound to be pegged to the US dollar. The move was headed off by the island's chief minister, Donald Gelling, and will not be discussed again till June. He and other Manx ministers fear that loose talk of independence could damage confidence in the island as a business centre. \"If we were to give the impression of uncertainty and instability, that might cause some of our larger employers to think twice about their longer-term commitment to the island's economy,\" said Mr Bell. Careless talk, in other words, could cost jobs. This is a powerful argument at a time when the Manx economy is doing very nicely: just 406 people (less than 1 per cent of the workforce) are looking for work and inflation is a paltry 1.6 per cent. Cynics claim much recent talk of UDI is based on little island-ism inflamed in part by British rightwingers and Euro-sceptics outraged by Oskar Lafontaine, the German finance minister, who last year called for tax harmonisation across the EU. Comments by Mario Monti, the single market commissioner, also sent shivers down a few Manx spines when he said: \"If you keep the tax haven for a few, you condemn the rest to a tax hell.\" The official line in Government Buildings in Douglas is that the Manx government must keep the closest of watches on Britain's dealings with Europe during the coming months. Mr Bell argues that if the island opts for independence it must do so for the right hard-nosed reasons. \"We have to make sure that we are not driven into independence by xenophobia. We have to have a clear-headed view of where we want the island to go and it has to be geared to what is in the best long-term interests of the Manx people - and in particular the Manx business community. \"It's quite foolish and irresponsible to claim that independence is the answer to all our problems. But I fear the debate is being generated more by anti-European hysteria and anti-Labour government feelings rather than by consideration of the island's needs.\" The Isle of Man's VAT rate is tied to that of Britain. But its direct taxation (income tax of just 15 and 20 per cent) is completely independent. Mr Bell suggested there could be big trouble if, in the interests of European tax harmonisation, the UK made any attempt to drive those rates up. The UK government has the responsibility for the good governance of the Isle of Man,\" he said. \"But I don't think it has ever legislated in any way to influence the taxation rate here. Any attempt to interfere now would be absolutely unprecedented and would cause major difficulties to the island and would hasten talk of independence.\" Sir Quentin claims such UK interference would have to be backed by force. \"The island's lieutenant and six men with fixed bayonets would have to order the Manx parliament to pass a law otherwise there would be no legality,\" he said. \"If this kind of threat comes, it's better for the island to go it alone. I can't see any alternative. Otherwise we become a rather seedy department of Cumbria.\" Bernard Moffatt, trade unionist and member of Mec Vannin, the Manx independence party, says the time is ripe for the Isle of Man to sever at last its constitutional links with Britain. \"For 50 years, we have have been climbing the ladder towards the high diving board,\" he said. \"We have now reached the end of that board and there is nowhere else to go except take the plunge into the world and see if we can survive as an independent state.\" Manx matters * The British government bought the Isle of Man for £70,000 in 1765. It is 32 miles long and 13 wide with a population of 72,000. * The island is a crown dependency with a lieutenant appointed by the Queen to act on her behalf. It is not part of the United Kingdom or the European Union. A general election is held every five years in November. * Basic rate income tax is 15 per cent, higher rate 20 per cent. There are no capital gains, capital transfer, wealth or inheritance taxes. No estate or death duties are levied. * The Manx government issues its own passports and banknotes. * The island's prominent local residents used to include Richard Adams, author of Watership Down, and still include comedian Norman Wisdom who is honoured with a statue by a bench outside the Marks and Spencer store in Douglas. * Tynwald, the Isle of Man's parliament, was established more than 1,000 years ago and is the oldest legislature in the world in continuous existence. * At a bridge on the road between the island's airport and Douglas, it is customary to say hello to the fairies. Fairy Bridge tea bags are a popular souvenir. * At the Celtavison Song Contest held in Killarney, Ireland, in the 1980s, a Manx folk band won the prize for the best song in a Celtic language.

Otherwise we become a rather seedy department of Cumbria.\" Bernard Moffatt, trade unionist and member of Mec Vannin, the Manx independence party, says the time is ripe for the Isle of Man to sever at last its constitutional links with Britain. \"For 50 years, we have have been climbing the ladder towards the high diving board,\" he said. \"We have now reached the end of that board and there is nowhere else to go except take the plunge into the world and see if we can survive as an independent state.\" Manx matters * The British government bought the Isle of Man for £70,000 in 1765. It is 32 miles long and 13 wide with a population of 72,000. * The island is a crown dependency with a lieutenant appointed by the Queen to act on her behalf. It is not part of the United Kingdom or the European Union. A general election is held every five years in November. * Basic rate income tax is 15 per cent, higher rate 20 per cent. There are no capital gains, capital transfer, wealth or inheritance taxes. No estate or death duties are levied. * The Manx government issues its own passports and banknotes. * The island's prominent local residents used to include Richard Adams, author of Watership Down, and still include comedian Norman Wisdom who is honoured with a statue by a bench outside the Marks and Spencer store in Douglas. * Tynwald, the Isle of Man's parliament, was established more than 1,000 years ago and is the oldest legislature in the world in continuous existence. * At a bridge on the road between the island's airport and Douglas, it is customary to say hello to the fairies. Fairy Bridge tea bags are a popular souvenir. * At the Celtavison Song Contest held in Killarney, Ireland, in the 1980s, a Manx folk band won the prize for the best song in a Celtic language. Three of the band's members were Hong Kong Chinese."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/feb/19/1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-19T03:56:42Z","webTitle":"BAe shares tumble over fears for Saudi arms deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/feb/19/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/feb/19/1","fields":{"headline":"BAe shares tumble over fears for Saudi arms deal","bodyText":"Shares in British Aerospace, the UK's largest defence company, tumbled on the stock market yesterday over concern about the future of its multi-billion pound Al Yamamah armaments contract with Saudi Arabia. By the close of business the shares had fallen 5 per cent to 412p. The Ministry of Defence and the company issued parallel statements \"categorically\" denying reports from the Gulf that Al Yamamah struck in the 1980s as a barter deal, swapping oil for weapons had been put on hold because of Saudi Arabia's growing economic difficulties. The Saudi economy has been hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices. The country's ruler, Prince Abdullah, is working on sweeping economic reforms to plug a 40 per cent hole in the budget resulting from falling energy prices. As part of cost-saving measures, other defence deals have already been axed. Jane's Defence Weekly reported this week that a $1.8 billion contract to buy an artillery system from South Africa has been put on hold because of financial stringency in the Kingdom. Yesterday's reports that the Al Yamamah contract could have hit difficulties first emerged from the Gulf and follow the recent visit to the region by the Defence Secretary, George Robertson. Defence sources indicated yesterday that the question of stopping future deliveries under Al Yamamah never came up during the meetings and that the Saudis had expressed their satisfaction with the conduct of the agreement. There has been investor concern since the first half of last year that BAe was not receiving the cash top-ups which are part of its oil barter arrangement with Saudi Arabia. However, the company made it clear at the time of the Marconi defence deal in January that the cash shortfalls had been made up. Nevertheless, with the oil price hovering around the $10-a-barrel mark and the big oil companies having to cut operations severely, the prospect of further problems remains. Saudi Arabia's difficulties have been seen by some oil majors as an opportunity to gain new access to its oil and natural gas reserves. The country is thought to be looking for up to $30 or $40 billion worth of investment in developing exploiting its natural gas facilities and modernising its oil extraction facilities to cope better with a new cheap oil era. The problems caused by the low oil price have been sufficiently severe for Riyadh that at least one leading US bank - Citibank - has placed the country on its \"watch list\" alongside countries such as Brazil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/feb/20/tonyblair","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-20T04:14:42Z","webTitle":"Mutants not to our taste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/20/tonyblair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/feb/20/tonyblair","fields":{"headline":"Mutants not to our taste","bodyText":"Will \"Frankenstein foods\" cause two-headed rabbits to sprout in fields otherwise denuded of life except for giant tomatoes?

Little has been announced about the film, except that it will be set on the expanding American railway network in the aftermath of the American Civil War, ie from about 1865 onwards. Barker wants the film to be a particularly American epic, in the same manner, he says, that Dracula and Frankenstein are perceived as specifically European stories. Barker, incidentally, was an executive producer on Gods And Monsters, the Oscar-nominated, semi-fictional portrait of English horror director James Whale, who made Frankenstein, The Bride Of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and The Old Dark House, and who is one of Barker's most revered antecedents in the horror genre. Nerd Heaven update Mouthbreathing computer nerds and four-eyed bedsit heliophobes will want to get out their best anoraks and celebrate now that it's been announced that Dungeons And Dragons - the game that comes close to being a nerd's secular religion, or lingua franca - is about to go before the cameras. Joel Silver's Silver Productions will be a partner in the project, and it'll be directed by 28-year-old first-timer Courtney Solomon. For those of you with lives, day-jobs, girlfriends, etc. who aren't in the know, D&amp;D-wise, the story tells of a young empress who teams up with a thief and a sorceress to track down an ancient artefact that will prevent the destruction of their kingdom and overthrow a wicked wizard. Etcetera. F/X buffs will be pleased to learn that the film will probably feature ten different monster/creatures and a final battle scene involving up to 75 dragons on the same screen. Double impact Jackie Chan seems finally to have cracked the American market, after several attempts to do so over the last 15 years or so. After the huge success last year of Rush Hour, which teamed him with motormouth comic Chris Tucker, Chan now has two new American projects in the pipeline. The first is Nosebleed, which, like Rush Hour, will be backed by New Line Cinema. It's about a window-washer at the World Trade Centre who teams up with a waitress and a bartender to foil what they all think is a terrorist attack. The other is Disney's Shanghai Noon, a period film about a Chinese adventurer in the Wild West who teams up with a train robber to rescue a kidnapped princess."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/1999/feb/20/newsstory.sport9","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-20T23:36:26Z","webTitle":"In serious need of promotion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/feb/20/newsstory.sport9","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/1999/feb/20/newsstory.sport9","fields":{"headline":"In serious need of promotion","bodyText":"The last time that Leyton Orient and Liverpool had anything in common was 1962, when both clubs were promoted from the Second Division into the old First Division. Orient stayed there for one sweet season, Liverpool are still there, having added 13 more championships to the five they already had. Nowadays, the nature of the two worlds they inhabit could not be better illustrated than by the reported figures for Robbie Fowler's new deal with Liverpool. At £1.75m, his wage is two-and-a-half times the amount earned annually by Orient's entire playing staff. And at Brisbane Road, they are worried because their players' wages are getting out of hand. At the other end of the League, they have a lot to worry about. The £700,000 wage bill is a frightener when the Bosman ruling has eroded income from transfers (Premiership clubs are more likely to make their transfer swoops in Latvia than Leytonstone nowadays) and the National Lottery has eaten away at their pools income. Compared to the Premiership, where sponsorship and TV income is so high that fans hardly seem to matter, in the Third Division almost all money comes from the pockets of supporters. Lyn Newman, who took on the commercial manager's job at Leyton Orient less than a year ago, knows that every penny counts. \"Up the road at Arsenal and Tottenham, they wouldn't believe what we have to do. You have to give blood in this job. They don't have to, the sponsors come to them,\" says Newman, who gives up evenings and weekends to do the rounds at the local chamber of commerce. The commercial income amounts to almost half a million pounds or one third of the turnover, but the major component - gate money - still comes from the fans. Any potential source of income is feverishly pursued. The cherished club lottery and scratchcards, for example could bring in a £10,000 profit, but Newman expects only half of that. Although set in one of the largest urban communities in the world, Orient's problem is that the fan base simply isn't big enough, though Newman has no doubt of its loyalty: \"In some cases, this club has been handed down for five generations. We have such a loyal band of supporters,\" she says. Growth of club membership has not been a simple exercise - for a start the borough is among the poorest in Britain - and the policy adopted by the club towards juniors (under 16s) is radical. With a capacity of 11,000 and an average gate of just over 4,000, Orient have applied the tried and trusted West End theatre strategy of papering their audience. This involves selling junior season tickets at a peppercorn rate (£15 for a year) and mid-season even giving them away. \"I get mobbed when I go to schools,\" says Newman who, on one famous occasion made 300 local schoolchildren season ticket holders in a single day. They don't do that at Anfield. For £5, under 16s can also join the junior supporters club and the meet-the-players day is one of those occasions that perfectly illustrates the value of the community club. The kids are divided by age with a first team player in charge of each group, and they spend the day together, learning skills and playing. Scunthorpe, with one of the smallest catchment areas in the League, is in tune with Orient's philosophy with its youngsters. For £1 only, anyone can become a club member. If you are a member and under 15 this entitles you to free access to every game. Scunthorpe also have a loyal but small support base, struggling to top 4,000 a game even though the club is enjoying some success, with the result that gate income accounts for only 35 per cent of turnover. Commercial activities make up the shortfall, the club successfully negotiating sponsorships for each of the four stands at Glanford Park as well as the usual shirt and matchday deals. Scunthorpe were hit hard by the National Lottery, which overnight pared income from the club's own scheme from £150,000 down to £50,000. That damage has been partly repaired by the club's membership of the Gold Bond scheme, administered by Blackpool Football Club and operated by many clubs in the lower Leagues. Scunthorpe are also chasing ways of raising more through merchandising, by expanding to leisurewear. Scunthorpe also charge £80 to their matchday mascots. This is a policy that some clubs criticise, but marketed sensibly can be good public relations. Perversely, when Scunthorpe were seeking free mascots in the Eighties, no kids would come forward. So they packaged a deal which included free club kit, four matchday tickets, an autographed programme, gave it an £80 price tag and now they're booked out. As they say, the more you pay, the more it's worth. Cardiff mascots still trot out for free, but when your catchment area is among the biggest in the United Kingdom, you do have more to choose from. Cardiff's heady ride at the top of the Third Division has seen crowds swell to near-capacity. The club's problem is that gate income has been too great a proportion of income and the target is for commercial income to match or overtake it. To that end, they have outsourced it to a local company, AppleMed, whose guiding principle must be to strike while the Cardiff iron is hot. Last year, when the club finished fourth from the bottom of the Nationwide League, they did not have such a strong bargaining power and ended up with a shirt contract for a very modest £20,000. AppleMed will be looking for substantially more this year. The company is also hoping to close a deal whereby the club kit can be sold in national chains and, if the regional demand is any indication (7,000 shirt sales in six months) this may not be an idle dream. There are other timely factors in the blossoming of Cardiff, including the national team's return to Ninian Park for next month's Euro 2000 qualifier against Denmark. Their previous qualifier was played at Anfield. In the lower reaches of the League, Cardiff, Leyton Orient and Scunthorpe have each adopted positive approaches in the battle for survival. As Don Rowing, the chief executive at Scunthorpe says with some passion. \"It's our heritage, the right to support a local football club, but unless there is some input from the Premiership, which is awash with money, the clubs at our end could starve.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theobserver/1999/feb/21/featuresreview.review4","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-21T02:40:57Z","webTitle":"Greece is the word","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/feb/21/featuresreview.review4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/feb/21/featuresreview.review4","fields":{"headline":"Greece is the word","bodyText":"Thomas L. Thompson has had a tough career. In his doctoral dissertation in the late Sixties, he came to the conclusion that the established ways of trying to prove that Abraham and the other biblical patriarchs had been historical figures were worthless. The archaeological evidence was being misinterpreted, and anyway the Bible isn't that kind of book. The academic world was not pleased. Thompson 'found it impossible to get my PhD in Europe or to publish my book in the United States'. He struggled on, working for a decade as a house-painter, and got a post in a small Catholic college, but lost it when he published a book arguing that the idealised 'United Monarchy' of Kings Saul, David and Solomon was also unhistorical. Finally, in 1993, Thompson was appointed to a chair at Copenhagen; and now his hour has come. The balance of opinion has gradually tilted towards him, and this book may be remembered as a landmark. It marks the end of 'biblical archaeology' - archaeological research guided by, and trying to confirm, biblical history. The whole enterprise has been as big a mistake as it would be for British archaeology to be dominated by a need to prove the historicity of Malory's King Arthur. Suppose, then, we let the archaeological evidence speak for itself: what does it say? Visitors to Jerusalem can get an idea by going to the Israel Museum. The Israelis have had the very strongest motives for digging up and putting on show any materials that confirm the belief in a long Jewish occupation of ancient Palestine. And they have indeed found a great deal of material from Hellenistic and Roman times. But of the main 'Old Testament' period there is startlingly little. What all the world came to think of as 'the Jewish people', their religion and their epic history now seems to have come into being as a result of the fifth-century Persian policy of building temples to the local gods around their empire. So, in biblical terms, history starts not with Abraham, but with Ezra and Nehemiah. Over a period of two or three centuries, the Temple and the Torah were established, and the welding of various local peoples into a New Israel was achieved. The biblical writers collected local traditions and worked them up into the Bible's great story of an Old Israel that had been chosen by God, but had repeatedly been unfaithful and finally was destroyed. One consequence of this revisionist history is that the great unified kingdom of David and Solomon never existed historically. Another is that the new chronology allows Greek philosophy to have had a much bigger influence on the biblical idea of God than used to be thought. Thompson draws attention to the gap between the highly volatile and anthropomorphic Yahweh of the oldest traditions, and the transcendent ineffable Creator of Isaiah 40-55. In a word, the difference is Greece. Thompson's transformation of the way we see the Bible draws the line between the Old and the New Israel in a new place. The Old Israel is now the fictioned Israel of pre-exilic times, and the New Israel is the Judaism of the Temple, the Torah and the synagogues that developed in Hellenistic and Roman times. Thompson does not care for the contrast between Old and New 'Testaments', and regards the Church's self-description as 'the New Israel' as being implicitly anti-semitic. He very effectively treats the gospels as part of what we might call the Old Testament. Best of all is Thompson's attack on the 'naive realism' of dogmatic theology. In his brilliant discussions of individual stories, he shows that when religion is seen as human it becomes much more complicated and interesting. Thompson has an excellent ear for the human author's voice as well as the voice of God; and because that voice is Jewish, God doesn't always get the best of the argument. Not by a long chalk. Thompson's shift in the way we see the Bible has been coming for several decades, but it is still radical. Western Christianity has always narrated a great epic history of salvation based on the Bible: Creation, the Fall, the Flood, the Patriarchs, Moses, the Exodus and the Law, the Conquest, the Judges, the Kings and Prophets, and the promised Messiah. We are now invited to see the whole story as back-projected and mythical. If we continue to practise religion, we'll have to do so in the full knowledge that it is a human imaginative construction. Some of us are already doing just that. Thompson's theories are bound to be highly offensive to conservatives, both in Israel and in the Church. Faith tends to create its own facts, and to become heavily invested in them. Doubtless people will continue to say that the Jews and their religion are 4,000 years old, and doubtless the pilgrims will continue to visit the holy places and regard them as genuine. The gap between the study and the pew grows steadily wider, and most people are not greatly concerned. Don Cupitt, an Anglican priest, is a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

As a committed Pan-Africanist, he introduced the former British protectorate to modern politics. He founded the Basutoland African Congress which, in 1959, became the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP). Under his leadership, the BCP provided sanctuary to South African refugees fleeing from the oppression and brutality of apartheid after 1960. Mokhehle became leader of the opposition in the first parliament of Lesotho following the 1965 general elections. Lesotho, a kingdom of two million encircled by South Africa, gained independence in 1966. Mokhehle, who won the election in 1960 as head of the Basutoland Congress Party, would have been its first ruler, but was thwarted by Chief Jonathan Leabua, his long-term rival from the Basuto National Party, who was seen as a puppet of apartheid South Africa. Mokhehle was a short but well-built man, popularly referred to as a “man with a big head”, suggesting that it was the size of that head which made him so intelligent. A controversial politician who was never out of the politics of his country until the day he died, he explained issues quietly but at length - as if his life depended on every word he uttered - and did not like being interrupted while in full flow. Ntsu Mokhehle was born at Ha Mokhehle in the Berea District, the son of a Mosotho school inspector. He had a high school education at St Matthew’s and Healdtown in the Cape Province, South Africa. His university studies at Fort Hare culminated in a MSc degree with distinction, but although he taught for a while in South Africa, his career at Basutoland High School in his native Lesotho was brief. He was expelled by the then colonial education authorities because of his political activities. After that expulsion, Mokhehle’s life began to be dedicated to the struggle for the political and economic emancipation of the Basotho people. He carved out a political career when he led the BCP to election victory, but Chief Leabua refused to relinquish power, suspended the constitution, declared a state of emergency, annulled the election results and detained Mokhehle for two years. Mokhehle went into exile for l6 years, first to Zambia and then to Botswana. From Botswana he directed a guerrilla campaign that infiltrated Libyan-trained assassins, by way of the Johannesburg mine-workers’ hostels, where most Sotho men lived. At the time, some of his guerrilla forces were operating inside Lesotho, while another 1,000 men were training in the mountain camps in Lesotho. The government of Chief Leabua responded with its own terror campaign, using a police unit armed by South Africa. In 1993, Dr Mokhehle again led the BCP into general elections after 23 years of successive dictatorships. They won spectacularly, gaining all 65 seats: “a one-party parliament in a multi-party state”. Mokhehle became the first prime minister of a democratic Lesotho. But the landslide victory was short-lived. He was ousted a year later by King Letsie III. Letsie dissolved Mokhehle’s government because Mokhehle refused to reinstate Letsie’s father, King Moshoeshoe II, to the throne. Mokhehle’s restoration as prime minister came about only after pressure from other southern African countries, and the promise to restore King Moshoeshoe. By 1997, Mokhehle’s grip on power was slipping, and factions formed within his party and government in a new power struggle, which led his loyalists in parliament to form a new party, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD). New elections were held and the LCD won, but the opposition parties cried foul and took to the streets. The protest spread to the army, prompting the South Africa government to intervene militarily. Mokhehle went into voluntary retirement last May when his term of office as prime minister ended. By then he was an old and ailing man, who eventually died in a hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa. My abiding memories of him will be of a man who struggled all his life to achieve, in order to bring about democracy. But in the end he felt let down; he never fully enjoyed the respect and command of the nation that he loved. He is survived by a wife, two daughters and a son.

It's a knockout","bodyText":"Back in the 1960s and 1970s, Muhammad Ali came over to Europe once in a while. The Greatest would duff up a few no-hopers from Britain, Germany and France without breaking sweat, and then fly out again. Memories of Ali in his pomp were rekindled by his visit to Brixton last week and by Saturday's G7 industrialised nations meeting in Bonn. The Americans arrived, berated a European and, with Oskar Lafontaine left on the canvas, departed. The communiqué could hardly have been more blunt. The Europeans were forced to admit that measures to boost growth were needed, and Mr Lafontaine's plan for currency target zones was dismissed. The US and other Anglo-Saxon members of the G7 had every reason to be peeved. Last autumn they agreed the biggest problem facing the global economy was a lack of growth rather than inflation, and decided to act together to boost demand. Britain, Canada and the US have taken the right action, the Europeans have not. While the US is running a record trade deficit and acting as the global buyer of first resort, Euroland has a trade surplus of 2 per cent of its output, sucking demand out of the rest of the world at a time when it can be ill-afforded. It is clear Mr Lafontaine and his French counterpart, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, have some sympathy with the US viewpoint. Sadly they can do very little to remedy matters since like King Lear, they have given away their powers. It is the European Central Bank that matters in Europe not the finance ministers, and the ECB is stuck in a time-warp, parroting notions that were popular in the Anglo-Saxon world a decade ago. The ECB's problem is that it is convinced Europe's unemployment problem is primarily structural, related to rigidities in the labour market. It assumes the natural rate of unemployment is close to the actual rate, around 10 per cent, and that therefore there is a limited role for macroeconomic policies to boost growth. But this is precisely what the \"natural rate\" junkies said about the US and Britain at the start of the 1990s. When UK unemployment on the claimant-count measure stood at almost three million at the end of 1992, it was assumed any attempt to reflate the economy and take people off the dole would quickly lead to higher inflation. It did not happen. Last year, for instance, when unemployment was heading down towards today's 18-year-low of 1.3 million, leading economists predicted the jobless total would have to rise by 500,000 to stop inflation taking off. Yet the labour market has continued tightening, and inflation has only stabilised because the Bank of England has cut interest rates five times in the past five months. The fear now is that unemployment will rise - not as a consequence of anti-inflation policies but because of low growth caused by deflation. Geoff Dicks, of Greenwich NatWest, wonders whether the Bank of England has now abandoned its \"natural rate\" theories as a result of events over the past couple of years. He concludes it has not done so because the Bank's inflation report emphasises that domestically generated inflation is still above the Government's 2.5 per cent target, and that it has only been the strong pound and the fall in import prices which have prevented an overshoot. What the Bank now wants to see is evidence that the breathing space won by the strong pound and the global crisis is having an effect on the domestic market. Today's Confederation of British Industry pay databank shows that domestically generated inflation may by abating. It is no surprise that pay settlements in manufacturing have fallen, from 3.5 per cent in the three months ending in October to 3.0 per cent in the quarter ending in January. What is a surprise is that settlements in the service sector are down from 4.4 per cent in October to 3.7 per cent now. What does this tell us? First, that the \"natural rate\" should be used with great care. Estimates of the \"natural rate\" vary according to the actual rate of unemployment. When the US had a jobless rate of 8 per cent, it was thought that the natural rate could not be lower than 6 per cent. Today, it has a rate of 4.4 per cent and falling. Second, the ECB is wrong to assume that Europe's unemployment problem is primarily structural. Growth rates in Germany and France have lagged well behind those in the US, and this has had a big impact on the jobs market. In the 15-year period from 1983, when the global economy was emerging from the slump triggered by the second oil shock, the US growth rate averaged 3.1 per cent a year against 2.4 per cent in Germany and 2.1 per cent in France. America had the fastest growth of the three countries in 11 of the 15 years. There may also be structural impediments to employment growth in Europe that need tackling. However, the structure of the labour market in France is little different today from what it was in 1970, when unemployment, at 2 per cent, was the lowest in Europe. Finally, criticism of the ECB should not disguise the fact that Anglo-Saxon labour markets face hard challenges. As an article in the latest Employment Policy Institute jobs audit puts it: \"Anglo-Saxon countries... enjoy high employment rates, especially compared to continental European economies. But their poverty rates are also significantly higher, which raises the question: is the extent of low wage work a major contributing factor?\" The article, by Ive Marx of Antwerp University, uses data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to confirm the perception that low-wage work is more widespread in the Anglo-Saxon countries than in mainland Europe. Defining low pay as full-time workers on less than two-thirds of the median gross wage, Belgium, Finland and Sweden have low-wage employment below 10 per cent. In France, Germany and Netherlands, it is under 15 per cent, in Britain it is one in five and in America and Canada, one in four. \"Poverty in work is certainly a real problem in the US, and to a lesser extent in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom, but it is perhaps not as big a problem as many seem to suspect. \"Why, then, have the Anglo-Saxon countries such high overall poverty rates for their working age populations? \"The answer is that poverty rates are particularly high for the non-employed, those of working age with no earnings. One finds a poverty rate of 40 per cent for non-employed Americans, which is about twice as high as for any of the European countries, except the UK, and about four times as high as for countries like Belgium, Denmark, Finland or Norway.\" It is this challenge that awaits the Government. It is possible unemployment will not rise as rapidly as some expect this year. Indeed, there is a chance the claimant count will fall below one million over the next few years as we re-enter a low-inflation, low-unemployment era. However, that would still leave high levels of poverty among those excluded from the labour market, particularly the over-50s and single parents. Identifying this problem is like saying that all a fighter had to do to beat Ali was keep out of trouble for 15 rounds then land a knockout blow. But action in the Budget to help excluded groups will be a welcome first step."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/feb/23/3","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-23T04:09:29Z","webTitle":"They don't know, you know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/23/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/feb/23/3","fields":{"headline":"They don't know, you know","bodyText":"Science can deliver the moon, Neil Armstrong's small step and all, but the moon it cannot promise. The chain of cold logic and hot ambition that led from Isaac Newton's garden to the Sea of Tranquillity in 1969, paradoxically cannot guarantee that genetically modified tomatoes will be absolutely safe to eat - nor that the moon will hang there in the earth's sky tonight. 'You can't say anything is completely safe,' Sir Robert May says. He's a mathematician who became a biologist, and then the Government's chief scientific adviser. 'You can say two and two is always four, because that sort of definition is built into the structure and nature of the system but you can't say, with 100 per cent confidence, that the sun will rise tomorrow. It is a pretty good working hypothesis... and at some slightly lower epistemological level, you can estimate the probability that an aeroplane will fall on either you or me while we are having this conversation.' He was speaking, having just had a week of things falling in on him: angry campaigners, anxious ministers, puzzled journalists and alarmed voters. The genetically modified organism (GMO) debate is also a debate about science, and within science. Campaigners and voters keep asking scientists to promise something that nobody can promise, a certain future. All scientists can say is that some GM foods seem to be safe; the ones that are not won't be used; and, sorry, there are no simple answers. And there are no risk-free foods anyway. John Beringer, the biologist who chairs Acre, the Government's advisory committee on releases into the environment, says that even traditional crops have their risks (1). 'Few, if any, of these crops would survive the stringent tests recommended for GM crops.' He would say that, opponents reply: he's involved. Maarten Chrispeels of the University of California at San Diego is also involved, on both sides. He is one of 20 scientists working here in Britain and overseas who were named in that now-famous memorandum defending Dr Arpad Pusztai, dropped by the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen. Last August Dr Pusztai had said that potatoes genetically modified to make a natural insect poison called a lectin, borrowed from the common snowdrop, had, when fed to rats, made their organs grow somewhat more slowly and depressed their immune systems. A team of auditors from the Rowett then looked at Dr Pusztai's research and reported that his data did not support his argument. The 68-year-old scientist was left out in the cold. So far, so simple: a martyr, and fellow scientists prepared to speak up for him. It isn't that simple. 'The scientists who signed this memorandum are basically saying Pusztai got shafted. Please reinstate him so that he can carry on his experiments. They are not saying GMOs should be banned,' Professor Chrispeels says. 'The auditors looked at some of the experiments and said: he is out of line, he should have waited till he had all the data. And Pusztai says look, I have 20 years of experience in lectins, I have some data that say perhaps we should proceed with caution. So both interpretations are possible on the basis of the data that the auditors and we have been allowed to examine. I want to stress that we have not seen all the data that Pusztai has.' But - he makes this point again and again - the data from the experiments so far raise more questions than they can answer. 'These experiments could be interpreted in different ways, as is always the case when you are in the preliminary stages of an investigation.' Professor Chrispeels says:'Scientists gather a body of evidence, submit it to their peers, and then publish it. It is possible that Pusztai has this evidence but I have not seen it.' In fact, he says, he would need a mountain of scientific evidence to convince him that the act of creating a GM organism was itself unsafe. Scientists have been altering plant genes for a long time. He is a molecular biologist who began in agriculture. He helped create the first insect-resistant transgenic seeds in collaboration with Australian scientists. 'I am not in favour of banning either GMOs or the use of GMOs in food, certainly not, unless there is evidence. But no evidence has been forthcoming. As a matter of fact, 20 million hectares of GMOs are being grown in the United States and nobody is turning into a turnip.' In the rest of the world, according to Sir Robert May, an area 1.5 times the size of the United Kingdom is already planted with commercial GM crops of soya beans, oilseed rape, maize, cotton, potatoes and tobacco. 'I'm just waiting for the protest about the safety of GM tobacco,' Sir Robert says. He sees it as yet another case of a technology very much devised in Britain, but mostly exploited abroad. For scientists, the GM food furore shows the gap between what people expect of science and what science can deliver. Here are arguments about the nature of science itself. Lewis Wolpert, the engineer who became an embryologist, once argued that the practice of science was unnatural, that scientific ideas often seemed to run against common sense(2). Riding a bicycle was easy, but explaining why a bicycle was stable at speed was not. The naturalist and ideas-maker Edward O. Wilson recently described the search for objective reality as religion liberated and writ large (3). 'It is an endeavour almost as old as civilisation and intertwined with traditional religion , but it follows a very different course - a stoic's creed, an acquired taste, a guidebook to adventure plotted across rough terrain.' Some sociologists argue that science is something humans invented and therefore has no more validity than any other cultural belief system. But for most professionals, science is a method: a steady, piecemeal approach to problems a piece at a time, conducted according to a set of widely-agreed rules. For them, science is what scientists do. They take nothing for granted: they test everything, even the things that seem stunningly obvious - is rat food more nourishing for rats, for instance, than say, wood? - and then they test again, in a different way, just to make sure, and then again, in a third way, just to make absolutely sure. Then they submit their results to a journal with a reputation to maintain which then sends the findings out to a panel of experienced fellow-scientists. They look at the research and say: 'Hang on, did you use rats from the same family line? Rats of the same age? Were you using rats that were used to gnawing wood? Which wood did you use as food? How much sawdust was in the rat food as filler?This 'peer review group' then sends the research back to the journal and then to the hapless researcher, who goes on running experiments and rewriting his report until everyone is satisfied. It gets published. The journal circulates. Whereupon, in a distant laboratory across the Atlantic, a scientist in the same line of research shakes his head sadly, and begins his own experiments to see how quickly he can demolish the work of the pro-rat-food team. If he does, the score is one-all, and other laboratories will start to get interested. This is a process that everyone in science understands: somebody puts up a hypothesis, and then devises a proof, and then puts it out into the open. Everybody else tries to kick the hypothesis to death. If other experiments produce the same result, then the hypothesis is declared to be a robust one - not right, just a good working hypothesis for the time being - and the research goes on from there. Karl Popper may have put this proposition starkly but his understanding of science as a process of disconfirmation rather than affirmation is broadly right. Within a few years, or a few decades, a completely new discovery may be made - made possible by a new set of questions, a new way of looking at things, or possibly just a new set of techniques. As a result the hypothesis has to change. The first hypothesis put the wrong question and got the wrong answer. So the chase begins again. All 'laws' within biology are in fact working propositions, under continuous test: a journey towards certainties, with no guarantee of an arrival. Having got results, and persuaded peers that the scientist got them honestly - some have been known to fake their findings, and some show an all-too-human tendency to dismiss the bad outcomes and highlight only the good results - there remain big questions of interpretation. What is the likelihood that such and such a result came about because it reflected the way things are, rather than on the basis of pure chance, or thanks to some completely undiscovered bias? Scientists are humans: they make mistakes, cling to favourite ideas, hold loyalties and see what they want to see. So they put their results to statistical analysis before they can convince each other that say, a rat's organ change was a result of eating raw potatoes modified with a gene to produce a snowdrop lectin rather than a result of sheer chance. Coincidences are uncannily common but they are still co-incidences. Stage conjurors can and often do use probability games to produce striking results: Richard Dawkins, the zoologist who has turned to the problems of the public understanding of science tells of an experiment at the Royal Institution Christmas lectures in which he 'identified' the psychic in the audience who had 'influenced' the fall of a coin successfully, eight times in a row(4). Sir Robert May has seen it all before, at Princeton, in the United States during the first alarms, when genetic engineering first became possible. 'I remember the robustly commonsensical people in the fire department nevertheless wanting to be reassured that they were not going to be subjected to a sort of Quatermass science fiction movie if they had to come to a fire in the biochemistry department,' he says. 'There was no corresponding thing here. Now, we are replaying that drama with the roles reversed. In the States, there has been no such apprehension.'

From a joint of beef to big international brands and designer labels, Britain has a reputation as a high cost country. Shoppers know it. Travellers know it - they regularly risk the wrath of HM Customs &amp; Excise to cash in on bargains bought abroad. Now, for the first time in 20 years, the British government is also showing more than a passing interest in the prices British citizens pay. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wants to know why. Gordon Brown has asked the European Commission to investigate disparities in prices across the EU while Kim Howells, minister at the Department of Trade and Industry Minister has signalled a shift in his department's priorities. Traditionally its focus has been the protection and promotion of big business. Now, Mr Howells says that the consumer has to be 'at the heart of policy'. He will publish a white paper in the summer setting out a new consumer strategy include the establishment of an official price monitoring unit. It may also 'name and shame' firms that it discovers are systematically ripping off their customers. One of the first targets could be the charges hotels extort from their guests for the direct-dial calls they make from their rooms. There is also a House of Commons committee hearing under way into the price of cars amid signs that the competition authority for the EU (the Commission's directorate-general IV) may be about to get tough on car manufacturers. At the same time - after an attack by the American computer chip manufacturer Intel on the prices charged for British computers, targeted in particular at Dixons - the Office of Fair Trading is now investigating the prices charged for personal computers sold in the United Kingdom. And early next month the OFT will also decide whether there should be a full-scale Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into British supermarkets - do they wield too much power, squeeze their suppliers and fail to pass on savings to their customers? The heat is on. Manufacturers and retailers will increasingly have to justify their price tags. Are there arguments they might muster in defence? An excuse for some price differences is the strength of the pound. The Confederation of British Industry reckons the pound is 10 per cent over-valued and at more than 9 francs to the pound the strong pound may explain why a CD or mobile phone bought in French store is cheaper than the same products purchased at home. But the currency factor does not explain why a Sony Trinitron television set costs £77 more in London than in Paris or why a pair of men's Timberland boots costs £109 in a French store but £145 in Britain. Nor does it explain why a bottle of Chanel No 5 costs a third more in Britain than France, especially when strong sterling should cut the cost of imported goods. And the exchange rate argument is all but irrelevant when comparing prices in the UK and the United States - where a Sony Trinitron is £137 less than in Britain and a pair of Timberlands £55 cheaper. The pound/dollar rate has been relatively stable for the past five years. Professor Paddy Barwise, director of the centre for marketing at the London Business School, is not impressed with the currency argument. 'People defending high prices use sterling to muddy the waters'. Generally manufacturers blame retailers for price differentials and retailers lay the blame squarely at the door of suppliers. One British store executive, who buys fashions from elsewhere in Europe and the US, said her company was charged more by manufacturers than foreign stores. The suppliers, on the other hand, insist retailers slap bigger margins on international brand names. Stephen Lock, an adviser to such brands as Nike and Tommy Hilfiger - which are considerably cheaper in the US - says: 'None of the American branded goods manufacturers make more profit in the UK than the US'. He insists that straightforward shelf-price comparisons are misleading. 'New York prices are quoted before federal and state taxes', he says, 'whereas here VAT is included'. Mr Lock also points out that distribution and marketing costs are much higher in Europe than in the US. There, a single advertising campaign in one common language can reach some 300 million consumers, whereas reaching the same market in Europe would require campaigns in 18 different languages with different regulations in each country. The extra costs do not stop at advertising. Product literature, guarantees and manuals must also be produced in different languages - to the extent that producing the manuals for television sets on sale in Europe costs as much as the glass in the television screen. Others say prices in the UK will always be higher than on the Continent or across the Atlantic simply because we live on islands with tough planning restrictions on what can be built and where. According to Axel Johne, professor of marketing at City University Business School, country-hopping in search of better deals is common place on the mainland of Europe. Germans regularly drive to the Netherlands to take advantage of cheaper prices, especially on big-ticket items and cars. Shoppers in Northern France do the same, hopping into Belgium. It is also, allegedly, a long winded and expensive business to get permission to build a megastore in the UK - it recently took Costco, an American discount warehouse operation, two years to get outline permission for a new building. Rents even on small stores can be prohibitive. The lease costs on a small outlet in a London suburb, for example, can easily exceed those of a similar-sized shop in the centre of Milan. Professor Michael Waterstone of the economics department of Warwick University says: 'Rents are an issue. British rents per square foot are high compared with similar towns abroad. In the US rents are lower because there are fewer planning controls. It is simply a bigger country, also labour costs are lower there'. A recent report by management consultant McKinsey found that, on average, selling space in the UK cost 40 per cent more than in the US and 20 per cent more than in France. British supermarkets are often attacked for their profit margins, which average 6 per cent, three times the levels achieved by their European rivals. Simple 'basket of goods' comparisons suggest British supermarket shoppers are being ripped off by up to 40 per cent. Undoubtedly the power wielded by the big four supermarket chains, Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Safeway, is substantial; it's growing as they move into new sectors. Ten years ago they controlled just over 30 per cent of grocery sales. By last year they had captured 45 per cent of a market now worth nearly £89 billion(1). 'It is a valid question whether their power has become so great that they have been squeezing their suppliers and not passing on savings', Professor Barwise says - he is also deputy chairman of the Consumers' Association. There's evidence to support his suggestion. Livestock farmers are grumbling about the ever lower prices they are paid for carcasses while meat prices on the store shelves remain stubbornly high. Food manufacturers say they are warned not to supply products to newcomers to the retail market or they will be thrown off the shelves of big four. They claim that they are made to underwrite all special offers and complain that the supermarkets systematically copy their branded package designs on own-label goods(2). Professor Waterstone believes British consumers are 'wimpish'. They like the better service standards in the Big Four and lazily prefer to patronise them while continuing to complain about prices rather than take their custom to the cheaper stores that still do exist. It's certainly no surprise that as the publication of the OFT's report into their activities draws near the supermarkets should once again talk excitedly about 'price war' to bolster their image as consumers' champions. They do profiteer on the basis of their over-powerful position but it has also to be acknowledged that set -up costs in the UK are so much higher than elsewhere. Returns earned by British supermarket groups on the capital they invest are some 5 per cent lower than in the rest of Europe. The same cannot be said for the car industry. A recent EU survey, based on prices gathered last November, once again identified the UK as the most expensive place in Europe to buy a car(3). According to the EU, British drivers are asked to pay up to 52 per cent more than their continental counterparts for exactly the same car and average UK prices are 16 per cent more than comparable cars in the Eurozone. In May the competition directorate in Brussels will update its survey. It will be the first carried out in euros and will further underline how high are car prices charged in the UK. An enquiry by the OFT is also under way. The Government could act. At issue is the 'block exemption' which allows carmakers to control prices by supplying only registered dealers. 'The consumer is being ripped off by the power of the supplier, underwritten by the government', Professor Johne says. Whether Mr Blair would be prepared to do that, however, remains to be seen. Aside from keeping prices high, the block exemption also encourages foreign carmakers to locate in Britain, and the future of Rover would be even more uncertain without it. As EU competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said last week, the block exemption is 'a political issue'. Certainly car-makers will use their considerable political weight to maintain the status quo. For according to analysts at stockbrokers Salomon Smith Barney, the European car industry would see 10 per cent of its profits wiped out if UK car prices were brought into line with the rest of Europe(4). 'Windfall profits still attach to all vehicle makers selling in the UK', Salomons say. 'Average operating margins of 4-5 per cent in the industry have to be nearer 20 per cent for sales made to UK retail customers'. They have calculated that inflated UK prices generate 30 per cent of Peugeot's profits, 25 per cent of BMW's and 10 per cent of Renault's. These companies will fight hard, and probably dirty, to protect themselves. Sources: (1)Insitute of Grocery Distribution; (2)The Welfare Consequences of the Exercise of Buyer Power.

The placing sent Orange shares tumbling nearly 6 per cent to 904p, despite the cellular firm's announcement of a better-than-expected set of year-end results and 2,000 new jobs. The surprise sale of 50 million shares at 865p apiece was interpreted by some analysts as a move by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate to cushion itself against the economic crisis in Asia and raised the spectre of further selling by Hutchison. A hurried statement from Orange, however, quoted Canning Fok, the Hong Kong conglomerate's group managing director saying the current level of investment would be held in the 'long term'. The placing through Goldman Sachs reduced Hutchison's stake to just under 45 per cent which means that Orange now has a free float of more than 50 per cent, making it potentially more vulnerable to a bid. The sale overshadowed Orange's results for the 12 months to end-December, which saw it cutting pre-tax losses by 29 per cent to £98.1 million. The company reported its first operating profit of £15.4 million on a turnover of £1.2 billion. The new jobs will be created over the next two years across the business, although a large number will be in customer service centres in Bristol, Darlington and Peterlee in County Durham. Orange's subscriber base improved by 80 per cent during the year, with its British marketshare rising from 14.2 per cent to 16.6 per cent. New services set for launch include Wildfire - a voice activated 'secretary' handset - and the world's smallest cellular phone which will retail for £299. Video phones are scheduled to be launched by the end of the year. Orange's chief executive, Hans Snook, claimed that 'unstoppable' growth in the market would mean that 50 per cent of Briton's will carry mobile phones by 2002. Outside the United Kingdom, the group unveiled plans to move into the Continent's two largest markets by establishing what it terms 'virtual networks'. The proposal is to buy airtime wholesale from existing operators in France and Germany and resell it under the Orange brand name. 'We see it as a way of leveraging our strengths to build an overseas presence without a huge capital investment,' Mr Snook said. He added that the first deal should be struck by the end of the year, but dampened speculation that Orange is negotiating for stakes in Germany's E-Plus or Bouygues Telecom of France, both of which have holdings up for grabs. The company also confirmed plans to go it alone in bidding for a third generation mobile phone licence in the government auction next year. The Government is expected to raise around £500 million apiece from the auction of five new UMTS licences which will allow new applications such as high-speed Internet access. Snook said the bid could be readily financed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/feb/26/features2","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-26T16:04:53Z","webTitle":"The ultimate prequel (No, it's not Star Wars)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/feb/26/features2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/feb/26/features2","fields":{"headline":"The ultimate prequel (No, it's not Star Wars)","bodyText":"Rapture is the only word to describe the response of 350 Polish journalists crammed into a Warsaw cinema for the country's most eagerly-awaited press showing. Just as George Lucas has returned to the origins of his intergalactic saga with Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, Jerzy Hoffman's new three-hour epic Ogniem i Mieczem (By Fire And Sword) marks a step back to an old triumph from a different era. But Lucas didn't have to come back from being blacklisted and forced into exile. The film, set against the backdrop of a mid-17th century uprising by Ukrainian Cossacks against Polish rule, is based on the first part of Nobel Laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz's trilogy. A semi-fictitious romantic saga, it depicts the fading fortunes of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a kingdom which by the late 1640s stretched from the Baltic coast to the \"wild steppes\" of modern-day central Ukraine. It was written in the 1880s to \"console the hearts\" of Poles at a time when their nation had vanished from the map. In the aftermath of a series of failed rebellions, the populist mix of virtuous knights, comradeship, damsels in distress, witchcraft and battle scenes galore soon entered the national lexicon, becoming every Polish schoolboy's most dreamy adventure tale. Now the intrepid little knight is back on the screen, 31 years after he blew himself to smithereens rather than offer up a besieged fortress to the marauding Turks. The actor has changed. Zbigniew Zamachowski, the star of another famous Polish trilogy, in Kieslowski's Three Colours: White, has taken up the mantle of the dead Tadeusz Lomnicki. And the times are radically different -- Poland has tossed off the communist yoke and is a free democratic country. But the effect is still powerful. \"No nation can afford to lose sight of its culture and its identity,\" says the 67-year-old Polish-Jewish director, to thunderous applause after the preview. Nostalgia for Sienkiewicz's work in post-communist Poland has more to do with Hoffman's classic adaptations of the second and third parts of the trilogy than with the text itself. Hoffman succumbed to Sienkiewicz as a child during his war-time imprisonment in Siberia after his father had sent back his copy of the epic from the front. \"I was fascinated from the beginning, particularly by Sienkiewicz's descriptions in By Fire And Sword of the Ukrainian steppes and the wilderness,\" he says, perched on a stool at a post-premiere drinks party. \"In my childhood fantasies, it looked like Siberia -- the huge open spaces, the huge, bearded eastern-orthodox villagers, the snow-filled moonlit nights, the tales of phantoms and witches.\" The director had made the final part of Sienkiewicz's trilogy, Pan Wolodyjowski (Gentleman Wolody-jowski), in 1967-68, convinced that would be the end of his professional contact with the trilogy. The second part, Potop (Deluge) had been reserved by the established Polish director Aleksander Ford, but an adaptation of By Fire And Sword would never be permitted by the communist authorities because of its allegedly anti-Ukrainian (ie anti-Soviet) content. Then an ignominious anti-Zionist purge of the party and the work-place by First Secretary Wladyslaw Gomulka in 1968 forced Ford into exile with some 13,000 other Jews. Hoffman was also blacklisted, and his name removed from a TV version of Pan Wolodyjowski. However, he survived the furore and in 1974 continued his epic tale, issuing Potop. A staggering 13 million Poles (more than one-third of the population) flooded into the cinema to relive the Swedish siege of Czestochowa. An Oscar nomination in the best foreign film category followed. Hoffman had become a national institution. More than 100 actors, 200 horses, 2,000 extras, a 300-strong technical crew, 118 filming days, computer-generated castles, and a lavish wardrobe of 17th-century costume were needed to make Hoffman's dream of completing his adaptation a reality. A new generation of actors was cast, with only one -- Andrzej Wajda's protege, Daniel Olbrychski -- able to boast a presence in all three parts (playing three different roles). The film also represents a personal crusade for Hoffman, who spent over a decade putting together the financing, and who is now promoting the film despite the death in December of his Russian wife, to whom he has dedicated the film. At a cost of #5.4 million, it is Poland's most expensive film. While the communist state bankrolled the previous films, this time sponsors include a bank, a cosmetic company and a brewer, whose Zagloba label is named after the comic Falstaffian nobleman who guzzles ale throughout the trilogy. Another £630,000 has been spent by the film's Polish promoters, who have given the film a build-up of almost Batman proportions. Trilomania has taken hold: news broadcasts have been filled for months with location reports \"from the front\". Public libraries all over the country are reporting a sudden rush for the original Sienkiewicz texts. And the country's cinemas were under siege from February 12, with a record-breaking 336,000 viewing the film in the first three days of general release. Such an aura surrounds the film that domestic reviewers have been loath to offer a critical word. One critic from the daily Gazeta Wyborcza summed up the mood, writing: \"I'm not going to attribute a mark. The issue is too important; dare I say, of national importance, to play with points. Simply, go to the cinema. Full stop.\" \"Aside from the fact that Sienkiewicz and the trilogy have their own myth, Poles are longing to see their own national film made to the standards of the west,\" is how Hoffman explains the public's huge interest. \"They want to see their own actors and their own history.\" But along with the celebrations, there are fears that Ogniem i Mieczem may worsen already strained Polish-Ukrainian relations. Jerzy Giedroyc, the editor of the Paris-based Polish literary magazine Kultura, called the adaptation \"extremely damaging\" while the country's ex-communist president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, requested a viewing of a rough cut. \"In the Polish imagination, 17th century Ukraine's Cossacks were a wild primitive race who dared to raise their hand against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Sienkiewicz faithfully portrayed that image,\" says Piotr Tyma, secretary of the Union of Ukrain-ians in Poland. Hoffman vehemently denies that there is anything to offend his neighbours in the film -- or that patriotism or a narrow nationalism is responsible for filling the cinemas. He admits, however, that Sienkiewicz may be construed in different ways. \"Every person should know their country's past, its history, and not only those beautiful selected moments which fuel nationalism but also the other side,\" says Hoffman. \"Cruelty was on both sides. The Polish nobility and the Cossacks were very similar in their customs, their brawling and drinking.\" He describes his film as a Polish Gone With The Wind, and says history is just a background to the time-less love story which occupies the fore. As the credits roll in the preview theatre, critics toss away their notepads, pencils and critical objectivity. They jump to their feet to applaud the small, bearded and bespectacled creator. As for Sienkiewicz's desire to console defeated Polish hearts, Hoffman maintains that his mission today is an entirely different one: \"Today, you don't have to console hearts. You have to touch the heart, but also make people think and reflect a little.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theobserver/1999/feb/27/featuresreview.review","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-27T02:04:09Z","webTitle":"Paperbacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/feb/27/featuresreview.review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/feb/27/featuresreview.review","fields":{"headline":"Paperbacks","bodyText":"A Genius in the Family: An Intimate Memoir of Jacqueline du Pre by Hilary du Pre and Piers du Pre, Vintage £7.99, pp426 Hilary and Jackie is a brilliantly acted film, but inevitably as a biopic it is selective. This memoir gives the full and, in many ways, more uncanny, version of the du Pres, according to Jacqueline's brother and sister. Everything in it seems magnified: their Englishness - all funny accents and fresh air - the contrast between the emotion of Jacqueline's playing and the family's reserve - 'It was never mentioned again' is a permanent refrain - and the speed with which everything happened. And it's very human in its sense of how opaque relationships - in a family, and between creativity and personality - can become. Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys by Will Self, Penguin, £6.99, pp244 In 'Caring, Sharing', the funniest, sharpest short story in this collection, New York has split into 'procros' - people who have sex, relationships, children - and the very rich - people who wouldn't touch anything messy, threatening or demanding. Instead, they have 'emotos', robot clones three times their size who attend to all their emotional needs. Will Self's other stories, at times, display a similar inventiveness, but also seem gripped by an unresolved tension. Are they straightforwardly decadent - all artifice, the grotesque and la maladie du siecle - or do they have other challenges to offer this narcissistic age? Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career by George Plimpton, Picador, £7.99, pp798 By retelling Capote's life through the voices of those who knew him, George Plimpton not only vividly evokes him in his element - conversation - but also cleverly avoids making definitive character judgments. The interviewees, of course, don't hold back - Truman the lyrical poet, the court jester, the shit-stirrer, the adoring, rejected son - but, for the reader, it's always Capote defiantly trying to bend life to his will. As a child in the Deep South - a precocious, pampered 'little butterball thing' - he was never scared of bullies: he'd turn cartwheels and they'd imitate him. He never lost that knack, it seems, only the certainty that it would give him what he needed. The Path to the Spiders' Nests by Italo Calvino, Vintage £5.99, pp185 Italo Calvino's first novel, written in 1947, and the 1964 preface he wrote when he had moved away from neo-realism are far more than literary historical curiosities. Calvino explains what he regretted about the book - an explanation which, in itself, is a striking insight into his writing - but it still memorably conveys the 'colour, rhythm and bitter taste, of the Italian partisans' war against the fascists. It also, like his later work, has a beautiful, nonchalant subtlety. Just as the boy Pin, the central character who steals a German sailor's pistol, feels both inadequate and powerful in the world of adults, so, on some level, the partisans seem to be driven by 'an elementary, anonymous urge to free themselves from all their humiliations'. Heshel's Kingdom by Dan Jacobson, Penguin, £7.99, pp243 Travelling through Lithuania, where his maternal grandfather Heshel Melamed lived until his death in 1919, Dan Jacobson compiles a record of all that separates him from his family's past. Melamed was a devout rabbi, Jacobson is a non-believer. He presided over a remote shtetl, Jacobson was born in Johannesburg. Jacobson sensitively delineates the abyss of history from which, throughout his life, his imagination has recoiled in despair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/feb/27/features.jobsmoney6","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-27T03:13:01Z","webTitle":"Annuity income goes up in smoke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/27/features.jobsmoney6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/feb/27/features.jobsmoney6","fields":{"headline":"Annuity income goes up in smoke","bodyText":"Cuts in interest rates have pushed annuities to their lowest levels for decades, yet one group of people can obtain much higher retirement incomes - as long as they smoke at least 10 cigarettes a day or are at least 30 per cent overweight. Buying an annuity means handing over your entire pension fund to an insurance company in return for an income for life. That was fine when annuity rates were high but these have been in freefall since 1990. Add to that the fact that many people face a retirement of 30 years or more, and the problem of how to secure a reasonable income has never been more difficult. However, if you have a medical condition or a lifestyle which is likely to reduce your life expectancy, then some insurance companes are willing to grant you what is called an impaired life annuity for a medical condition or an enhanced life annuity for smoking or obesity. Impaired life annuities are offered to those with conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart conditions, kidney failure, certain types of cancer, multiple sclerosis and chronic asthma. This is not a comprehensive list - the test applied by insurance companies is that your condition 'significantly reduces your life expectancy'. For instance, a 65-year-old male in good health today is expected to live to 82. If the insurance company regards you as an 'impaired life', it might bet, in effect, that it will have to pay you a pension only for 12, rather than 17 years. Companies offering impaired life annuities include Sun Life, Scottish Widows, Stalwart Assurance, Guaranteed Underwriting Agency and the Pension Annuity Friendly Society. They will normally deal with the public only through independent financial advisers. Stalwart Assurance is one of the few insurance companies offering enhanced life annuities for smokers and the obese. To be eligible for an enhanced smoker's rate, you need to have smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day for the last 10 years. To be considered obese, you have to be at least 30 per cent overweight for your height, age and sex. Obtaining quotations is quite straightforward. You complete a short questionnaire, sign a declaration that the information you have provided is correct and consent to a doctor's report being provided on request. Stalwart Assurance marketing manager, Kathy Horsley said, \"We don't automatically request a doctor's report, although we reserve the right to seek one. We consider it more important to respond quickly to our clients' requests. We can usually turn around a case in seven to 10 days, depending on how quickly we receive the pension fund.\" Clearly, someone with only a year to live will get the best impaired life rates, although if you have only months to live, you should ask for a 'special dispensation' from the Inland Revenue for a full return of your pension fund. Mrs Rosemary Dietrich, aged 59, of Benson in Oxfordshire was advised to seek an impaired life annuity because she has smoked 40 cigarettes a day since her teens. She approached the Annuity Bureau, which provided four quotations, the best of which was from Stalwart Assurance. It offered her £250 a year more than she would have received from her original pension provider, Abbey Life. \"I am now receiving £1,950 a year from Stalwart, compared with the £1,700 which Abbey Life offered me. Although I won't stop working until June, I was advised to take the annuity now, because rates are expected to continue falling,\" she said. Her smoking costs her around £50 a week. Mrs Dietrich, a secretary with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, took a transfer value from her former occupational pension and placed it in a personal pension with Abbey Life in 1992. \"Apart from the Stalwart pension, I will have to depend on a small occupational pension and my widow's pension for my retirement income, so the little bit extra from Stalwart is a great help,\" she said. As Mrs Dietrich's experience illustrates, finding the best annuity rate for your circumstances has become one of the most important and sometimes difficult financial decisions you will have to make. In 1990, a man aged 65 could have obtained an annuity rate of 15.5 per cent compared with 8.75 per cent today. This has come about because annuity rates are based on the yield on gilts and these have plummeted from 12 per cent in 1990 to 4.5 per cent today. Clearly, the lower the prevailing annuity rate, the larger the pension fund you need to buy an annuity. For instance, a £100,000 fund would have bought a pension of £10,871 a year in 1990 (for a male aged 65, wife aged 62 taking 50 per cent spouse's benefit, increasing at 3 per cent a year), compared with £5,384 for the same couple today. So, it is crucial that you find the best annuity rate from the two dozen insurance companies on the market. Scanning the market in this way is called using the open market option and is best done by an independent financial adviser who specialises in annuities, as the market is complex and rates change frequently. Regrettably, many people remain unaware of the open market option and simply take whatever is on offer from their existing pension provider. To complicate matters, if your pension contract contains a guaranteed annuity rate, you will probably be better off sticking with your current provider, but you should still check the open market. \u0095 The Annuity Bureau publishes a free guide called You And Your Annuity.

Trevor McDonald says there must be no tears when News at Ten comes off the air. But as most people know, News at Ten ceased to exist some while ago. Recently it's been News at 10.02, 10.03, or later. In the early days, unless Smallweed's ancient memory fails him, it started just as Big Ben struck 10; and if for some reason - football, perhaps, or incompetence - it started a little late, it did so without the opening chimes. I knew News at Ten was doomed when that practice ceased, and Big Ben was shamelessly shown striking 10 when its chimes were already history. They didn't even have the decency to put up a caption saying 'archive material' or 'recorded earlier this evening'. After such a deception, it didn't surprise me at all when Trevor's real name turned out to be George. Brand-new themes for a brand-new millennium, number 121, continued. Last week I asked why it was that we say an hotel and an historian but never an horse. I was hoping for lots of letters asserting that in historian and hotel, the 'h' is pronounced almost imperceptibly, hardly more than the K in Knebworth. I would then have imperiously argued that round where I live in south London, the 'h' in horse is barely perceptible either. To accept 'an hotel' while rejecting 'an horse' would therefore, I hoped to contend, be an act of naked classism. Unhappily, the letters which reached me this week have been deplorably sensible, tending to argue that 'an historian' and 'an hotel' are not truly correct at all, but an affectation: an affectation practised by people who thought it made them sound grand, and confined to words of more than one syllable. The true answer to Smallweed's question, however, is that supplied by John Webb of Chippenham. 'If King Richard III' he writes 'had said, 'An horse, an horse, my kingdom for an horse', someone would have been bound to turn up with a large hairy-arsed Viking.' In the ruddy after-glow of a night in the bars of Copacabana, a grizzled neophyte nuzzled the cheek of a tear-stained... Nemo me impune lacessit (Basingstoke) writes: You seem to have forgotten the undertaking you gave last week to chart the use of muzak to keep customers out of restaurants, rather than to lull them while there into a state where they can't detect the flaws in the bouillabaisse. Smallweed decently counters: Your are right. Years ago, in the French town of Thouars, I and three others, all recognisably English, entered a cafe and asked for coffee. A virago behind the bar served them up with bad grace. Shortly after, as we chatted of horses, hotels and historians, she produced a gramophone record (as we called them in those days) and placed it on a gramophone (ditto). The noise that followed resembled, if it resembled anything, the sound of an hippopotamus practising scales on a derelict piano. We fled, as she had intended. I am sure after all these years that the wench is dead. But I wonder what became of the record? An historian in an hotel acerbically comments: It is for this very reason that I have come to Thouars on an horse to investigate. A grammarian writes: In the item above, how do you wish the word flaw to be pronounced? Smallweed responds in unfeigned astonishment: Why, to rhyme with draw, of course. A grammarian comments: You are entering deep waters here. Have you not noticed how many young men and women on the BBC nowadays add an 'r' to the end of 'draw'? We hear of instance, of statesman 'draw'ring the line' on Kosovo, and the Home Secretary 'draw'ring attention' to issues of racism. Smallweed controversially vouchsafes: Deplawable. I shall speak to the man they call Jack Strore about it. A disclaimer: In response to inquiries by readers, may I make it clear that this Weed for one has not been genetically modified. I am happy to have this claim examined by a balanced panel of experts, as long as it doesn't contain anyone from Monsanto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/1999/feb/27/books.guardianreview2","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-27T03:13:23Z","webTitle":"Goodbye to all that","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/feb/27/books.guardianreview2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/feb/27/books.guardianreview2","fields":{"headline":"Goodbye to all that","bodyText":"My home town was a kind of ground zero for Englishness. Almost a national synonym for middle-class ennui, East Grinstead was the last stop on a railway line south of London, the first place outside the metropolis that wasn't actually metropolitan, a welter of disappointment and understatement and yet also of a kind of pride. When I grew up, it was a commuter-belt development of 20,000 but also a place of its own. Its Victorian railway station and Elizabethan main street, its unique mix of local butchers, bakers, hardware stores and bookshops, the vegetable allotments and rugby pitches, the church spire, the great swathes of bluebells that turned the neighbouring woodlands into a shock of violet in the springtime - they made it a place in itself, a place to stay and grow up in, a place that knew itself and knew where it stood. But 15 years later, it is a place I almost fail to recognise. The meadows I played in as a boy are now covered with crowds of pseudo cottages built for the burgeoning middle class. The old railway station has been replaced by a concrete terminus. The new de facto town centre, a cavernous aircraft hangar of a supermarket, has displaced almost every local shop in the town. The main street is now a ghostly assortment of real estate offices and charity shops, banks and mortgage companies. The main road now leads swiftly on to the new M25 that circles London. Trucks with Belgian and Italian licence plates clog the artery, on their way to Gatwick Airport or the Channel Tunnel. And I click past dozens of German cable channels to watch South Park and Larry King before logging on to my parents' AOL account to check my e-mail. This wasn't quite the script I had imagined when I left in 1984. Every emigrant to America likes to think of his home country as a repository, of the old and the quaint, of unchanging stability and backward thinking. So it is an adjustment to find the suburban England I had once seen as a rickety edifice of nostalgia, class and passivity become the kind of striving, anonymous exurb I once associated with America , and to feel the still-raw unease that such a transformation has clearly brought about. By transformation,I mean the loss of national identity itself. For in a way perhaps invisible to outsiders and too gradual for insiders to fully acknowledge, the combined forces of globalisation, political reform and the end of the cold war have swept through Britain in the past two decades with a force unequalled in any other country in the western world. As the century ends, it is possible, I think, to talk about the abolition of Britain without the risk of hyperbole. The UK's cultural and social identity has been altered beyond any recent prediction. Its very geographical boundaries are being redrawn. Its basic constitution is being gutted and reconceived. Its monarchy has been reinvented. Half its Parliament is under the axe. Its voting system is about to be altered. Its currency may well soon be abandoned. And its role in the world at large is in radical flux. Some of this change was organic and inevitable. But much of it is also the legacy of three remarkable prime ministers, who have successively managed in very different ways to revolutionise Britain's economy, society and constitution in a way that promises to free the people of the island from the past that long threatened to strangle them. It is part of the genius of Britain's undemocratic democracy that this transformation has taken place with such speed and thoroughness. A British Prime Minister commands a largely unitary state with almost unchecked power for an indefinite tenure. With a solid majority in Parliament, he or she can do almost anything, and come from almost anywhere. Walk through central London today and within a few blocks, you hear Arabic and Italian, French and Spanish, Urdu and German. Australian accents are almost as common as American ones. The distinct class dialects I remember from my youth - the high vowels of the aristocracy; the rough, broad edges of cockney; the awkward flatness of mid-England - are far less distinct. Even the BBC is a cacophony of regional twang, with Scottish brogue and Welsh lilt more common than the plummy Queen's English of my teens. Elsewhere, there is a kind of sonorous merging, the rise of a new accent that seems to have absorbed East End vowels with a southern English blandness. It is classless but at the same time fashionably downmarket. Tony Blair's voice captures it: he swings in one sentence from solid English propriety to sudden proletarian slang. Call it lower Blair: the new England wired into the very vocal cords. When I was young, most immigrants still retained a Caribbean tilt or Pakistani staccato. Now they reflect lower Blair or the English region they come from. Think of what Britain once meant and a handful of clichés come to mind. Bad food. Crooked teeth. Good manners. Pragmatism. Free speech. Theatre. Class. Monarchy. Poor heating. Sexual awkwardness. Sentimentality to animals. Stoicism. Looking at this list today, only a handful survive: theatre, free speech and the pet fixation. A modern list of Britishness would look altogether different. Designer furniture. Misogyny. Public relations. Sarcasm. Excessive drinking. Fast driving. Celebrity. Beaujolais nouveau. Mobile phones. Tabloids. Sexual ease. The latter is perhaps the most surprising. Stroll through Soho, where as a teenager I peeked into dirty book-stores and video booths, titillated by the clammy desire that was inextricable from English sexual shame. Now the streets pulse with a throng of Italian and French immigrants and a freshly visible gay subculture. Night life begins at 2am and continues past dawn - every day of the week. In a single generation, the English appear to have abandoned a habit of awkwardness for an assumption of hedonism. Everywhere the new intercepts the old: the Seattle coffee bar next to the pub, the gleaming new gym next to the tube station, the Millennium Dome near the old Docklands, the banks of female deputies behind Tony Blair in the House of Commons. Perhaps most striking is the racial integration. When I left Britain, London was still reeling from race riots in Brixton and from a sense that the island could not possibly absorb all the immigrants without a racial conflagration. There is still racism and employment discrimination, of course, and the findings of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry have provided further evidence of unequal police treatment. Parliament, the armed forces and the police force remain disturbingly white. But compared with the racial tension I feel every day in Washington, the ethnic mix in London seems remarkably at ease. For more than a decade, European Union nationals have had an automatic right to live and work in Britain. With economic growth in that period roughly twice the European average and with the British unemployment rate around half the European average, the influx has been palpable and continues. More foreign EU nationals live and work in London than in any other European city. Tony Blair's real radicalism has turned out to be constitutional rather than economic or social. He saw the decrepitude of Britain's constitutional order and embarked on perhaps the most far-reaching series of reforms ever tried by a modern British government. Of the dozens of conversations I had in London about the future of the UK, no one I spoke to believed Scotland would be a part of Britain in 10 years' time. The Welsh, too, voted in favour of their own assembly, which they will also elect in May. The Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland presages a slow dissolution of London's rule in Ulster. The third de facto country in the island - greater London - will finally elect its own mayor. What Blair has ushered in, in other words, may well turn out to be a return to a political Constitution last seen in the late Middle Ages: an English state with an almost independent European metropolis on the Thames, a feisty neighbour to its north and a half-heartedly controlled province to its west. When I left for America, the clear, simple symbol of England was the Union Jack. It is now increasingly the bare emblem of St George: a red cross on a white background. You see it in soccer stadiums and emblazoned into the skulls of East End skinheads. In 1995, the biggest greeting-card distributor introduced a card to celebrate St George's Day on April 23. Within two years, as Jeremy Paxman pointed out, the number of cards sold had grown to as much as 50,000. The repercussions of this are a little hard to envisage. They extend from the possibility of a bitter if peaceful, internal split-up - a kind of Yugoslavia with cups of tea - to more far-reaching questions such as Britain's place in the UN Security Council. Will England deserve a seat - with a population of merely 49 million, on barely two-thirds of a small island? No one seems to know. Just as blithely, Blair is also set to change Britain's second chamber beyond recognition. In 1940, when George Orwell envisaged a future socialist government, he saw its first objective as the abolition of the House of Lords. Sixty years later, it's finally happening. This year, more than 600 of 752 hereditary peers - the descendants of royal mistresses and ancient landowners, among others - will be fired from the upper chamber. Adoption of the euro has come to symbolise the ambivalence with which the British, if that is still a meaningful term, have come to abandon their nationhood. The country, in any case, has already unravelled in more amorphous ways. But the adoption of a foreign currency, the abolition of the English \"quid'', the handing over of the power of money itself to a bank in Frankfurt, has stuck quite understandably in the collective English throat. It has become a rallying cry for all those suddenly fearful of the symbolic end of a nation that has, in truth, already ended. It is a symbol of a reality the English have accepted but not yet acknowledged. Loss is the central theme of modern Britain: loss of empire, loss of power, loss of grandeur, loss of the comfort of the past. When Churchill rallied his countrymen to the immense task of 1940 by calling the Battle of Britain his nation's \"finest hour\u0094, he was perhaps unaware of the burden that phrase would impose on future generations. How do you envisage a future in a country whose greatest moment has been indisputably centred in the past? The problem was, after all, insoluble. It was the problem of decline. And perhaps the new era is symptomatic of a simple, exhausted decision to drop the issue altogether, a mass letting go, a communal sigh of acceptance that because the problem cannot be solved it should be quietly abandoned. It is a recognition that for each successive generation, the question of national power that once dominated the country's politics has less and less meaning or force. The British have finally stopped seeking a role and started getting a life. It is a typically pragmatic improvisation. By quietly abolishing Britain, the islanders abolish the problem of Britain. For there is no \"Great\"hovering in front of Scotland, England or Wales. These older, deeper entities come from a time before the loss of empire, before even the idea of empire. Britain is a relatively recent construct, cobbled together in the 17th century in the Act of Union with Scotland, over-reaching in Ireland and America in the 18th and finally spreading as an organising, colonial force across the globe in the 19th. Like the Soviet empire before it, although in an incomparably more benign way, this contrived nation experienced a cathartic defeat-in-victory in the second world war, and after a desperate, painful attempt to reassert itself, has finally given up. Before very long, the words \"United Kingdom\"may seem as anachronistic as \"Soviet Union,\"although they will surely be remembered more fondly. But unlike Russia's future, Britain's is far from bleak. London is Europe's cultural and financial capital, as well as one of the world's truly international hubs. England itself remains as opaque as ever: undemonstrative yet restless, cantankerous yet docile, open to the world and yet oddly at ease with its isolation. The ruddy faces and warm beer may be receding, but the rowdy cosmopolitanism that was once typical of the islanders under the last Queen Elizabeth seems clearly on the rebound. Perhaps England's future, then, will be as a Canada to the EU's United States, with Scotland playing the role of Quebec. Or maybe Blair will lose his nerve, a backlash will occur and the dissolution of Britain may slow for a while. We cannot know for sure. What we can know, however, is that the English, for their part, seem to be enjoying the ride. Maybe they intuit that Orwell was wrong about the endurance of British nationalism but right about the tenacity of Englishness. It is hard to forget Orwell's elegiac hope, as German bombs were raining down on London, that even if every major institution in Britain were thrown on to the scrapheap, England would still somehow be England, \"an everlasting animal stretching into the future and the past, and, like all living things, having the power to change out of recognition and yet remain the same.\" Or perhaps the islanders have merely sensed that there is only so long, even if you are English, that you can cling to a culture of loss. Sooner or later, you begin to feel the possibility of gain. \u0095 Andrew Sullivan is the author of Love Undetectable: Reflections On Friendship, Sex And Survival (Chatto, £12.99)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/feb/27/duncancampbell","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-27T03:13:42Z","webTitle":"Police in new scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/27/duncancampbell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/feb/27/duncancampbell","fields":{"headline":"Police in new scandal","bodyText":"The police service, still reeling from the criticisms of its handling of the Stephen Lawrence case, was yesterday dealt another severe blow with the announcement of a major corruption investigation involving the suspension of officers from two of the country's elite squads.

In strictly architectural terms County Hall was nothing to write home about, a bland and half-hearted Edwardian baroque conceit, never a match for the Gothic revival splendour of the Palace of Westminster across the Thames. So Norman Foster has a clean slate to design the first truly impressive home for London government. Given limited finance and the need to build quickly, he has opted for a dramatic architectural one-liner, a building that promises to make an instant mark on the capital. It looks like a giant eye and is designed to catch the eye. Certainly it will be the world's most overtly modern city hall. It will also be the most transparent, its acres of glass wall symbolic of the democracy and open government London has been denied for the past 13 years. In this sense it is very different from most city halls, which from Glasgow via Leeds and Manchester to Barcelona and Berlin, New York and Chicago are designed to represent the monumental authority of city government. Most city halls of the past century have been designed in grandiloquent neo-classical or baroque styles to emphasise this power. Even when modern styles of architecture have been commissioned these have veered towards the monumental. Even that most democratic of countries, Holland, where modern architecture has long been considered a virtue, boasts such forbidding city halls as the one at Hilversum. One has to travel far to find locally elected assemblies housed in gentle, likeable or modest architecture. Alvar Aalto's work in Finland was exemplary in this respect, but in the rest of the world notions of authority and power have long been confused, with the result that the architecture of democracy has often been indistinguishable from that of one-party and fascist states. Elsewhere even the most progressive or left-wing cities - Barcelona, Manchester, Berlin - rely on the heavy-handed symbolism of classical architecture. Foster's building for London, if it is to be as well executed as it deserves, takes the idea of a truly open city government further than it has been to date. It is radical and has a great deal to live up to."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/feb/28/observerbusiness.theobserver4","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-28T02:02:19Z","webTitle":"We've already joined a single currency.

In 765","bodyText":"The pound sterling, guardian of British sovereignty against the onslaught of Europeans, was in fact invented by a Frenchman. Emperor Charlemagne set up the system of pennies and pounds (livres) in the eighth century, and spread it around the Continent. After it was successfully launched in the rest of Europe, the ancient Britons decided to join in. Around 765, King Heaberth of Kent produced the first English pennies. Later King Offa of Mercia conquered Kent and introduced silver pennies across most of England. Twelve hundred years on, the pound is the world's longest continuously serving currency. The value of the pound was easily determined: a pound weight in silver. One word came to describe both the currency and the metal: sterling. A pound sterling was literally a pound of silver. In today's money, it was worth around £500. But its high value meant it was of no day-to-day use, and for the first half of its life the pound was a unit of accounting only, a notional currency, with no form in notes and coins (Does that remind you of anything?). Instead, for its first 1206 years until 1971, the pound was divided into 240 pennies. The pound of silver was literally cut up into 240 pieces, and each little chunk was turned into a coin, stamped with the king's head as a seal of authority and guarantee of quality. But even these were not very practical. They represented more than a day's wage for a worker; buying a loaf of bread was like trying to pay a bus fare with a £50 note. Halfpennies and farthings (a quarter of a penny) came into circulation: they were literally pennies chopped into halves or quarters. Not until 1279, sensitive about having his head chopped up, did Edward I issue the first round halfpennies and farthings. The European pounds and pennies didn't suffer from the high-value problem; monarchs simply made the coins worth less by devaluing them, making them of less than pure silver. English monarchs were generally good at resisting such temptation - with one exception. Henry VIII sparked what has become known to numismatists as the 'the great debasement'. To pay for his lavish lifestyle, he added copper into the silver coins, effectively robbing them of their value. This caused monetary chaos for decades. Any good money that escaped his clutches was driven out of circulation by the bad. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, she had to recall every coin in the kingdom and reissue proper ones. It wasn't only monarchs who tampered with coins. In the first decades of the twelfth century, the quality of silver in Britain's currency fell sharply. On Christmas Day 1124, all the mint masters were tried and found guilty at the Assize of Winchester, and punished by having their right hands chopped off. The quality of coinage suddenly improved. Over the centuries, bigger and bigger value coins were introduced. Edward I came out with the groat, the largest value silver coin, worth four pennies. Edward III brought out the first gold coin, a noble, worth a third of a pound. Finally, in 1489, Henry VII told the Tower of London to mint the first pound coin: the gold sovereign, complete with a detailed, realistic coin portrait of a monarch on a throne, bearing orb and sceptre. The sovereign has a proud history as the monetary backbone of the British empire, but Henry was in fact merely falling into line with European practice. Large gold coins were all the rage on the mainland, and the new sovereign was almost identical in weight and design to a Dutch coin launched two years earlier. But after 700 years as a notional currency, the pound at last existed in concrete form (the euro is set to make the same progress in just three years). The introduction of higher-value gold coins had unintended consequences. If the price of gold varied against that of silver, the value of the coins would no longer add up. When it was introduced, the guinea was worth 20 shillings, or a pound. But it gradually appreciated against silver and became worth 21 shillings ( £1.05). The true flowering of coinage came under Elizabeth I, who appointed as Master of the Mint the great mathematical genius Sir Isaac Newton. Suddenly there were more denominations of coin than at any time before or since - values such as three farthings (three-quarters of a penny) or three halfpence, the idea being to make giving change easier. Eventually, cash-strapped monarchs introduced other forms of currency. James I issued copper coins, which people distrusted for years. When it was founded in 1694, the Bank of England issued paper currency - little more than handwritten promissory notes, such as the £1,000 note of 1725. Notes were first issued on a wide scale to help pay for the Napoleonic wars: £1, £2 and £5 notes were printed en masse, and deemed scandalous by decent society. Gold was eliminated from coins after the First World War, and the silver content was dropped to 50 per cent. During the Second World War, the precious metals were replaced by today's copper-nickel. However, given the press outrage at the insult to the monarch implicit in abandoning the pound, it may come as a surprise that the monarch's face appeared on banknotes only in 1960 - and never has in Scotland. So although the pound has a 1,200-year history, the Queen's head on a tenner is very much a newfangled concept."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/1999/feb/28/politicalnews.foodanddrink.jayrayneronrestaurants1","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-28T15:46:44Z","webTitle":"Dame Shirley of Tel Aviv","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1999/feb/28/politicalnews.foodanddrink.jayrayneronrestaurants1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/1999/feb/28/politicalnews.foodanddrink.jayrayneronrestaurants1","fields":{"headline":"Dame Shirley of Tel Aviv","bodyText":"Dame Shirley Porter would not agree to talk in her flat in Israel, overlooking the sea. 'People write about gold taps and that sort of thing,' she said, accurately. Instead we would take a trip by boat down the Yarkon River which flows through Tel Aviv on its way from the hills of the West Bank to the Mediterranean and which is indisputably filthy. In 1997 three athletes at the Maccabi Games the Jewish Olympics fell into the water when a bridge they were crossing collapsed. They later died, not from injuries incurred when the structure gave way, but from poisoning. We set off in the boat piloted by Dame Shirley's 'environmental adviser'. It was fiercely hot and sunny. Dame Shirley pulled a floppy straw hat from her shoulder bag, put a shielding hand above her eyes, and scanned the bank like an explorer. Soon she had identified the enemy. 'What's all that stuff?' she said, waving towards the water's edge. We looked. Plastic wrappers and old bottles, a couple of cans and some dirty paper clung to the damp earth. Dame Shirley had found litter. 'It's from a private picnic,' her adviser said. 'I don't care what it's from,' Dame Shirley said. 'It shouldn't be there. It should be cleaned up.' Dame Shirley has always hated litter. Crisp packets, fag ends, human detritus of all sorts in London, these were the things that turned her into a politician. In Israel, however, litter is only one of her many causes. Further upstream on the Yarkon lie the beginnings of a nautical centre, where schoolchildren will learn to canoe and sail, and possibly swim when if the water tests clean enough. It is being built in memory of Dame Shirley's grandson, Daniel, who was killed in a car crash in Israel in 1993 while he was on military service, from funds supplied by the Porter Foundation, her family's charity. Two miles away to the north is the campus of Tel Aviv University, where Sir Leslie Porter, her husband, is chancellor. It is rich with buildings and projects endowed by the Porters. There is the Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics and the Shirley and Leslie Porter School of Cultural Studies. There is the Cohen-Porter Family Swimming Pool. The Porters have endowed academic posts and set up scholarship funds and made annual donations for books and equipment. They have given large amounts of money to Israel for the past 30 years, even when they didn't live there, and they continue to give money now that they do. There is, however, one sum of money that the Porters are not so keen to part with. That is the money which, according to a ruling reached in December 1997 by the High Court of England, Dame Shirley Porter owes to the London Borough of Westminster: pounds 26.5 million. That, according to the judgment, is the loss caused to Westminster taxpayers by her unlawful policy of selling council property to private purchasers in the hope that they would vote Tory, implemented after the 1986 council elections. She is in no mood to pay and has appealed against the judgment to a higher court. In any case, she has no assets left in England to pay with. In 1994 she sold her flat overlooking Hyde Park and her weekend cottage in Oxfordshire. Up to that year, there had been 5.5 million shares in Tesco, the company founded by her father, Jack Cohen, registered under her name, worth more than pounds 10m. In 1994, any reference to Dame Shirley Porter disappeared from the company records, either because she had sold the shares or because they had been transferred to another name. Other investments were moved into trusts in Panama and Guernsey. At the time this money was on the move, a report estimated the combined wealth of Dame Shirley and her husband at pounds 70m. However accurate the figure the Porters did not challenge it none of that money remained within British jurisdiction, and neither did she. The year the money departed, the Porters took up residence in a penthouse apartment at the wealthy seaside resort of Herzilya Pituach, half an hour's drive north of Tel Aviv. They also have a house in Palm Springs, California, to which they retreat from the wind and rain of a Middle Eastern winter. Their links with Britain have not quite been severed, though. The Porters still attend official functions staged by representatives of Her Majesty's Government in Israel. Last June, they were at the Queen's Birthday Party, which is held every year at the official residence of the British Ambassador in the hills of Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv. But other than on legal business, their visits to Britain are rare. Dame Shirley does not see herself as a fugitive. She sees herself as a victim of history. She wrote in a letter to me: 'As the years have passed, the political nature (of the case against her) has become ever clearer. I am being hounded for who I am, for my unrepentant Thatcherism, for the sins of the Eighties, real or imagined.' Her appeal will be heard next month. Dame Shirley had not given an interview for more than five years when I first wrote to her in Israel in September last year. She seemed determined to continue this silence. 'I have had time to reflect upon your request,' she wrote back. 'As much as I would like to put my point of view, I am advised by my lawyers that this case should be decided in the courts and not in the media. So reluctantly I must say no.' She invited me to talk instead to Roger Rosewell who, at the time, wrote right-wing editorials for the Mail on Sunday and who for 15 years has been her unofficial spokesman. Rosewell started his political life as the industrial organiser of the Socialist Workers' Party (a Trotskyist group) in the Seventies and then made the familiar journey to the other extreme. 'The older I get,' he said, 'the more suspicious I become of people who have too many political principles.' His view of Dame Shirley was roughly this: that she was not 'a philosophical Conservative' but someone who believed that local government was largely about the very apolitical business of 'delivering services and of getting things done'. Rosewell talked in long, clause-heavy sentences, as if he were addressing a public meeting and didn't want to allow space for interruptions. What really defined her, he said, was her desire to speak her mind. As to homes-for-votes: 'Shirley did what the lawyers said. The lawyer who gave the advice has been acquitted. The council officers have been acquitted. But judges say she's still guilty because she had an unlawful motive. They think they know what was going on in her head.' But if she were convinced of her innocence, why had she left the country? Rosewell said that it wasn't as people thought. Her daughter Linda had lived in Israel for many years, and in 1993 her grandson, Daniel Marcus, had died in a car crash. At the same time Linda had been in the middle of a complicated divorce. 'A great wave of affection and emotion came over Shirley, and she was adamant she had to be at Linda's side,' Rosewell said. 'I think they found a strength there as a family that they did not have here. But she's still a British citizen. She's not hiding. She's not fleeing the country.' It was difficult to find other people in Britain who, like Rosewell, would admit to being 'fond' of Dame Shirley despised her. Tricia Kirwan, who resigned from the chair of the council's housing committee in 1989, said: 'It was bully, bully, bully. She didn't know how to handle people. She always needed to be told how important or how clever she was. I think she wanted terribly to achieve something and I don't think she ever did.' The essence of Dame Shirley's character, she said, was in the detail: 'Her flat was indescribably vulgar. She had covers on the loo paper. Her drinks cabinet was gilt.' John Ware, a BBC producer who investigated Dame Shirley for two years for Panorama, had tried to understand her. 'I think she experienced quite a lot of subliminal, posh anti-Semitism. When a Tory said 'she's just ghastly' you knew what they meant.' The result, he said, was that she interpreted all opposition as unjustified and unfair. 'She was someone who set her jaw against the world. A combination of a doting dad, loads of money, and a chip on her shoulder that wasn't imagined, was lethal.' I was even told by a former opposition councillor: 'I sometimes wonder how anybody can like her, and then I remember that even Hitler had friends.' In Israel, they do not say that kind of thing. In Israel they say the opposite. I went to Israel in the hope that Dame Shirley might change her mind and agree to see me. On the phone she said she would think about it. In the meantime, she said, I might make a tour of Porter sites. She would help with the appointments. At Tel Aviv University, I visited the jewel among the family's endowments, the United Kingdom Building of Life Sciences, a six-storey cube of bright white concrete. It is home to an enormous range of academic endeavours (including an entire floor endowed, according to its plaque, by Gail and Gerald Ronson). There, at the Porter Super Centre for Environmental and Ecological Research, I met Professor Yossi Loya. 'There are not very many donors interested in the environment,' he said. 'Most of them, they just want to put their name on buildings. But here is a lady who has the environment prime among her interests. This is very unusual.' She was always asking questions, he said. 'She came to the faculty and she looked at the toilets and she gave money to clean them up.' Yoram Shamir, the university's spokesman, was equally enthusiastic about the Porters. 'There are many projects they give money to but which they don't put their name upon,' he said. When I asked about the Westminster case, he explained that these things did not interest the university. 'She's willing to do things no other donor would do. She initiates prizes for the cleanest toilet. This is brave.' Dame Shirley also arranged for me to see the Porter Senior Citizen Centre in Old Jaffa, of which Tel Aviv had originally been a suburb, and where many Jewish immigrants, mostly Sephardic Bulgarians, had made their homes in the 1940s. Now they were in their seventies and eighties. For many of them, Israel had not lived up to its promises; they were poor and isolated and ailing. The day centre, opened in 1993, had clearly been a success, full of local residents from dawn until dusk. It provides workshops, legal advice and companionship. 'Shirley was one of the first donors to give to these people,' said David Altman, the director of the Tel Aviv Foundation. 'Why did she give? Because of her sensitivity to older people. To needy people. Because of her experience in public life.' He introduced me in Hebrew to the crowds in the social room, telling them I was a journalist writing about Shirley Porter. Immediately a dozen elderly women jumped to their feet and ululated in greeting, their arms lifted high. 'They don't see her as a nameless figure,' Altman said over the din. 'She is someone they know.' One of the women said, 'Shirley is the mother of this club. She takes care of everything.' 'See?' Altman shouted genially. 'See? For them the Porter name makes them very proud. I can tell you 50 per cent of the people here wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for the Porter Centre.' And the case in Westminster? 'I have never seen a successful politician anywhere in the world,' he said, 'who didn't have people after their neck. People are always trying to prove you are not as good as you say.' So it went on. Shlomo Lahat, who was mayor of Tel Aviv for 20 years until he retired in 1993, said he had been to Westminster and studied Dame Shirley's methods. 'I was very much impressed by the way she treated the public and her employees. I copied many things from her.' Such as? 'Denver boots. You know. Wheel clamps. I copied it from her. I wasn't looking to make myself popular. I was looking to bring order to the city. When we used Denver boots they saw that I meant it.' Eventually, after further snatched conversations by mobile phone, in which she restated the risks she felt she would be taking if she granted an interview, Dame Shirley agreed to meet me. In television news reports, during the homes-for-votes scandal, as she had stood on the steps of the London court building, or outside Westminster council's offices intoning statements of defiance, Dame Shirley had appeared solid and square-shouldered in tailored two-piece suits. Here, dressed against the Israeli sun in denim trousers and a long-sleeved floral shirt in matching shades of rust, she looked thin and fragile. We took our boat trip and then returned to the restaurant of the Council for a Beautiful Israel, where we had met. She wouldn't discuss the case, she said. Any thoughts she had on that she would give me in a letter. We would have to come at it from other directions, then. Did she understand why people often reacted so badly to her? 'The thing is, I hate pretension and in politics you see a lot of it. I need to be involved. I like to improve the quality of life.' She reminded me about the litter we had seen on the river bank. 'So what if it was this or that private picnic? It shouldn't be there. It should be cleaned up. I have this habit inherited from my father. He would go into a shop and he would always find the one dented tin. Well, I'm like that. I'm exactly like that.' She said she thought of herself as a catalyst. 'I am able to empathise. I'm a people person. I think I get that from my father. I like the fabrics of cities, people who make things happen. I don't like pretension. I like encouraging people.' Once, she said, these qualities had won her friends. 'I used to be the darling of the London Evening Standard before Max Hastings became editor (in 1996). Max seems to hate me.' Why? 'It might be because he came from the hunting-and-shooting wing of the Tory party. Because I'm a woman, I'm wealthy.' The truth was, she said, she didn't have much time for the British Tory party these days. She didn't see a place for herself in an organisation that was so set against closer ties with Europe. It did not mean, however, that she could throw her lot in with Labour. 'I think Blair's a very clever fellow. Their party management is terrific. But I can't believe they have the extreme Left under control. The odd thing is I like the razzmatazz and sense of fun and excitement that they engender, though when I tried to do the same in Westminster with similar pizzazz the opposition were the first to scoff.' Her irritation that her achievements had been forgotten was a constant theme. She gave me typed lists of initiatives and policies: the Say No to Drugs Campaign, the Plain English Campaign, her success at keeping local taxes down, her involvement in the abolition of the Greater London Council. 'Basically, I was just interested in cleaning things up,' she said. 'I wasn't a deep thinker. I believe people should be helped if they need it. My own philosophy was about putting the customer first.' Would she still describe herself as a committed Thatcherite? 'Yes,' she said. I asked if there was anything she regretted. 'I regret having gone into politics and having put my whole life and soul into it. I didn't spend as much time with Daniel (her dead grandson) and Joanna (her granddaughter) as I could have done.' She looked uncomfortable for the only time in our conversation and rapped her fingers on the table. 'Nor did I spend enough time with my parents. And what for? To have my name dragged through the mud. It upsets me that people, out of revenge, tear me apart.' Then she said: 'I never want to be at the mercy of anybody else ever again.' She handed me the letter. 'You can quote from that,' she said. She had a meeting to go to. I walked her to her taxi in the car park. She pulled the floppy straw hat from her bag and put it on against the sun. The letter ran to 11 pages. Her designated-sales policy was entirely lawful, she wrote. She had taken legal advice and acted upon it. Yet she was being found guilty because, the judges said, she had an unlawful motive. 'While I never bullied or bribed anyone to do my bidding, I used my strong personality to push through a policy that appeared lawful on the outside, indeed which was lawful on the outside, but which has since become unlawful because of my private thoughts and passions.' She had understood perfectly what was going on: 'Westminster was one of the Left's prime targets. Sure they wrecked meetings, spat at me and others, smoked dope in the council chamber, thumped staff and tried to make the council ungovernable. But we hung on.' The problem, as she saw it, was that the case was being dealt with through the courts. 'Law and politics don't mix,' she wrote. 'Political skills don't count for much in a courtroom. If there had been a vote between myself and the auditor I would trust democracy any day.' And then, not for the first time, she invoked the memory of Jack Cohen, the Tesco mogul. 'My late father was a great fighter. I am the same. Whatever it takes and however long it takes I will clear my name. I will prove my innocence. I have never been a quitter. I am not going to start becoming one now.' One afternoon, not long after my return from Israel, I went along to the National Portrait Gallery. I had noticed from the accounts of the Porter Foundation that it had given substantial amounts of money to the gallery and I wanted to see what it had bought them. The Porter Gallery, on the ground floor, is less a room than a broad alcove of shiny marble, with a tablet of bleached stone carved with the family name fixed to the wall. Inside was a temporary exhibition of cartoons by Gerald Scarfe, who does cruel things to the human face. There was Harold Wilson, the prime minister who had given Jack Cohen his knighthood, hangdog features drooping to the ground, bags beneath his eyes big enough to carry home the weekly shop. There was Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister whom Shirley so adored. Scarfe had her as a bloody axehead, decapitating her opponents. There was John Major, the Prime Minister who had given Shirley her damehood, and who was pictured as a grey-faced Dr Death. Scarfe's introduction to the exhibition was attached to the wall of the gallery. 'It is the misuse of power,' he had written, 'from the smallest, crookedest local councillor to the bloodiest Stalins, that fires my political drawings.' There was no cartoon of Shirley Porter. For the time being, she appeared to have escaped.

'People write about gold taps and that sort of thing,' she said, accurately. Instead we would take a trip by boat down the Yarkon River which flows through Tel Aviv on its way from the hills of the West Bank to the Mediterranean and which is indisputably filthy. In 1997 three athletes at the Maccabi Games - the Jewish Olympics - fell into the water when a bridge they were crossing collapsed. They later died, not from injuries incurred when the structure gave way, but from poisoning. We set off in the boat piloted by Dame Shirley's 'environmental adviser'. It was fiercely hot and sunny. Dame Shirley pulled a floppy straw hat from her shoulder bag, put a shielding hand above her eyes, and scanned the bank like an explorer. Soon she had identified the enemy. 'What's all that stuff?' she said, waving towards the water's edge. We looked. Plastic wrappers and old bottles, a couple of cans and some dirty paper clung to the damp earth. Dame Shirley had found litter. 'It's from a private picnic,' her adviser said. 'I don't care what it's from,' Dame Shirley said. 'It shouldn't be there. It should be cleaned up.' Dame Shirley has always hated litter. Crisp packets, fag ends, human detritus of all sorts - in London, these were the things that turned her into a politician. In Israel, however, litter is only one of her many causes. Further upstream on the Yarkon lie the beginnings of a nautical centre, where schoolchildren will learn to canoe and sail, and possibly swim when - if - the water tests clean enough. It is being built in memory of Dame Shirley's grandson, Daniel, who was killed in a car crash in Israel in 1993 while he was on military service, from funds supplied by the Porter Foundation, her family's charity. Two miles away to the north is the campus of Tel Aviv University, where Sir Leslie Porter, her husband, is chancellor. It is rich with buildings and projects endowed by the Porters. There is the Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics and the Shirley and Leslie Porter School of Cultural Studies. There is the Cohen-Porter Family Swimming Pool. The Porters have endowed academic posts and set up scholarship funds and made annual donations for books and equipment. They have given large amounts of money to Israel for the past 30 years, even when they didn't live there, and they continue to give money now that they do. There is, however, one sum of money that the Porters are not so keen to part with. That is the money which, according to a ruling reached in December 1997 by the High Court of England, Dame Shirley Porter owes to the London Borough of Westminster: £26.5 million. That, according to the judgment, is the loss caused to Westminster taxpayers by her unlawful policy of selling council property to private purchasers in the hope that they would vote Tory, implemented after the 1986 council elections. She is in no mood to pay and has appealed against the judgment to a higher court. In any case, she has no assets left in England to pay with. In 1994 she sold her flat overlooking Hyde Park and her weekend cottage in Oxfordshire. Up to that year, there had been 5.5 million shares in Tesco, the company founded by her father, Jack Cohen, registered under her name, worth more than £10m. In 1994, any reference to Dame Shirley Porter disappeared from the company records, either because she had sold the shares or because they had been transferred to another name. Other investments were moved into trusts in Panama and Guernsey. At the time this money was on the move, a report estimated the combined wealth of Dame Shirley and her husband at £70m. However accurate the figure - the Porters did not challenge it - none of that money remained within British jurisdiction, and neither did she. The year the money departed, the Porters took up residence in a penthouse apartment at the wealthy seaside resort of Herzilya Pituach, half an hour's drive north of Tel Aviv. They also have a house in Palm Springs, California, to which they retreat from the wind and rain of a Middle Eastern winter. Their links with Britain have not quite been severed, though. The Porters still attend official functions staged by representatives of Her Majesty's Government in Israel. Last June, they were at the Queen's Birthday Party, which is held every year at the official residence of the British Ambassador in the hills of Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv. But other than on legal business, their visits to Britain are rare. Dame Shirley does not see herself as a fugitive. She sees herself as a victim of history. She wrote in a letter to me: 'As the years have passed, the political nature [of the case against her] has become ever clearer. I am being hounded for who I am, for my unrepentant Thatcherism, for the sins of the Eighties, real or imagined.' Her appeal will be heard next month. Dame Shirley had not given an interview for more than five years when I first wrote to her in Israel in September last year. She seemed determined to continue this silence. 'I have had time to reflect upon your request,' she wrote back. 'As much as I would like to put my point of view, I am advised by my lawyers that this case should be decided in the courts and not in the media. So reluctantly I must say no.'

Tricia Kirwan, who resigned from the chair of the council's housing committee in 1989, said: 'It was bully, bully, bully. She didn't know how to handle people. She always needed to be told how important or how clever she was. I think she wanted terribly to achieve something and I don't think she ever did.'

At the city's Petroleum Club, only the odd executive pops in for lunch before heading back to a busy office - and a dwindling workforce. The black gold that powered Scotland's economy and fuelled nationalist ire is not the strong currency it was. In 1998 UK oil revenues collapsed by 33 per cent to 20 per cent of their peak value in 1984; boom town days are gone. But this collapse means more to Scots - and, ultimately, the UK - than bland per barrel figures and a few luxury goods sitting unwanted on Aberdeen shelves. It is a crucial ingredient of the question they must answer on May 6: would Scotland be better off going it alone? In the next few weeks politicians of all hues will fill newspapers with their rhetoric on the benefits of self-determination and the dangers of separation. Sean Connery will rally nationalist pride for the Scottish National Party. Tony Blair and some pop stars will chorus 'Altogether Now' in defence of the Union. But beneath the glitz lies the drier text of economics. In the seventies and eighties it was easy enough. The SNP's campaign, It's Scotland's Oil, met willing listeners. A nation suffering under alien Thatcherite policies and laissez faire economics was desperate to hear that the crude stuff of the North Sea could fund a better, more socially just country - an independent Scotland. The SNP told them it could, and it claims that Treasury figures prove it was correct. Early last year, in a written answer to John Swinney, the SNP's deputy leader and Treasury spokesman, William Waldegrave, former chief secretary to the Treasury, conceded that between 1979 and 1995 the UK was £27 billion in deficit to Scotland. The nationalists vaunted it as a devastating figure; Labour claimed it was worthless, referring to only a narrow period in the 1980s when oil prices peaked. Whatever the truth, the collapse in the price of oil has now moved the debate on to much rougher terrain. According to the latest Government Expenditures and Revenues in Scotland (GERS) figure, in 1996/97 Scotland showed a fiscal deficit of around £7.1 billion, excluding oil revenues. If this figure is, as most economists assert, the most accurate snapshot of the economic state of play, an independent Scotland would begin life with an annual deficit of between £3 billion and £4 billion, taking oil revenues into account. Predictably, Labour seizes on the GERS figure while the SNP rejects it as a political exercise. Although the way it was calculated has been endorsed by the Treasury and the House of Commons library, the nationalists refuse to accept the methodology. 'We do not accept that Scotland is subsidised,' said Alex Salmond, the SNP leader. 'If you look at the figures closely, over that period the UK ran a deficit of almost £32 billion. If you take Scotland's population share of this, assuming it is no better or worse off than anywhere else in Britain, you come to a figure of £2.8 billion. This means Scotland is worse off by £4.3 billion if it stays tethered to London. Many leading academics do not share the SNP's scepticism. Brian Ashcroft, director of the Fraser of Allander economics institute, said that GERS was the most accurate assessment of Scotland's economic viability. Snatching at what it believes to be assured territory, Labour has decided to make 'Divorce is an expensive business' a cornerstone of its election campaign. But Donald Dewar, the Scottish Secretary, readily concedes that an independent Scotland would be economically feasible. 'The argument is about the point of an independent Scotland,' he said. 'Of course we can be independent, we are not a poor country, but you have to ask whether it is sensible for Scotland.' In the short term, oil revenues would be fundamentally important to the economy. But the key to whether Scotland would be better off independent lies in the future: the euro, transition costs, political uncertainty, and the debate over whether economic policy made in Scotland would give appreciably better results than that made in the UK. Prof Ashcroft said: 'There would have to be massive improvements in the supply side - research and development, innovation, productivity, business start-up rates - for Scotland to prosper, and it is not clear that improved policy would have enough impact to make much difference.' In the past few months the SNP, though Mr Salmond vigorously denies this, has been changing its position on the economy of an independent Scotland. It is beginning to concede that Scotland would run with a budget deficit, but it would be small and would be cancelled out in time by a more vibrant economy. However, Labour claims, to SNP fury, that, using the GERS figure and its projections, Scotland would not meet the crucial Maastricht criterion - that public sector annual debt as a percentage of GDP must not exceed 3 per cent - for joining the euro, a cornerstone of SNP economic policy. An SNP administration would most likely have to set up an exchange rate mechanism for a currency allied to sterling, But Mr Dewar said it would also leave Scotland with increased taxes or lowered public expenditure. The nationalists, however, dismiss Labour predictions as scaremongering. 'There will obviously be associated costs with becoming independent, but there will be a multiplier effect in the economy with jobs created, greater consideration of Scotland's needs, promotion of its goods and companies and greater efficiency,' said Mr Swinney. 'The transition will have neutral impact and then Scotland can begin to prosper.' To reach this prosperity, the SNP must convince a nervous business community of its argument - 75 per cent of Scotland's top 100 companies believe independence would be bad for business. But the party line is simple: many of these companies said the same before the vote for devolution, and all have stayed. As to the greatest business fear - that Scotland will lose its relationship with England, its best trading partner - the SNP points to the harmonious trading between the US and Canada, often to deaf ears. Alan Hogarth of the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland said: 'When 52 per cent of our trade goes south of the border, it doesn't matter what John Swinney is personally going to do to help the transition: there would be no benefit to Scotland in leaving the United Kingdom.' For each economic policy and figure the SNP produces, Labour has a contrary one. For the man in the street it is, at best, bamboozling. Prof Ashcroft said: 'I am not so sure an independent Scotland would prosper much more greatly on its own, but its something people are going to have to make their minds up on pretty quickly.'

It sounds bland, commonplace even, but that phrase implies a large extension not just of anti-discrimination law but of the powers of the peculiar body with the job of combating ethnic inequity - 'peculiar' because the Commission for Racial Equality is an organ of state, a quango with the job of interfering, even mounting legal actions against other bits of government (as well as the private sector). No wonder, you might say, the CRE has led a shadowy existence since its creation in the mid-Seventies. No wonder such central organs of state as the police and armed forces have been largely impervious to its appeals. But now it's in the limelight. If the injunction above became the law of the land, the police and prison service would for the first time be subject to monitoring and legal action instigated by the CRE - and one of the central recommendations of the Macpherson report thus be carried in effect. Such a change has been unsuccessfully pressed on successive governments (mainly Tory) for two decades. Only now, in the aftermath of the Lawrence inquiry is it anywhere near happening. Here's a quango which, politically speaking, was in a terminal condition in the Thatcher years: her advisers urged its abolition, she interfered with decisions about members and vetoed appointments (1). Now there are high hopes that Jack Straw will pick up and run with the CRE's list of proposals for augmenting the Race Relations Act. They include putting a duty on public bodies to monitor employment and service delivery by ethnic group (2). Yet at the same time the CRE's future is cloudy. And with it prospects for the other big agency, the Equal Opportunities Commission (which deals with gender but not - yet - sexual preference). It has a new chair, Julie Mellor, who is expected to be a lot more dynamic than her predecessor Kamlesh Bahl, which wouldn't be hard. A new Disability Rights Commission is due to be set up this spring but already there's a question mark. The architecture of human rights and equalities is having to be rethought, mainly as a consequence of the Human Rights Act 1998, which brings into United Kingdom law the tenets of the European Convention on Human Rights. Rights and protection against discrimination are not the same but there are huge areas of overlap with inescapable consequences for the agencies - and they may be added to in the shape of a Human Rights Commission. At the moment there's no Richard Rogers design in sight, let alone a clerk of works. Work is in progress in different corners of the site, in Northern Ireland and Scotland, where human rights are officially outside the ambit of the new parliament but questions of jurisdiction and monitoring are pending. The jumble is shown by the fact the CRE (which covers Scotland and Wales as well) answers to the Home Office which will be responsible for implementing the Human Rights Act; but the EOC and disabilities belong to the Department for Education and Employment which, if the past is any guide, is not going to give turf up without a fight. In the background there are European ambiguities. Some equalities are defined by the European Union; other rights are given by the European Court of Human Rights, which comes under the ambit of the Council of Europe. There are battles ahead. Sir Herman Ouseley the CRE chair is on record opposing the creation of an overarching human rights body. Yet without rationalisation of the law and administration of rights and equalities there's a risk of bureaucratic overload and conflict between jurisdictions. The Prime Minister wants British government to 'join up' more. He might start here. Rights may come into conflict. What happens if anti-discrimination initiatives grate against the aim of raising attainment by grading pupils and schools? Meanwhile who monitors the monitors? Some public bodies are now subject to strict performance testing. What would an audit show for, say, the EOC or the CRE? It may be no fault of the CRE that we have had the Lawrence case but at some stage the volume of prejudice and inequality in society is going to have to be put down on the balance sheet. One problem has been that the CRE has to wait till people come to it with problems; its efforts to reach out and fight prejudice, witness its recent advertising campaign, have had mixed results. Then there is the status of race discrimination versus other objects of policy. For example: the CRE wants to force ministers to certify their legislation conforms with the Race Relations Act. That could mean suppressing the rights of parents to choose schools or transfer their children out of an area, in other words pitched battles between the CRE and the Chief Inspector of Schools and his backers in the DfEE (and Number Ten). Meanwhile what if those parents appeal to the courts for protection under sections 8 or 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights as incorporated in the UK Rights Act - the sections dealing with rights to family life and respect for religion? One pointer to the way things might run comes this week from Northern Ireland where the first United Kingdom commission dedicated to implementing human rights has been created. Chaired by Brice Dickson, an academic on leave from the University of Ulster, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission will, among other things, investigate abuses and subject legislation proposed by the NI Assembly (if it gets up and running) to tests of compatibility with human rights statutes, including international law. (All of this on a budget of £750,000 a year.) Also in Ulster there is a new Equality Commission which is absorbing Northern Ireland's separate bodies dealing with religious and political discrimination at work, ethnic minorities, gender and disabilities. It sounds radical in UK terms yet next door in the Republic of Ireland, the Employment Equality Act 1998 has established an agency with (it seems) strong monitoring powers. Northern Ireland is small and has a distinct history offering the unique window of opportunity for change created by last year's Good Friday agreement. For Great Britain the question is whether specialist rights adjudication and anti discrimination work demands specialist bureaucracy. Some lawyers think the better alignment of statutes dealing with rights and equalities takes precedence over how they are enforced. There's certainly scope for mixing and matching. John Wadham argues that courts and tribunals could use human right 9 (on freedom of religion) to extend anti-discrimination protections (3). Doesn't that argue, the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests, for a single human rights agency (4)? So far, the official line is: no merger but 'the Government entirely agrees that there is much scope for the EOC and CRE to work together and encourages them to do so'. The equalities bodies are autonomous. The EOC for example operates under its own statute, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Its £7.1 million budget (in 2000-2001) supports enquiries, research and individuals in bringing cases, mostly before industrial tribunals. The Government is due this summer to respond to an EOC request for additional powers to force employers to monitor staff in terms of gender, grade and pay at least once a year. But take the proverbial case of the pregnant black Muslim woman penalised unfairly, as she sees it, by an employer. We need, says Sarah Spencer the civil liberties lawyer who has been leading for the IPPR on human rights, a one-stop shop. An investigation into, say, alleged racial discrimination in the National Health Service would be unlikely to stop at the boundaries of race: gender and disability would soon enter the picture. Different inquiries conducted by separate agencies would be intolerable. All the more reason, says Ms Spencer for a single body to look at infringements of different rights at the same time. The personnel departments of firms do not always recognise race, gender and disability as discrete categories - pity the executive who had to deal with separate regimes for monitoring quotas for employment calculated on different principles. How many points on a notional scale might an Asian man with a disability score against an African-Caribbean woman without? Sarah Spencer says the way forward is commissioners responsible for race and gender and disability becoming members of a new HRC (The illustration below shows how things might look in future.) That way lies fruitful dialogue as well as, potentially, a lighter burden on employers. That's a touchy subject. There's Chris Haskins, the Labour businessman convening a Cabinet Office panel supposed to be ridding business of excess regulation. Anomalies may matter if there is a backlash against the growth of a rights culture, especially where ethnic minorities are its 'beneficiaries'. William Hague and the Right would be daft not to see political opportunity here. Civil libertarians might have some cause for anxiety, too. The equalities bodies are quangos, things which Labour in opposition found an affront to democracy. The status of the equalities bodies might not matter if all they did was assist people mount cases which the courts and tribunals then decided. It's when they start moving into propaganda and quasi-political action that their ambiguous relations with Whitehall and Westminster become important. Yet, as Ms Spencer says, the success of rights and equalities organisations can only be measured by the shift in public attitudes they engender rather than the number of court cases they take. Human rights are, ultimately, more a matter of persuasion and daily behaviour than legislative fiat or judicial review.

Government lawyers will ask today for the case to be discontinued at the Old Bailey, three months before his trial was due to begin, a spokeswoman for the CPS said last night. The surprise decision, following weeks of private negotiations, was taken after a CPS 'review' of the case. But it was unclear last night at what level the decision was taken or whether David Calvert Smith, the Director of Public Prosecutions was involved. The discontinuation means that neither Mr Aitken nor Mr Ayas will face a trial which could have laid bare some of the Saudi royal family's controversial financial affairs and the way they deal with people who fall out of favour. It is also likely that the sentencing of Mr Aitken, who pleaded guilty at Bow Street magistrates in January to perjury and perverting the course of justice, could be brought forward. Mr Aitken, who faces imprisonment, was due to be sentenced after Mr Ayas's trial which was set down for June 8. The abandonnment of the case will come as a relief to the British and Saudi governments as Mr Ayas had planned to plead not guilty and introduce some potentially embarrassing allegations in his defence. He had planned to argue that he was acting on the instructions of the Saudi ruler, King Fahd, and his former boss, the king's son Prince Mohamad, to conceal a purported intelligence link between the former cabinet minister and the Saudi regime. Mr Ayas, 56, a Saudi citizen of Lebanese origins, was to have been a pivotal witness in Mr Aitken's libel action which followed stories published by The Guardian and Granada's World in Action in April 1995. He signed a statement supporting Mr Aitken's lying account of his weekend stay at the Paris Ritz in September 1993. He backed up Mr Aitken's story that his wife, Lolicia, had paid part of the £1,000 bill. This fell apart when the Guardian and Granada's lawyers produced evidence from British Airways and a Swiss car hire firm that Mrs Aitken had spent the weekend in Switzerland. The libel action collapsed in July 1997 before Mr Ayas was called as a witness. But after the trial it emerged that in June Mr Ayas had been summoned from his London home near Hyde Park to Saudi Arabia by Prince Mohamad who then placed him under house arrest and accused him of stealing $230 million. Mr Ayas, who was the prince's business manager from the early seventies in the negotiation of huge commissions, managed to escape the country disguised as a woman. The prince is pursuing his claim against him through the High Court in London. Mr Ayas has claimed that while under house arrest, and for a while in prison, he was repeatedly interrogated, kept in solitary confinement and deprived of sleep by the Saudi secret police on the orders of the prince. He claims he signed a confession under mental and physical duress. Mr Aitken, who still faces a £2 million costs bill for the libel action, was a business colleague of Mr Ayas and the prince from 1979 through a UK-registered company, Al Bilad. It was set up to sponsor business ventures in the kingdom and garner commissions running into millions of pounds. In 1984 the prince was appointed the governorship of the kingdom's oil-rich eastern province. With five children living in England, Mr Ayas became friendly with the Aitken family and became a god father to Mr Aitken's twin daughter, Victoria. The former minister of defence procurement - and later Chief Secretary to the Trerasury - has admitted that he drafted a witness statement for Victoria which also supported his version of events in Paris. Victoria, now aged 18, was arrested last year but not charged. Since being charged last May Mr Ayas has been on bail and, like Mr Aitken, he was forbidden to leave the country. He was committed for trial with Mr Aitken at Bow Street in December. But in January, after Mr Aitken's guilty pleas, he was granted his passport back in order to travel to Cairo to see his seriously ill father. He returned last month after his father died."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/mar/04/17","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-04T03:22:38Z","webTitle":"Smoke signals from the sage of Omaha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/mar/04/17","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/mar/04/17","fields":{"headline":"Smoke signals from the sage of Omaha","bodyText":"There were two separate and distinct signals from across the Atlantic yesterday on Wall Street's next move. Sitting in a Dairy Queen restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska, America's best investor, Warren Buffett, cautioned that the US stock market had reached a 'dangerous period'. While in New York, Goldman Sachs formally disclosed that a decision had been taken to press the button for a float early in May irrespective of the state of Wall Street. Just in case the market should go wrong this time, Goldmans will be paying out its partners in shares - to be held for five years as an insurance policy against a troubled market. Last time around the track, the partners left themselves the option of becoming instant multi-millionaires. Buffett's intervention is fascinating. The sage of Omaha rarely gives interviews and even more rarely appears on television; although he has extensive media interests through his investment in the Washington Post company. Buffett told ABC's Nightline programme that the market is 'more exaggerated than in the past'. He noted that there had been 'a lot of speculative activity and all kinds of things over the years in markets, and frequently it doesn't come to a good end'. He argued that investors there just for the bubble, 'will get flushed out very quickly'. Buffett's investment philosophy is very different to that which has fuelled the Internet/technology boom on Wall Street. His approach is to buy into undervalued companies through his firm Berkshire Hathaway and support them as they rebuild: as a result of his investments in companies like Gillette, Coca-Cola, the Washington Post and the Dairy Queen middle-American fast food chain, in one of whose outlets he was interviewed, the value of his company has reached $90 billion - the return on shares in Berkshire Hathaway has been 31 per cent annually over the last decade. Buffett remains vague on the timing of the setback. Indeed, the Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index has risen 56 per cent since he issued his last bearish blast two years ago. This time, however, the very public place of delivery - on a flagship news analysis slot - suggests a sharper reality in his message. Light in M&amp;S storm The psychological blows to the reputation of Marks &amp; Spencer come raining down. The credit ratings agency Moody's has banished the coveted triple-A rating on its debt on the grounds that the competitive position in the retail market in the United Kingdom will diminish its financial flexibility. Meanwhile in the City, Peter Salsbury's prawn cocktail offensive - aided by the financial communications group Brunswick - is failing to produce dividends. The company's shares were under pressure in the latest trading session after two analysts, HSBC Securities and WestLB Panmure, issued sell notes. The current theory in the City is that like-for-like clothes sales are falling in double digits, despite the more aggressive marketing campaign for the spring collection. This would not be a major surprise: February is never good for consumer spending. Nevertheless, Moody's is right to point out that M&amp;S's huge new capacity as a result of the purchase of the Littlewoods stores, could not have arrived at a worse time. Some of the shine has gone from the M&amp;S brand as the group itself partly acknowledges when it flirts with the idea of bringing in designer names; although it effectively did that some time ago with its upmarket Italian collections. The part of the business likely to receive greater recognition as M&amp;S comes to terms with its problems, is the financial services arm which was created quietly in 1986 and which in the 1998 financial year is expected to chip in up to 18 per cent of overall profits. This part of the business is going great guns putting on business, credit and savings at a compound rate of 30 per cent a year. It is also reporting an encouraging start to the Individual Savings Account (ISA) era, handling up to 1,000 applications a day. None of this is going to plug the gap caused by falling clothes sales and dismal global markets but it is too early to press the panic button. Banks's breather When the Bank of England leaves rates where they are, it does not feel the need to immediately tell investors or business why. So it all becomes theory. The best explanation for the Bank's breather was that it had acted five months in a row and it would be better to spend some more time looking at the indicators before easing further. Certainly there are signs that the economy may not be slowing as fast as some feared it might. Unemployment is still falling, if modestly, although special factors such as the New Deal may be part of that. Retail sales bounced in January, but again that may be a false reading given discounting on the high street. More likely is caution ahead of the Budget. The monetary policy committee will have been briefed on the Government's fiscal stand, but may have a niggling concern that the Chancellor might use the surplus in the public finances to do a little extra on public spending in addition to the 4 per cent real growth in the pipeline. The Treasury is convinced that even if a worse than expected slowdown were to occur, the public finances could take the hit without breaching the golden rule of borrowing to finance investment over the cycle. The MPC preferred to see the numbers: it should have been bolder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/04/uk.davidpallister","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-04T15:12:39Z","webTitle":"No trial for Aitken's Saudi ally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/04/uk.davidpallister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/04/uk.davidpallister","fields":{"headline":"No trial for Aitken's Saudi ally","bodyText":"The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to drop the charges of conspiracy and perverting the course of justice against Said Ayas, the former Saudi friend and business colleague of Jonathan Aitken, who had supported the disgraced minister's failed libel action against The Guardian and Granada TV in 1997.

The discontinuation means that neither Mr Aitken nor Mr Ayas will face a trial which could have laid bare some of the Saudi royal family's controversial financial affairs and the way they deal with people who fall out of favour. It is also likely that the sentencing of Mr Aitken, who pleaded guilty at Bow Street magistrates in January to perjury and perverting the course of justice, could be brought forward. Mr Aitken, who faces imprisonment, was due to be sentenced after Mr Ayas's trial which was set down for June 8. The abandonnment of the case will come as a relief to the British and Saudi governments as Mr Ayas had planned to plead not guilty and introduce some potentially embarrassing allegations in his defence. He had planned to argue that he was acting on the instructions of the Saudi ruler, King Fahd, and his former boss, the king's son Prince Mohamad, to conceal a purported intelligence link between the former cabinet minister and the Saudi regime. Mr Ayas, 56, a Saudi citizen of Lebanese origins, was to have been a pivotal witness in Mr Aitken's libel action which followed stories published by The Guardian and Granada's World in Action in April 1995. He signed a statement supporting Mr Aitken's lying account of his weekend stay at the Paris Ritz in September 1993. He backed up Mr Aitken's story that his wife, Lolicia, had paid part of the £1,000 bill. This fell apart when the Guardian and Granada's lawyers produced evidence from British Airways and a Swiss car hire firm that Mrs Aitken had spent the weekend in Switzerland. The libel action collapsed in July 1997 before Mr Ayas was called as a witness. But after the trial it emerged that in June Mr Ayas had been summoned from his London home near Hyde Park to Saudi Arabia by Prince Mohamad who then placed him under house arrest and accused him of stealing $230 million. Mr Ayas, who was the prince's business manager from the early seventies in the negotiation of huge commissions, managed to escape the country disguised as a woman. The prince is pursuing his claim against him through the High Court in London. Mr Ayas has claimed that while under house arrest, and for a while in prison, he was repeatedly interrogated, kept in solitary confinement and deprived of sleep by the Saudi secret police on the orders of the prince. He claims he signed a confession under mental and physical duress. Mr Aitken, who still faces a £2 million costs bill for the libel action, was a business colleague of Mr Ayas and the prince from 1979 through a UK-registered company, Al Bilad. It was set up to sponsor business ventures in the kingdom and garner commissions running into millions of pounds. In 1984 the prince was appointed the governorship of the kingdom's oil-rich eastern province. With five children living in England, Mr Ayas became friendly with the Aitken family and became a god father to Mr Aitken's twin daughter, Victoria. The former minister of defence procurement - and later Chief Secretary to the Trerasury - has admitted that he drafted a witness statement for Victoria which also supported his version of events in Paris. Victoria, now aged 18, was arrested last year but not charged. Since being charged last May Mr Ayas has been on bail and, like Mr Aitken, he was forbidden to leave the country. He was committed for trial with Mr Aitken at Bow Street in December. But in January, after Mr Aitken's guilty pleas, he was granted his passport back in order to travel to Cairo to see his seriously ill father. He returned last month after his father died."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/mar/05/guardianobituaries.westafrica","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-05T12:48:18Z","webTitle":"Nana Opoku Ware II obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/05/guardianobituaries.westafrica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/mar/05/guardianobituaries.westafrica","fields":{"headline":"Nana Opoku Ware II obituary","bodyText":"The Asante people of Ghana never say their king, the asantehene, is 'dead'. They say, instead, that 'a mighty tree has been uprooted.' As the sad message reverberates around Asante that Nana Opoku Ware II, the King of Asante, has died aged 79, millions of people will be pouring into the capital, Kumase, from all corners of the kingdom. Their gathering is an awesome sight. Clad in traditional mourning clothes of deep black, or purplish red, millions of people issue from every street and path and make their way to the asantehene's home, the Manhyia Palace, in a vast, moving, human canopy. The loyalty that Asantes feel towards the asantehene's symbol of office, sika adwa kofi the golden stool is beyond comprehension. The stool is said to have been conjured up from the heavens in a cloud of dust, one Friday, by Okomfo Anokye, a spiritualist and counsellor to King Osei Tutu, who founded the Asante nation in the late 17th century. To cement the stool's hold upon the imagination, he asked each chief and queen-mother of the Asante clans to yield some pubic hair, as well as nails from the fingers and toes. These he mixed with herbs, burned the lot into powder, added water and smeared some of the potion on the stool, while giving the rest to the gathered potentates to drink. He reputedly warned them that the soul of each of their clans was inextricably bound up with that of the stool. That the Asantes take Okomfo Anokye's warning quite literally is illustrated by what happened in 1900, by which time the British had subdued Asante and exiled its king, Prempeh I. On a visit to Asante, the British governor, Sir Frederick Hodgson, haughtily demanded: 'Where is the golden stool? Why am I not sitting on it this moment?' This was sacrilege: not even the asantehene actually sits on the stool. After Hodgson's arrogant request, the Asante army, led by a woman warrior, Yaa Asantewaa, besieged him in the British fort at Kumase, and nearly starved his party to death. Nana Opoku Ware, who inherited this loyalty, was born Jacob Matthew Poku. Educated at Adisadel College in Cape Coast, he read law in London and was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1962. Following the coup that overthrew Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, in 1966, Poku became communications minister. He had been due to take up an appointment as ambassador to Rome, when his maternal uncle, Nana Sir Osei Agyemang Prempeh II, died in 1970 and Poku succeeded him. During his reign Nana Opoku Ware was so tactful that some of his subjects regarded him as 'too soft'. His worst period was in 1979, when Flight-Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings seized power in an army coup, and began to attack the Ghana establishment. Things got even worse after Rawlings made a comeback in December, 1981. Some Asantes expected Nana Opoku Ware to lead his people in opposition to Rawlings, but their hopes did not materialise. To his credit, he is believed instead to have helped persuade the army officer to adopt the path of constitutional rule. Nana Opoku Ware was married to his childhood sweetheart, Lady Victoria, who predeceased him in 1996. He is survived by five children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/05/eu.wto4","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-05T18:24:25Z","webTitle":"Banana players","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/05/eu.wto4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/05/eu.wto4","fields":{"headline":"Banana players","bodyText":"The Caribbean Banana Exporters Association was formed in 1972 to bring together the Banana Growers' Associations in Jamaica and the Windward Islands (Dominica, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada) who were the traditional suppliers to the UK market. In 1988, CBEA set up a London lobby to defend its interests during the negotiations which were then pending to replace the national import regimes of EU member states by a common market regime for bananas for the whole European Community. For this purpose the CBEA acts jointly with the three companies marketing its bananas: Fyffes, Geest and Jamaica Producers. The Council on Hemispheric Affairs is an independent research and information organization that aims to promote the common interest of the hemisphere, raise the visibility and increase the importance of the inter-American relationship, as well as encourage the formulation of rational and constructive U.S. policies towards Latin America. It has published a series on Chiquita's role in the banana wars and has examined the roles played by various figures in the US government. Chiquita is an Ohio based food conglomerate employing 40,000 workers primarily in Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia and Honduras. Chiquita is the worlds largest banana trader and contributes to both major political parties in the USA. Together with Dole and Del Monte, these three North American companies account for nearly two-thirds of the world trade in bananas. The United Kingdom, with established trade and historical Commonwealth links to Caribbean banana growers, has already discussed the renegotiation of the Lome Convention after it expires in 2000. The Lome Convention links African, Caribbean and Pacific nations and their links to the European trading bloc. The findings of the Select Committee on International Development decided that: It was therefore also necessary to provide an incentive to import the ACP banana in spite of the higher costs involved to the supplier. The Protocol achieved this through the `Category B allocation'. 30 per cent of the tariff quota of dollar bananas was allocated to those operators who imported or ripened bananas from the EU and ACP. The profits from the dollar bananas could thus cross-subsidise the importing of ACP [Africa-Caribbean-Pacific] bananas. The World Trade Organisation was set up in 1995. The international organization that preceded it was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The WTO is the only international agency overseeing the rules of international trade. Its purpose is to help trade flow smoothly, in a system based on rules, to settle trade disputes between governments, and to organize trade negotiations. The WTO, under appeal from the USA and various Central and Latin American nations, decided that this cross-subsidisation contravened WTO rules. (Its full ruling can be downloaded from http://www.useu.be/issues/banab.wp5) It has proposed a temporary compromise which, until recently, both the USA and the EU were happy to accept. The United States Trade Representatives announced two days ago that the US was 'withholding liquidation on imports valued at over $500 million of selected products from the European Union (EU), consistent with U.S. rights under the WTO agreements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/mar/06/weekend.isabelhilton","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-06T02:22:15Z","webTitle":"Children of a Lhasa god","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/mar/06/weekend.isabelhilton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/mar/06/weekend.isabelhilton","fields":{"headline":"Children of a Lhasa god","bodyText":"The Dalai Lama was having a hectic day. The young president of the Kalmyck Republic, an unlikely Buddhist state on the Caspian Sea that is an autonomous segment of Russia, had just left the Dalai Lama's brightly-decorated audience room. The president had received a rebuke for the growing corruption of his young administration, which had been reported to the Dalai Lama a few days earlier by the Kalmyck leader of the opposition. In an ante-room, a Norwegian journalist was settling in for a long wait for a brief interview, and a group of Tibetan devotees, dressed in their best, were preparing for their audience. The Dalai Lama's personal staff were nervous. If things started running late, they knew how quickly the queue for his attention would build up. For a man who, in his 64th year, is one of the world's more celebrated displaced persons, it was an average set of visitors to this hillside Indian town. In March 1959, when the Dalai Lama and nearly 100,000 of his fellow countrymen fled Tibet to India, they thought that exile would be a temporary affair. Sonam Topgyal, now the prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, was then a 25-year-old monk. He laughed when I asked if he had imagined, as he fled across the high passes of the Himalayas, that he would still be living in India 40 years later. \"Every day, we expected to return. I think we were very naive,\" he replied. \"We didn't know anything. We had heard of the United Nations, and we thought that they would help us. We were in a transit camp in Assam, and whenever we were called for meetings, we thought that this would be the day we would be told we could go back. It was nearly two years before I began to realise that the Chinese occupation of Tibet was a serious matter and would not be easily resolved. Now, my hope is that I will see Tibet again before I die.\" Thousands of Tibetans from that first exodus have not lived to see their country again. Now, their children and grandchildren are asking themselves if they ever will. It was 1951 when the newly-victorious Communist government of China first invaded Tibet and brought Lhasa under a loose Chinese administration. The terms of it were laid out in a treaty signed between the two governments - the 17 Point Agreement On The Liberation Of Tibet - that promised Tibet autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. But eight years later, a revolt against the Chinese that had begun in eastern Tibet - where the Chinese had imposed direct rule and begun \"socialist reforms\" - reached the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. The Chinese responded with violent repression and the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of his country, fled. It was a journey, as one Tibetan exile put it, not only from Tibet to India, but from the 16th century to the 20th. It ended in Dharmsala, a former British hill station in Himachal Pradesh, in northern India, a muddy little town that clings to the precipitous slope of the Himalayan foothills that rise like a sheer, snow-capped wall from the wide Kangra Valley below. As you climb the narrow, winding roads to the Tibetan settlement, India seems to fall away. In its place, there's a little Tibet. The unpaved streets still have a curiously temporary air, though the settlement is booming now: the steady flow of visitors attracted by the Dalai Lama's presence has triggered a spate of hotel building in Dharmsala. In the bars of the local hotels, Tibetans in national dress serve drinks to western Buddhist groupies, visiting Japanese delegations and Indian bus parties, as well as a few stranded westerners, some of whom came to Dharmsala years ago and never summoned the will to leave. For all of them, for diverse reasons, the Dalai Lama is a unique attraction. When the Tibetans first fled to India, they were dispersed - some to settlements in the south of India, where they were given land to farm and where the majority still live; others - among them many of Tibet's former aristocracy - found themselves put to building roads in the north, the only work there was. The death toll in both places was heavy - in the south from malaria and other unfamiliar tropical ailments; in the north, from exhaustion and shock. When the Dalai Lama arrived in Dharmsala, there was little to recommend it except the view. Forty years later, there's a modest government-in-exile that runs the affairs of the 100,000 Tibetan refugees and manages such foreign relations as can be achieved from the limbo of a refugee settlement. There's a library that houses religious and secular texts, some carried over the Himalayas in the flight, others obtained since; there are several monasteries, a hospital and two large residential schools-cum-orphanages that are filled to capacity by the steady stream of unaccompanied children who continue to arrive from Tibet. The soul of this refugee community is the 14th Dalai Lama himself, the last of Tibet's religious and political leaders. Until 1959, he was both worshipped as the incarnation of the Buddha of Compassion, and obeyed, in Central Tibet at least, as the seventh in a line of ruling theocrats who had headed Tibet's government since the 17th century. Today, he is still revered in his role as spiritual and political leader of the community in exile and, inside Tibet, as a symbol of resistance to the Chinese, and of the hope that, one day, Tibet might regain, if not independence, then at least enough autonomy to be allowed to practise its religion and preserve its culture in peace. For the first 20 years, it was a lonely business for the Tibetans. Other exile groups seemed to occupy a place in strategies of the Cold War, visible to the outside world if only as instruments of the west's engagement with Communism. But while the United Nations went to war over the Chinese-backed invasion of South Korea by the Communist North, and the United States expended tens of thousands of US lives trying to defeat North Vietnam, the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1951 passed with barely a squeak of international protest. Even the Tibetan revolt in 1959 provoked little more than half-hearted CIA backing for a modest guerrilla army to harry the People's Liberation Army from over the border in the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Mustang. When President Nixon decided to make friends with China in the Seventies, even that was stopped. But in the Eighties and Nineties, the Tibetan case became visible. Now, the stateless Dalai Lama is an international media star: he has given interviews for Playboy, guest-edited Vogue, won the Nobel Peace prize, and attracts huge crowds on his many international tours. Tibet is a fashionable cause in Hollywood, and the Dalai Lama is received, despite unfailing Chinese protests, by presidents and prime ministers. On several levels, this is clearly a success story. But the high visibility of the Tibetan cause has brought it no closer to a solution: the history of the attempts at negotiation - some promising contact in the late Seventies and Eighties gave way in the Nineties to an increasingly intransigent atmosphere - gives little hope that, within the lifetime of the 14th Dalai Lama, Beijing will be prepared to take the risk of permitting such a powerfully symbolic figure to return to Tibet, or to restore to the Tibetans the autonomy agreed in 1951. The Chinese, it seems, are happy to wait him out. For his people, the future seems no more certain than it did at the beginning of this odyssey. Meanwhile, the generation that fled in 1959 is growing old, and their children and grandchildren live out the marginal existence of the stateless. In the past two years, a series of scandals and disputes have rocked the exile community and frustration at the lack of progress is eroding the dream of return. Many exiled Tibetans are beginning to feel that it has all gone on long enough. The western view of Tibet is still incurably romantic - a hybrid fantasy in which the Orientalist vision of Shangri-la meets the contemporary fairytale of Disneyland. Even in the squalid streets of Dharmsala, western tourists find Tibetans picturesque - the maroon-robed monks, the charming old ladies in Tibetan dress faithfully circumambulating the Dalai Lama's modest palace on the hillside. The image of the Dalai Lama himself, charismatic and morally unassailable, plays its part in the western myth. But the realities of refugee life are less than romantic. Though people in Dharmsala are reticent about the problems they face, the strains of this long period in limbo are visible below the picturesque exterior. \"It's absolutely no fun being a refugee,\" said Tupten, a young Tibetan born in India and one of the second generation of Tibetan refugees brought up in exile. \"Young people here feel two things - instant power and total helplessness. Power, because we are Tibetans, and when western tourists come and click away at us with their cameras, the attention makes us feel wanted. But helplessness because really we are almost an extinct species and there seems to be nothing we can do to change our situation.\" The choice for young people, he says, lies between trying to make a professional career, which involves abandoning the Tibetan community and the identity that it bestows, or staying within the community and accepting the price: unemployment, aimlessness and a sense of frustration that can spill over into disillusionment. \"A lot of people my age turn to drugs and alcohol, because they have concluded that activism in the Tibetan cause reaps no benefit,\" admitted Tutpen. \"They want to do something, but feel there is nothing we can do.\" That sense of impotence is exacerbated by the violence of the Chinese onslaught on Tibetan beliefs inside Tibet and by the precarious nature of refugee life. The community is tolerated by successive Indian governments, which have done their best for the exiles. But India is trapped, too, between the poverty of its own people and the pressures of its powerful neighbour, China. In 1994, a stabbing incident between a Tibetan youth and an Indian provoked a three-day riot in which local people broke the windows of the Tibetan government-in-exile building and threatened to burn down one of the Tibetan schools. It was a reminder that even Indian hospitality cannot be taken too much for granted. Since then, thousands more Tibetans have arrived as the Chinese have cracked down again on religious freedoms in Tibet. Last year alone, 4,000 men, women and children braved exposure and frostbite to make the illegal and dangerous journey across the high passes of the Himalayas to Nepal and on to India. But they no longer automatically receive permission to stay in India. The children are placed in schools; the monks and nuns who make up nearly half the continuing exodus go straight into monasteries and convents. The adult men and women, including some who are former political prisoners of the Chinese, find that the precious refugee certificate - the key to a measure of security in India - is no longer available. They are given two years of basic education, then told that they should return to Tibet. It is a bitter message but, if they stay, they risk a lifetime of economic problems and political disillusionment. Jamyang, an ex-army officer who now runs the settlement school where adult refugees study two years of basic English at the expense of the exile government, explained: \"It's very difficult for people to make up their minds what to do. During their stay here, they get food and lodging and they are safe. But when their two years are up, the problems start. They have nothing, no job, no capital and they don't know any Indian languages. The settlements are already overcrowded and they don't have any special skills. On the other hand, if they return to Tibet and are caught, they can get two to three years in jail for having left illegally.\" Jamyang himself left with the original exodus in 1959. \"I was 23 when I came. There were different problems then. There was nothing at all here for us, but we were all in the same position. Now, there is a big gap between people who arrive from Tibet and those who live here. A lot of exiles have never experienced Chinese oppression and they look down on the new arrivals.\" Dorje is an ex-monk and a former political prisoner who has felt that disapproval. In the early Nineties, he was arrested in Tibet for putting up a poster calling for Tibetan independence. In jail, he was beaten and sentenced to two years in a labour camp. After his release, fearing another arrest, he fled to India. But, though the Dalai Lama remains the centre of his spiritual hopes, the realities of life in India are less inspiring. \"In Lhasa, if we were sitting around a table like this - people who trusted each other - we would be talking about the Dalai Lama's latest speech, or what people had heard on Radio Free Asia, or news about some incident or some arrests,\" said Dotje. \"Here, when people sit around, they talk about their relatives in the United States, or about money. I can understand it, because in Tibet we have political problems, not economic ones. Here, they have to rely on themselves economically and, after a while, you get more interested in money than in politics. Look at who turns out here if there is a demonstration. It's the poor people. The better-off don't bother. In Lhasa, if there's a demonstration, we have to make up our minds that we are prepared to die.\" It's a criticism that Dawa Tsering, a long-term exile and now the welfare officer of the Dharmsala community, accepts. The older generation, he points out, is now a minority in the community in exile. \"When we were young,\" he recalled, \"in the Sixties, the whole atmosphere was different. The young people would stage dramas in every community that would always have a political message. We only thought of going back to Tibet. Now, those plays don't exist any more. Ninety per cent of our people now are young. They were brought up here and never encountered the Chinese. They are patriotic, but it's different. In Tibet, the Chinese forcefully suppress our culture. Here, we are not forced to abandon it, but we are losing it by negligence. If we lose it, we're not Tibetans any more and the Chinese won't even need their guns.\" For new refugees such as Dorje, arriving in exile brings home the fact that they risked - and lost - everything for one political gesture. Now, he lives in limbo, fearful of returning to Tibet, but depressed at the lack of a future in India. \"I think the worst thing,\" he said, \"is that I lost everything and I achieved so little. It's totally out of balance. I would have preferred to be able to do more for less suffering. I don't think people here are interested in what we did, and even in Tibet people think you are stupid if you protest. They think China is so powerful that there isn't any point. You almost feel ashamed to be a political prisoner.\" For four decades, the community has absorbed the continuing influx of refugees, but now the strains between the two exile groups are beginning to tell. In 40 years of enforced separation, the character - and even the language - of Tibetans in exile has diverged from Tibetans in Tibet. In exile, the young refugees grow up speaking English and Hindi as well as their parents' native Tibetan. In Tibet, Chinese is the enforced second language. In Tibet the political oppression is palpable and explicit. In exile, there is freedom of a kind, but the attachment to the Dalai Lama creates a communal hostility to criticism that can be oppressive, too. For secular intellectuals, such as Lhasang Tsering, who, with a group of like-minded friends, founded the Amnye Machen Institute to translate and publish non-religious writings, the prolonged frustration of exile is now at a critical point. \"It's much more visible among the young people even than ten years ago,\" he said. \"The numbers are still small, but the trend of taking to drugs and alcohol is clear. You can't blame them: there's no scope for their talent and no hope of return. I am beginning to feel that we will end up like American Indians.\" The Dalai Lama himself is aware of the problems. Last year, the Tibetan Youth Congress, which has been critical of the Dalai Lama's willingness to accept autonomy instead of continuing to press for complete independence, organised a prolonged hunger strike in Delhi. In the course of it, Thupten Ngodup, a 50-year-old Tibetan exile, burned himself to death. The Dalai Lama had appealed to the hunger strikers to call off their protest. \"It is a clear indication of frustration,\" he admitted, but he himself believes that events are slowly moving in the direction of a settlement. ÔIf we only look at the question of dialogue, there is no progress at all,\" the Dalai Lama said. \"It's now becoming clear that the Chinese attitude is hardening, not just on the Tibetan issue but towards the dissidents, too. But if you look from another angle - the support for the Tibetan issue, particularly the sympathy and support from Chinese intellectuals - there are positive signs. The situation in China proper is changing. It has the same constitution and the same one-party rule, but in reality it is changing month by month. So, I feel that if you look at it from the wider perspective, there is more sign of hope. In the Sixties and Seventies, we only had faith that eventually truth would prevail. Now, many governments are showing their sympathy and want to help to bring about dialogue.\" Others are less convinced that time is on the Tibetan side. The fear that hangs over Dharmsala is that the Chinese are waiting for the Dalai Lama to die. Without him, they say, who would care about the Tibetans. In old Tibet, the death of a Dalai Lama was followed by the search for the new incarnation. In exile, the process is less certain, and two prominent recent cases - the Panchen and the Karmapa lamas - have ended in disputes between Tibetan Buddhists and the Chinese. Even if a child were found whom everyone accepted as the reincarnated Dalai Lama, it would be nearly two decades before he was of an age to lead his community. In that uncertain time, the fear is that the Tibetan cause would suffer. As Lhasang Tsering put it, \"It's all very well to say that we want to talk to the Chinese, but one question to which nobody has given an answer is why should the Chinese talk to us? Negotiation implies a shared need to come to a compromise, but where is the pressure on the Chinese that gives them a reason to compromise? They are playing for time and we are playing into their hands. It's a journey without a destination.\" For him, the only answer is violent action - a policy in complete opposition to the Dalai Lama's insistence, accepted by the overwhelming majority of his followers, on a non-violent approach. \"The present policy is not non-violence, it's non-action,\" said Lhasang Tsering. \"We are all going to die. The only thing that matters is whether you die for something worthy.\" Without the Dalai Lama's restraining hand, there is no doubt that more Tibetans would argue for violence. Even Dawa Tsering has considered it, despite the overwhelming odds against the Tibetans. \"I would shed my blood, but if you only have one bucket of blood and losing it achieved nothing, then what's the point? Everybody loves the idea of a free Tibet, but the Dalai Lama is right. There is no alternative.\" In the Tibetan Children's Village, high up on the mountainside above Dharmsala, the staff are braced for a further influx of children as the Tibetan New Year approaches. Already, the exile community has been told that there will be no places available in the school this year for local children: the school is full of youngsters whose parents despair of an education in Tibet and who have sent them into exile, often at the risk of their lives. Volunteers sit on the floor of a large room, patiently wrapping hundreds of New Year presents. In the past two years, the Chinese campaign against the Dalai Lama has raged inside Tibet. Monks and nuns have been forced either to denounce him or to leave their monasteries. In 40 years, Beijing has tried many solutions to its Tibetan \"problem\". All have been damaging to Tibet's traditions and religious life, but none has succeeded in eradicating Tibetan loyalty to their spiritual leader. But when the children in the Tibetan Children's Village grow up, there may no longer be a Dalai Lama to act as the inspiration and the voice of his divided people. By then, many fear, it might be too late for Tibet. ¥ Isabel Hilton's interview with the Dalai Lama will be broadcast on Viewing The Century: The Dalai Lama on Radio 3, March 21, at 5.45pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/mar/06/features.jobsmoney20","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-06T03:03:56Z","webTitle":"Collectors after the artefacts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/06/features.jobsmoney20","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/mar/06/features.jobsmoney20","fields":{"headline":"Collectors after the artefacts","bodyText":"The word artefact is defined as anything coming from the ancient world. You could, if you had a mind to, buy one of the first man-made objects, a paleolithic flint tool dating from 250,000 BC. It would cost anything from £500 upwards. Or you could buy (at a considerably higher price) a terracotta pot dating from the Chinese Qin dynasty of 210 BC. But if you decided to become a collector of antiquities in the UK for whatever reason - as an investment, for their aesthetic form or as decoration, for their historical context, or because of the emotional appeal of their great age and the links they provide with the development of Western civilisation - you would find that dealers and auction houses have confined definitions of antiquities. A standard book called Collecting Antiquities by Charles Ede (Hollington Books, £25) says that excluding flints, which are usually considered a separate province, date limits can be taken as circa 7,000 BC to AD 500 shortly after the fall of Rome, with an extension of about 200 years to cover the Coptic civilisation of Egypt. The bulk of material is concentrated in the period 2,000 BC to AD 500. Geographically, you are talking about an area stretching from Ireland in the West to Afghanistan in the East and from Sweden in the North to Tunisia and Egypt in the South. The ancient Far Eastern civilisations are excluded by these categorisations. Even so, the field is vast both in terms of time or area whether it be Greek pottery, Roman sculpture or Roman glass, Cypriot jugs and pots, Egyptian figurines or Coptic papyrus manuscripts. These are subject to fashion. Joanna van der Lande, the specialist at Bonhams auction house, says that five years ago you could not give away Cypriot pottery. Now there is a vogue for it. People buy it to take back to Cyprus. It is often undemanding, with simple linear decorations. The striking thing about Cypriot pieces and other antiquities, which people often find surprising, is how cheap they can be. In a recent Bonhams auction a Cypriot, black-topped red-polished ware bowl with a single pieced lug handle at the rim, dating from the early bronze age, 2100 BC to 2000 BC, sold for £300. Joanna van der Lande says there are plenty of modestly priced artefacts around. There is interest in Egyptian small sculptures or figurines. She says that in a forthcoming auction, there are a number of ushabtis - little sculptures made of faience or glazed compositions. They came to be used in large numbers in the New Kingdom, by the great Pharoahs of the 18th dynasty around 2,000 BC. Usually, 365 ushabtis were buried with the dead to act as helpers in the next life. These will be on offer at the Bonhams sale on April 22nd from around £800. Also at the sale a Roman sculpture, a marble head, will also be on offer for £500. Of course, ushabtis can fetch thousands depending on condition and rarity. But when you think that contemporary ceramics like the works of Clarice Cliff can fetch thousands, then there are clearly many bargains to be found. James Ede, the son of Charles, who runs the Charles Ede gallery in London's West End, agrees. He says: \"Journalists I speak to are constantly surprised about how cheap antiquities can be. It is as if people cannot believe they are holding something which is 2,000 years old but is worth just a few hundred pounds.\" He cites Greek pottery which, he says, is technically amongst the finest ever made. It is typically black or red - not because of the pigment or the glaze, but because the \"slip\" of dilute clay used on the surface contained iron. In his catalogue of Greek pottery from southern Italy, some pieces are on offer for several hundred pounds. A Lekythos with a flattened bowl, covered with a lattice pattern, with tongues around the lower neck dating from circa 290 BC is priced at £425. Caution must be taken with antiquities, however. More than most areas of collecting, it is prone to fakes and forgeries. You should only buy from a reputable dealer or auction house and be sure of your purchase's provenance and authenticity. Assuming you buy the genuine article cheaply, how will it fare in value? Like most dealers or auctioneers, Joanna van der Lande says: \"I always recommend that you never sell in under 10 years. Only buy because you really like the item.\" James Ede says: \"Like any decent dealer, I say you should not buy for investment.\" He does add, however, that he has a Greek \"Attic\" piece from the 6th century BC coming up for sale at £28,000. In 1976, his firm sold a rather better one for a tenth of this price. \u0095 For further information: Charles Ede, tel: 0171-4983-4944; Bonhams, tel: 0171-393-3900."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/1999/mar/06/1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-06T03:04:58Z","webTitle":"The fat-cat controllers of Brazil's landless peasants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/06/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/06/1","fields":{"headline":"The fat-cat controllers of Brazil's landless peasants","bodyText":"A red and black steam train hoots as it crosses a village square in what could pass for a 19th century rural English scene. Only this is 1999 and the setting is remote north-east Brazil. The clunky Thomas the Tank Engine - an English Kerr Stuart, built in 1927 - is chugging along at Usina Serra Grande, the only South American sugar cane plantation that still transports its harvest by steam train. Brazilian mechanics make all the spare parts and maintain 12 miles of private track within the vast plantation - at 100 square miles, it is four times the size of Guernsey - in the state of Alagoas. \"When [the current owner] bought Serra Grande in the 1970s it still had trains,\" said Jose Bakker, the estate's general manager. \"He thought that if the United States and Europe had them, then Brazil should have too. So he kept them. But he didn't lose money. Each locomotive can pull 10 times more than a lorry, so it's more efficient.\" Though only about 20 per cent of the harvest is still collected by train, compared with tractor and lorry, the obsolete locomotive is a powerful image of how the industry is stuck in time. The mode of production has hardly changed in almost 100 years at Usina Serra Grande, whose population of about 10,000 means it is large enough to be registered on maps as a town. Inside its borders the vast majority of the workers live like serfs, cutting the cane by hand and earning £10 to £20 for a seven-day week. Their homes are simple bungalows where families often sleep several to a room. Meanwhile the managers live in grand colonial houses, with personalised crockery and antique snooker tables on the balcony. It is a quasi-feudal system. The plantation functions almost like a sovereign state, assuming the responsibilities of a benevolent government. Usina Serra Grande provides free accommodation, electricity and water for all its workers, has 14 schools, supplies every child with a uniform and books, and pays for several on-site doctors. The degree of autonomy used to be such that the plantation even had its own currency. Now the staff pick up their money at a bank in a nearby town, providing the only reason they ever need to leave the premises, as Usina Serra Grande has shops, a market and even a cinema. Despite the low wages, its workers have better than average health-care, and the guarantee of year-round work makes staying more attractive than leaving. \"We are always saying we must move, but where would we go?\" said Maria Socorro da Silva, aged 42, who lives with a family of eight in three tiny, dirty rooms. The medieval structure of the sugar plantation is not limited to Usina Serra Grande. Virtually all the sugar in Brazil, the world's largest producer, comes from big estates where the workers have no land rights. Including the workers' families, almost a million people live under the sugar barons' control. The power of the large estates, called latifundos, has resulted in Brazil having the world's most unfair distribution of land, with just 2.8 per cent of landlords owing 56.7 per cent of all occupied territory. This land inequality has in turn given Brazil another record - for the worst distribution of wealth in the world. Mr Bakker believes the latifundo system is the only way agriculture can work in the north-east. \"Sugar cane is not profitable unless you have a big producer,\" he said. \"Here we keep things like they were at the turn of the century. It will be like this for another 500 years.\" One of Usina Serra Grande's oldest residents, Vitoria Vasconcellos, aged 76, said the plantation had changed only slightly. in her time. \"Before, it was a kingdom; the owner was the king. At mass his family would sit apart from everyone else. Now owners are more accessible. They at least come to the school fair.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/06/politicalnews.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-06T03:05:05Z","webTitle":"Blair urges unity to beat SNP threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/06/politicalnews.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/06/politicalnews.politics","fields":{"headline":"Blair urges unity to beat SNP threat","bodyText":"After a series of false starts Tony Blair finally kicked off the Scottish parliamentary election campaign yesterday with a call for old Labour and new Labour, socialists and social democrats, to unite and see off the challenge posed by the SNP. In a rallying call to the final Scottish Labour conference before the Holyrood elections, the Prime Minister made it clear that he wanted the May 6th elections to be fought on the basis of the \"policies of principle rather than the policies of identity\". The fighting speech was perhaps the most passionate Mr Blair has yet made north of the border. Over the last few months, the emergence of a strong leftwing within Scottish Labour has opened the door to public divisions. But yesterday the Prime Minister's strenuous calls for those divisions to be put aside were met by an appreciative audience. \"Old Labour or New Labour, social democrat or socialist, or just Labour. Whatever you are, do realise that this is a battle for the future of Scotland and it is a battle that, with the right principles, that, with the right principles and policies, you're going to win,\" he told the conference in Glasgow. Although Labour's election strategy of launching continual attacks on the Scottish National Party the so-called Nat bashing has been criticised within Labour ranks as counter-productive, Mr Blair signalled there would be no let up in this tactic. He launched a scathing attack on the SNP's economic policies, claiming that the SNP proclaimed patriotism admirably but could not produce serious policies. He said the collapse in oil revenues had left a massive hole in the SNP's spending plans a hole that would have to be filled with tax rises. \"Before they ask for the first of the Scottish people, they should tell the truth to the Scottish people. How will they fill the £4 billion hole in the Scottish public finances that separation would bring? £30 a week for every Scot on an average income,\" he said. The SNP have closed the gap on the Labour party threatening its dominance of Scottish politics. Latest polls for The Herald show Labour would win 59 seats out of the 129-seat Parliament not enough to achieve an overall majority but, with the backing of 15 Liberal Democrats, the non-nationalist left would have a majority of 19. In a bid to define a distinctive character for the Scottish Labour party, Mr Blair made it clear that he wanted his Holyrood members to forge their own policies away from Westminster control. Speaking beneath a banner which proclaimed \"Scotland leading Britain\" Mr Blair outlined policy commitments which Scotland would trail-blaze for the rest of the United Kingdom. He pledged nursery places for every three-year-old child in Scotland, one year younger than he has pledged in England and Wales. He also pledged to fund a minimum of four computers in every primary and secondary classroom in Scotland. But SNP leader Alex Salmond tonight accused the Prime Minister of delivering a speech that was \"defensive\" on the issues of jobs, the Scottish Parliament voting system, and \"London Labour control\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/mar/07/columnists.observerbusiness","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-07T15:06:37Z","webTitle":"Art for advertising's sake or the other way around?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/mar/07/columnists.observerbusiness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/mar/07/columnists.observerbusiness","fields":{"headline":"Art for advertising's sake or the other way around?","bodyText":"Another week, another daft row about commercial life imitating art. This time it's Gillian Wearing getting in a tizzy over M&amp;C Saatchi's latest (and last) ads for Sky Digital, which feature adults speaking with children's voices. It seems that you just can't win with these artists. One minute they're moaning about the need for wider public access to their ideas; the next they're sounding off when someone gives them exactly that. Thousands of people saw Wearing's original artwork; millions will see the M&amp;C Saatchi version. But perhaps the most galling truth for the artist in question is that in many ways the work of the admen is more impressive than her own. The ads for Sky are beautifully made and communicate an interesting insight about how we view TV. There's no doubt that Wearing's original idea was a creative and arresting one. And the agency seemed happy to acknowledge that the ad was 'inspired' by it. But it seems to me that to take the original idea out of its neutral context as a work of art and to spot how it could be used so successfully to sell Sky Digital is creativity that certainly ranks alongside the original work. Apparently, one full bus equals 40 empty cars. If this information doesn't exactly tip you off your seat, the people behind a new ad campaign in London hope that it might at least get you out of your car and on your bike, bus or Tube. Worthy though its intentions are, I suspect the campaign will fail. This is partly due to the less than punchy messages. Another poster in the series reads: 'Each year over 1 billion car journeys are less than a mile.' I know what they mean, but it isn't immediately obvious. Still, the main reason the campaign will fail is not the headlines on the posters but in the small print at the top. For here are the logos of the various sponsors of the campaign, whose tagline is 'Make a difference - use your car sensibly.' The backers include the City of Westminster, the Association of Train Operating Companies, the Government Office for London, the RAC and the National Asthma Campaign. All excellent organisations. The trouble is, around half of them are unknown to the public, and none of them has any money to match the marketing expenditure of car manufacturers. Last year, the top 10 car companies spent over £440 million on advertising in Britain alone, making cars by far the largest advertising category; seven times larger than soap powders, for example. So what chance does a campaign cobbled together by well-meaning but impecunious charities, trade bodies and local authorities have against Renault's £72m a year or Vauxhall's £65m? A glimmer of hope lies in another sponsor of the campaign, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). This body, the car manufacturers' collective lobbying organisation, spends much of its time promoting the steps that the motor industry is taking to become more socially responsible. Sceptics may utter a hollow laugh upon seeing 'motor industry' and 'socially responsible' in the same sentence, but the truth is these companies are making great strides to produce cleaner, more efficient cars. And it's encouraging to see the SMMT's backing for the 'drive sensibly' campaign. But it's still a pinprick compared to their members' marketing budgets. Until it's the car companies themselves, and not just their trade association, who get behind such messages, only a few Notting Hill worthies are likely to be persuaded to leave the Mercedes at home and carry little Molly to the baby yoga class. The vast majority of the population will see only the opposite message, since the Fords and Volkswagens of this world haven't yet realised that promoting responsible use of their products might sell more of them. It's not always with noble aims that companies enter the St Tony Church of The Third Way and put their corporate cash in society's collecting box. Texaco, found guilty in the US courts of racial discrimination, was ordered by the judge to spend money on an advertising campaign promoting diversity. So US viewers were treated to a series of happy scenes on Texaco oil rigs featuring not only black, brown and yellow faces, but also - women! While one can only admire the imaginative nature of the punishment meted out, I hope Texaco doesn't have the nerve to claim this as evidence of social contribution. You may have thought it couldn't be done, but there is an advert to rival the Ferrero Rocher 'ambassador's reception' in sheer awfulness. It's for a company called EFG. The picture shows a bar of music, with three notes - yes, an 'E', an 'F' and a 'G'. And the headline? What else but: 'EFG - Striking the right note in financial services.' Someone, please tell me it's a spoof. Following Trades' exclusive story last week that ITN is threatening Sky News with trademark infringement over the words Sky News At Ten, it would appear that the matter may not make it to court. Staff on the bulletin have been told they may be working on the dedicated slot only until September. Sky claims the bulletin will be there until Kingdom come. After that, presumably, the bong-ha-ha will have died down. Channel 4's attempt to turn itself into Smash Hits TV is progressing with the signing of David Beckham and Posh Spice for the run-up and aftermath of their wedding. To ensure a flying start, Channel 4 chief executive Michael Jackson was on hand to video the birth of Brooklyn Joseph Beckham at the Portland hospital - allegedly. Lord Saatchi has taken to posturing for the middle-market tabloids to suggest that his company, M&amp;C Saatchi, is to buy back the company he founded - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Really? Or maybe, what the spinmeister extraordinaire is really doing by appearing predatory is discreetly nailing up the For Sale sign in his shop window. After all, the partners at M&amp;C Saatchi have another five years to go to ensure their earn-outs, and if they want a comfortable retirement, this may be the way forward. HATS off to the Mirror's fearless investigative team, the not-totally-originally entitled City Slickers. Last Friday's Mirror money page delivered a huge headline - 'Mirror Profits Soar to £100m' - and a veritable paean to new Mirror chief executive John Allwood. Very impartial. But didn't Slickers overlook the fact that for the year in question it was not Mr Allwood who was in charge of the company but our old favourite, Mr David Montgomery? No warm words for him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/07/devolution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-07T16:43:44Z","webTitle":"Pious we can just about live with.

The danger is the thick and the idle \u0085","bodyText":"Tony Blair knows where Scotland is going. Or so he insisted in an interview last week, just before he set off for the Scottish Labour conference. With real irritation, he slapped down media taunts that he had no idea of where his constitutional reforms might lead. Devolution, he implied, would do what he had always meant it to do. If he really does know what is going to happen after the Scottish Parliament elections on 6 May, he is luckier than most. Every week, new uncertainties surface. They are often exciting uncertainties, asking for fresh solutions to how a small country should govern itself. But for those who run the United Kingdom, they are nerve-racking. The political uncertainties are pretty basic. The best bet is still that Labour will emerge as the biggest party, but without an absolute majority. Then, it's assumed, there will have to be a coalition, presumably with the Scottish Lib-Dems. But will there? Labour leaders have joined in all the pious Edinburgh talk about a 'new kind of politics based on co-operation, not confrontation'. But Labour as a party still has a ferocious gut revulsion against coalitions. It seems perfectly possible to me that Donald Dewar would simply form a minority government, then dare the Opposition to pitch Scotland into chaos by blocking his legislation. Such things are done in other European countries. Minority cabinets live dangerously, but can survive surprisingly well. And suppose Jim Wallace and his Scottish Lib-Dems were tempted to sign a coalition with the SNP. They are an autonomous party - but could they resist if Tony Blair offered Paddy Ashdown an instant referendum on proportional representation if 'his Scots' switched to Labour instead? Would they be accused of letting Westminster dictate the very terms of Scottish political life? After party uncertainties come bureaucratic ones. It has emerged that Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar has been negotiating a string of secret 'concordats' with Whitehall departments, detailing what Scottish ministries will be able to do and what will be done by 'British' civil servants. The instructions are secret, but all incoming Scottish Ministers will find copies on their desks - a fait accompli. In one sense, this is merely filling in the small print of devolution. The Scotland Act laid down only the broad division of powers between Edinburgh and London. But the concordats, now beginning to leak out, look like a clawing-back of control by Whitehall. They cover areas such as agriculture, environment and relations with Europe. Most explosive is the Treasury concordat, reputedly giving a UK Chancellor power to veto Scottish incentives to inward investment. All this has been denounced by the Lib-Dems and SNP as an undemocratic attempt to deprive the Scottish Parliament of its rights by stealth. And behind the concordats is the official-secrecy problem. Do Scottish civil servants have the right to share what their London colleagues know? And if not, then surely a separate and independent Scottish civil service ought to emerge - if only to avoid impossible conflicts. It can't be said too often: devolution is the difficult option. Independence, by contrast, has the merit of stark simplicity. To make Scottish devolution work will require three things in short supply: imagination, generosity and - above all - faith that this is the best way to manage the English-Scottish relationship. Without those three, routine bargaining will degenerate into public collision. The concordats were designed to avoid conflict, but they are more likely to provoke it. It is quite inevitable that the Scottish Parliament will ask for more freedom over spending, and Whitehall cannot prevent that. The arguments should be relatively muffled, if it's a Labour-led administration in Edinburgh haggling with a Labour government in London. But God help devolution if the machine isn't running smoothly by the time the Tories get back to power. I have nothing against independence, if the Scots freely choose it. But slithering backwards into it just because those in charge are too thick and idle to see devolution as a process rather than a piece of concrete \u0085 that would be a pity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/mar/08/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-08T02:03:54Z","webTitle":"No 1358: Heaven","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/08/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/mar/08/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"No 1358: Heaven","bodyText":"Age: 'In the beginning,' you will remember, 'God created the Heaven and the Earth.'

Others have a more personal vision. Such as? Well, here's Lord Archer's idea of it, as told to Michael Seed, who has collated a book of famous people's views of the afterlife: 'I hope all my friends will get [to Heaven], even though one or two of them have been rather naughty. I'm also rather hoping God plays cricket, and if the rumour is true that God is an Englishman, he can be the umpire.' So heaven's going to be run by Jeffrey and his dodgy mates? And we'll have to watch people playing cricket for an eternity? Sounds rather like being alive, doesn't it. But that's just Archer's view. William Hague thinks it'll be like rambling. That's exactly like being alive: No, no, a different type of rambling: 'Like the feeling that I get when I reach the summit after a strenuous hill walk,' he says. 'There is a sense of exhilaration... coupled with a sense of wonder at the newly revealed view from the hilltop.' What's the Government's line? According to Rt Rev Blair, 'Heaven is a place you share with others.' Like public transport. Don't suppose Steven Norris would be happy with that. Indeed not. Blair continues that: 'It's a place where there is good and no evil.' So Mandelson's stuffed? Presumably the PM will let PM back in after a suitable period of purgatory. Do say: 'The kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it' - St Matthew 13:45-6. Don't say: 'Heaven, as conventionally conceived, is a place so inane, so dull, so useless, so miserable, that nobody has ever ventured to describe a whole day in Heaven, though plenty of people have described a day at the seaside' - George Bernard Shaw.

After long years of neglect, step by step this Government is rebuilding Britain's public services. On top of the £40 billion extra we are already investing in education and health, we will today allocate increased resources for our key public services. We have identified specific areas where step changes can be made through additional investment from the Capital Modernisation Fund. We are allocating an additional £170 million for crime prevention in areas where crime is highest. The Home Secretary will make a detailed statement to the House. For public transport, in addition to the rural transport fund, we will make a further allocation to be announced by the Deputy Prime Minister. For Northern Ireland, today we allocate additional capital spending of £50 million, for Wales of £80 million, for Scotland of £165 million. Full details of new investments will be given by the Secretaries of State. The £19 billion pounds extra we are already providing for education will finance smaller class sizes, more nursery education, better pay for better teachers, our drive to improve literacy and numeracy - and we will help 700,000 more young people to go on to further and higher education. But, so that every child will have that chance, we need specific and targeted help for our inner city schools. For upgrading their technology, the Secretary of State for Education will receive an additional £100 million. And for every school we will not only invest in new technology; as a result of our prudence in the last year, and following the huge take-up of the additional money provided last year, we are able this month to make another extra and larger allocation for school books: £2,000 pounds to every school in every constituency in every part of the country, immediate new resources of £60 million for a total of 10 million new books in all. I turn to the NHS. £21 billion pounds extra money is making possible the largest hospital building programme since the war: a £1 billion investment in modern technology in the health service; the recruitment of 7,000 new doctors; 15,000 more nurses; and a fair pay award for nurses. The Government's new programme, NHS Direct, is a proven success. And later this week the Secretary of State for Health will announce detailed proposals not only to extend it to all of the country by the end of next year, but to carry NHS Direct right into communities - with a network of health centres and drop-in centres where people can get immediate advice about treatment. We have already provided additional resources for upgrading one-third of all accident and emergency units that need modernisation. Today we go further. To enhance in every part of the United Kingdom the health care that people most urgently require we today make an additional and immediate cash allocation, to be spent in the next 12 months, for the upgrading of every single accident and emergency unit which needs it, in every part of Britain. For this and other improvements which the Secretaries of State for Health, and Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland will announce, I am providing for the NHS almost half a billion pounds of extra investment today. Throughout the public services, more than a £1 billion of additional new investment, on top of the £2 billion pounds I have allocated to families and pensioners. Public services in the months and years ahead - safe in this Government's hands.

The French call it l'esprit de l'escalier, the moment when you work out, as you take the stairs in high dudgeon, the dazzling riposte you should have made 30 seconds before. In William Hague's case this would be some witty thrust along the lines of \"Shut your stupid gob\". He'd had 24 hours to think about it, and all he had come up with was the same question, which he asked, I think, four times. Like a subaltern going over the top in the first world war, he advanced on the enemy lines behind a hail of figures. \"240 million!\" and \"10,500 million!\" were among the many statistics he hurled at Mr Blair. (Sorry, my metaphors are getting a little confused here. But then in war, you can only predict the unpredictable.) The Prime Minister had anticipated the attack. \"4.5 billion!\" he shouted. \"£740 a year better off!\" Finally, he wheeled out his Big Bertha, a thunderous, earth-shaking \"Nine billion pounds!\" But the Boy Hague has guts. Once he has been cut down by friendly fire (Tories seem to think this might happen later this year) the officer class who sent him to be mown down in the fusillade of death will make sure he gets a posthumous VC for his bravery in the trenches. Four times he demanded how much taxes had increased as a result of all the Labour government's budgets. Four times Mr Blair told him that taxes were now coming down. \"What is the total tax increase for the coming year as a result of tax increases? In pounds!\" he demanded, as if Mr Blair might sneakily try giving the answer in euros, or Ruritanian krepps. Mr Hague came back at him again and again. (Of course, he already knew the answer. Like a good barrister, a leader of the Opposition never asks a question unless he has a better answer than the one he expects to be given.) He sounded like a schoolboy telling the teacher: \"And we're going to stay here until you answer my question.\" One yearned for some distinguished mathematician, Stephen Hawking perhaps, to arrive and point out with the aid of graphs that they were arguing about completely different things. Mr Hague means that taxes will have risen since May 1997 in spite of this Budget. Mr Blair means that taxes are now on their way down because of this Budget. They were thus in the position of two men, one insisting furiously that avocados are green, while the other shouts: \"No, you blithering idiot, bananas are yellow!\" After this engagement the Prime Minister seemed to be suffering from shell shock. He began to rave deliriously about his government's achievements, the benisons which are about to rain down on every family in the nation. Tax cuts! National insurance down! Child benefit up! He sounded like a old-time preacher describing the Kingdom of Heaven. As he spoke, he stood with feet apart, and hoisted a pointing finger on the end of his upraised arm. He looked like a cross between John Travolta and the Rev Ian Paisley. The two sides, having fought each other to a standstill, neither gaining more than a few yards, sat down. Back behind the lines, Mr Blair was able to take a warm bath in the supportive approval of his troops. They lined up to tell him how delighted their constituents were with the Budget, how grateful they were for the sacrifices made by our brave boys in the Treasury. Something was missing, though. The banner with the regimental motto was not flying. Luckily Captain Ashdown was ready. \"And no more boom and bust!\" he cried across No Man's Land. \"Quite right!

He said that 200 of the new jobs would be created under the Government's New Deal scheme, which subsidises employers who recruit from the ranks of the long-term unemployed. Peugeot announced the new jobs last December when it said it was recruiting a third shift for Ryton, which makes the new Peugeot 206. The new shift will set a precedent for the British motor industry, in that its members will have to work every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.Mr Byers said that Peugeot's decision to invest in Ryton underlined the competitiveness of the United Kingdom as a manufacturing base and confirmed the West Midlands as one of Europe's leading automotive manufacturing centres. He added: \"I particularly welcome the potential of this investment to create many new opportunities for long-term unemployed people to get back into work, supported by government-funded training.\" His comments come as Rover Group and its German parent, BMW, are seeking up to A200 million in government aid as the price of saving the 12,000 jobs at the group's Longbridge works in Birmingham. BMW has said that the aid package will determine whether it builds a replacement for the Rover 200 and 400 models at Longbridge or at a new site in Hungary. DaimlerChrysler yesterday revealed that it had pulled out of six-month long talks to buy an equity stake in Nissan, Japan's heavily indebted car firm, but said it would continue co-operation in the manufacture of heavy trucks. Louis Schweitzer, the chairman of Renault, said the French vehicle group was still studying a possible alliance with Nissan, but added that there would be no immediate announcement. \"We've always said it was an attractive prospect but that it wouldn't be easy,\" he said. \"I have underlined recently that this could offer great opportunities, but that it was something which included some risk related to the situation of Nissan and to the differences of culture, so we are going on with our in-depth study,\" he said. Nissan, which has lost money during six of the last seven years, indicated earlier this year that a foreign car manufacturer buying up to a third of the company's shares would get boardroom representation and a veto over management initiatives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/11/politicalnews.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-11T01:33:21Z","webTitle":"Commons sketch: Over the top with our brave leaders into a hail of figures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/11/politicalnews.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/11/politicalnews.uk","fields":{"headline":"Commons sketch: Over the top with our brave leaders into a hail of figures","bodyText":"The Wednesday after the Budget is the time the Opposition gets to say what it wishes it had thought of the previous day. The French call it l'esprit de l'escalier, the moment when you work out, as you take the stairs in high dudgeon, the dazzling riposte you should have made 30 seconds before. In William Hague's case this would be some witty thrust along the lines of \"Shut your stupid gob\". He'd had 24 hours to think about it, and all he had come up with was the same question, which he asked, I think, four times. Like a subaltern going over the top in the first world war, he advanced on the enemy lines behind a hail of figures. \"240 million!\" and \"10,500 million!\" were among the many statistics he hurled at Mr Blair. (Sorry, my metaphors are getting a little confused here. But then in war, you can only predict the unpredictable.) The Prime Minister had anticipated the attack. \"4.5 billion!\" he shouted. \"£740 a year better off!\" Finally, he wheeled out his Big Bertha, a thunderous, earth-shaking \"Nine billion pounds!\" But the Boy Hague has guts. Once he has been cut down by friendly fire (Tories seem to think this might happen later this year) the officer class who sent him to be mown down in the fusillade of death will make sure he gets a posthumous VC for his bravery in the trenches. Four times he demanded how much taxes had increased as a result of all the Labour government's budgets. Four times Mr Blair told him that taxes were now coming down. \"What is the total tax increase for the coming year as a result of tax increases? In pounds!\" he demanded, as if Mr Blair might sneakily try giving the answer in euros, or Ruritanian krepps. Mr Hague came back at him again and again. (Of course, he already knew the answer. Like a good barrister, a leader of the Opposition never asks a question unless he has a better answer than the one he expects to be given.) He sounded like a schoolboy telling the teacher: \"And we're going to stay here until you answer my question.\" One yearned for some distinguished mathematician, Stephen Hawking perhaps, to arrive and point out with the aid of graphs that they were arguing about completely different things. Mr Hague means that taxes will have risen since May 1997 in spite of this Budget. Mr Blair means that taxes are now on their way down because of this Budget. They were thus in the position of two men, one insisting furiously that avocados are green, while the other shouts: \"No, you blithering idiot, bananas are yellow!\" After this engagement the Prime Minister seemed to be suffering from shell shock. He began to rave deliriously about his government's achievements, the benisons which are about to rain down on every family in the nation. Tax cuts! National insurance down! Child benefit up! He sounded like a old-time preacher describing the Kingdom of Heaven. As he spoke, he stood with feet apart, and hoisted a pointing finger on the end of his upraised arm. He looked like a cross between John Travolta and the Rev Ian Paisley. The two sides, having fought each other to a standstill, neither gaining more than a few yards, sat down. Back behind the lines, Mr Blair was able to take a warm bath in the supportive approval of his troops. They lined up to tell him how delighted their constituents were with the Budget, how grateful they were for the sacrifices made by our brave boys in the Treasury. Something was missing, though. The banner with the regimental motto was not flying. Luckily Captain Ashdown was ready. \"And no more boom and bust!\" he cried across No Man's Land. \"Quite right! We must avoid a return to Tory boom and bust,\" said Colonel Blair, and his men cheered and waved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/13/uk.politicalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-13T02:48:02Z","webTitle":"SNP urges 'tartan tax' as boost to devolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/13/uk.politicalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/13/uk.politicalnews","fields":{"headline":"SNP urges 'tartan tax' as boost to devolution","bodyText":"Plans by the Scottish Nationalists to raise taxes in an independent Scotland ignited a row yesterday when members were urged to boost spending north of the border. Under SNP budget proposals announced yesterday, people in Scotland will pay 1p more in income tax than anywhere else in the United Kingdom next year.

The controversial call, immediately dubbed a 'tartan tax', was later reiterated by Alex Salmond, the party leader, in his rallying address. His speech met an enthusiastic audience, but it is not clear that the proposals will be so well received by the Scottish electorate. Mr Salmond was adamant, however. \"Gordon Brown thinks that the Scottish election can be bought by £2 a week for the average Scot. Bought and sold for a 1p off tax. I think he is wrong. I know he is wrong.\" Some senior party figures have questioned the plan and say that it could play into the hands of Labour and the Conservatives, who each say they will not use the tax-varying powers. The Chancellor, speaking on a visit to Edinburgh, dismissed the SNP's proposals as an error of judgment. He said he did not believe that Scots would wish to see the bonuses his budget handed out to England, Northern Ireland and Wales, denied to them. \"If taxes were raised next year by a Scottish parliament, the losers would be home owners, the would-be pensioners, and young people starting out.

This pledge would effectively rule out any alliance with the Liberal Democrats at Holyrood, so an SNP administration is, according to the polls, unlikely. But Mr Salmond, speaking at a time when the SNP is the only party in a position to challenge Labour's dominance of Scottish politics, was forthright in his views. \"Our country is waiting to be led, a new society is waiting to be born,\" he said. \"We are ready to win, to succeed in winning equality and independence for our country to be a nation again.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/13/otherparties.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-13T18:13:34Z","webTitle":"SNP urges 'tartan tax' as boost to devolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/13/otherparties.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/13/otherparties.uk","fields":{"headline":"SNP urges 'tartan tax' as boost to devolution","bodyText":"Plans by the Scottish Nationalists to raise taxes in an independent Scotland ignited a row yesterday when members were urged to boost spending north of the border.

It was of course nothing of the kind. Resentment against high levels of direct taxation has flickered only intermittently across the Continent of Europe - Oskar Lafontaine's departure from the German government last week had to do with anxiety about jobs not rejection of high taxation as a principle. Despite variegated fiscal experience in Europe, the American proposition that there was an iron law prescribing lower direct taxes became a nostrum of the eighties and got revived in the nineties when Labour's tax plans were wot won it for John Major in 1992. Gordon Brown sealed the pact by that promise prior to the 1997 election not to raise income tax during the (first) Blair government. But now here comes Alex Salmond of the SNP giving Scottish voters a chance to kick conventional wisdom in the teeth. Yes, he is stealing Liberal Democrat clothes and we mustn't forget, either, recent local authority votes allowing residents the chance to approve higher council tax levies. But in Aberdeen a straight offer was made. Vote Nat and you pay more. Vote Nat and the state, albeit the new Scottish statelet, will take more out of your pocket. With the money, Mr Salmond said, Scottish (ie higher) levels of provision in health and education would be maintained. It's a good move, a blow for fiscal adulthood. That's for several reasons. Some are local. There's more than a touch of Janus about modern Scottish nationalism, urban, rural, left, right, all things to all Scots. But Mr Salmond's move crystallises his rhetorical alignment to the left of Labour, presenting the SNP as a high-spending and collectivist party. (Do nationalism's right-wing and conservative elements now flee the camp and if so where?) Gordon Brown is said to think the Nats have walked into a carefully-prepared tax trap, that Labour can convincingly maintain its promise not levy the tartan tax, give voters the income tax cuts announced in the Budget and still find the wherewithal to pay for education and health. Scotland has a proud academic record - Chancellor and Prime Minister inter alia - per capita spending on health is high. The SNP says it needs extra money. Its tax promise thus provides Scottish voters with added choice. That's good for democracy and for the vitality of politics north of the border. It's what devolution ought to be all about. No election and certainly not the unprecedented contest taking place in Scotland on May 6 is likely to be determined by a single issue. Yet voters in Scotland will now have to think practically and self-interestedly about the trade-off between taxing and spending and they, and the rest of the United Kingdom, may learn a thing or two about altruism and its costs. A penny worth of income tax is worth some £230 million a year in Scotland, no inconsiderable sum. The SNP promises to shovel the money directly into the desired services. But if schools and social work are to benefit, such 'hypothecation' could mean slicing through the remaining autonomy of local authorities. There's a debate we probably need to have openly in England, too. In the Thatcher years, deeply influenced by American models and rhetoric, the right pretended with neo-Marxist certainty to know the direction of history, especially the ratio of government spending to the economy at large, which was heading south. But why should the tax take continue to fall if voters prize social justice and good public services? The SNP's premise is that Scottish voters are different. In a small way they are being offered the chance to prove it and show the rest of us that the era of 'tax revolt' is now over."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/16/uk.politicalnews2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-16T02:02:17Z","webTitle":"Peers cast doubt on Blair case for rebate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/16/uk.politicalnews2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/16/uk.politicalnews2","fields":{"headline":"Peers cast doubt on Blair case for rebate","bodyText":"Tony Blair will be undermined today by a parliamentary select committee only hours before his meeting with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, to fight for Brit-ain's £2 billion rebate from the European Union. The House of Lords European committee, which is chaired by the Labour peer, Lord Grenfell, urged Mr Blair in a report published today to abandon the rebate in the greater interests of an overall EU financial settlement. But Downing Street will reject the committee's recommendations and stick by its formula which says the rebate is not up for negotiation. Mr Schroder will press Mr Blair to make concessions when he visits Downing Street as part of a quick tour of European leaders ahead of a summit in Berlin next week to discuss European funding for the next seven years. Defence of the rebate has become a political totem since it was secured in 1984 by Baroness Thatcher, making it harder for Mr Blair to trade it away as part of a new financial package that would include reform of the common agricultural policy. The select committee's report concludes: 'We agree that there is still a problem for the United Kingdom but we consider that the rebate itself may no longer be the best way of solving it. We, therefore, take the view that the rebate should be negotiable as part of an overall settlement delivering the result of fairer net contributions. 'It would be regrettable if the entire package (including CAP reform and the possibility of funding enlargement) were lost because the United Kingdom government insisted there was only one way of solving its problem.' The committee suggests that Britain trades the rebate for the savings that could be made on CAP reform and increased expenditure in the UK. Three of the 15 peers on the committee are Labour, three Conservative, one Liberal Democrat and the remainder cross-benchers. Lord Grenfell denied last night that the report would undermine Mr Blair. The report pointed out that the rebate position was not sustainable in the long run, he said. Other countries, such as Germany, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands, were in the same position as Britain, with excessive budgetary contributions, but they did not receive rebates. 'Germany and the others will not sit back for ever,' Lord Grenfell said. In a separate development, the main cross-party campaign in favour of joining the single currency was officially launched last night. The campaign group, Britain in Europe, is made up of politicians from various parties, the business community and trade unions. The group has been given the support of Downing Street. The campaign group is headed by British Airways chairman Lord Marshall. Other leading figures include former Labour adviser Lord Hollick, the head of United News and Media, which owns the Express, plus Labour MP Giles Radice, of the European Movement, and Colin Sharman of KPMG International. Unilever chairman Sir Niall FitzGerald, the general secretary of the engineering union Ken Jackson, and Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell, are also involved. Baroness Thatcher's former chancellor, Lord Howe, is listed as an 'observer' on the new group's board. The group, Britain in Europe, claims that 'other leading politicians' are expected to join. In the run-up to the European elections on June 10, Britain in Europe is planning to leaflet 125 towns and cities. The drive is similar to the strategy being pursued by the anti-European Democracy Movement, led by Paul Sykes, which is holding a series of events to leaflet town centres during the same period."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/mar/16/6","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-16T02:03:58Z","webTitle":"Home loans at Euro rate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/mar/16/6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/mar/16/6","fields":{"headline":"Home loans at Euro rate","bodyText":"Nationwide Building Society could start a revolution in mortgages by launching the first sterling home loan linked to European interest rates. The mortgage will be priced at 1.75 per cent above the European Central Bank rate for 10 years, giving a current variable rate of 4.75 per cent. There is also a discount of 1 per cent in the first year. This compares with a typical United Kingdom bank standard variable mortgage rate of 6.95 per cent. The move indicates that with consumers clamouring to take advantage of lower European interest rates, financial services companies are not prepared to sit back and wait for the UK to make a decision about joining the single currency before launching products. Other banks and building societies will be watching closely to see how the new mortgage fares. 'It will certainly get other lenders thinking. It is clearly innovative,' said Ray Boulger at mortgage brokers John Charcol. A handful of lenders, notably Abbey National and Barclays, have already launched euro mortgages this year, allowing people to pay interest rates of around 4.6 per cent. However, these are niche products available only to the small band of Britons paid in euros. As the Nationwide mortgage will operate in sterling, there is no exchange rate risk, as is the case with foreign currency mortgages. The catch is early redemption penalties for the full 10 years. A customer wanting to pay off the loan within the first five years must pay nine months' gross interest, which reduces to six months' interest in years six to eight, and three months' interest in years nine and 10. The other downside is that if Britain joins the European single currency in, say, 2002, the ECB base rate - currently 3 per cent - will also become our base rate. In that case, a mortgage rate of 1.75 per cent above UK base would not seem nearly such good value, said Patrick Bunton at mortgage brokers London &amp; Country. Also, 10 years is a hell of a long time to sign up for in the current environment.' Nationwide has called the product the European Tracker Mortgage and will be available via its telephone division from March 24. It is only available to people moving house. 'This will be a completely new type of mortgage product and Nationwide is testing customer reaction with only a limited amount of mortgage funds being made available,' said a spokesman. 'It is designed for those people who believe that European interest rates are, at least for the foreseeable future, going to be lower than UK rates.' Most analysts expect interest rates in the 'Eurozone' to be lower than British base rates for at least two years. 'On the face of it, you should probably rip [Nationwide's] arm off to get that sort of deal because for the next few years British interest rates are likely to be higher than European rates. 'Then it looks like we will go into Economic and Monetary Union and rates will be the same,' said Adam Cole, UK economist at HSBC. He warned that the deal could look less attractive in a few years' time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/mar/16/uk.politicalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-16T02:04:33Z","webTitle":"Sub-aqua Prescott claims a diplomatic triumph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/16/uk.politicalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/mar/16/uk.politicalnews","fields":{"headline":"Sub-aqua Prescott claims a diplomatic triumph","bodyText":"For such a sensitive soul it was an unedifying spectacle. As he was studying a coral reef at 30 feet under the warm waters of the Indian ocean over the weekend, the round figure of John Prescott suddenly shot up when water gushed into his diving mask. The Deputy Prime Minister quickly recovered his composure, but he was given an unpleasant taste of the hazards of diving which has ruined many a holiday on the idyllic Maldive islands. Except, of course, that Mr Prescott is not on holiday, as his aides have been at pains to point out. He may have a spectacular suntan, but the Deputy Prime Minister insists that he has been on serious government business during a 12-day odyssey across India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. His trip, which ended at the weekend at the luxurious Kurumba village resort on the Maldives, has taken Mr Prescott to a tiger reserve in Rajasthan where he rose at dawn to watch the shy creatures and to the Taj Mahal courtesy of an Indian government helicopter. Mr Prescott enthused about his adventure in an interview with an Indian newspaper headlined Postcard from India. 'In a single day last weekend I witnessed two sights that will stay with me for the rest of my life,' he said. 'The first was the white marble splendour of the Taj Mahal, for many westerners the enduring symbol of India. The second was a Bengal tiger, striding slowly and majestically towards me out of the twilight in the Rathambore wildlife reserve in Rajasthan. We have much in common and much to learn from each other.' After his spell in the wild Mr Prescott retired to the five star Maurya Sheraton hotel in Delhi's diplomatic quarter, where rooms with a king-size bed cost £163 a night. When he moved on to Bombay last Wednesday staff at the exclusive Oberoi Towers hotel were so pleased to see the Deputy Prime Minister that they moved him out of his £173-a-night room to the £1,358-a-night presidential suite. The upgrade represented a bargain for the taxpayer, Mr Prescott's staff insisted yesterday. 'It would have been rude to turn down the offer,' a spokeswoman said, 'He is the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.' Mr Prescott's twin status as 'DPM' as his office love to call him and as the overlord of a super-ministry covering three government departments has provided plenty of business to keep him busy in Asia, his officials say. With his DPM hat, Mr Prescott has been mending fences with senior figures in the Indian government, including Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, after the debacle over the Queen's visit to India in 1997. Six senior businessmen have accompanied Mr Prescott hoping to drum up business in the newly-liberalised Indian market, which was threatened by the cooling in relations after the Queen's visit. After networking with politicians in Delhi and Bombay, Mr Prescott donned his Environment Secretary hat and headed down to the Maldives to examine the devastating impact of global warming on coral reefs. His dive off the Maldive islands was described as important fieldwork for a conference he will attend on sustainable development in New York next month. Mr Prescott said yesterday that Britain is to provide £300,000 for coral conservation in the region. 'Damage I have been shown here is a clear indication of the link between climate, oceans and land-based pollution. Coral reefs are the miners' canary of the oceans. The world needs to take notice.' High-minded reports have appeared in the Times of India recording Mr Prescott's visit which made no mention of luxurious hotels. The Foreign Office will have been delighted with one headline in the paper which said: 'Prescott's meeting with PM signals thaw in ties.' L.K. Sharma, London-based Europe correspondent of The Times of India who interviewed Mr Prescott ahead of his visit, said he could not understand the fuss in Britain. 'Ministers cannot even catch a taxi in Britain without getting into trouble,' he said. 'We are five years behind Britain in that sort of reporting. Perhaps we will catch up.' Mr Sharma said that Mr Prescott's visit had been a great success in mending fences with Delhi. 'Mr Prescott went with a great deal of humility compared with Robin Cook. He said he was going to learn. Sending such a senior figure has sent a very good signal to India.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/mar/16/healthandwellbeing.health5","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-16T16:24:01Z","webTitle":"A culture that kills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/mar/16/healthandwellbeing.health5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/mar/16/healthandwellbeing.health5","fields":{"headline":"A culture that kills","bodyText":"British people die unnecessarily, according to World Health Organisation cancer chief Karol Sikora. If the British health system were as good at treating cancer as the best elsewhere in Europe, up to 25,000 lives would be saved each year, 10,000 if we merely hit the average. Move to France for the best chance of surviving lung cancer, the Eurocare II study implies(1). For those diagnosed with breast and prostate cancer Switzerland offers most hope. Top of the league for treating bowel cancer is the Netherlands, while the Austrians have the highest success rates in stomach cancer. Britain languishes at the bottom of the league alongside countries of much lower socio-economic status such as Poland and Estonia. The picture isn't uniformly bad. In some British centres, patients receive treatment as good as anywhere in the world and their chances are as high as they can be given in the current state of knowledge. But distressingly for patients, cancer care in this country is patchy, in some areas below standard. It's hard for patients to find out whether they are getting the best care - or the worst. Why? At a recent Paris conference a simple explanation was proffered: our low spending on powerful tumour-killing drugs was to blame. There is more to it than that. How care is organised, shortage of specialist oncologists, non-implementation of agreed reforms, a conservative medical culture and lack of money are all implicated. Two decades ago most European countries picked up and ran with a WHO directive which recommended specialist multidisciplinary teams which would focus on specific types of cancer. Britain did not follow suit. Professor Gordon McVie, director of the Cancer Research Campaign, says cancer simply wasn't considered a priority. Doctors took the view that 'cancer was something anyone could have a crack at'. British cancer patients are traditionally diagnosed and treated by general physicians and surgeons, who may deal with only a handful of cases a year. European patients are fast-tracked to specialists. Cancer charities tell patients that the first question they have to ask, in judging the quality of the care they about to receive, is whether the doctor they are referred to specialises in their kind of cancer. The chances are that he will not. Yet research has proven over and again the benefits of specialist care in reducing delays in diagnosis, improving the effectiveness of treatment and boosting the odds on survival. A woman with ovarian cancer, for example, has 50 per cent less risk of dying within five years if her removal operation is done by a surgeon who does more than five such procedures a year, rather than by one who does fewer than five. In 1995, recognising the need for change, the chief medical officers for England and Wales (Sir Kenneth Calman and Dr Deidre Hine) recommended a radical restructuring of cancer care. This was intended to introduce dedicated cancer units in district hospitals for more common cancers and create cancer centres providing high standard comprehensive, specialised and multidisciplinary care for most cancers, including rare ones, in regional centres(2). Optimists say this sea-change in cancer organisation make Karol Sikora's figures on cancer survival - which cover only the period 1978-89 - well out-of-date. But in reality the Calman/Hine changes are proving agonisingly slow and uneven. While for example Birmingham has forged ahead in developing specialist cancer care, others, such as Oxford, have barely started. It's a matter of culture: the highly-opinionated professionals running cancer care have been steeped in a thick brew of attitudes and expectations. The Bristol heart babies case demonstrated the absolute autonomy that senior hospital doctors have enjoyed. But the more urgent problem is the shortage of cancer specialists. Britain has fewer oncologists per patient than any equivalent European country. According to the Joint Council for Clinical Oncology (JCCO), representing radiologists, surgeons and physicians, there are currently the equivalent of 365 whole-time oncologists (85 medical oncologists - specialists in drug therapy - and 280 clinical oncologists, that is specialists in radiotherapy). With 183,000 people newly diagnosed with cancer a year, this means each specialist sees about 500 new patients a year. Compare this, the JCCO chairman, Dr Mike Cullen, says, to the 75 new patients per specialist in Norway, 100 in Belgium, 140 in Germany, 150 in Austria, 200 in France, Spain and the US, 250 in the Netherlands and 270 in Switzerland. 'These figures speak for themselves. They mean consultants in other countries can devote more time per patient and, very importantly, that they can become more specialised in just one or two types of cancer. It's like snooker, the more you practise the better you get. An oncologist seeing 400 to 500 patients can't do that. This is a key contributing factor to poorer overall survival.' The reasons for this shortfall include bad planning (it takes five years to train a specialist) and lack of money which means trusts have to wait to convert, say, a post in rheumatology to oncology when the incumbent retires rather than increasing posts overall. We lack a co-ordinated force to drive change through a fragmented NHS. Money shortages are evident again when it comes to drug treatment - chemotherapy. Drugs such as Taxol which are rationed by health authorities in the United Kingdom, have been proved to offer months, sometimes years of extra life to cancer patients. But Britain spends less than any equivalent Western country on cancer medicines. In the year to March 1998, Britain spent £58m or £1.01 per head of population on anti-cancer drugs while Italy spent £1.24 per head, Germany £2.31, France £2.93 and the US £4.93. For the sake of comparison, note that in the same 12 months, Britain spent £41 million on acne treatments, £78 million on laxatives, £87 million on AIDS/HIV therapy, £420 million on antibiotics, £660 million on ulcer therapy and £774 million on medication to lower blood pressure. Dr Cullen says 'I don't think we should be spending as much on drugs as the US, but we are clearly behind the times in these treatments. Cancer isn't rare: a quarter of us will die from it and a third of us will get it at some time, yet we are not spending anywhere near as much as we should on it.' Therapeutic radiotherapy is suffering from a similar lack of investment. An audit last year by the Royal College of Radiologists found access to linear accelerators severely limited - these are the modern machines which have made it possible to direct radiation more accurately to tumours while sparing normal tissues and minimising complications, both of key factors in survival. Fewer than 7 per cent of the population are served by the recommended level of four accelerators per million people(3). In 22 radiology departments, treatment is still delivered with Cobalt-60 machines abandoned in other parts of Western Europe. The royal college believes a minimum of 48 new accelerators - at a cost of £1 million each - and 44 replacements along with supporting staff are needed to bring Britain level with European standards. 'Almost every department in the country is short of one machine, and at least another of their machines needs replacing,' Dr Norman Howard says on behalf of the radiologists. 'Most of Europe is better off and one always goes to Scandinavia with one's tongue hanging out.'The college has put together one of the few sets of statistics that give an indication of how variable treatment is around the country. It has measured health authorities against the good practice guidelines it put together for the maximum length of time patients should have to wait for radiotherapy. Its report showed that the North West topped the league, with 40 per cent of patients waiting an unacceptably long time for treatment, followed by Trent (37 per cent) and Northern and Yorkshire (36 per cent)(4). Best was the West Midlands, with 7 per cent. The Department of Health's league tables for the first time last December gave a break-down by health authority of death rates from breast cancer(5). Mortality figures can easily be skewed, critics say. Although they were adjusted for the age of the local population, they did not take into account factors like poverty and smoking. That said, there were marked variations. With 100 as the average, the Isle of Wight came out best with a standardised mortality ratio of 81, followed by Gateshead, South Tyneside and Morecambe Bay on 82. Worst was Solihull on 119 and Walsall on 118. The Thames Cancer Registry offers a glimpse of the variations in London and the South-east. Breast cancer five-year survival is slightly above the national average at 68.7 per cent. But some addresses are significantly better than others. Five year survival rates for breast cancer in Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster are 73.7 per cent, while in Bexley and Greenwich, they are only 66 per cent. The contrast between the boroughs is more marked when it comes to prostate cancer. In Kensington, a man has a 59.8 per cent chance of living for five years. In Bexley, his chances are only 34 per cent. What is to be done? The Calman-Hine reforms need to be pushed through faster, and with more money behind them. The Government has recently announced extra sums for lung and breast cancer, but welcome as they are, they are not directed at improving the organisation of cancer care. Professor Sikora would also like to see a national cancer centre from which excellence, best practice and high standards could be disseminated around the country. Some hope that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which starts work next month, will end some of the patchiness around the country. Its experts will make value for money judgments on, say, Taxol in ovarian cancer, which is used almost universally in Europe and the US but is still available here only in areas where the health authority has decided to pay for it. If things are to get better, attitudes need to change on the part of doctors, for example to new therapies. And patients. Patient support groups such as CancerBACUP say the public should challenge the prevailing culture. If patients and their relatives were more demanding, more assertive the chances of surviving cancer in Britain would stand a chance of approaching the European norm.

He may revise this opinion if, as seems increasingly likely, the Home Secretary gives him a British passport. For more than a century, foreigners living here who wished to become naturalised Britons have had to show that they are 'of good character'. This might appear an insuperable obstacle for Al Fayed, who was damned as a congenital liar in a 752-page report issued 10 years ago by the Department of Trade and Industry. But Home Secretary Jack Straw has now decided to 'discount the criticisms . . . in the DTI Inspectors' Report on grounds of passage of time'. I asked the Home Office for further details of this novel exemption. Would Straw still turn a blind eye if the official condemnation had been published five years ago? 'We're not saying we disagree with the DTI report,' a spokesman told me. So why ignore it? 'The Home Secretary felt it was appropriate. There's no hard and fast rule.' Or, in other words, Straw is simply making up the rules as he goes along. What makes his generosity all the more puzzling is that it conflicts with government policy. Only last month, during the second reading of his Immigration and Asylum Bill, Straw told the Commons of his determination to repel 'economic migrants' who come to Britain merely to better themselves. Personally, I can't see why he should vilify and demonise these people: as the Labour MP Marsha Singh said in the same debate, Europeans have been engaged in economic migration for centuries - to the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and so on. But I am not the Home Secretary. If Jack Straw believes that economic migrants deserve zero tolerance, why make an exception for a corrupt and corrupting Egyptian shopkeeper? Perhaps a clue can be found in a Daily Express editorial last week, which claimed that 'a multi-cultural Britain ought to be able to accommodate Mr Fayed' despite his record of bribery, deceit, intimidation and sexual harassment. (When an interior designer at Harrods resisted his sexual advances, he warned her that 'I'll cut your fucking legs off and throw you out into the street and then you'll realise how lucky you are to work for Mohamed Al Fayed'.) According to the Express, anyone who objects to Fayed or his methods is guilty of 'snobbishness tainted with racism'. The last thing Jack Straw wants, so soon after the Lawrence inquiry, is to be accused of 'institutional racism' or 'canteen culture'. What both the Home Secretary and the Express fail to notice is that Fayed himself is one of the most thoroughgoing racists in town. Visiting the Harrods sports department in 1994, he gestured at a group of Asian staff and commanded his security guards to 'throw those Pakis out'. When asked why, he replied: 'They are Pakis and this is my store.' On another occasion he ordered the sacking of an employee in the Food Hall, whom he described as a 'black bastard'. In November 1997 an industrial tribunal concluded that Harrods practised 'blatant racial discrimination'. Al Fayed has been forced to pay thousands of pounds in compensation to shop-assistants from ethnic minorities who have been unfairly dismissed, but he clearly thinks that it's a price worth paying. A 'staff review' five years ago led to the firing of 33 people, of whom at least 24 were of Asian or Afro-Caribbean background. By 1995 just 15 per cent of customer service staff at Harrods were black or Asian, as against 36 per cent at Selfridges and 49 per cent at Debenhams. Interviewed by Der Spiegel magazine a year later, Al Fayed revealed that one reason for wanting a British passport was that he hated having to queue at the airport 'among all those Pakis'. Thanks to nice Mr Straw, it looks as if his wish will soon be granted. Another week, another fresh start for little William Hague. He has asked Gary Streeter, the Tory MP for Devon South West, to arrange no fewer than 70 meetings with Christian church leaders 'to find out where politicians go wrong and how the Conservatives could improve'. Streeter's preliminary conclusion, according to a report in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, is that 'politicians' private lives must match their public persona if they are to win the respect of voters'. Streeter, who in his own private life is a West Country lawyer, seems ideally qualified for the task of guiding his party into the paths of righteousness. Last summer, shortly after joining the shadow cabinet, he was hauled up before a Law Society tribunal for representing a client whose interests conflicted, or appeared likely to conflict, with those of his other clients. He was fined £1,000 for 'conduct unbecoming a solicitor'. Too much beef-on-the-bone, or a surfeit of genetically modified tomato juice in their Bloody Marys? Whatever the cause, during the past few days our leading right-wing pundits have been in an alarmingly apoplectic state. 'The Chancellor could not have been more matter-of-fact in pronouncing the Government's death sentence on the traditional family,' Simon Heffer rages in the Daily Mail. 'Yet in replacing the present married couple's allowance, that was exactly what he was doing . . . the Government's broad-brush approach removes many of the remaining reasons for a young woman to have a child in wedlock.' David Green of the Institute of Economic Affairs agrees: 'This Budget is a nail in the coffin of the institution of marriage.' For decades, these Heffers and Greens have thundered against the 'nanny state', arguing that attempts by governments to promote a particular way of life is tantamount to 'social engineering' of the most sinister, Stalinist kind. Now, all of a sudden, they want Gordon Brown to be Mary Poppins and Isambard Kingdom Brunel rolled into one. Please boss us about, they beg him; how can you expect us to behave responsibly unless you withhold treats from the naughty boys and girls who won't become cogs in the marriage machine? The Daily Mail accuses Brown of 'kicking away the final fiscal prop to the institution of marriage'; Paul Johnson mourns the demise of 'the last tax advantage people had for sticking to the marriage rules'. It's a rum do - and all the rummer because these wild ululations come from people who usually maintain wedlock is the most enduring of human creations. The institution of marriage survived for millennia without 'fiscal props' and 'tax advantages'. Yet now we are warned that it can be kept alive only by bribery, and pretty meagre bribery at that: £190 a year, to be precise. One Sunday newspaper claimed last weekend that axing the married couple's allowance was an affront to 'traditionalists who believe people should be encouraged to live in old-fashioned Christian marriage'. Christ certainly demonstrated his approval of marriage by helping out with the catering at the wedding in Cana; he also said a husband should not divorce his wife 'except for fornication'. But nowhere in the scriptures can I find a commandment that 'thou shalt pay an annual state subsidy of £190, allowable against tax, to those whom God hath joined together, lest thou incur the wrath of the Daily Mail, yea and even the Institute of Economic Affairs'. Perhaps that devout Christian husband Paul Johnson, who has had his own difficulties in 'sticking to the marriage rules', can point me to the elusive reference."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/18/4","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-18T03:43:36Z","webTitle":"UK citizenship for island outposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/18/4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/18/4","fields":{"headline":"UK citizenship for island outposts","bodyText":"'Oh, lovely' cried Anne Sin, owner of Anne's Place restaurant on the wharf at Jamestown, as she yesterday became the first St Helenian to hear that Britain had agreed to restore the islanders' rights. 'We've been fighting and waiting for this for such a very long time. I'm so pleased.' As the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was informing the Commons of the Government's 'renewed contract and modern partnership' with the far-flung remnants of a once mighty empire including full citizenship for all who want it, Mrs Sin was excitedly telling customers enjoying her famous seafood platters that the distant motherland had done the right thing. Others among the 5,500 'Saints' of Britain's remote Atlantic 'Alcatraz' were ecstatic as the news was broadcast on the local radio station, bringing hope of more generous aid and pride that the spirit of the 1673 royal charter was again respected in London. 'I love it,' enthused Ivy Yon, who runs Jamestown's Wellington House hotel: 'This is a very big event for us. I would never be able to leave St Helena to live outside, but it's nice to know that I'm free to go to and do as I please in Britain. I won't need a work permit any more.' Half a world away, Brenda Christian, a direct descendant of the 18th century Bounty mutineers who settled Pitcairn island in the lonely depths of the Pacific, was also delighted. 'We've always considered ourselves British citizens. It's great that now we will finally get the same rights as everyone else.' In Bermuda, the oldest and wealthiest of Britain's 13 remaining overseas territories, there was satisfaction, too, though, with a standard of living higher than Britain, the citizenship change is more symbolic than real. As Mr Cook told MPs, the territories will in return accept obligations: Bermuda will prosecute tax evasion and other financial irregularities, as well as bring its laws on capital punishment, flogging and homosexuality into line with British and European standards. 'Overall the people of Bermuda will be happy to have full British citizenship,' said Raymond Hainey of Hamilton's Royal Gazette. 'It's long been a source of resentment that when people arrive in Britain they have to give way to French and Germans with EU passports.' Elsewhere in the Caribbean, the chief minister of Montserrat, David Brandt, welcomed Mr Cook's white paper, which aims to improve policy co-ordination that was embarassingly poor in the island's volcano crisis; memories are still raw over the 'golden elephants' jibe by Clare Short, the development secretary. In the Cayman islands, concern focused on Britain's demand for international standards on money laundering, transparency and co-operation with law enforcement agencies. This is seen as vital after the near-collapse last year of the locally registered Long-Term Capital Management precipitated a $3.5 billion bail-out by the New York Federal Reserve. 'The globalisation of international finance means we cannot tolerate a weak link anywhere in the chain without exposing investors to risk,' Mr Cook told MPs. 'People don't care particularly about the citizenship issue, though it will make travel easier,' said Ursula Gill, who was putting the story on the front page of this morning's edition of the Cayman Compass. 'Nobody's going to up and move to the UK.' The white paper proposes giving full citizenship to 150,000 people, many of whom lost their automatic right to a British passport under the immigration laws of the 1980s. Only a handful in the neediest cases, St Helena and Montserrat, are expected to take up the offer, not least because 70 per cent of overseas territories residents have a higher per capita income than Britain. There is no reciprocal right for mainland Britons to settle in what will now be officially renamed United Kingdom Overseas Territories, with the Caribbeans in particular anxious to prevent an influx. Mr Cook launched the review following the handover of Hong Kong to China in June 1997, after successive governments refused to grant full citizenship to 3 million of the colony's Chinese inhabitants. He wanted to bring all the territories into line with the largely white Falkland islands and Gibraltar to avoid any suggestion of racial discrimination. The package includes an environmental protection programme to safeguard the polar icecap in the uninhabited British Antarctic Territory, and the numerous species of dolphins and whales in the waters off the Falklands. 'The white paper confirms our commitment to drop the title 'dependent territories',' Mr Cook said. 'It is the wrong name for today's territories, which are energetic, self-governing, and anything but dependent.' The Foreign Secretary said that the change would end the 'strong sense of grievance' in these last outposts. He promised legislation 'at the earliest possible opportunity' to enact necessary changes. Who will benefit? Eight of Britain's remaining inhabited overseas territories will be affected by the Government's proposals on citizenship, financial and legal reforms.They are: Cayman Islands: Three islands in the Caribbean, total area 100 square miles. Offshore financial centre, population 36,000. Bermuda: About 100 small islands in the Atlantic, with a total area of 21 sq miles. Internal self-government since 1968. Population 61,000. Anguilla: A Caribbean island of 35 sq miles, a British colony since 1650. Population 12,000. St Helena and dependencies: St Helena is a mountainous island in the south Atlantic, 700 miles from its nearest neighbour and dependency Ascension. It depends on a yearly £3.2 million subsidy from Britain. Turks and Caicos Islands: Eight of the 30 islands are inhabited. Population 20,000. British Virgin Islands: Eleven of the 46 islands are inhabited. Population 19,000. Montserrat: This Caribbean island of 38 sq miles has an active volcano which erupted in June, 1997, killing 19 people. Population 4,500, concentrated in the northern third of the island. Became a British colony in 1632. Pitcairn Islands: Another volcanic island, this time in the south Pacific. Population is just 54. The Falkland Islands and Gibraltar already enjoy full British citizenship rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/mar/19/4","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-19T02:54:29Z","webTitle":"Rover's £647m record losses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/mar/19/4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/mar/19/4","fields":{"headline":"Rover's £647m record losses","bodyText":"BMW, the German car group, dramatically underlined the parlous state of Rover yesterday by unveiling record losses of £647 million at its United Kingdom subsidiary last year - and the best ever results from its eponymous luxury cars division. The revelation of the scale of Rover's losses - and reliable estimates are that they could be more than £300 million this year - came as the German group's supervisory board turned down what insiders regard as a derisory offer of grant aid from the Government to rebuild the Longbridge plant, near Birmingham. Union leaders warned ministers that BMW could produce a planned new range of models in Hungary. Rover, which lost £91 million in 1997 and was due to be making profits by next year, lost DM1.871 billion (£64 million), dragging down the overall BMW group's pre-tax earnings to DM2.076 billion compared with DM2.528 billion in 1997. But the BMW cars division saw its earnings rise 24.5 per cent to a record DM3.917 billion. The company blamed last year's losses at Rover on model changes (including the phasing out of the 100, or Metro, and pending changes to the 200/400 series, as well as the delayed arrival of the up-market R75 model), market and currency factors and the cost of restructuring. The latter, largely the dismissal of 2,500 employees, knocked around £150 million off the result.The company said the final results for 1998, due to be revealed in Munich on March 30, would be less horrendous as they would be assessed on the average value of the pound against the DM over the year but executives have long campaigned for sterling to fall to around DM2.60 compared with its current DM2.90 and warned that its strength is severely delaying Rover's financial recovery. Rover's sales fell 4.8 per cent to 497,574 units, with its market share plunging to 5 per cent or less in the final months of 1998. But even these sales made losses as the company was forced to match competitors' discounts in the UK. BMW shares rose nearly 3 per cent in late trading in Frankfurt as the group announced an unchanged dividend of DM20 a share but the mood among union leaders and employees darkened as the full scale of Rover's losses came to light and new doubts about the Government's commitment to Longbridge emerged. Whitehall sources dismissed reported hostility at BMW's Munich headquarters to the Government's offer, worth £118 million compared with the £240 million sought, arguing that this was part of negotiations which would continue over several weeks. But Tony Woodley, chief union negotiator at Rover, claiming that Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, had not even made a formal offer, said the delay in assuring the future of Longbridge and its workforce was unnecessary and 'simply drip-feeds despondency among the employees'."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/19/davidhencke","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-19T02:54:56Z","webTitle":"Mining firm tries to change law to block £100m claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/19/davidhencke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/19/davidhencke","fields":{"headline":"Mining firm tries to change law to block £100m claims","bodyText":"A British company defending one of the biggest damages claims since the Thalidomide scandal is campaigning to change the law to prevent the case being brought. Documents leaked to the Guardian show that it has sought the support of senior civil servants in four Whitehall departments. Cape plc, which has substantial foreign mining interests, is defending claims in the British courts that could cost it up to £100 million, from more than 1,500 South African former workers with asbestosis and fatal lung cancers. The cases can only be brought if the workers are awarded legal aid. The company is trying through the courts and Whitehall to persuade Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, to reverse a House of Lords ruling which allowed a Namibian worker to get legal aid to bring a case in the UK against another company. Cape hired Wilf Weeks, a partner in the lobbying firm GJW, and Charles Lewington, John Major's former media adviser, to lobby Whitehall and Downing Street to influence Lord Irvine to introduce amendments to the Access to Justice Bill going through Parliament. The aim is to ban foreign workers of British companies getting legal aid. Lord Irvine is poised to make a decision this month but is expected to keep legal aid in cases involving basic human rights. The documents, leaked from GJW, reveal that Mr Weeks claims to have elicited support from civil servants in the Treasury, Foreign Office, Department of Trade and Industry, Cabinet Office and the Society of Labour Lawyers to influence the Lord Chancellor. The papers detail off-the-record briefings with civil servants and advisers who are quoted expressing sympathy for the company's case: 'Officials continually emphasised the arguments that the taxpayer will end up footing the bill are of critical importance.' Tony Rogers, head of legal aid spending in the Treasury, is quoted as saying: 'The implications of such a multiple claim by foreign nationals on the public purse would be a matter of serious concern.' Foreign Office officials Jill Barrett and Tom Hoskins are quoted as saying: 'The decision to pursue the case in the UK courts rather than South Africa would be seen as displaying a lack of faith in the South African legal system.' Department of Trade and Industry officials Michael Colgan and Bob Manning reportedly said they would not be keen to see any developments which discouraged multinationals from locating their headquarters in the UK. Jonathan Cowper, head of the Better Government Unit in the Cabinet Office, is reportedly prepared to co-ordinate issues over the matter. Stuart Bell MP, of the Society of Labour Lawyers, is quoted as agreeing that a 'very select briefing of parliamentarians would be sensible to ensure that the Lord Chancellor was aware of the wide-ranging implications'. The Cape workers were denied the right to sue in South Africa by a compulsory 'no-fault' system of compensation funded by mining companies. Injury claims can only be paid if employees waived the right to sue in South Africa. In 1997 solicitor Richard Meeran won legal aid for five South Africans to sue Cape in Britain. Since then he has consolidated more than 1,500 claims for dead and dying former employees. The first plaintiff is Hendrik Afrika, who started working for Cape in 1960 aged 17. He claims there were no warnings and no protective clothing was supplied. He was diagnosed as suffering from asbestosis a year ago. Mr Meeran said: 'Large numbers of people have been fatally or seriously injured and the company which failed to protect them should be accountable here, where they are based and where they took their profits.' Ann Clwyd, chair of the all-party Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, who has also received the GJW documents, said yesterday: 'I was absolutely appalled when I read the company's strategy... The workers have right on their side, not the company.' GJW last night said its relationship with Cape had ended after supplying the strategy. Mr Lewington said: 'I have a practice of never talking about confidential advice.' David McIntosh, a senior partner of Davies Arnold Cooper, the lawyers for Cape, distanced his firm from the strategy. 'GJW is no longer working for Cape. We are also, as their lawyers, determined to act in a prim and proper way and are going back to the courts to challenge this judgment because we believe it was not made clear when the House of Lords allowed this case to be brought in the United Kingdom that possibly 2,000 people could be involved. So it is correct to say we are challenging the grounds of the original case but through the courts.' Cape declined to speak directly to the Guardian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/mar/20/features.jobsmoney12","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-20T04:05:06Z","webTitle":"On the right tracks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/20/features.jobsmoney12","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/mar/20/features.jobsmoney12","fields":{"headline":"On the right tracks","bodyText":"Trackers appear to be such a simple as well as a popular concept. Investors hand over their money and hitch a ride in a cheap fund tracking the movement of a share index, leaving costly actively-managed funds in their wake. The trackers' seemingly peerless combination of reduced risk, reasonable charges and impressive performance has persuaded nearly half a million investors to save £6 billion in these funds over the past five years. But it could all be too good to be true. Investors buying into index trackers thinking they are low risk are mistaken. In recent times, market forces have served to raise the stakes and plan purchasers are now being warned that buying index trackers could mean concentrating their holdings on a narrow band of shares. Most funds track the FTSE 100, which consists of the 100 largest companies on the UK stock market. At present, though, it is dominated by 10 companies: BP Amoco, Glaxo Wellcome, British Telecom, SmithKline Beecham, Lloyds TSB, Vodafone, Shell Transport and Trading, Barclays, Zeneca Group and Diageo. They make up 42 per cent of the index and thus an investor's portfolio. Of the funds at the bottom of the FTSE 100, it takes 78 companies to make up the same percentage. As well as the strong growth in these blue chip stocks, which means that more and more of a fund's money has to be concentrated on them, a series of mergers and acquisitions means that the spread of sectors in which these large United Kingdom firms is concentrated has also narrowed to only four: pharmaceuticals, oil, banking and telecommunications. If these companies and sectors perform well, so will the index and funds tracking it. But if one firm founders, the index and investor's portfolios will suffer. M&amp;G fund manager John Hatherly believes that marketing index trackers as low risk is dubious. \"That is very close to misleading,\" he says. \"They follow the market, so they can go down as well as up.\" He says that the tide is beginning to turn. \"While telecommunications was the second most popular sector last year, in the first two months of this year it slipped to seventh or eighth. Sectors emerging in popularity are engineering, media, leisure, construction and paper and packaging [all under-represented in the Footsie].\" Active funds which spot the trend can move out of these stocks before their performance slips away. Mark Bogard, managing director of Barclays offshoot b2, says: \"The FTSE 100 has performed well in the past but is more volatile. \" Some recommend switching to a fund tracking the FTSE All Share index, which represents around 827 quoted UK companies. Although this, too, is dominated by the top 100 companies, risk is spread more widely. Other funds track European and US indices. Actively-managed funds are an alternative, but these are more expensive. Active funds trade more often in an effort to outperform the market. In a mature market such as the UK's, however, it is extremely difficult to improve on the performance of indices. Investment houses have recognised this and some have limited the degree to which active managers can stray from their funds' corresponding indices. Tracker observers label this practice \"closet indexing\" or \"quasi-tracking\". They say that under these circumstances it is even more difficult to justify paying active managers' initial charges of 5 per cent or more and the average annual management fee of around 1.4 per cent. Others counter that the process is reasonable. \"If the Footsie is where the value is, it's hard to say whether it's closet indexing or just plain sensible,\" says Hatherly. It must be remembered that the two investment styles are not mutually exclusive. Barclays Global Investors UK Growth fund has its foot in both camps with an \"advanced active technique\" which combines \"an index approach with controlled active sector and stock tilts\". It aims to outperform the FTSE All Share by 2 per cent a year, a tall order given its higher than tracker annual charges. Managers believe that the long-suffering debate over active versus trackers has been put out of its misery. Michael Hayden, savings and investment director for Legal &amp; General, says: \"Investors with a portfolio should consider a low-cost index tracker for broad exposure to UK markets as the core of their portfolio, and satellite active investments in other markets or sectors such as smaller companies if they believe they are in for re-rating.\" For first-time or less experienced investors, the case for index trackers remains strong. Declining interest rates mean that returns from deposit-based savings are insignificant and many index trackers can hold investor's capital in a Pep or, from April 6, an ISA, enabling investors to benefit from tax-free income and growth. While trackers will perform slightly less well than the market because of management costs, investors will not be left with a dud."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"theguardian/1999/mar/20/features.jobsmoney18","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-20T04:05:48Z","webTitle":"What better than a wedding to cheer up the market?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/20/features.jobsmoney18","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/mar/20/features.jobsmoney18","fields":{"headline":"What better than a wedding to cheer up the market?","bodyText":"Europe, corporate bonds, trackers: the three themes that dominate most Pep decisions this year. Europe means performance, bonds bring income and trackers equal reliability and low cost. But it can be worthwhile looking for investment sectors that are not being heavily promoted. One area that few mention is UK Equity Growth - aiming at shares in significant companies which have good prospects of being worth more next year. Most of the target firms are among the biggest 100 or 150 on the London stock exchange. The incentive to invest comes from merger mania - as huge companies form mega-corporations. The United Kingdom petrol company BP recently tied the knot with fellow US oil giant Amoco; the drug group Zeneca is getting together with the Swedish pharmaceutical giant Astra, while Vodafone's marriage to the American telephone company AirTouch is also creating a new multi-billion stock market counter. Even small companies are getting the urge to merge. And the City loves it. Putting two and two together really does make five in share price terms. But the economics behind equity growth sector opportunities are finely balanced. Optimists say that shares are cheap, provided that interest rates continue falling to Euroland levels. They also believe that they are better value than bonds whose prices have been chased to unprecedented levels. Pessimists quote equity strategists such as brokers Salomon Smith Barney which reckons that the stock market's estimates of earnings growth this year and in 2000 \"remain on the high side despite the many downgrades that are coming through. And there are plenty more forecast reductions still to come as the domestic economy remains sluggish.\" Despite that gloomy crystal ball gazing, brokers believe that the Footsie index of top shares will hit 7,000 by the end of next year - and beat bonds and cash deposits in the bargain. What could tip the balance towards the optimists are Peps and ISAs. Although tax-free investments represent only a small slice of the £1,400 billion riding on the UK stock market, the £5 billion or so likely to go into UK shares is vital to maintaining the predominance of buyers over sellers. And Pep money tends to stick around - it must be maintained or moved to other funds. Cashing in will lose the tax freedom benefits forever. One obvious way into this hoped-for growth is via low-cost tracker funds. But one of the problems trackers face is that brighter active fund managers can try to predict their buying and selling, knowing that they must buy certain shares in a set ratio to their size. So the live fund managers try to outplay the computers by moving in ahead. At the same time, they can take bets in medium-sized companies that most trackers exclude. David Aaron of the eponymous financial advice firm goes for funds with a long-term record which have shown consistency of leadership such as Johnson Fry Slater Growth which has outperformed rivals with a mix of market leaders, especially in banking and pharmaceutical shares. ABN Amro's UK Growth trust is well rated by both Aaron and adviser firm Allenbridge. They like the fund's past performance, its heavy backing of in-favour telecoms shares in general and of Vodafone in particular and the experience of manager Nigel Thomas who has been running the fund since 1986. Many unit trust managers are now rotated with a frequency which would embarrass football clubs, so anyone with a long record of outperformance should be worth backing. Socgen UK Growth is a year old and has yet to make a mark. So far, it has undershot its growth target - two per cent over the FTSE All Share Index. But advisers give it the benefit of the doubt. They put their trust in manager Peter Seabrook and his record at Robert Fleming where he was chief UK investment officer. Jupiter UK Growth also has its fans. It offers exposure both to blue chip companies and smaller growth opportunities. It can be combined with other Jupiter funds for a wider growth perspective, a combination that has sent it to the top of discount adviser Chelsea Superstore's purchase list. Buying these funds through low-cost brokers brings their upfront charges down to tracker fund levels, although there will still be an annual fee of around 1.5 per cent. Going for growth means low or no income. It also means living with greater ups and downs than with a more income-oriented strategy. One of the most volatile is Exeter Capital Growth, which invests in the higher risk capital shares sub-division of split level investment trusts. This is a big bet on growth which has paid off so far but could go wrong, especially over any short period when the stock market falls. But analysts reckon that with yields falling elsewhere to low levels, investors will increasingly turn to growth stocks for their equity exposure - just as they do in Europe, Japan and the US. And as the dividend tax credit more than halves on UK shares, previous advantages of going for income and reinvesting for long-term growth diminish. The cost of union Watch out for schemes that offer \"to consolidate all your Peps under one roof\". The logic is that many investors now have plans with upwards of 10 management companies all of whom send out reports in different forms and at varying times of the year. Joining them altogether should enable investors to see what they have more easily - and also be able to spot which of their trusts are underperforming. But many of the consolidation deals on offer work well only for commission-chasing advisers. Any advantages to investors are swallowed up by costs. Investors have to fork out for an extra layer of charges to pay these commissions. Best Investment's Jason Hollands warns: \"Henderson has been promoting a transfer and consolidate scheme to IFAs as the 'greatest single sales opportunity currenty available' and boasting of average commissions of £567 to be made or £1,135 for a husband and wife sale. But nowhere do they explain the benefits to clients.\" Hollands, whose firm offers a no-cost portfolio advice service, reckons that the three most-marketed Pep consolidation services are all costly. He estimates that Skandia Multi-Pep will add 8.91 per cent to charges over five years while Lazard Active Transfer Pep clients will pay an additional 11.5 per cent. Henderson has the highest extra at 12.75 per cent. All of these charges lessen the chances of above-average performance. The odds against chart-topping figures from a multi-pep or a consolidation scheme can become even more remote as some schemes allow only a limited number of trusts. And once you are in one, escape can be both difficult and costly."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/20/audreygillan.libbybrooks","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-20T04:07:07Z","webTitle":"'I did not kill my friends the Jews'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/20/audreygillan.libbybrooks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/20/audreygillan.libbybrooks","fields":{"headline":"'I did not kill my friends the Jews'","bodyText":"A 78-year-old man yesterday stumbled into the dock of a British court to make legal history: the first alleged war criminal called to account for murders committed in eastern Europe more than 50 years ago. The dramatic evidence of Anthony Sawoniuk marked a pivotal point in the nation's approach to the Holocaust. Limping and using a walking cane for balance, the former British Rail worker got to the box, took the oath and denied killing any Jews. Crying and angrily wagging his finger around the room, he said it was a lie that he had shot 15 Jewish women in a forest and claimed it was another lie that he had killed three other people. Mr Sawoniuk, from Bermondsey, craned his ear towards his defence counsel, William Clegg, QC, as he boomed out questions to him. Asked whether he had any reason to hate the Jews, he said: 'I never hated the Jews. The Jews were my best friends. I was born next door to them. I grew up with them. I went to school with them. I have got nothing against the Jews. I have been accused by people who came to this country to tell lies. They should be locked up for lying.' As he shouted, Mr Sawoniuk pointed to where several prosecution witnesses had been sitting earlier in the trial. As he stabbed his finger towards the policemen sitting in the well of the coutroom, saying 'and them', he was told by his counsel to calm down. His voice still redolent of the place of his birth, Mr Sawoniuk was speaking shortly after he was cleared of two out of four murder charges. Mr Justice Potts instructed the jury to find him not guilty on two counts after deciding they could not make a safe conviction. The prosecution alleges that Mr Sawoniuk collaborated with the Nazis during the second world war, becoming a policeman and leading search-and-kill police squads to hunt down Jews escaping massacre. He denies charges of murdering Jews in his home town of Domachevo, Belarus, in 1942. Yesterday, he was cleared of murdering a Jew known as Schlemko and of murdering another Jew known as Mir Barlas. He still faces two charges that he murdered 15 Jewish women and shot two men and another woman. It is not alleged that Mr Sawoniuk, who has lived in Britain since the end of the war, took part in the massacre of nearly 3,000 Jews in Domachevo on Yom Kippur 1942. But the prosecution claims that he took part in round-up operations afterwards in which escaping Jews were hunted down and killed. Mr Sawoniuk told the jury that he was deaf in one ear, diabetic, that he had brain damage, heart disease and blood pressure. He had also received electric shocks at the Maudsley mental hospital. Asked why, he said: 'I don't know. Mental illness.' He denied looking for Jews who had survived the massacre on Yom Kippur. 'I never looked for any Jewish survivors ever,' he said. 'When I was in the ghetto by myself I was looking for clothes, shoes. I never looked for the Jews.' Asked by Mr Clegg if he had killed any Jews in the period following the massacre, he said: 'I never did and I never had the intention to do so.' Earlier, Mr Clegg had told the jury that Mr Sawoniuk's status in the war had been elevated in an attempt to exaggerate his importance in German-occupied Doma-chevo.He was just a boy of 20 or 21 who even the peasants described as poor. The jury had heard about Hitler and Himmler but that had nothing to do with the defendant. 'Do you think Hitler had got some hotline to a hut in Domachevo to discuss his policies with Sawoniuk? It's absurd. It's like comparing Churchill consulting Pike of Dad's Army. It's nothing to do with the real issue of the case.' Warning the jury not to try to achieve justice for victims of the Holocaust, he said: 'There can be no trial in our history that has been more emotive than this. It would not have been possible for anybody to have sat through this trial, be they lawyer or juror, and not to have been moved by accounts of the Holocaust in eastern Europe. It is enough to make anyone's blood run cold.' Urging the jury to put all of that in its proper place, he added: 'It happened. It's dreadful, awful. Something that happened in the war. It's not his fault that it happened.' Referring to the Yom Kippur massacre, he told the jury that no one has said he played any role in that. 'The terrible events of that day, the wailing and the crying and the gunfire, he is not accused of any part of it,' he said. Mr Clegg told them that his client had sat through the five weeks of the trial and had been desperate to get into the witness box to plead his innocence. He said that there was no evidence, other than the testimony of two witnesses, that Mr Sawoniuk had killed the 15 women and the other three people. A trip to the scene of the alleged crime only cast further doubt as to whether a witness could even see Mr Sawoniuk since he was further away than the length of a football pitch. 'It's important for you to decide whether you can feel sure that an incident did happen and whether you can then be sure Sawoniuk was there,' he said. 'Whatever else happened in the war, he never shot those ladies in the forest and he never shot those three people near the electricity sub-station. He is going to tell you that he is not guilty of each count on this indictment.' He told the jury that Mr Sawoniuk's had not been an easy life by any standards. Living in Belarussia 60 or 70 years ago. Mr Sawoniuk had no father, no breadwinner when he was a teenager. He was a man with no land and no job. 'He was effectively placed in a position where he had no real choice but to join the police,' he said. 'There was nothing else for him to do.'Mr Sawoniuk later claimed he joined the police because he was so poor and hungry and because he was told he would be taken to a German work camp if he did not. He admitted that he hated partisans and that he had fought and killed them as part of his duties. 'They tried to kill me so I kill them first,' he said. He explained that he had arrived in the United Kingdom by way of Scotland and had lived in Peckham for 30 years, then Bermondsey for 26. During that time, he had kept his past a secret even from two of his three wives because a friend had told him it would be best. He claimed that that was why he had lied to police about being married and he also denied being a policeman working for the Germans through fear of being deported. The case continues on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/22/3","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-22T05:30:29Z","webTitle":"International news in brief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/22/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/22/3","fields":{"headline":"International news in brief","bodyText":"Jordan's new king to make his wife queen King Abdullah of Jordan will give his wife Rania the title of queen and will allow his father's widow to retain the same title, but with fewer privileges, officials said yesterday.

Croat generals 'to be tried' An investigation by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague has recommended that three Croatian generals should be indicted for leading the army to summary executions, indiscriminate shelling of civilian populations and 'ethnic cleansing' during a 1995 assault on the Serbs, the New York Times reported. The indictments would be the first against Croatian army officers involved in the Balkan wars. The tribunal, set up by the United Nations in 1993, has indicted 83 people, most of them Serbs. 'During, and in the 100 days following the military offensive, at least 150 Serb civilians were summarily executed, and many hundreds disappeared,' the report says. It adds: 'In a widespread and systematic manner, Croatian troops committed murder and other inhumane acts upon and against Croatian Serbs.' The generals who commanded the military operation - Mirko Norac, Ante Gotovina, and Ivan Cermak - could be held accountable under international law. AP, New York.

I was travelling by train after having driven an employer's 470 horse power truck on an international journey.

In France, the diesel prices are approximately midway between those in Spain and the United Kingdom. It would take me about four hours to drive from Boston to Brighton in a 38-tonne truck.

But recent revelations about the exorbitant fees claimed by some QCs have led critics to question not just the cost, but whether 'silks' (as they are known, for their silk gowns) have any place in the legal system of the next millennium. Next month's reforms to speed up and streamline civil litigation, spearheaded by Lord Woolf, and the Access to Justice Bill, which goes to the Commons tomorrow, represent the biggest shake-up of the civil justice system since the 1800s. More than 100 MPs have signed a Commons motion calling on the Lord Chancellor 'to abolish the anachronistic distinction of Queen's Counsel which has no place in the 21st century legal system'. Can QCs operate in the public interest and not just at the public's expense? Double manning, theoretically abolished years ago, remains rife. QCs are now permitted to work alone, but still usually insist on a junior's assistance. This can jack up costs to levels that would make a premier league footballer blush. Why do we need Queen's Counsel when we don't need queen's accountants or plumbers? Silks flatter themselves that solicitors are guided by the tag when choosing barristers. In fact they rely on personal experience, recommendations from colleagues, observation of performance and, if necessary, 'good lawyer' guides, when putting clients' money at risk. Silks claim the title 'QC' equates to a certificate of excellence, a legal kitemark, a guarantee of high-quality advice and representation. But everyone in the law knows this to be nonsense. There are good, bad and indifferent QCs, as in every profession. How does the system measure up against accreditation arrangements in the real world? These feature objective criteria to define the standard of service expected, and a transparent assessment procedure with open testing of applicants. Often there are limits on the number of times an applicant can apply, and there may be probationary periods for new appointees. Applications are usually self-financing, with the cost of monitoring met by renewal fees. There are reappraisals and vigorous complaints procedures with sanctions including, for the worst cases, withdrawal of accreditation. Silks may argue that such arrangements could not possibly be suitable for them. But even judges are now subject to appraisal and training supervised by the Judicial Studies Board. Many silks draw all or most of their earnings from public funds - earning, in many cases, much more than judges. Yet there is no means of judging whether the client or taxpayer gets value for money. And, unlike doctors, if they botch a case, they are largely immune to being sued. Before I became an MP I was an assessor for the Law Society panel for specialist personal injury solicitors. Candidates for the panel pay its full cost through fees. They are judged against objective criteria of experience, knowledge and competence, with continuing education obligations and four-yearly reappraisal. Unsuccessful applicants are given written reasons and a right of appeal. How does the silk system compare? Selection is based on woolly and subjective criteria. Appointment by the Lord Chancellor is based on 'soundings': comments from judges, other QCs and leaders of the profession, perpetuating the old boy network. Despite the best endeavours of the Lord Chancellor, bias on grounds of race, sex and age are an inherent feature of the secretive spider's web behind the appointments system, a stepping stone to the judicial bench. There is no probationary period, despite the substantial changes a QC will see in his practice after appointment; no continuing education or reappraisal. Once appointed, a QC can practise indefinitely. But while he may have been highly competent at 45, will his skills be as sharp and up-to-date in his late 70s? The £80,000-a-year cost of choosing and appointing QCs is largely borne by the taxpayer. While successful applicants pay £150 a head, their earnings average £250,000 - before becoming QCs. Unsuccessful applicants - including the ones who continue to apply after 25 rejections - pay nothing, though the Bar is considering meeting this expense. I challenge the Bar Council and the Lord Chancellor's department to test my argument objectively against theirs. The United Kingdom Accreditation Service provides a national, unified service to 'kitemark' organisations which themselves undertake accreditation. UKAS accreditation means that the certifying body concerned has itself been independently assessed to agreed standards of competence and impartiality. So, submit yourselves and the QC system to UKAS, and see if it approves. I, for one, would be happy to put a wager on the outcome: a day's pay as an MP against a QC's daily brief fee. The fact is that the QC system is a hopelessly outdated sham. It must modernise or go. \u0095 Andrew Dismore, a solicitor, is Labour MP for Hendon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/mar/23/12","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-23T02:51:11Z","webTitle":"UK growth yields £1.5bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/mar/23/12","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/mar/23/12","fields":{"headline":"UK growth yields £1.5bn","bodyText":"An unexpected windfall to the City from last summer's financial meltdown helped keep the UK's current account in the black in 1998, despite a widening trade gap with the rest of the world. Record income from investment and trade in services outweighed the £20.6 billion shortfall on trade in goods, boosting the current account to a £1.5 billion surplus. Last year's result is £4.8 billion lower than the £6.3 billion surplus recorded in 1997, but it is the first time since the the oil-driven bonanza of the mid-1980s that Britain has recorded two consecutive surpluses, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday.The surplus on investment income rose to £6.8 billion in the last three months of 1998 after foreign-owned banks and oil companies repatriated lower profits as a result of last autumn's financial turbulence and lower oil prices. Analysts warned that most of the improvement in the current account figures was due to special factors. 'Once these one-off losses are chalked up we can expect a sharp deterioration in the deficit,' said John O'Sullivan at NatWest Markets. Despite posting a healthy trade surplus, output from the services sector was lower in the final three months of last year than originally believed, according to separate figures also released yesterday by the ONS. As a result, the statisticians now estimate that growth in the final three months of 1998 was just 0.1 per cent, against the previous estimate of 0.2 per cent growth. This is the slowest quarterly expansion since the spring of 1992, when the United Kingdom was still struggling to emerge from the ERM-inspired recession of the early 1990s. City analysts said the weaker growth figure boosted the chances that the Bank of England will lower the cost of borrowing at its meeting in early April. 'The economy virtually ground to a halt at the end of last year and that may nudge the Bank of England further towards a rate cut,' said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets. The overall estimate for growth in 1998 has also been revised down from 2.3 per cent to 2.1 per cent, which is below the long-term historic average. 'Growth is now estimated to have been sub-trend for the past year and these further downward revisions mean that the economy has, in effect, already 'soft-landed',' said Richard Iley, of ABN-AMRO. Manufacturing contracted by 1.3 per cent in the final quarter of the year and is 0.5 per cent lower than in the same period a year earlier. The services sector recorded its slowest quarterly expansion since the spring of 1995, growing by just 0.5 per cent over the quarter. The slowdown hit corporate profits which slumped by 2.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year. The worst affected were financial institutions which recorded a 36 per cent fall in their operating surplus, in the aftermath of the Russian debt default. Household incomes continued to rise as unemployment fell, but the gloomy economic news depressed spending causing consumers to save for a rainy day. The savings ratio rose to 7.4 per cent of GDP from 6.3 per cent in the previous quarter as a result. The ONS said record numbers of Britons made trips overseas as the strength of sterling made holidays abroad more attractive. Fifty million UK residents left British shores last year, a ten per cent increase over the 1997 total. Spending overseas by visitors increased by 15 per cent which ate into the surplus on trade in services."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/mar/23/guardianobituaries3","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-23T02:51:52Z","webTitle":"Sir Michael Caine obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/23/guardianobituaries3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/mar/23/guardianobituaries3","fields":{"headline":"Sir Michael Caine obituary","bodyText":"The former chairman of Booker, Sir Michael Caine, who has died aged 71, was a polymath of the charitable world, passionately committed to internationalism and to improving social conditions, and admired by the best writers in Britain.

He would go to the heart of an issue and deliver results. He chaired Booker, the food and agri-business company from 1979 to 1993, and was vice-chairman from 1973. He joined Booker McConnell in 1952, having been inspired by its then head Lord (Jock) Campbell. Caine chaired the management committee of the Booker Prize for fiction from the early 1970s until the mid-1990s. He read every single shortlisted book and looked beyond this country for intellectual replenishment. He also launched what was then the Russian Booker Prize. His business career after a spell with the British embassy in Washington had begun in Guyana. From 1955 to 1958, he headed Booker's retailing interests in Trinidad, Malawi and Guyana. He remained concerned that developing countries should be better understood in industrialised Europe and saw education as the key to everything. This made him an outstanding chairman of the United Kingdom Council For Overseas Student Affairs (1980-1993), and a wise counsellor during his period with the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (1987-1996). He organised and fund-raised for Africa 95, and when it was over, and the last play and painting had returned to Africa, he ensured that all the planning papers and relics were safely archived. Since 1995 Caine was chairman of the London-based Africa Centre's council of management, overseeing its funding campaign and ensuring that its prominence was strengthened with African leaders and with the business community. He was much involved with the Royal African Society. Recently, he was seeking a way in which more African students could come to Britain, and was also involved in trying to get African publications more widely distributed. His relationship with Guyana and its sugar industry continued throughout his business career. In 1976, he headed the Booker negotiations with the Guyanese which led to disinvestment Booker had been responsible for 25 per cent of the country's gross domestic product via its sugar plantations. Born in Hong Kong, Caine was the son of a colonial civil servant, Sir Sydney Caine, who later became director of the London School of Economics. He was educated at Bedales, Lincoln College, Oxford where his thesis was on slavery and secession in the United States and George Washington University in America. He was married first to Janice Mercer, by whom he had a son and a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1987. He then married Emma Nicholson, now Baroness Nicholson; she brought him great happiness and widened his political tolerance. Martyn Goff writes: Michael Caine's commitment to the Booker Prize was total and powerful. His decisiveness sometimes reached the level of mental bullying. He determined that no judge should serve twice, and that the shortlisted runners-up should not get compensatory awards. But he was as committed to standards as he was to these precepts. He never saw the prize as a narrow piece of sponsorship. What was he seeking? Only that he hoped that 'some winners would be A-level set books in 20 years' time'. Caine was not put off by setbacks. John Berger's rejection of half the prize money in 1972 for his winning book G as an attack on the company's colonial record did not deflect Caine from urging the continuation of the Prize when its first five-year stint came to an end. Caine was always keen that the management committee should be careful in its selection of judges. He was also adamant that the prize was not seeking to create bestsellers. 'If that were all we wanted,' he wrote, 'there would be no need of judges. The Jeffrey Archers would win.' \u0095 Sir Michael Harris Caine, businessman, born June 17, 1927; died March 20, 1999"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/mar/24/guardianobituaries3","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-24T03:26:25Z","webTitle":"Gladys Dimson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/24/guardianobituaries3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/mar/24/guardianobituaries3","fields":{"headline":"Gladys Dimson obituary","bodyText":"Gladys Dimson, who has died aged 83, was passionate about public housing and as the Greater London Council's chairman of housing, management (1973-77) looked after the biggest municipal housing stock in Europe. She was, according to Conservatives, 'part of the North London Socialist set' before the term 'Bollinger bolsheviks' had been invented. It is hard now to reconcile the social policies of the 1950s to 1970s with our own time. In 1951, for example, Winston Churchill ordered Harold Macmillan, Minister of Housing, to build 300,000 houses a year. Twenty years of public housing blossomed and County Hall was deeply involved. For a decade, Gladys was active with new and expanding towns' programmes and must also be credited with pioneering seaside homes for retiring working-class Londoners. She was born into a talented Jewish family in Glasgow. Her family voted Labour and talked endlessly about politics. Her brother became the financial guru of the Metal Box Company. Despite the antisemitism of those days, she progressed on the fast track - the Laurel Bank School ('We were pushed like mad to work'), Glasgow University for a year and then the London School of Economics. In 1936, she married Sam Dimson, a young doctor. They both threw their professional skills and political beliefs into London's impoverished East End. She immersed herself in voluntary social work, learned about desperate housing conditions and was drawn into the labyrinth of London's County Hall and its municipal socialism, with its vast housing empire. She was co-opted on to the London County Council's children's committee, joining the elite of women councillors in County Hall during the last decade of the life of the LCC. Among her contemporaries were Peggy Jay, who led the field in child care, Lady Helen Bentwich, a founder of Israel, Margaret Cole, wife of the formidable Fabian, and Evelyn Dennington, a renowned housing expert. This body of unstoppable Labour women were movers and shakers. Gladys accepted their tutelage with grace if not deference. In 1964 she was elected to the new Greater London Council (GLC), and when Labour gained control in 1973, she announced her ambition to run house building - that meant a minimum of 20,000 new homes a year - as well as management of housing estates. However, I had to tell her that we were going to divide this vast portfolio into two - into management and development. So Gladys had to share that particular kingdom with Richard Balfe, then secretary of the London Co-op Political Committee, now a grandee in the European Parliament. Her consolation prize was to have as her deputy and support system Ken Livingstone. They remained close until the GLC was abolished in 1986. In the general election of 1970 she stood in the north-west London Tory constituency of Hendon South. There was a large Jewish community there whose grandparents had started their journey to suburbia from the leftwing East End, but were now Conservative voters. After the political change in London - from Labour to Conservative - in 1977, she courted Lady Alma Birk about a possible peerage. Alma, with her Daily Mirror connections, had the ear of No.10, but the word never came. Gladys was resilient, and Lord Pitt nudged her towards work with Shelter, where she was on the board of management (1976-89), and then to complete the circle she went back to Stepney, to the famous settlement of Toynbee Hall. This was when John Profumo, the warden, was applying his superb organisational abilities to a complicated housing project. Gladys gave him enthusiastic support, which he warmly appreciated. She is survived by her daughter, Wendy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/24/balkans12","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-24T09:16:22Z","webTitle":"Prescott: 'Neither NATO nor the United Kingdom is waging war against the people of Yugoslavia'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/24/balkans12","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/24/balkans12","fields":{"headline":"Prescott: 'Neither NATO nor the United Kingdom is waging war against the people of Yugoslavia'","bodyText":"Earlier this evening, four British aircraft, together with missiles from the submarine HMS Splendid, attacked targets in the Federal republic of Yugoslavia as part of a co-ordinated NATO air strike. Two other aircraft flew supporting missions. Hon. Members may have heard the Prime Minister's remarks from Berlin earlier this evening, when he said \"I want to pay tribute, at the outset, to our forces. We owe a huge debt to them for their courage, and their professionalism. Tonight, there are families in Britain who will be feeling a real sense of anxiety. They can feel too a real sense of pride at the contribution their loved ones make to peace and stability in Europe.\" I am sure that the House will wish to join me in echoing those sentiments. The UK Harriers operated out of Gioia del Colle in Italy. In addition, attacks were mounted by seven United States Air Force B52 bombers from Fairford in Gloucestershire. The strike in which they participated was a very significant one, involving both air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles and manned aircraft from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and Spain. A number of other allied air forces flew supporting missions. The targets being attacked in this first phase were mainly elements of the Yugoslavian air defence system, but also included a number of Serbian military facilities related to the repression in Kosovo. The NATO military action, which has the full support of all 19 member states, is intended to support the political aims of the international community. It is justified as an exceptional measure to prevent an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. It is, and will continue to be, directed towards disrupting the violent attacks being committed by the Yugoslav army and the Serbian special police force and weakening their ability to continue their repressive strategy. Two United Nations Security Council resolutions, 1199 and 1203, underpin our actions. Both demanded that the Serbs cease all actions against the civilian population and withdraw the security units used for civilian repression. Milosevic has been in breach of every single part of those UN resolutions. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, a quarter of a million Kosovars, more than 10 per cent. of the population, are now homeless as a result of repression by Serb forces. Sixty five thousand people have been forced from their homes in the past month, and no less than 25,000 in the days since the peace talks broke down. Families are being uprooted and driven from their homes. There are disturbing reports of the destruction of whole villages. Over the past few days, we have all seen harrowing and unforgettable images on the television and in newspapers. The scenes are more reminiscent of the middle ages than of Europe on the eve of the 21st century. I would remind the House that the decision to initiate air strikes was taken last night only after it became clear that the final diplomatic effort in Belgrade had not with success and that all efforts to achieve a negotiated political solution to the Kosovo crisis had failed. Over the past year the international community, with Britain at the forefront, has made intensive efforts to Seek a peaceful solution. Milosevic has either rejected these approaches or entered into undertakings on which he has subsequently reneged, notably his blatant failure to observe the limits on army and special police numbers in Kosovo. Military force is now the only option. NATO's position is clear, and was set out in statement of 30 January. We seek to bring an end to the violence in order to avert a humanitarian catastrophe and support the completion of negotiations on an interim political settlement. Three demands were made at the time, all of Which Mr. Milosevic has so far rejected: he has not ended his use of excessive and disproportionate force in Kosovo; he has broken the undertaking that he gave last October to reduce Serb forces in Kosovo to pre-February 1998 levels; and he has so far refused to accept the interim political settlement that was negotiated at the peace talks in France earlier this year. Tonight the NATO alliance-19 nations of which 13 flew their aircraft tonight-has backed its words with action. It has hit hard and it will continue to hit hard until its military objectives are achieved. What happens next is up to Mr. Milosevic. It remains open to him to show at any time that he is ready to meet the demands of the international community. The demands are reasonable: they are an autonomous Kosovo within Serbia and an international military force to underpin the settlement. We hope that the Yugoslav people will understand that this is the only practical basis of moving forward without further bloodshed. I take this opportunity tonight to address a warning to those in the Yugoslav army and other forces who may be in receipt of orders to repress the Albanians in Kosovo: \"Do not assume that you can carry out such activity with impunity. You have a personal responsibility not to exceed the bounds of international law. You run the risk of being prosecuted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague if you do so.\" I also address the Kosovar Albanians: \"You have had the courage to commit yourselves to the path of peace. It is imperative that you remain committed to that approach and refrain from provocative actions in the days to come.\" Neither NATO nor the United Kingdom is waging war against the people of Yugoslavia. We will make every effort to avoid civilian casualties. Our objective is to reduce the human suffering and violence against the civilian population of Kosovo. We seek to bring to an end the human tragedy now unfolding. We know the risks of action and we salute the bravery of our service men and women who are undertaking these operations on our behalf. To the families of the brave men and women of our armed forces involved in this action- and indeed to the British people as a whole-I say this: we should remind ourselves that history has proved time and time again that standing up to aggression is the only way to stop such brutal leaders. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said to the house yesterday: \"If Kosovo was left to the mercy of Serbian repression. There is not merely a risk, but the probability of re-igniting unrest in Albania, of a destabilised Macedonia, of almost certain knock-on effects in Bosnia. and of further tension between Greece and Turkey. Strategic interests for the whole of Europe are at stake.\" -(Official Report, 23 March 1999; Vol. 328. c. 161) We, as fellow Europeans, cannot contemplate, on our own doorstep, a disintegration into chaos and disorder. This is indeed a grave moment. Those who have doubted NATO's resolve have been shown to be wrong. We are prepared to see this through. We do not expect that air attacks will lead to an instant end to the brutality in Kosovo-Yugoslavia has a substantial military machine and is under the control of a ruthless man. But our attacks will make it clear to the president and his security forces that if they continue to use excessive force in Kosovo, they will pay a very high price indeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/mar/25/features11.g28","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-25T03:41:02Z","webTitle":"The odd couple","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/25/features11.g28","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/mar/25/features11.g28","fields":{"headline":"The odd couple","bodyText":"The birthday girl must have been disappointed. Winnie Mandela had organised the party at her Soweto home for one of her young grandchildren. But in the midst of the celebrations, Winnie whipped off the gold and diamond wedding ring Nelson Mandela had slipped on her finger 41 years ago and gave it to a shy teenage white girl in the corner. Hardly anyone at the party knew who the 13 year-old was. But they recognised her father - Paul Erasmus, the apartheid security policeman whose job it once was to make Winnie's life hell. He shot up her home, blackened her name in the press and did his part to wreck her marriage. Some of the guests thought Winnie's gesture was a joke, or a stunt. Others saw it as the flamboyance of an unstable woman. But Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, as she calls herself since her divorce from South Africa's president, said the gift to Candice Erasmus was an act of reconciliation. To casual observers of the South African political scene, it seemed one of the more remarkable rapprochements of modern times. Here was a woman who for years had been one of the most high-profile and potent enemies of the apartheid regime embracing a man notorious for his murderous role in attempting to preserve it. It seemed extraordinary enough that the two might spend time in the same room. That Madikizela-Mandela should present him with a gift as laden with symbolism as the ring given to her by her former husband seemed to betoken a capacity for mercy bordering on the saintly. In fact, the gesture was merely the most conspicuous manifestation of a relationship that has confounded many of their friends for years. With a clear dividend for both parties, though, it is an alliance that is less difficult to explain than it seems. When Paul Erasmus went public in 1995 and confessed his role in trying to destroy Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, it offered her the chance to blame her failed marriage and conviction for the death of the young township activist, Stompie Seipei, on a government conspiracy. Erasmus willingly accepts the responsibility. In turn, Madikizela-Mandela offered Erasmus a chance to rehabilitate himself for the new South Africa, and shelter after he was thrown off the government's witness protection programme. Since then the improbable friendship appears to have flourished. Erasmus claims they see each other frequently to work on various projects from help for the disabled to business ventures he declines to discuss. They even teamed up to back a clinic offering a controversial treatment for Aids and other diseases in which the blood is oxygenated. Oxytherapy, as it's known, is banned in the US and several European countries but Madikizela-Mandela and Erasmus both see it as a miracle cure. 'We talk endlessly about the dirty tricks days,' Erasmus told the Guardian in a rare interview. 'I really like to think I've changed her perceptions a few degrees. Over the time I've spent with Winnie I've explained why we did what we did, what made us tick. I showed her police training manuals. She's fascinated about how we lived on the other side of the colour line. How we felt about blacks. The mindset we developed. We have fun because there are so many parallels.' Even so, the former secret policeman admits to having been dumfounded when Madikizela-Mandela made her extravagant gifts. 'It's an incredible irony that after all that's happened she should do this. It stunned me. I smashed her marriage and did her the most damage. She has forgiven me. She has made my kids part of her household. My son calls her \"granny\". But this I never expected,' he said. 'I tried to give the ring back afterwards and I was told by her aides that it would be an insult. The one thing about Winnie that's predictable is her unpredictability.' The relationship between Erasmus and Madikizela-Mandela is all the more remarkable when you consider the zeal with which he once set out to destroy her. Erasmus retains a perverse pride in the litany of torture, killings and 'dirty tricks' he confesses to. His security police unit launched its campaign against Winnie after the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990. President FW de Klerk's government claimed to be dealing with the newly unbanned African National Congress in good faith. But Erasmus says he was told on his training course that the unit had four years until elections to reduce the ANC 'to just another political party.' Erasmus was stationed with a security police unit on the Witwatersrand known as 'Stratcom'. Stratcom, or 'strategic communication', was a network directed by the State Security Council headed by de Klerk and designed to destabilise the black liberation movement through propaganda and dirty tricks. In an operation sanctioned by cabinet ministers through the upper levels of the security police, Erasmus bugged Winnie's home and intercepted her mail to glean information on her alleged infidelity, on the criminal activities of her Mandela United Football Club and on the death of teenage activist Stompie Seipei. This information was then fed as a mixture of fact and fiction to local and foreign media. Erasmus also tried to intimidate Madikizela-Mandela by shooting up her house with shotguns, and harassing friends and relatives. After he quit the police, Erasmus made public a memo marked 'top secret' documenting the international campaign. The memorandum, from Erasmus' unit to Major Johan Putter at security police headquarters in Pretoria, says that 'a veritable mass of material' was forwarded to the South African and international media in early 1991 'with the specific objective of using the Winnie Mandela 'saga' to discredit the ANC as a whole'. ] The document revealed that Stratcom had recruited 'an as yet unregistered source in the United Kingdom who has extensive media and political contacts throughout the world'. Erasmus identified the source as Dr Harvey Ward, former director-general of the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation and media adviser to the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith. Ward, who died in 1995, had moved to Glasgow and joined the Conservative Party. In May 1991, he leaked new accusations based on reports from the security police in Soweto - which characterised Mandela and her daughters as nymphomaniacs and drug users - to a 'wide variety of contacts in the media and political sphere in the UK', according to the memo. 'It is of cardinal importance and interest that all the [media] reports indicate that the information is perceived to have been leaked by elements within the ANC and it is clear that a vast amount of suspicion and conflict has resulted within the ranks of the ANC and most importantly within the executive,' the memo said. The document claims that Stratcom planted stories in British papers such as the Independent and the Sunday Times, and the American magazine Vanity Fair under the title How Bad is Winnie Mandela? The papers, it seems, were successfully taken in. Erasmus said Stratcom worked on the principal that anti-Winnie propaganda should be based on 70 per cent fact and 30 per cent fiction. 'You create a perception. Even when some of it can be disproved, since some of it is true people think all of it is true,' he said. As an example, Erasmus supplied a 'statement by Ionias Phiri of Alexandra township' - a forgery written by written by Erasmus and his colleagues and given to the media - which claimed that 'a few of us are aware that she [Winnie Mandela] has a drinking problem and prefers J&amp;B and White Horse whisky. What is not known so well is that Mandela no longer sleeps in her bedroom and does not have his meals with her when they are at home.' But Erasmus's anti-Winnie campaign was mild compared to some of what went before. The former security policeman has admitted to torture and murder. In one case he described the arrest in Namibia, which was then under South African rule, of a woman called Rosavita. She was allegedly the wife of a Swapo liberation movement activist. Erasmus detained the woman with her young child. When he didn't get the answers he wanted he resorted to a contraption the security police nicknamed Radio Moscow. It was an hand cranked electrical generator. 'I pointed my rifle at the child and told Johannes to start asking questions. Even he was impressed by this particular bit of savagery, judging by the smile on his face. We got answers, but not the ones we wanted,' Erasmus later wrote. 'Back at Oshakati, we reported to Colonel Meyer and then set about acquainting Rosavita with Radio Moscow. Ear lobes and mouth, armpit and toes, nipples and screams.' Erasmus quit the police in 1993, saying he was angry and disillusioned because his family had been 'victimised by a corrupt commanding officer'. The former security policeman said he was himself the target of a dirty tricks and disinformation campaign after he went public. He gave evidence to a government commission into covert security force activities, and was dispatched to Britain under a witness protection programme. But life in hiding proved difficult. 'It's very hard when your kids get up in the morning and ask, \"what name are we using today daddy?\",' he said. Erasmus's marriage collapsed. In 1994 he found himself back in South Africa. All he had was a disability pension. But he found a good friend in Winnie Madikizela-Mandela when he decided to tell all publicly. 'When I confessed she was crying, putting her arm around me and thanking me for my courage. It was a very emotional moment,' he said. Winnie regularly paraded Erasmus to speak up for her. He was the only witness to absolve Madikizela-Mandela at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He told the TRC that based on his investigations, Stompie Seipei had been murdered because he was an informer but Madikizela-Mandela knew nothing of it. The commission came to no firm conclusion. Erasmus counts himself among Winnie's closest friends. So close that his son, Dylan, who suffers from cerebral palsy, is forgiven the worst of transgressions. 'She is truly wonderful with my children. The children of a hated security policemen. She has accepted them as Africans. My son who doesn't know better sometimes calls black people \"kaffir\". It's a terrible insult. But Winnie understands. We have a laugh,' he said. It's doubtful Madikizela-Mandela views the relationship in quite the same way. Erasmus said Madikizela-Mandela was furious when a guest at the party told the papers about the gesture with the ring, and handed over a picture of her hugging the two Erasmus children which was spread across the front of a Johannesburg Sunday newspaper. The years since her conviction and divorce have not been the easiest for Madikizela-Mandela. She lost her post as Deputy Minister for Arts and Culture in her former husband's cabinet after repeated clashes with her minister, allegations of abuse of her parliamentary position and a trip to West Africa which Nelson Mandela told her not to make. Perhaps the most damning judgement came from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which concluded that while heroic during the long bitter years of her husband's imprisonment, she was also a tragic figure who had done immeasurable damage to her own reputation. Yet her gift for political survival is still flourishing. She remains president of the ANC Women's League despite determined opposition. In the most recent poll of ANC members on the list of candidates for parliament in June's election, Madikizela-Mandela came eighth. It was a demonstration of continuing support for her militancy among sections of the party faithful, particularly township youth. Yet her capacity for upset is never far from the surface. No sooner had she won a degree of bemused admiration from some whites for her gift of the wedding ring to Candice Erasmus than she offered a bizarre explanation for the persistent murders of white farmers in South Africa by saying they were killing each other in order to blame and discredit blacks. Ultimately, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela relationship with Paul Erasmus is symbiotic. She needs him to whitewash her responsibility for Stompie Seipei's murder, and to remind the outside world of the persecution she suffered. Erasmus needs Madikizela-Mandela to confirm that he is indeed a changed man. For now they still need each other. But times are changing in South Africa. Nelson Mandela is about to retire. Winnie is making clear her support for her old friend and Mandela's anointed successor, Thabo Mbeki, even to the point of publicly justifying some of his more conservative policies. The day may not be too far away when Winnie Madikizela-Mandela decides that having a former security policeman as a friend is not politically wise. Paul Erasmus is still deciding what to do with Nelson and Winnie Mandela's wedding ring. He might give it to a museum, if his daughter approves. Or he might hold it in trust for the day Candice gets married. But whatever happens to the ring he doesn't think it will help rebuild relations with his wife and family. They were wrecked not so much by what he did to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as a security policeman but for daring to apologise for it afterwards. 'This thing with Winnie has really divided my family and friends. It is very hard to make them understand she is not a monster. My ancestors are turning in their graves.'"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/25/davidpallister","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-25T03:41:16Z","webTitle":"Lords rule torture is extradition crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/25/davidpallister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/25/davidpallister","fields":{"headline":"Lords rule torture is extradition crime","bodyText":"Lord Browne-Wilkinson The most senior law lord, he was the first to allow the appeal on the narrow grounds that Pinochet did not enjoy immunity from charges of torture after 1988 when torture became an extraditable crime. The judge said the allegations against the general only included one act of torture after that date and two of conspiracy to torture. In setting out an outline of the law, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said in general a state only exercises criminal jurisdiction over offences which occur within its geographical boundaries. If a person who is alleged to have committed a crime in Spain is found in the United Kingdom, Spain can apply to extradite him under the Extradition Act of 1989. The most important requirement was that the conduct complained of must constitute a crime under the law both of Spain and of the United Kingdom. The judge said that since the Nazi atrocities and the Nuremberg trials, international law has recognised a number of offences as being international crimes. The most important was torture which is regulated by the International Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1984. Britain's obligations under the convention were incorporated in the Criminal Justice Act of 1988. That act came into force on September 29, 1988. As required by the convention 'all' torture wherever committed world-wide was made criminal under UK law and triable in Britain. The law, however, was not retrospective and the first question to be answered was whether or not the definition of an 'extradition crime' requires the conduct to be criminal under UK law at the date of commission or only at the date of extradition. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said he did not consider torture committed outside of the UK before September 1988 was a crime under British law. 'In my view, there is certain conduct of Senator Pinochet (albeit a small amount) which does constitute an extradition crime and would enable the Home Secretary (if he thought fit) to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain unless he is entitled to state immunity,' he said. The judge said there was no real dispute that during the period of the Pinochet regime 'appalling acts of barbarism were committed in Chile and elsewhere in the world: torture, murder and the unexplained disappearance of individuals, all on a large scale. Although it is not alleged that Senator Pinochet himself committed any of those acts, it is alleged that they were done in pursuance of a conspiracy to which he was a party, at his instigation and with his knowledge.' Lord Browne-Wilkinson said it was not the job of the court to reach a decision on the grounds of personal preference or political inclination. 'Our job is to decide two questions of law: are there any extradition crimes and, if so, is Senator Pinochet immune from trial for committing those crimes.' The judge said under English law it was clear that charges of torture could only be brought if the acts of torture were criminal at the time they were committed. So acts of torture before 1988 are not extraditable. The only charge of hostage taking could also not be caught under the Taking of Hostages Act of 1982. The judge explained: 'The statutory offence consists of taking and detaining a person (the hostage), so as to compel someone who is not the hostage to do or abstain from doing some act. But the only conduct relating to hostages which is charged alleges that the person detained (the so-called hostage) was to be forced to do something by reason of threats to injure other non-hostages which is the exact converse of the offence. The hostage charges therefore are bad and do not constitute extradition crimes.' Turning to the development of the modern law of torture, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said that since the Nuremberg Tribunal the concept of personal liability for a crime in international law must have been part of international law. 'In the early years state torture was one of the elements of a war crime. In consequence torture, and various other crimes against humanity, were linked to war or at least to hostilities of some kind. But in the course of time this linkage with war fell away and torture, divorced from war or hostilities, became an international crime on its own.' Because of the importance placed on the prohibition of torture, states could assume universal jurisdiction over torture wherever it is committed. 'It was suggested by Miss Montgomery, for Senator Pinochet, that although torture was contrary to international law it was not strictly an international crime in the highest sense. I have no doubt that long before the Torture Convention of 1984 state torture was an international crime in the highest sense.' The convention was agreed, the judge said, 'not in order to create an international crime which had not previously existed but to provide an international system under which the international criminal the torturer could find no safe haven.' Under the convention torture can only be committed by a 'public official', which includes a head of state. The question of whether Pinochet enjoyed state immunity was of 'considerable general importance internationally It will be the first time so far as counsel have discovered when a local domestic court has refused to afford immunity to a head of state or former head of state on the grounds that there can be no immunity against prosecution for certain international crimes. 'Given the importance of the point, it is surprising how narrow is the area of dispute. The issue is whether international law grants state immunity in relation to the international crime of torture and, if so, whether Chile is entitled to claim such immunity even though Chile, Spain and the UK are all parties to the Torture Convention and therefore contractually bound to give effect to its provisions from December 8, 1988 at the latest.' The judge said it was a basic principle of international law that a head of state enjoyed immunity from prosecution by another state. 'The question then which has to be answered is whether the alleged organisation of state torture by Senator Pinochet (if proved) would constitute an act committed by Senator Pinochet as part of his official functions as head of state. I believe there to be strong ground for saying the implementation of torture as defined by the Torture Convention cannot be a state function. How can it be for international law purposes an official function to do something which international law itself prohibits and criminalises? Yet, if the former head of state has immunity, the man most responsible will escape liability while his inferiors (the chiefs of police, junior army officers) who carried out his orders will be liable. I find it impossible to accept this was the intention. 'In my judgment all these factors together demonstrate that the notion of continued immunity for ex-heads of state is inconsistent with the provisions of the Torture Convention. 'As to the charges of murder and conspiracy to murder, no one has advanced any reason why the ordinary rules of immunity should not apply and Senator Pinochet is entitled to such immunity.' Lord Goff The only judge to dismiss the appeal, Lord Goff said he rejected the reasoning of the three law lords who last year decided Pinochet did not enjoy absolute immunity. He argued former heads of state enjoyed immunity even after leaving office for acts done when they were in power.He said that the essential purpose of the Torture Convention of 1984 was 'to ensure that a torturer does not escape the consequences of his act by going to another country.' But he pointed out the convention did not address the problem of whether states could waive immunity for their public officials. He suggested this was deliberately left open. If immunity was excluded, 'former heads of state and senior public officials would have to think twice about travelling abroad, for fear of being the subject of unfounded allegations emanating from states of a different political persuasion. In this connection, it is a mistake to assume that state parties to the Convention would only wish to preserve state immunity in cases of torture in order to shield public officials guilty of torture from prosecution elsewhere in the world. Such an assumption is based on a misunderstanding of the nature and function of state immunity, which is a rule of international law restraining one sovereign state from sitting in judgment on the sovereign behaviour of another. 'Preservation of state immunity is therefore a matter of particular importance to powerful countries whose heads of state perform an executive role, and who may therefore be regarded as possible targets by governments of states which, for deeply felt political reasons, deplore their actions while in office. 'I am of the opinion that in 1989 there was no settled practice that state immunity was not available in criminal proceedings before a national court concerned with an alleged crime against humanity, or indeed as to what constituted a crime against humanity.' He concluded: 'By far the greater part of the charges against Senator Pinochet must be excluded... and that, in respect of the surviving charges Senator Pinochet is entitled to the benefit of state immunity ratione materiae as a former head of state.' Lord Hope Lord Hope, Scotland's senior judge, said the crimes alleged by Spain 'are murder on such a scale as to amount to genocide and terrorism, including torture and hostage-taking'. 'Senator Pinochet was party to a conspiracy to commit the crimes of murder, torture and hostage-taking, and this conspiracy was formed before the coup. He is said to have agreed with other military figures that they would take over the functions of government and subdue all opposition to their control of it by capturing and torturing those who opposed them, who might oppose them or who might be thought by others to be likely to oppose them. The purpose of this campaign of torture was not just to inflict pain. Some of those who were to be tortured were to be released, to spread words of the steps that would be taken against those who opposed the conspirators. Many of those who were to be tortured were to be subjected to various other forms of atrocity, and some of them were be killed. The plan was to be executed in Chile and several other countries. 'When the plan was put into effect victims are said to have been abducted, tortured and murdered pursuant to the conspiracy. This was done first in Chile, and then in other countries in South America, in the United States and in Europe. Many of the acts evidencing the conspiracy are said to have been committed in Chile before September 11, 1973. Some people were tortured at a naval base in August 1973. Large numbers of persons were abducted, tortured and murdered on September11, 1973 in the course of the coup before the junta took control and Senator Pinochet was appointed its president. These acts continued during the days and weeks after the coup. A period of repression ensued, which is said to have been at its most intense in 1973 and 1974. The conspiracy is said to have continued for several years thereafter, but to have declined in intensity during the decade before Senator Pinochet retired as head of state on March 11, 1990.' He agreed with Lord Browne-Wilkinson that the alleged acts of torture can only be punishable in the UK if they were illegal when they took place. Lord Hope also rejected the allegation that Pinochet was guilty of hostage taking under the meaning of the Taking of Hostages Act. He said: 'Charge 3 of the draft charges, which is the only charge which alleges conspiracy to take hostages, states that the course of conduct... was to include the abduction and torture of persons as part of a campaign to terrify and subdue those who were disposed to criticise or oppose Senator Pinochet or his fellow conspirators. Those who were not detained were to be intimidated, through the accounts of survivors and by rumour, by fear that they might suffer the same fate. Those who had been detained were to be compelled to divulge information to the conspirators by the threatened injury and detention of others known to the abducted persons by the conspirators. 'But there is no allegation that the conspiracy was to threaten to kill, injure or detain those who were being detained in order to compel others to do or to abstain from doing any act. The narrative shows that the alleged conspiracy was to subject persons already detained to threats that others would be taken and that they also would be tortured. This does not seem to me to amount to a conspiracy to take hostages within the meaning of section 1 of the Act of 1982. The purpose of the proposed conduct, as regards the detained persons, was to subject them to what can best be described as a form of mental torture.' On the torture charges Lord Hope said 'the courts of this country could try Senator Pinochet for acts of torture in Chile and elsewhere after September 29, 1988, because they are extra-territorial offences under section 134 of the act of 1988. They could also try him here for conspiring in Chile or elsewhere after that date to commit torture, wherever the torture was to be committed, because torture after that date is an extra-territorial offence and the courts in England have jurisdiction over such a conspiracy at common law.' But acts before that date are not extradictable. The effect was to remove from the proceedings the entire course of such conduct in which Pinochet is said to have engaged from the moment he embarked on the alleged conspiracy to torture in January 1972 until September 29, 1988. Lord Hope said a head of state's immunity could be cut down by an international convention and he considered the Torture Convention deprived Pinochet of his immunity when Chile ratified on October 30, 1988. The judge concluded by saying the Home Secretary would have to reconsider whether to proceed with the extradition given the drastic reduction of extraditable charges. If the case goes on, Lord Hope said the magistrate would also have to consider whether the narrow charges constituted a conspiracy to commit systematic torture. Lord Hutton Lord Hutton agreed with Lord Browne-Wilkinson about the date of the commission of a crime and that Pinochet was entitled to immunity on the charges of murder and conspiracy to murder. The crucial question was whether Pinochet ordered torture as a function of head of state. 'It is clear that the acts of torture which Senator Pinochet is alleged to have committed were not acts carried out in his private capacity for his personal gratification.' Lord Hutton concluded: 'I consider that a single act of torture carried out or instigated by a public official or other person acting in a official capacity constitutes a crime against international law, and that torture does not become an international crime only when it is committed or instigated on a large scale. Accordingly I am of opinion that Senator Pinochet cannot claim that a single act of torture or a small number of acts of torture carried out by him did not constitute international crimes and did not constitute acts committed outside the ambit of his functions as head of state.' Lord Saville Lord Saville took the view that Pinochet was 'a prime example of an official torturer'. But he lost his immunity in December 1988 when Chile, Spain and Britain had all signed the Torture Convention. 'So far as these countries at least are concerned it seems to me that from that date these state parties are in agreement with each other that the immunity ratione materiae of their former heads of state cannot be claimed in cases of alleged official torture. 'If there were states that wished to preserve such immunity in the face of universal condemnation of official torture, it is perhaps not surprising that they kept quiet about it.' Lord Millett Lord Millett gave the strongest endorsement of the Spanish request by arguing that international law was developiong to such an extent that Pinochet should be extradited on the wider charges. He said: 'In future those who commit atrocities against civilian populations must expect to be called to account if fundamental human rights are to be properly protected. In this context, the exalted rank of the accused can afford no defence.\" He added: 'In my opinion, the systematic use of torture on a large scale and as an instrument of state policy had joined piracy, war crimes and crimes against peace as an international crime of universal jurisdiction well before 1984. I consider that it had done so by 1973. For my own part, therefore, I would hold that the courts of this country already possessed extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of torture and conspiracy to torture on the scale of the charges in the present case and did not require the authority of statute to exercise it.' The judge said that Chile insisted on the exclusive right to prosecute. But the Torture Convention only gave Chile the primary right. 'If it does not seek his extradition (and it does not) then the UK is obliged to extradite him to another requesting state or prosecute him itself.' He said: 'I would allow the appeal in respect of the charges relating to the offences in Spain and to torture and conspiracy to torture wherever and whenever carried out. But the majority of your Lordships think otherwise, and consider that Senator Pinochet can be extradited only in respect of a very limited number of charges. This will transform the position from that which the Secretary of State considered last December. It will be incumbent on the Secretary of State to reconsider the matter in the light of the very different circumstances which now prevail. Lord Phillips addressed the development of international law. He said: said: 'International law is on the move and the move has been effected by express consensus recorded in or reflected by a considerable number of international instruments. Since the Second World War states have recognised that not all criminal conduct can be left to be dealt with as a domestic matter by the laws and the courts of the territories in which such conduct occurs. There are some categories of crime of such gravity that they shock the consciousness of mankind and cannot be tolerated by the international community. Any individual who commits such a crime offends against international law. The nature of these crimes is such that they are likely to involve the concerted conduct of many and liable to involve the complicity of the officials of the state in which they occur, if not of the state itself. In these circumstances it is desirable that jurisdiction should exist to prosecute individuals for such conduct outside the territory in which such conduct occurs.' 'If Senator Pinochet behaved as Spain alleged, then the entirety of his conduct was a violation of the norms of international law. He can have no immunity against prosecution for any crime that formed part of that campaign. 'He said it was 'not surprising that Senator Pinochet and the Chile have been unable to point to any body of judicial precedent which supports the proposition that a former head of state can establish immunity from criminal process on the ground that the crime was committed in the course of performing official functions.' He concluded that international law overrode UK law on state immunity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/25/pinochet.chile5","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-25T03:42:59Z","webTitle":"Lords rule torture is extradition crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/25/pinochet.chile5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/25/pinochet.chile5","fields":{"headline":"Lords rule torture is extradition crime","bodyText":"Lord Browne-Wilkinson The most senior law lord, he was the first to allow the appeal on the narrow grounds that Pinochet did not enjoy immunity from charges of torture after 1988 when torture became an extraditable crime. The judge said the allegations against the general only included one act of torture after that date and two of conspiracy to torture. In setting out an outline of the law, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said in general a state only exercises criminal jurisdiction over offences which occur within its geographical boundaries. If a person who is alleged to have committed a crime in Spain is found in the United Kingdom, Spain can apply to extradite him under the Extradition Act of 1989. The most important requirement was that the conduct complained of must constitute a crime under the law both of Spain and of the United Kingdom. The judge said that since the Nazi atrocities and the Nuremberg trials, international law has recognised a number of offences as being international crimes. The most important was torture which is regulated by the International Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1984. Britain's obligations under the convention were incorporated in the Criminal Justice Act of 1988. That act came into force on September 29, 1988. As required by the convention 'all' torture wherever committed world-wide was made criminal under UK law and triable in Britain. The law, however, was not retrospective and the first question to be answered was whether or not the definition of an 'extradition crime' requires the conduct to be criminal under UK law at the date of commission or only at the date of extradition. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said he did not consider torture committed outside of the UK before September 1988 was a crime under British law. 'In my view, there is certain conduct of Senator Pinochet (albeit a small amount) which does constitute an extradition crime and would enable the Home Secretary (if he thought fit) to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain unless he is entitled to state immunity,' he said. The judge said there was no real dispute that during the period of the Pinochet regime 'appalling acts of barbarism were committed in Chile and elsewhere in the world: torture, murder and the unexplained disappearance of individuals, all on a large scale. Although it is not alleged that Senator Pinochet himself committed any of those acts, it is alleged that they were done in pursuance of a conspiracy to which he was a party, at his instigation and with his knowledge.' Lord Browne-Wilkinson said it was not the job of the court to reach a decision on the grounds of personal preference or political inclination. 'Our job is to decide two questions of law: are there any extradition crimes and, if so, is Senator Pinochet immune from trial for committing those crimes.' The judge said under English law it was clear that charges of torture could only be brought if the acts of torture were criminal at the time they were committed. So acts of torture before 1988 are not extraditable. The only charge of hostage taking could also not be caught under the Taking of Hostages Act of 1982. The judge explained: 'The statutory offence consists of taking and detaining a person (the hostage), so as to compel someone who is not the hostage to do or abstain from doing some act. But the only conduct relating to hostages which is charged alleges that the person detained (the so-called hostage) was to be forced to do something by reason of threats to injure other non-hostages which is the exact converse of the offence. The hostage charges therefore are bad and do not constitute extradition crimes.' Turning to the development of the modern law of torture, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said that since the Nuremberg Tribunal the concept of personal liability for a crime in international law must have been part of international law. 'In the early years state torture was one of the elements of a war crime. In consequence torture, and various other crimes against humanity, were linked to war or at least to hostilities of some kind. But in the course of time this linkage with war fell away and torture, divorced from war or hostilities, became an international crime on its own.' Because of the importance placed on the prohibition of torture, states could assume universal jurisdiction over torture wherever it is committed. 'It was suggested by Miss Montgomery, for Senator Pinochet, that although torture was contrary to international law it was not strictly an international crime in the highest sense. I have no doubt that long before the Torture Convention of 1984 state torture was an international crime in the highest sense.' The convention was agreed, the judge said, 'not in order to create an international crime which had not previously existed but to provide an international system under which the international criminal the torturer could find no safe haven.' Under the convention torture can only be committed by a 'public official', which includes a head of state. The question of whether Pinochet enjoyed state immunity was of 'considerable general importance internationally It will be the first time so far as counsel have discovered when a local domestic court has refused to afford immunity to a head of state or former head of state on the grounds that there can be no immunity against prosecution for certain international crimes. 'Given the importance of the point, it is surprising how narrow is the area of dispute. The issue is whether international law grants state immunity in relation to the international crime of torture and, if so, whether Chile is entitled to claim such immunity even though Chile, Spain and the UK are all parties to the Torture Convention and therefore contractually bound to give effect to its provisions from December 8, 1988 at the latest.' The judge said it was a basic principle of international law that a head of state enjoyed immunity from prosecution by another state. 'The question then which has to be answered is whether the alleged organisation of state torture by Senator Pinochet (if proved) would constitute an act committed by Senator Pinochet as part of his official functions as head of state. I believe there to be strong ground for saying the implementation of torture as defined by the Torture Convention cannot be a state function.

The offensive action, which involved sea and airlaunched cruise missiles as well as manned aircraft from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada and Spain, was supported by a number of other allied air forces flying essential fighter cover, air refuelling and defence suppression missions. A total of 13 Nato air forces were involved. All Nato aircraft returned safely to their bases after their missions had been completed. The first targets, which were mainly facilities associated with the Yugoslavian air defence system, were hit just after 7 o'clock. Assets used included air-launched cruise missiles, fired by US B-52 aircraft, which had taken off from RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire earlier in the day, and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles fired by USN ships and, for the first time, by HMS Splendid. Follow-on attacks were conducted by manned tactical aircraft, including RAF Harrier GR-7s, based in southern Italy, using Paveway 2 Laser Guided Bombs. Other targets included facilities associated with military units directly involved in aggression within Kosovo. The map shows the location of the UK Tomahawk and Harrier GR-7 targets. Turning to the detail of the UK involvement, HMS Splendid fired its Tomahawk missiles against a key military radar facility located near Pristina airfield in Kosovo. This facility, comprising 2 highly capable air defence radars and an associated control building, was capable of providing extensive data to Yugoslavian air defence forces - fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missile units and anti-aircraft artillery. The control centre was also capable of correlating data from a number of subordinate radars and distributing this throughout the national air defence network for use by other units and to help build up the national air picture. Clearly, such a capability posed a serious threat to Nato manned aircraft and it was vital, therefore, that it was put out of action. Just over an hour after the first cruise missiles impacted on their targets, 6 RAF Harriers were tasked to attack an ammunition storage facility just a few miles to the east of the Tomahawk target. Four of the aircraft were armed with two Paveway 2 1000lb laser guided bombs - the type used extensively and with considerable success during Operation Desert Fox - whilst the other two acted as escorts. The bombers were tasked against explosive and ammunition storage buildings within a Yugoslavian military ammunition storage facility which was known to support the Ministry of the Interior Police, who have been at the forefront of repressive actions against the Kosovar Albanian population. This type of facility contributes significantly to the Serbian security forces repressive capability. It is too soon to give any results of the UK attacks. I can tell you, however, that HMS Splendid successfully launched its TLAM missiles. We do not yet have any detailed imagery of the targets, and it will probably take some time for Nato to conduct a full Battle Damage Assessment exercise. The Harriers formed the third wave of a very concentrated attack on that target. Because of explosions, fire and smoke caused by the first two waves, our Harriers had difficulty seeing and maintaining lock on their targets. Bombs from our first aircraft lost lock once they were in flight and fell short of the target on open ground. As a result, the following Harriers aborted their attack and returned to base with their weapons. This restraint and discipline underlines our determination to avoid collateral damage and civilian casualties. Overall, SACEUR - to whom I have spoken this morning - is satisfied with the results achieved so far, although he recognises there is still much to be done. We are of course very relieved that all Nato aircraft have returned safely to base. There were some air encounters between Nato and Yugoslavian aircraft last night. Some reports suggest that up to 4 Yugoslavian aircraft (MIG 29) were shot down. Last night's action was of course only the opening salvo, the first step towards Nato achieving its military objectives. Our forces are likely to be in action again, alongside our allies, and we are ready to continue these efforts for some time to come. We are dealing with a ruthless dictator who appears to be ready to accept a certain amount of military damage by Nato in order to pursue his brutal repression. He should be under no illusions of our resolve and that we are ready to continue for as long as is necessary to stop his totally unacceptable repression. As we continue with our attacks, however. it is vital that we keep our military objectives clearly in view. We have not set ourselves the task of defeating the Yugoslavian army. We are engaged in an effort to reduce Milosevic's repressive capability and we will achieve that. We have no intention of sending ground forces into Kosovo except with the agreement of both Parties. This is a limited military action with a strictly humanitarian objective, which we believe we can achieve through air strikes. We do not think it would be right to escalate this into a major ground invasion, in which many lives may be lost and the humanitarian crisis could be made worse. Before closing, I should like to say a word about force protection. We have, as you know, some 4,500 British troops in Macedonia. Some were sent there originally to be ready to extract our peace monitors in an emergency. The majority, however, were sent there to be ready to take part in a Nato led implementation force should the Rambouillet peace accords be signed by both sides. All of these forces, and those of other allies, are now under the operational control of General Sir Mike Jackson, the British commander of Nato's Rapid Reaction Corps. Under SACEUR, General Jackson has put in place contingency plans to respond to any attack upon Nato forces in Macedonia. He has confirmed to me this morning that this planning is complete. Similar contingency arrangements have been made for Nato forces elsewhere in the region. Any attack on our forces would meet with a swift and severe response in self defence. There should be no misunderstanding about that in Belgrade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/25/balkans11","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-25T13:24:34Z","webTitle":"Briefing: Defence Secretary George Robertson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/25/balkans11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/25/balkans11","fields":{"headline":"Briefing: Defence Secretary George Robertson","bodyText":"Over the past year, the international community, with Britain at the forefront, has made intensive efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Kosovo. President Milosevic has either rebuffed the approaches or made deals he has reneged on. The result, as we have all seen, has been a developing humanitarian catastrophe in which Yugoslav and Serb security forces are destroying whole villages and making tens of thousands homeless. Only yesterday before we had to embark on air strikes the Ministry of Interior Special Police were reported to be razing villages in central Kosovo in the areas around Poclujevo, Srbica and Komorane. The diplomatic track came to an end on Tuesday this week, when Ambassador Holbrooke had a final, unsuccessful, meeting with Milosevic. Throughout this period Nato has been supporting these initiatives. Because it was only the credible threat of military force which led to the agreements last October which Milosevic ultimately failed to observe. Seven weeks ago on 30 January this year the North Atlantic Council reaffirmed its readiness to take action and passed to Nato Secretary General Javier Solana the power to order air strikes against targets in FRY territory in order to underpin international efforts to bring about a resolution. On Tuesday of this week, following the failure of two rounds of talks in France, and after a final round of consultations, and with great reluctance, he directed SACEUR to begin operations. The military objective of these operations is clear cut. It is to avert an impending humanitarian catastrophe by disrupting the violent attacks currently being carried out by the Yugoslav security forces against the Kosovar Albanians and to limit their ability to conduct such repression in the future. This action is supported by all 19 Nato states, 13 of which have planes and support assets committed to the operation. Last night the air forces of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States were all involved in the Allied military action. We are in no doubt that Nato is acting within international law. Our legal justification rests upon the accepted principle that force may be used in extreme circumstances to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Nato's action has received support from Canada, Britain, France, Argentina, Slovenia, Malaysia, Gambia, Bahrain, Netherlands, Gabon, Albania, Bosnia and Japan. It was opposed by only China, Russia, Namibia, India and understandably Belarus and the former Republic of Yugoslavia. We believe that military return is clearly justified in the circumstances of Kosovo, given the undisputed humanitarian emergency and the rejection by Milosevic of all diplomatic efforts. Yesterday the time came for Nato to act, in a clear and determined way. If yesterday Milosevic still doubted the Alliance's resolve, he now has, in the damage to his military machine, the evidence of our determination to take action to avert a human tragedy in Kosovo. Milosevic should, even at this late stage think again, stop the violence in Kosovo, withdraw his troops and sign the peace accord. Let me make it clear, that we have the will, the determination and the stomach to see this through and to stop the flow of blood and human misery in Kosovo. So let Mr Milosevic understand this, we will be watching now how he behaves. British and Allied aircraft will resume their attacks later today unless he stops the violence against the Kosovar population. The decision to use force was not taken lightly. We are well aware of the considerable risks, and we salute the bravery of our servicemen and women who are undertaking these operations on our behalf. But we will not stand idly by and watch a tragedy continue to unfold in our own continent, a tragedy which could all too easily lead to a wider conflict. Last night, Nato backed its words with actions. We hit hard and we shall continue to hit hard until our military objectives are achieved. The Chief of the Defence Staff will shortly say more about the UK's role in last nights operations. Briefly, six British Harriers, operating out of Gioia del Colle in Italy, took part in the attack, as did HMS splendid with its Cruise missiles, the first ever British Cruise missile fired in anger. Seven USAF B52 bombers from Fairford in Gloucestershire also participated in the mission, as did aircraft from the 11 other allies I have already mentioned. I am pleased to say that all allied aircraft returned safely. This first round of strikes concentrated mainly but not exclusively on Yugoslav air defence systems, thus paving the way for attacks on further targets associated with Belgrade's capability for repression in Kosovo. What happens next is up to Mr Milosevic. It remains open to him to show at any time that he is ready to meet the demands of the international community. Those demands are reasonable and in his country's best interest. We hope that the Yugoslav people will understand that this is the only practical and humanitarian basis of moving forward without further bloodshed. We do not expect the air attacks to lead to an instant end to the brutality 'in Kosovo. We know that Yugoslavia has a substantial military machine but Nato is prepared to see this through until our military objectives have been achieved. Our attacks will make it clear to President Milosevic and his security forces that he and they will pay a very high price for the continued use of excessive force in Kosovo. I understand that Nato will give a briefing later today on the overall pattern of last night's actions. It will clearly be some time before staff in Brussels can assemble a complete picture of the damage caused by our strikes. However, I will now ask the Chief of the Defence Staff to speak about the British aspects of last night's operations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/mar/27/weekend.davidmckie","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-27T02:47:03Z","webTitle":"House of cards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/mar/27/weekend.davidmckie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/mar/27/weekend.davidmckie","fields":{"headline":"House of cards","bodyText":"The House of Lords, as seen from the gallery, has always made me think of a very superior brothel. Ridiculous, of course: for one thing, most of the clients look far too old, and far too many men are present, compared to women. But otherwise: all that red plush, all that shimmering opulence, all that lolling about (for, while some sit impeccably upright, others recline, and those entitled to do so disport themselves on the steps of the throne). The other day, one of the Sunday supplements published a series of photographs of upmarket brothels in Paris at the turn of the century: with their gilt and elegant lights and decorated panelling, they could almost have been the work of Pugin and Barry. Of course, this isn't - except to its critics, and purely in the political sense - a house of ill-repute... Yet it is a house of seduction. How many old sweats have gone there over the years from the Labour benches in the Commons, grumbling as they did so at being asked to swell the ranks of a place they'd theoretically hated ever since they first scented politics (however much, as they confided to friends, the wife was thrilled by the prospect of becoming Lady Whoever)? A bastion of upper-class privilege: that was their view; a conspiracy against democracy; shut it down. But then the sweet envelopment - all those servitors hurrying to help you, to take your coat and hat, to show you the way to the bars and the restaurants, to guide you through the intricacies of procedure, as ready with \"milords\" and \"miladies\" as if you were the Duke of Omnium, not plain Joe Bloke from Rotherham. And all those terrifying hereditary peers, with names that you read about long ago in schoolroom history books, whose ancestors fought at Agincourt: what a surprise! So many of them, apparently the perfection of friendliness, with none of the swagger and arrogance and the condescension you might have expected! (For even when the condescension is there, when it comes from true patricians it tends to be subtle and well disguised.) Their presence, even while you cling to the view that they should have been booted out ages back, is part of the ambience, the easeful seductiveness. The place is awash with courtesy, in the chamber as well as outside. How they love, in their lordships' house, to praise their institution, and to flatter each other! The most mundane occasions are riddled with compliments. \" The noble lord, in his most eloquent speech... \" which was really nothing more than a re-cooked Telegraph leader. The most ordinary, flaccid exchanges can be punctuated by self-administered tributes to the eloquence and wisdom of a debating chamber whose excellence is honoured and envied across the civilised world. Soon, new arrivals are rubbing their eyes and joining in. \"Corruptingly nice\" Tony Benn's father, the first Lord Stansgate, called it, with proper wariness. Others, less wary, more susceptible to its gentle embrace, fell for it unreservedly. \"My short experience of the House of Lords has convinced me that the debating level is much higher than in the Commons. There is not the same vested party interest. There is an independence of mind and scholarship that serves the nation well.\" George Thomas, Lord Tonypandy, arrived at safe haven after years in the Speaker's chair attempting to quell the tumultuous Commons. And some of the praise is justified. The party-political violence that flourishes in the Commons often demeans debate - though no more than it is demeaned by the tutored obsequiousness, the grovelling eagerness to offer the boss what he wants, of much of the Labour benches since the last election. The Commons is a very masculine place, designed by men for men to perform in, especially, perhaps, those skilled in the dormitory rough and tumble of public schools. Strong and intelligent women, who in a better system would have been on the Commons front benches decades ago, do not altogether regret that, unable to get themselves nominated in winnable Labour seats, they have ended up in the Lords. You're not jeered at, or shouted down if you can't make yourself stentorian. You're not so subjected, apart from the over-egged compliments, to sexual teasing or innuendo. It is easier there to develop a serious argument, coloured by party allegiance, perhaps, but not drowned in it. The courtesy may sometimes be cloying, but better that than the rough house. If reform makes a seat in the upper chamber dependent on direct election, freezing out those with no party allegiance, eliminating the sort of diffident but knowledgeable people who could never face the pace and stress of the hustings - if, in other words, the Lords becomes more like the Commons - won't something precious be lost? Won't it even be threatened if, anomalous though they are, we expel all the hereditaries who help to give the place its present agreeable, civilised flavour? But they have to go. That's been clear for at least 80 years. Some of the arguments being conducted now - do we directly, or indirectly elect? If we nominate, don't we end up with a houseful of poodles? Do we retain a representative group of hereditaries, or turn them out altogether? - were being aired in hauntingly similar terms at the end of the 1890s, as the Tory-dominated Lords, eager to win in the upper house what they couldn't win in the lower, slashed their way through Gladstone's intended legislation. As the party leader, Arthur Balfour, told a Conservative rally in 1906, whether in power or in opposition, their great Unionist party should control the destinies of the Empire. What they couldn't win in the Commons, they sought to win in the Lords. It's probably true that the beginnings of their decline were observable as early as 1832, the year of the first great reform bill. It's easy now to underestimate quite how tight was the hold of the great aristocratic families up till that time. Not only could they exercise their influence through the Lords; by controlling the rotten boroughs, filling the seats in their gift with family, friends and reliable placemen, and exploiting the open (rather than secret) ballot, they could make or break half the seats in the Commons, too. Since the 1670s, the Commons - though, theoretically, co-equal powers with the Lords - had superior control over finance. But the Lords was the engine room. The younger Pitt's first cabinet had seven members; the one that launched his second administration had 12. In each case, he was the only commoner. You can see the pattern of power in the county of Westmorland. From the days of James Lowther, Earl of Lonsdale, the Lowthers controlled and nearly always represented both the Westmorland seats, as well as calling the shots in half a dozen elsewhere. \"More detested than any man alive, as a shameless political sharper, a domestic bashaw, and an intolerable tyrant over his tenants and dependants,\" one contemporary wrote. \"A man of intolerable character and enormous wealth,\" said another. When, in 1818, the future Lord Chancellor, Brougham, dared to challenge the Lowthers' grip on the county, causing the first contested election in 40 years, the Lowthers moved in to squash him with huge resources and matching ruthlessness. Even 1832 didn't shake them. The successful candidates in the county of Westmorland in a rare contested election in 1832 were Viscount Lowther (Conservative) and his son, the Hon HC Lowther. In the three elections that followed, a brace of Lowthers was still returned unopposed. Apart from the brief appearance of a London alderman called Thompson, the county's MPs through to the 1880s were mainly Lowthers, though the Earl of Bective, son of the Marquess of Headfort and son-in-law of Thompson, was given a seat for a while. The election of 1880 was the first to be disputed for 48 years. It didn't make much difference - the Hon William Lowther, grandson of the odious James, and the Earl of Bective were returned with substantial majorities . Nonetheless, the rot had set in. As the franchise for the Commons was widened, the automatic right of hereditary peers to seats in the upper chamber began to look less like the natural pattern of life, and more like a glaring anomaly. And the ebbing influence of the patrician class over the composition of the Commons meant more elected members coming into the Commons who found that anomaly indefensible. The momentum for Lords reform, or even replacement, was strengthened again by the widening of the franchise in 1867-68 - a Tory measure, so it went through the Lords unscathed - and again by the further reforms of 1884 (a Liberal measure, fiercely opposed in the Lords). In 1876, life peers were admitted, in the form of three law lords. The following year, Lord John Russell moved for the routine appointment of life peers, a case that would be made with gathering strength through the rest of the century. \"The question,\" said the great John Bright as the 1884 Reform Bill went through the Commons, \"is not one of the franchise bill only; that bill will not be defeated or long delayed. There has arisen another and greater question. Shall the House of Lords subject to its will the Ministry, which represents the Crown, and the House of Commons, which represents the nation? Shall the policy of a great and free country be thwarted by men, sitting in their hereditary chamber, who are not there by right of votes given them, and through whom the voice of the millions of the United Kingdom is not heard? Their veto is a constant insult to the House of Commons, and if the freedom of our people is not a pretence or sham, some limit must be placed on a power which is chiefly manifested in and by its hostility to the true interest of the nation. A parliament controlled by hereditary peers is not better, perhaps it is worse, than a parliament influenced and controlled by a despotic monarch. Ask your friends to consider this seriously. Let them join with their countrymen in demanding a change which shall free the House of Commons from fetters as humiliating to it as they are injurious to the country.\" Nine years later, the greatest turnout ever seen in the Lords destroyed Gladstone's Irish Home Rule Bill, passed a week before in the Commons by 34 votes amid scenes of uproar after a Tory member (Lord Cranborne - a Cecil: you can never keep them out of this story for long) called one of the Irish members, Davitt, a murderer. When told to withdraw, he explained that his allegation, though justified, had \"not been meant for the ears of the House\". There voted, out of 560 peers entitled to do so, just 41 in favour, 419 against. Some of the fiercest criticism levelled against the bill came from patricians who were normally Gladstone's supporters. Both in the House of Lords and at huge public rallies outside it, the Duke of Devonshire hymned the Lords as the one available bastion against the \"tyrannical majority\" in the Commons, where debate had been stifled. The Lords, who had by now got a taste for these things, further wrecked the Employers' Liability Bill and a bill on parish councils. Gladstone addressed the matter with a series of Lear-like threats, which the Tories condemned as a \"declaration of war\". It wasn't declaration enough for Radicals. The feisty old Etonian maverick, Henri Labouchere, thought the moment had come for revenge. From 1882 onwards, he had several times moved in the Commons a resolution based on that which the Commons had used after the execution of Charles I to abolish the upper chamber: \"that the House of Lords is useless, dangerous, and ought to be abolished\". This initiative had mustered 71 supporters in 1884, 166 in 1886, 162 (including two of Gladstone's senior lieutenants) in 1888. Now, with most of the Liberal Party roused against Lords intransigence and Liberal newspapers howling for blood, he tabled a prayer to the Queen \"that the power now enjoyed by the House of Lords shall cease\". It came up at a moment when many had gone to dinner, and was solemnly carried, to Gladstone's dismay, by 147 to 145. \"I suppose,\" one of Gladstone's ministers asked him sardonically, \"you can find enough people to draft into the Lords to push that proposal through it?\" Labouchere produced from his pocket a list with 500 names. Labouchere was an unpredictable, not always wholly serious figure. He ran a paper called \"Truth\": he had planned to call it \"The Lyre\" until the wiser counsels of people with more sensitive ears prevailed. Even establishment figures such as the Earl of Rosebery, Gladstone's instinctively conservative successor as Liberal leader, campaigned to curb, if not to remove, the dominance of hereditary peers such as himself. He had brought proposals to the Lords in the year of reform, 1884, and again four years later, when a Cecil - the third Marquess of Salisbury - marshalled the votes to defeat them: but even Salisbury now accepted that hereditary peers should lose their monopoly and life peers (well, just a few) be permitted to join them. The 18th-century romantics who preach to us on such matters in the editorial columns of the Daily Telegraph, castigating William Hague for abandoning Tory principles and traditions, take a far more starry-eyed view of the glories of heredity than many Conservatives did at the turn of the century. Even hereditary peers knew their days were numbered. When their powers were cut by the 1911 Act, after they had sought to obstruct the Budget, that was trailed as only stage one of a project that would lead very soon to their banishment. By the end of the government's term, the Bill's preamble stated, all hereditary peers would have been excluded. In the Commons debate on that Bill, the Liberal prime minister, Asquith, was denied a hearing for almost 45 minutes by a clamour on the Tory benches orchestrated by a Cecil (Lord Hugh). In 1948, an all-party conference voted for their extinction; in 1958, Conservative legislation broke their monopoly by introducing life peers, regarded by few as the end of the matter. That bill even let in women, the threat of whose arrival alarmed hereditary peers in their all-male house. As one dreadful old reactionary, Viscount Masserene and Ferrard, wrote later in a wonderfully fruity book: \"It was beyond my wildest dreams that we should find the fair sex among us... I have spoken to countless women from all forms of life, and they have shown a singular lack of enthusiasm for members of their sex to join your Lordships' house. No one admires more than I do the intuitive wisdom, talents and beauty of women, but women are not legislators and never will be. You cannot argue with a woman; I cannot, anyway. Was it not Plato who said: 'A good woman is always quiet, never talkative'?\" Six years later, with the notion of life peers, even women life peers, seeming perfectly commonplace, Harold Wilson promised not to create any further hereditary peers, a practice later Conservative governments came close to continuing. William Whitelaw and George Thomas were both made hereditary peers, but they had no sons, only (I use that term in a Massarene sense) daughters, so they could not pass the titles on. Only Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton, was exempt from this exclusion. Even though he had no sons, merely daughters. Margaret Thatcher even turned her back on the clamour of ardent supporters to make Enoch Powell a hereditary viscount. And, in 1968, Labour's Bill to remove the voting rights of hereditary peers, which was killed by a strange, ad hoc cross-party coalition headed by Powell and Michael Foot, was backed both by the Tory leadership and by the House of Lords. So the cause to which the romantics have bound themselves was lost long ago. As Lord Jenkins wrote to the Times in February 1996, when the Conservative leadership took a more reactionary line on these issues than it does now: \"What I find nonsensical is the attempt by the Government and others to portray proposals to restrain the right to sit and vote of hereditary peers as a constitutional monstrosity, a sign of barbarians at the gate, and an undermining of the defences of the monarchy. This is typical of the unhistorical ignorance that characterises so much government thought, from the Prime Minister downwards. I cite six occasions in this century... \"; which he then proceeded to do. One hundred and fifteen years after Bright's essential question - \"Shall the policy of a great and free country be thwarted by men, sitting in their hereditary chamber, who are not there by right of votes given them, and through whom the voice of the millions of the United Kingdom is not heard?\" - there are still those who defend the hereditary element, often with arguments enchantingly close to those used in the 1830s to oppose the first Reform Bill. These are many, varied, and overwhelmingly bogus. The first, though sometimes cloaked in the language of genetics, is essentially mystical. Here is a classic statement, from Sir Anthony Wagner, Garter King of Arms, in 1969. \"We ignore at our peril any social or political expression of that great natural force which makes most of us wish to do more for our families than for mankind at large... The hereditary principle, expressed in loyalty to dynasties, lords and kindred, did almost as much as belief in God and in the fealty of vassal to lord to rebuild European civilisation after the collapse of the Roman Empire.\" That spirit survives. \"The traditions of this House, and its history,\" one hereditary peer declared when the Lords debated itself at the end of February, \"are part of the mystique of this country and of our proud island race, and are admired throughout the world.\" Today's hereditary peers, these assumptions pretend, represent the wisdom of centuries; not just counsels passed down from generation to generation, but something subtler still: a quality in the blood. It is what we're supposed to admire in the Cecils: it is certainly what, it appears, the Cecils admire in themselves. At the end of last year, William Hague sacked his leader in the Lords, Lord Cranborne, for an act of conspicuous treachery: doing a deal with the enemy (Labour) to preserve a hereditary presence in the upper chamber between stage one of the Government's plans - the sentence of death upon the hereditaries - and stage two - a new model House of Lords. True as he otherwise was to his leader, this Cecil recognised a higher allegiance - to the traditions of his great family and to the House that he, like his forefathers, sat in. Many of his colleagues in the Lords believed he had chosen rightly: some - intriguingly, mostly life peers who had come to revere the House - gave up the Tory whip in protest. Cranborne, comparing himself to a disobedient spaniel, went on his way. He was sorry, he said, but he'd make the same choice again if the occasion arose. Hague handed the job to Lord Strathclyde. The comparison between the two men tells us a lot about the delusions sustaining the romantic myth. The Cecils, who gave us so many Viscounts, Earls and now Marquesses of Salisbury (which is what Lord Cranbornes become when their daddies die) have been around, and have frequently had their fingers in government pies, ever since William Cecil, first Baron Burghley, served Henry VIII and Elizabeth, and Robert, first Earl of Salisbury, became Elizabeth's secretary of state and James I's chief minister. This family's story is interwoven with British history. The very names of such peers are like antique music. George John Charles Mercer Nairne Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marquess of Lansdowne. Charles Henry John Benedict Crofton Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. Gilbert Edward George Lariston Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, Earl of Minto. John David Clotworthy Whyte-Melville Foster Skeffington, Viscount Massarene and Ferrard, Baron Oriel. Nancy Jane Marie Heathcote-Drummond Willoughby, Baroness Willoughby de Eresby. How mundane the new life peers sound in contrast. Lord Sawyer; Lord Whitty; Lord Bragg. But they're more what the Lords is about. Some 70 per cent come from families ennobled in the past two centuries: around 45 per cent from our own. Lord Strathclyde is the second baron. His own father having died first, it was he who inherited the title on the death of his grandfather, a Glasgow MP in the days when the Tories still won seats in Glasgow, and an unexceptional Scottish Office minister ennobled as lately as 1955; after which he left the Commons and went off to run the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board. For every peer who is there because some distant ancestor was rewarded by a deliriously grateful nation for a Waterloo or Trafalgar, there's at least one more whose presence reflects some favour done to a monarch - or perhaps a monarch's dalliance with a favourite mistress. There are ten times as many as those whose presence is due either to political deals and services rendered (some of them dirty: some, like Lloyd George's more notorious creations, rewarding party donations), or to the need to keep great plutocrats, barons of industry, owners of useful newspapers, sweet. The origin of a peerage, in many cases, was the need to get some long-serving commoner out of the way so that someone younger could take his seat. The sort of people who today would become life peers had to be made hereditaries then. The romantics would like you to think that the Lords is full of Cecils, when in fact it is full of Strathclydes. Next, it is argued that the Lords has a range of expertise denied to the Commons. People who understand about industry, commerce, science, the arts... True. Its select committees have far more people present who know what they are talking about than equivalent groups in the Commons. In 1975, a Tory MP told a Commons debate in the Lords a few weeks ago, the Brussels commission confessed itself outwitted, perplexed and defeated, perplexed by a delegation from a national legislature. They came from the House of Lords. But, being an honest man, he went on to admit that those who achieved this triumph were all life peers. That is scarcely surprising. Life peers are often there precisely because they have expertise. With hereditary peers, the expertise is an accidental bonus. If you trawled the ranks of the great and the good for people best equipped to enlighten parliamentary debate, you would find far more of the people you wanted outside the ranks of the hereditary peers than within. Partly because of that expertise, the quality of debates in the Lords is said (chiefly by peers themselves) to be higher by far than those in the Commons, with the implication that a seasoning of hereditaries has something to do with it. And indeed, any trawl of Hansard will pick up speeches by hereditary peers that do credit to Parliament. The trouble is that if you ask for examples of great speeches by hereditary peers, the one you always get is Harold Macmillan's when, as Lord Stockton, he raged against Margaret Thatcher for selling the family silver. Even if the best of Lords speeches outdo the best in the Commons - and I'm not sure they do - most of the best in an average debate will come from life peers, not hereditaries. In March 1996, the Lords staged a devastating debate on the state of higher education. Only one speaker - the minister - had a good word to say for the government. Seventeen life peers spoke, but only five hereditaries, one of whom was the minister. There are also, it has to be said, at the other end of the scale, a greater number of blathering rambles in Lords debates than the Commons would tolerate. Sometimes, blatherers dominate proceedings: the day they discussed UFOs in 1979 still haunts all who heard it. In 1995, part-way through a debate on dangerous dogs, an Old Etonian Tory hereditary peer launched into a wandering eulogy of his Staffordshire bull-terrier, a lovable fellow purchased in Grantham and named Sir Caspar Weinberger \"after the American senator who was very popular then and in all the news bulletins\". It's a tribute to the courtesy of the Lords - or a sign that they're all inured to such drivel - that no one on such occasions invoked the silken formula for shutting a driveller up: to move that the Noble Lord be no longer heard. Those who think that the average peer takes after Demosthenes should read some of the speeches in the House's debate on Lords reform at the end of February. The ones in late evening, many of which are simply declarations of whining self-interest, plumb depths of intellectual decrepitude rarely matched in the Commons. Try, for instance, the contribution of Lord Belhaven and Stenton, who thinks the present beleagured state of hereditary peers is comparable with that of the Jews in Hitler's Germany. (Though, it has to be said, there are hopeless old fools among life peers too, as Lord Beloff demonstrated with his recent letter to the Times comparing Blair's Britain to Hitler's Germany.) But is the House as reactionary as it's painted? Wasn't it ahead of the Commons in voting for the liberalisation of the laws on homosexuality, divorce and abortion - as well as for admitting TV cameras? Indeed it was. But that came after the life peers arrived. The great hereditary champions of our liberty were responsible in their heyday for blocking parliamentary reform (except when proposed by Conservatives), for delaying the abolition of slavery, for watering down Shaftesbury's bill to keep children out of the mines, to abolish capital punishment for shoplifting, to block reform of the lunacy laws, and to end the exclusion of Jews from Parliament. If we're asked to value hereditary peers for what's in their genes, why should we suppose that dark reaction isn't lurking there, too? Bright was right. They have been there too long, and cannot depart too soon. But will they? Don't forget, as the drama's played out, that there's still a Cecil involved. Why did Lord Cranborne, scion of a great English house, collude with Labour to give reform a safe passage when a product of Wath on Dearne comprehensive chose not to do so? Some wise old heads on the Labour benches think they know why. It's one thing to say we need to be rid of hereditary peers; it's quite another to settle the composition of a new second chamber. Elect the lot, and you'll lose much of that special expertise, while creating a chamber which, having the popular mandate that is not there at present, might constantly second-guess the Commons. To check that, you curb their powers: but why could an upper chamber with greater legitimacy be given fewer powers than an illegitimate one? Simply nominate peers and where - outside the crossbenchers - is the old independence? Would a government that prefers closed lists for PR elections rather than open ones find room in the new upper chamber for mavericks and trouble-makers? If you mix the directed - or indirectly elected - with nominees, what's the desirable balance? Two to one in favour of the elected, or, as some have argued, the other way round? Remember what happened in 1911. Stage one - cutting the powers of the Lords - was swiftly achieved. Stage two - the expulsion of the hereditaries - never happened. Can we be sure that stage two in the pattern that's now proposed will not be delayed, or ever defeated? It's a reasonable bet, at the least in Cranborne's calculations, that the 91 peers whom his deal has saved for the interim phase of reform will still be there in five years' time, perhaps even in ten. It looks like an outside chance. But watch out: there are Cecils - charming, courteous, seductive Cecils perhaps; but still Cecils - about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/27/duncancampbell.richardnortontaylor","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-27T02:47:13Z","webTitle":"M15 role in inquiry into Israeli embassy blast under scrutiny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/27/duncancampbell.richardnortontaylor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/27/duncancampbell.richardnortontaylor","fields":{"headline":"M15 role in inquiry into Israeli embassy blast under scrutiny","bodyText":"The role of the intelligence agencies in the investigation of the 1994 Israeli embassy bombing will come under scrutiny on Monday when the two Palestinians found guilty of conspiring in the attack seek leave to appeal against their convictions. Their lawyers will challenge Public Interest Immunity certificates gagging orders which are preventing the defence from seeing documents which could shed light on intelligence relating to the bombing received by MI5. Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, two Palestinian graduates living in England, were convicted in December 1996 of conspiring to cause explosions in the United Kingdom. They were jailed for 20 years. In a secret hearing last week, High Court judges agreed that MI5 documents should be withheld from the defence. But the Palestinians' lawyers will seize on a decision this month by the European Commission of Human Rights. In an attack on the use of PII certificates, the commission ruled that three men jailed for life for murder and violent robbery in 1990 were denied a fair trial because police papers were covered by PII gagging orders. The commission's attack on PII certificates was echoed in the Macpherson report on the murder of Stephen Lawrence. The case has always been complex. A middle-aged woman who parked a car bomb, which caused widespread damage but no serious injuries, has never been found. A key witness Rida Mughrabi, who befriended Alami and Botmeh has also not been traced. It was alleged at the Old Bailey trial that Botmeh, aged 31, and Alami, aged 33, had been part of a team plotting the bombing. It was never suggested that either had planted the bomb. Alami, a chemical engineer, and Botmeh, an electronics engineer, admitted during the trial that they had carried out experiments in the Peak District using home-made explosives so they could pass information about them back to Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. No direct evidence links them to the embassy bombing. They told the court that Mughrabi approached Botmeh and said he had fallen out with the PLO and discussed how to make explosives, some of which he asked them to store for him. Botmeh and Alami insist the bombing of the Israeli embassy in London was counter-productive to the Palestinian cause. Both Botmeh and Alami were free on police bail throughout the trial. The prosecution admitted that a hand-drawn map which it originally claimed was of a part of London was of Sidon, in Lebanon, and discussions between British and Israeli forensic scientists about the explosives used in the bomb were also covered by PII certificates. The trial judge acknowledged that the evidence was 'll circumstantial'. MI5's involvement was revealed in 1997 by its former officer, David Shayler. He said MI5 was warned before the bomb that an attack was imminent but failed to act on the warning and said that the MI5 officer who received the warning was not disciplined. Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, said that 'it was not the case that such information as the Security Service had in its possession would have enabled it to prevent' the bombing. But he added he could see how Mr Shayler 'could have gained this mistaken impression'."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/27/7","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-27T02:47:14Z","webTitle":"Fishing port fights to stem heroin invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/27/7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/27/7","fields":{"headline":"Fishing port fights to stem heroin invasion","bodyText":"Trawlers trailing foam and gulls chugged into Fraserburgh harbour at sunrise yesterday laden with the white fish that have enriched the town. Young men in waders leaped ashore, unloaded catches, pocketed pay and headed inland for the new fisherman's friend: heroin. Two men in a grey Ford Fiesta waited on the quay. Business looked promising. Most of the fishermen had at least £700 and only two days to spend it. By tomorrow some are likely to be in debt. Others might be in hospital fighting to survive an overdose. Fraserburgh, a town of affluence and beauty perched on the north-east coast of Scotland, has the highest per capita rate of heroin addiction in the United Kingdom. Two fishermen from the same vessel overdosed and died in the past few weeks. A two-year study published this week revealed that 50 of the 63 men who overdosed last year were fishermen. Mothers dread the return of their sons because of the temptation on land, yet even at sea heroin is being secretly smoked, leading to fuzzy concentration and, allegedly, collisions, accidents and lost limbs. Alisdair Ritchie, 50, a skipper with two boats, said more than 90 per cent of the fishermen under 30 were on drugs. 'I don't take on young men any more. Junkies are no use. They can fall asleep at the wheel, anything can happen. My youngest crew member is 42. The lack of manpower is doing more damage to fishing than the EEC ever did.' Mr Ritchie makes one exception to his rule, his son, Marc, 20. 'I take him out to sea because it's the only way to keep him alive, to keep him away from heroin. He was the brightest boy at school but now he can hardly think.' Marc, exhausted after a 10-day trip icing and bagging £44,000 of cod and haddock, admitted he had overdosed three times. 'I started on heroin when I was 16, but I've been clean since January. But its difficult to stay off. You work really hard and you come back and you've only two days to enjoy yourself.' The drug was always just a phone call away. 'Heroin helps you to relax. I can't really describe it. It's just really nice. I smoked it at sea once or twice when I was on watch. The hit only lasts one hour, less if you inject.' When a group of fishing friends got together for a session it was difficult to resist. Fraserburgh's GP, Sandy Wisely, has been campaigning for random drug tests on trawlers for four years. He said fishermen were more likely to overdose because they binged after long stretches away without heroin. 'Then they come back and shoot up not knowing what dose to take. You look at their arms and it's like Eric Bristow's dartboard.' Dealers travelled from Aberdeen, breaking up an ounce of heroin into 240 £20 wraps. An ounce might cost a dealer £650. Demand was one part of the problem, the other was the dealers like the two men sitting in the Ford Fiesta waiting for the boats to arrive. Susan, not her real name, discovered her fisherman son was a heroin addict when she heard gurgling from his bedroom. A tiny, frail woman, she smashed down the door with her shoulder. 'A mother's love' she said. Extracting a needle from the comatose teenager and calling an ambulance was the start of a nightmare that many other families were enduring. 'It doesn't matter how nice my house is, I'm a prisoner in my home. My son will steal to feed his habit so I have to carry my purse, chequebook and handbag every time I go from one room to another. My husband and I take turns watching him when he is sleeping to make sure he isn't overdosing. He spends £200 a day on heroin.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/27/2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-27T02:47:24Z","webTitle":"Lara blasts business rivals into cyber-space","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/27/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/27/2","fields":{"headline":"Lara blasts business rivals into cyber-space","bodyText":"Few women in business have made such an impact. But one female's outstanding talents have seen a firm little known outside the City named the world's most successful company. Ahead of leviathans of the business world such as Boeing, Hewlett-Packard and Merrill Lynch comes the Wimbledon, south London-based computer software business, Eidos. And the woman who made it all possible? Step forward cyber-heroine Lara Croft. The accolade comes from an analysis of corporate growth conducted by the respected think-tank, the World Economic Forum. According to the WEF, Eidos has seen sales grow by 715 per cent to around £135 million fuelled by the cyberstar of the electronic game Tomb Raider. The rating confirms Ms Croft's iconic status. Her gun-wielding antics have already been splashed across billboards and buses in New York. She has featured in pop videos, car advertisements in France, and in such august organs as Time and Newsweek magazines. Jamie Thomson, a senior computer games developer working for Eidos, said Lara Croft represented a shift in society. Twenty years ago young men would not have chosen a woman as their icon. But society was more sophisticated now. And, as Thomson readily admits, plenty of Lara Croft's appeal is pretty traditional: 'She has got an Uzi and is really hard, but she is sexy too.' Eidos's success reflects the explosion in the video games market. Experts reckon that there are 80 million PCs in use, and 70 million games platforms such as the Sony Playstation, Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast. John Kavanagh, Eidos's publishing director, is forecasting that the next generation of games machines will entice an untapped segment of society the middle-aged into computer games, because of the increasingly sophisticated power of the games machines. Mr Kavanagh forecasts that graphics will be vivid enough to appeal to an older generation. Older people he said, lose their 'power of imagination' with age, and need more computing power to create the necessary realism. The Tomb Raider series has sold 15 million copies worldwide. Ms Croft's latest escapade, Tomb Raider 3, has shifted more than 4 million units since its pre-Christmas launch. Her appeal has captivated Hollywood too. Paramount is to make a feature film about the gun-toting star. It is fitting that a major studio should come begging for a computer game heroine. According to Elspa, the games trade association, more than £1 billion of computer and video game software was sold last year in the United Kingdom, outstripping cinema and video rental receipts. Tomb Raider 3 outsold Titanic both in the UK and worldwide. Jeremy Lewis, chief financial officer at Eidos, said yesterday that an 'unknown actress' was likely to be cast as Lara, indicating that big names such as Liz Hurley, Demi Moore and Sharon Stone were no longer under consideration. This is not just an issue of whether the face and cheque fits. Paramount and Eidos want the actress to be available for a sequel, which it is much easier to guarantee with an unknown. Eidos is delighted by the film, not just because of the extra revenue - the firm will be paid a share of the box office proceeds and the merchandising - but because of the huge marketing push that Paramount is planning to put behind the film. That marketing will lift the Tomb Raider game franchise to new levels of awareness, Eidos hopes. Now a quoted company with publicly owned shares, Eidos is fronted by a former banker, Charles Cornwall. Lara's success has made him a multi-millionaire and also saw the man who developed the Tomb Raider series, Jeremy Heath-Smith, paid £1.8 million last year. Harder to foresee is how enduring the Tomb Raider phenomenon will be in the turbulent world of fast-changing consumer taste. Eidos itself is trying to reduce its dependence upon Lara by developing other games. The company is also positioning itself to run games on-line. But what the company must really want, but is unlikely to ever find, is another character like Lara Croft. Life of Lara \u0095 ...was chosen by science minister Lord Sainsbury as 'an ambassador for British scientific excellence' \u0095 ...through her latest game, Tomb Raider 3, outsold the film Titanic both in the UK and worldwide \u0095 ... was stripped by a 'nude raider' web ring that posted images of her without hotpants and rubber vest \u0095 ... is supposed to have gone to Wimbledon High School for girls, Gordonstoun and a Swiss finishing school before opting for a life of adventure rather than marriage to the Earl of Farringdon \u0095 ... has been condemned by feminists as a controllable representation of womanhood \u0095 ... was created by graphic artist Toby Gard, who quit as Lara was becoming famous \u0095 .... has, as her fantasy, Brian Blessed in a bath of Crunchy Nut cornflakes \u0095 ... is owned by Core Design, owned by Eidos \u0095 ... faces rivals in the form of some 40 new games under development at Eidos, many budgeted to take 18 months to finish at a cost of more than $1 million \u0095 ... is the sharp end of the computer and video games market, which has grown by 78 per cent (1995-1997).

Judge Baltasar Garzon has sent a revised list of cases to London which, he argues, will justify extradition, despite the new restrictions set by the law lords earlier this week. They ruled that Pinochet's arrest was legal, but that he was not answerable to human rights abuses before 1988, the year a UN convention on torture became part of British law. Although the ruling effectively threw out 27 of the 30 charges - because the alleged offences were committed before the cut-off date - the new cases are all said to be more recent. Sources close to the magistrate said last night: 'In his plea, sent in the early hours of yesterday morning, Judge Garzon cites 41 cases of detention and torture which took place after 1988. 'Garzon is quite clear that these cases justify extradition and that they are grounds to try Pinochet in Spain on charges of detention and torture. The judge worked around the clock on this. He isn't willing to let it go.' Judge Garzon criticised the law lords' ruling as 'inhumane'. In the new documents he said that family members of those who disappeared during Pinochet's rule had the right to know the whereabouts of their loved ones - regardless of the date they disappeared. He wrote: 'To deny this right just because they were deprived of their freedom before September 1988 could in itself be an inhumane act.' The revised request was rushed to London so that its arguments could be taken into account by Jack Straw. His authorisation is need for proceedings to continue. But it was unclear last night whether the judge has the right to amend the list of cases at this stage. In the document, Garzon gave detailed accounts of 41 cases of torture and murder during Pinochet's rule. Some 33 had not been mentioned in previous documents. 'All it takes is one valid case,' said Joan Garces, the lawyer who has pressed the case for victims of purges carried out during General Pinochet's 17-year military dictatorship in Chile. 'We know that there are a lot more than that even after 1988.' Under international law unsolved disappearances remained open cases. Some 1,200 which took place in Chile between 1973 and 1988 could therefore also be considered as valid grounds for extradition. Amnesty International said it was too early to be sure what the legal position was. 'Under the UN Convention against Torture, even a single act of torture gives rise to criminal responsibility before the world. The United Kingdom is obliged to proceed with extradition or to conduct a trial in the UK. The law and not politics should guide Jack Straw's decision.' Patrick Robertson, an adviser to Pinochet, said: 'Our view is that Judge Garzon is changing the charge sheet to suit his book, and it looks as if he has photocopied the Reettiger report [the truth and reconciliation report drawn up at the end of Pincohet's regime]. Ninety nine per cent of the charges were kicked out by the House of Lords, and they are bringing a whole pile of new allegations which no one has had time to look at so far.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/27/saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-27T02:47:47Z","webTitle":"Saudis avert disaster but not politics at haj","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/27/saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/27/saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Saudis avert disaster but not politics at haj","bodyText":"More than 2 million Muslims from 100 countries converged on Mount Arafat in Saudi Arabia yesterday for the climax of the haj pilgrimage. So far the annual gathering has been free of the disasters of previous years but regional politics have been harder to shake off. Iraq and Libya, both under United Nations-imposed air embargoes, flew pilgrims to Saudi Arabia in defiance of sanctions. Iraq drove thousands of pilgrims through Saudi checkpoints without permission. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had agreed to host the pilgrims and to pay their expenses, but Baghdad recalled them when Saudi authorities refused its demand to pay the pilgrims' expenses out of Iraqi funds frozen since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. On Tuesday some Iranian pilgrims chanted slogans against the United States and Israel at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam's holiest site and the starting point for the haj. A Saudi security official was quoted by the press as saying that the Iranians may have been joined by other nationalities and that the issue was settled without confrontation. Iran boycotted the haj for three years in 1987, after more than 400 mostly Iranian pilgrims died in clashes triggered by similar rallies. As ties have improved between Riyadh and Tehran, Iranian pilgrims have taken to holding their rally in their compound at the haj. Saudi Arabia has tried in vain to keep politics and religion apart at the annual event, a difficult task at the best of times in the Middle East but especially so with such a large gathering. Yesterday hundreds of thousands of Muslim men and women spent from midday until sunset praying at Mount Arafat, site of Prophet Mohammed's last sermon 14 centuries ago. This year's haj is of special importance to Muslims because the climax fell on a Friday, Islam's holy day, for the first time since 1994. Saudi Arabia, whose monarch has taken the title 'Custodian of the two holy mosques', has spent billions of dollars on preparations for the haj and put 45,000 personnel on call to deal with the pilgrims. To avoid a repeat of last year's stampede in which 119 people died, the Saudis have come up with a new ways to avoid congestion on a bridge used by pilgrims on the last day of the haj. Communal kitchens have been set up in the tent city in Mena, near Mount Arafat. The Saudis are trying to discourage pilgrims from using gas cylinders, which were blamed for a 1997 blaze that killed more than 340 pilgrims and injured 1,500. Half the pilgrims are Saudis and foreign residents who travel to the holy sites from inside the kingdom. This year, the government limited Saudi citizens to performing haj only once every five years to cut down on the growing number of Muslims taking part in the ritual. The Organisation of Islamic Conference has set a quota for each country to avoid overcrowding. All able-bodied Muslims are required to perform the haj, involving a set number of rituals, at least once if they can afford it and this year's pilgrims are joined by the Sudanese president, Omar el-Bashir, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohammad and Aslan Maskhadov, president of Russia's breakaway region of Chechenia. Egypt's Grand Mufti Sheikh Nasr farid Wasel, the country's top Muslim cleric, was quoted in a newspaper as saying that Egypt's top bellydancer, Fifi Abdou, and dozens of film stars belonging to the Egyptian contingent should not perform the pilgrimage unless they quit show business. Money earned through public performance was illicit in Islam and should not be used to perform religious duties, he said. 'They should give up these sins and return to God,' he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/27/pinochet.chile","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-27T02:48:06Z","webTitle":"New cases brought against Pinochet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/27/pinochet.chile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/27/pinochet.chile","fields":{"headline":"New cases brought against Pinochet","bodyText":"The Spanish magistrate seeking to try General Pinochet in Spain yesterday put pressure on Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, to go ahead with the extradition process by adding 33 previously unlisted cases of alleged torture to his extradition request.

Ridiculous, of course: for one thing, most of the clients look far too old, and far too many men are present, compared to women. But otherwise: all that red plush, all that shimmering opulence, all that lolling about (for, while some sit impeccably upright, others recline, and those entitled to do so disport themselves on the steps of the throne). The other day, one of the Sunday supplements published a series of photographs of upmarket brothels in Paris at the turn of the century: with their gilt and elegant lights and decorated panelling, they could almost have been the work of Pugin and Barry. Of course, this isn't - except to its critics, and purely in the political sense - a house of ill-repute... Yet it is a house of seduction. How many old sweats have gone there over the years from the Labour benches in the Commons, grumbling as they did so at being asked to swell the ranks of a place they'd theoretically hated ever since they first scented politics (however much, as they confided to friends, the wife was thrilled by the prospect of becoming Lady Whoever)? A bastion of upper-class privilege: that was their view; a conspiracy against democracy; shut it down. But then the sweet envelopment - all those servitors hurrying to help you, to take your coat and hat, to show you the way to the bars and the restaurants, to guide you through the intricacies of procedure, as ready with \"milords\" and \"miladies\" as if you were the Duke of Omnium, not plain Joe Bloke from Rotherham. And all those terrifying hereditary peers, with names that you read about long ago in schoolroom history books, whose ancestors fought at Agincourt: what a surprise! So many of them, apparently the perfection of friendliness, with none of the swagger and arrogance and the condescension you might have expected! (For even when the condescension is there, when it comes from true patricians it tends to be subtle and well disguised.) Their presence, even while you cling to the view that they should have been booted out ages back, is part of the ambience, the easeful seductiveness. The place is awash with courtesy, in the chamber as well as outside. How they love, in their lordships' house, to praise their institution, and to flatter each other! The most mundane occasions are riddled with compliments. \" The noble lord, in his most eloquent speech... \" which was really nothing more than a re-cooked Telegraph leader. The most ordinary, flaccid exchanges can be punctuated by self-administered tributes to the eloquence and wisdom of a debating chamber whose excellence is honoured and envied across the civilised world. Soon, new arrivals are rubbing their eyes and joining in. \"Corruptingly nice\" Tony Benn's father, the first Lord Stansgate, called it, with proper wariness. Others, less wary, more susceptible to its gentle embrace, fell for it unreservedly. \"My short experience of the House of Lords has convinced me that the debating level is much higher than in the Commons. There is not the same vested party interest. There is an independence of mind and scholarship that serves the nation well.\" George Thomas, Lord Tonypandy, arrived at safe haven after years in the Speaker's chair attempting to quell the tumultuous Commons. And some of the praise is justified. The party-political violence that flourishes in the Commons often demeans debate - though no more than it is demeaned by the tutored obsequiousness, the grovelling eagerness to offer the boss what he wants, of much of the Labour benches since the last election. The Commons is a very masculine place, designed by men for men to perform in, especially, perhaps, those skilled in the dormitory rough and tumble of public schools. Strong and intelligent women, who in a better system would have been on the Commons front benches decades ago, do not altogether regret that, unable to get themselves nominated in winnable Labour seats, they have ended up in the Lords. You're not jeered at, or shouted down if you can't make yourself stentorian. You're not so subjected, apart from the over-egged compliments, to sexual teasing or innuendo. It is easier there to develop a serious argument, coloured by party allegiance, perhaps, but not drowned in it. The courtesy may sometimes be cloying, but better that than the rough house. If reform makes a seat in the upper chamber dependent on direct election, freezing out those with no party allegiance, eliminating the sort of diffident but knowledgeable people who could never face the pace and stress of the hustings - if, in other words, the Lords becomes more like the Commons - won't something precious be lost? Won't it even be threatened if, anomalous though they are, we expel all the hereditaries who help to give the place its present agreeable, civilised flavour? But they have to go. That's been clear for at least 80 years. Some of the arguments being conducted now - do we directly, or indirectly elect? If we nominate, don't we end up with a houseful of poodles? Do we retain a representative group of hereditaries, or turn them out altogether? - were being aired in hauntingly similar terms at the end of the 1890s, as the Tory-dominated Lords, eager to win in the upper house what they couldn't win in the lower, slashed their way through Gladstone's intended legislation. As the party leader, Arthur Balfour, told a Conservative rally in 1906, whether in power or in opposition, their great Unionist party should control the destinies of the Empire. What they couldn't win in the Commons, they sought to win in the Lords. It's probably true that the beginnings of their decline were observable as early as 1832, the year of the first great reform bill. It's easy now to underestimate quite how tight was the hold of the great aristocratic families up till that time. Not only could they exercise their influence through the Lords; by controlling the rotten boroughs, filling the seats in their gift with family, friends and reliable placemen, and exploiting the open (rather than secret) ballot, they could make or break half the seats in the Commons, too. Since the 1670s, the Commons - though, theoretically, co-equal powers with the Lords - had superior control over finance. But the Lords was the engine room. The younger Pitt's first cabinet had seven members; the one that launched his second administration had 12. In each case, he was the only commoner. You can see the pattern of power in the county of Westmorland. From the days of James Lowther, Earl of Lonsdale, the Lowthers controlled and nearly always represented both the Westmorland seats, as well as calling the shots in half a dozen elsewhere. \"More detested than any man alive, as a shameless political sharper, a domestic bashaw, and an intolerable tyrant over his tenants and dependants,\" one contemporary wrote. \"A man of intolerable character and enormous wealth,\" said another. When, in 1818, the future Lord Chancellor, Brougham, dared to challenge the Lowthers' grip on the county, causing the first contested election in 40 years, the Lowthers moved in to squash him with huge resources and matching ruthlessness. Even 1832 didn't shake them. The successful candidates in the county of Westmorland in a rare contested election in 1832 were Viscount Lowther (Conservative) and his son, the Hon HC Lowther. In the three elections that followed, a brace of Lowthers was still returned unopposed. Apart from the brief appearance of a London alderman called Thompson, the county's MPs through to the 1880s were mainly Lowthers, though the Earl of Bective, son of the Marquess of Headfort and son-in-law of Thompson, was given a seat for a while. The election of 1880 was the first to be disputed for 48 years. It didn't make much difference - the Hon William Lowther, grandson of the odious James, and the Earl of Bective were returned with substantial majorities . Nonetheless, the rot had set in. As the franchise for the Commons was widened, the automatic right of hereditary peers to seats in the upper chamber began to look less like the natural pattern of life, and more like a glaring anomaly. And the ebbing influence of the patrician class over the composition of the Commons meant more elected members coming into the Commons who found that anomaly indefensible. The momentum for Lords reform, or even replacement, was strengthened again by the widening of the franchise in 1867-68 - a Tory measure, so it went through the Lords unscathed - and again by the further reforms of 1884 (a Liberal measure, fiercely opposed in the Lords). In 1876, life peers were admitted, in the form of three law lords. The following year, Lord John Russell moved for the routine appointment of life peers, a case that would be made with gathering strength through the rest of the century. \"The question,\" said the great John Bright as the 1884 Reform Bill went through the Commons, \"is not one of the franchise bill only; that bill will not be defeated or long delayed. There has arisen another and greater question. Shall the House of Lords subject to its will the Ministry, which represents the Crown, and the House of Commons, which represents the nation? Shall the policy of a great and free country be thwarted by men, sitting in their hereditary chamber, who are not there by right of votes given them, and through whom the voice of the millions of the United Kingdom is not heard? Their veto is a constant insult to the House of Commons, and if the freedom of our people is not a pretence or sham, some limit must be placed on a power which is chiefly manifested in and by its hostility to the true interest of the nation. A parliament controlled by hereditary peers is not better, perhaps it is worse, than a parliament influenced and controlled by a despotic monarch. Ask your friends to consider this seriously. Let them join with their countrymen in demanding a change which shall free the House of Commons from fetters as humiliating to it as they are injurious to the country.\" Nine years later, the greatest turnout ever seen in the Lords destroyed Gladstone's Irish Home Rule Bill, passed a week before in the Commons by 34 votes amid scenes of uproar after a Tory member (Lord Cranborne - a Cecil: you can never keep them out of this story for long) called one of the Irish members, Davitt, a murderer. When told to withdraw, he explained that his allegation, though justified, had \"not been meant for the ears of the House\". There voted, out of 560 peers entitled to do so, just 41 in favour, 419 against. Some of the fiercest criticism levelled against the bill came from patricians who were normally Gladstone's supporters. Both in the House of Lords and at huge public rallies outside it, the Duke of Devonshire hymned the Lords as the one available bastion against the \"tyrannical majority\" in the Commons, where debate had been stifled. The Lords, who had by now got a taste for these things, further wrecked the Employers' Liability Bill and a bill on parish councils. Gladstone addressed the matter with a series of Lear-like threats, which the Tories condemned as a \"declaration of war\". It wasn't declaration enough for Radicals. The feisty old Etonian maverick, Henri Labouchere, thought the moment had come for revenge. From 1882 onwards, he had several times moved in the Commons a resolution based on that which the Commons had used after the execution of Charles I to abolish the upper chamber: \"that the House of Lords is useless, dangerous, and ought to be abolished\". This initiative had mustered 71 supporters in 1884, 166 in 1886, 162 (including two of Gladstone's senior lieutenants) in 1888. Now, with most of the Liberal Party roused against Lords intransigence and Liberal newspapers howling for blood, he tabled a prayer to the Queen \"that the power now enjoyed by the House of Lords shall cease\". It came up at a moment when many had gone to dinner, and was solemnly carried, to Gladstone's dismay, by 147 to 145. \"I suppose,\" one of Gladstone's ministers asked him sardonically, \"you can find enough people to draft into the Lords to push that proposal through it?\" Labouchere produced from his pocket a list with 500 names. Labouchere was an unpredictable, not always wholly serious figure. He ran a paper called \"Truth\": he had planned to call it \"The Lyre\" until the wiser counsels of people with more sensitive ears prevailed. Even establishment figures such as the Earl of Rosebery, Gladstone's instinctively conservative successor as Liberal leader, campaigned to curb, if not to remove, the dominance of hereditary peers such as himself. He had brought proposals to the Lords in the year of reform, 1884, and again four years later, when a Cecil - the third Marquess of Salisbury - marshalled the votes to defeat them: but even Salisbury now accepted that hereditary peers should lose their monopoly and life peers (well, just a few) be permitted to join them. The 18th-century romantics who preach to us on such matters in the editorial columns of the Daily Telegraph, castigating William Hague for abandoning Tory principles and traditions, take a far more starry-eyed view of the glories of heredity than many Conservatives did at the turn of the century. Even hereditary peers knew their days were numbered. When their powers were cut by the 1911 Act, after they had sought to obstruct the Budget, that was trailed as only stage one of a project that would lead very soon to their banishment. By the end of the government's term, the Bill's preamble stated, all hereditary peers would have been excluded. In the Commons debate on that Bill, the Liberal prime minister, Asquith, was denied a hearing for almost 45 minutes by a clamour on the Tory benches orchestrated by a Cecil (Lord Hugh). In 1948, an all-party conference voted for their extinction; in 1958, Conservative legislation broke their monopoly by introducing life peers, regarded by few as the end of the matter. That bill even let in women, the threat of whose arrival alarmed hereditary peers in their all-male house. As one dreadful old reactionary, Viscount Masserene and Ferrard, wrote later in a wonderfully fruity book: \"It was beyond my wildest dreams that we should find the fair sex among us... I have spoken to countless women from all forms of life, and they have shown a singular lack of enthusiasm for members of their sex to join your Lordships' house. No one admires more than I do the intuitive wisdom, talents and beauty of women, but women are not legislators and never will be. You cannot argue with a woman; I cannot, anyway. Was it not Plato who said: 'A good woman is always quiet, never talkative'?\" Six years later, with the notion of life peers, even women life peers, seeming perfectly commonplace, Harold Wilson promised not to create any further hereditary peers, a practice later Conservative governments came close to continuing. William Whitelaw and George Thomas were both made hereditary peers, but they had no sons, only (I use that term in a Massarene sense) daughters, so they could not pass the titles on. Only Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton, was exempt from this exclusion. Even though he had no sons, merely daughters. Margaret Thatcher even turned her back on the clamour of ardent supporters to make Enoch Powell a hereditary viscount. And, in 1968, Labour's Bill to remove the voting rights of hereditary peers, which was killed by a strange, ad hoc cross-party coalition headed by Powell and Michael Foot, was backed both by the Tory leadership and by the House of Lords. So the cause to which the romantics have bound themselves was lost long ago. As Lord Jenkins wrote to the Times in February 1996, when the Conservative leadership took a more reactionary line on these issues than it does now: \"What I find nonsensical is the attempt by the Government and others to portray proposals to restrain the right to sit and vote of hereditary peers as a constitutional monstrosity, a sign of barbarians at the gate, and an undermining of the defences of the monarchy. This is typical of the unhistorical ignorance that characterises so much government thought, from the Prime Minister downwards. I cite six occasions in this century... \"; which he then proceeded to do. One hundred and fifteen years after Bright's essential question - \"Shall the policy of a great and free country be thwarted by men, sitting in their hereditary chamber, who are not there by right of votes given them, and through whom the voice of the millions of the United Kingdom is not heard?\" - there are still those who defend the hereditary element, often with arguments enchantingly close to those used in the 1830s to oppose the first Reform Bill. These are many, varied, and overwhelmingly bogus. The first, though sometimes cloaked in the language of genetics, is essentially mystical. Here is a classic statement, from Sir Anthony Wagner, Garter King of Arms, in 1969. \"We ignore at our peril any social or political expression of that great natural force which makes most of us wish to do more for our families than for mankind at large... The hereditary principle, expressed in loyalty to dynasties, lords and kindred, did almost as much as belief in God and in the fealty of vassal to lord to rebuild European civilisation after the collapse of the Roman Empire.\" That spirit survives. \"The traditions of this House, and its history,\" one hereditary peer declared when the Lords debated itself at the end of February, \"are part of the mystique of this country and of our proud island race, and are admired throughout the world.\" Today's hereditary peers, these assumptions pretend, represent the wisdom of centuries; not just counsels passed down from generation to generation, but something subtler still: a quality in the blood. It is what we're supposed to admire in the Cecils: it is certainly what, it appears, the Cecils admire in themselves. At the end of last year, William Hague sacked his leader in the Lords, Lord Cranborne, for an act of conspicuous treachery: doing a deal with the enemy (Labour) to preserve a hereditary presence in the upper chamber between stage one of the Government's plans - the sentence of death upon the hereditaries - and stage two - a new model House of Lords. True as he otherwise was to his leader, this Cecil recognised a higher allegiance - to the traditions of his great family and to the House that he, like his forefathers, sat in. Many of his colleagues in the Lords believed he had chosen rightly: some - intriguingly, mostly life peers who had come to revere the House - gave up the Tory whip in protest. Cranborne, comparing himself to a disobedient spaniel, went on his way. He was sorry, he said, but he'd make the same choice again if the occasion arose. Hague handed the job to Lord Strathclyde. The comparison between the two men tells us a lot about the delusions sustaining the romantic myth. The Cecils, who gave us so many Viscounts, Earls and now Marquesses of Salisbury (which is what Lord Cranbornes become when their daddies die) have been around, and have frequently had their fingers in government pies, ever since William Cecil, first Baron Burghley, served Henry VIII and Elizabeth, and Robert, first Earl of Salisbury, became Elizabeth's secretary of state and James I's chief minister. This family's story is interwoven with British history. The very names of such peers are like antique music. George John Charles Mercer Nairne Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marquess of Lansdowne. Charles Henry John Benedict Crofton Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. Gilbert Edward George Lariston Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, Earl of Minto. John David Clotworthy Whyte-Melville Foster Skeffington, Viscount Massarene and Ferrard, Baron Oriel. Nancy Jane Marie Heathcote-Drummond Willoughby, Baroness Willoughby de Eresby. How mundane the new life peers sound in contrast. Lord Sawyer; Lord Whitty; Lord Bragg. But they're more what the Lords is about. Some 70 per cent come from families ennobled in the past two centuries: around 45 per cent from our own. Lord Strathclyde is the second baron. His own father having died first, it was he who inherited the title on the death of his grandfather, a Glasgow MP in the days when the Tories still won seats in Glasgow, and an unexceptional Scottish Office minister ennobled as lately as 1955; after which he left the Commons and went off to run the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board. For every peer who is there because some distant ancestor was rewarded by a deliriously grateful nation for a Waterloo or Trafalgar, there's at least one more whose presence reflects some favour done to a monarch - or perhaps a monarch's dalliance with a favourite mistress. There are ten times as many as those whose presence is due either to political deals and services rendered (some of them dirty: some, like Lloyd George's more notorious creations, rewarding party donations), or to the need to keep great plutocrats, barons of industry, owners of useful newspapers, sweet. The origin of a peerage, in many cases, was the need to get some long-serving commoner out of the way so that someone younger could take his seat. The sort of people who today would become life peers had to be made hereditaries then. The romantics would like you to think that the Lords is full of Cecils, when in fact it is full of Strathclydes. Next, it is argued that the Lords has a range of expertise denied to the Commons. People who understand about industry, commerce, science, the arts... True. Its select committees have far more people present who know what they are talking about than equivalent groups in the Commons. In 1975, a Tory MP told a Commons debate in the Lords a few weeks ago, the Brussels commission confessed itself outwitted, perplexed and defeated, perplexed by a delegation from a national legislature. They came from the House of Lords. But, being an honest man, he went on to admit that those who achieved this triumph were all life peers. That is scarcely surprising. Life peers are often there precisely because they have expertise. With hereditary peers, the expertise is an accidental bonus. If you trawled the ranks of the great and the good for people best equipped to enlighten parliamentary debate, you would find far more of the people you wanted outside the ranks of the hereditary peers than within. Partly because of that expertise, the quality of debates in the Lords is said (chiefly by peers themselves) to be higher by far than those in the Commons, with the implication that a seasoning of hereditaries has something to do with it. And indeed, any trawl of Hansard will pick up speeches by hereditary peers that do credit to Parliament. The trouble is that if you ask for examples of great speeches by hereditary peers, the one you always get is Harold Macmillan's when, as Lord Stockton, he raged against Margaret Thatcher for selling the family silver. Even if the best of Lords speeches outdo the best in the Commons - and I'm not sure they do - most of the best in an average debate will come from life peers, not hereditaries. In March 1996, the Lords staged a devastating debate on the state of higher education. Only one speaker - the minister - had a good word to say for the government. Seventeen life peers spoke, but only five hereditaries, one of whom was the minister. There are also, it has to be said, at the other end of the scale, a greater number of blathering rambles in Lords debates than the Commons would tolerate. Sometimes, blatherers dominate proceedings: the day they discussed UFOs in 1979 still haunts all who heard it. In 1995, part-way through a debate on dangerous dogs, an Old Etonian Tory hereditary peer launched into a wandering eulogy of his Staffordshire bull-terrier, a lovable fellow purchased in Grantham and named Sir Caspar Weinberger \"after the American senator who was very popular then and in all the news bulletins\". It's a tribute to the courtesy of the Lords - or a sign that they're all inured to such drivel - that no one on such occasions invoked the silken formula for shutting a driveller up: to move that the Noble Lord be no longer heard. Those who think that the average peer takes after Demosthenes should read some of the speeches in the House's debate on Lords reform at the end of February. The ones in late evening, many of which are simply declarations of whining self-interest, plumb depths of intellectual decrepitude rarely matched in the Commons. Try, for instance, the contribution of Lord Belhaven and Stenton, who thinks the present beleagured state of hereditary peers is comparable with that of the Jews in Hitler's Germany. (Though, it has to be said, there are hopeless old fools among life peers too, as Lord Beloff demonstrated with his recent letter to the Times comparing Blair's Britain to Hitler's Germany.) But is the House as reactionary as it's painted? Wasn't it ahead of the Commons in voting for the liberalisation of the laws on homosexuality, divorce and abortion - as well as for admitting TV cameras? Indeed it was. But that came after the life peers arrived. The great hereditary champions of our liberty were responsible in their heyday for blocking parliamentary reform (except when proposed by Conservatives), for delaying the abolition of slavery, for watering down Shaftesbury's bill to keep children out of the mines, to abolish capital punishment for shoplifting, to block reform of the lunacy laws, and to end the exclusion of Jews from Parliament. If we're asked to value hereditary peers for what's in their genes, why should we suppose that dark reaction isn't lurking there, too? Bright was right. They have been there too long, and cannot depart too soon. But will they? Don't forget, as the drama's played out, that there's still a Cecil involved. Why did Lord Cranborne, scion of a great English house, collude with Labour to give reform a safe passage when a product of Wath on Dearne comprehensive chose not to do so? Some wise old heads on the Labour benches think they know why. It's one thing to say we need to be rid of hereditary peers; it's quite another to settle the composition of a new second chamber. Elect the lot, and you'll lose much of that special expertise, while creating a chamber which, having the popular mandate that is not there at present, might constantly second-guess the Commons. To check that, you curb their powers: but why could an upper chamber with greater legitimacy be given fewer powers than an illegitimate one? Simply nominate peers and where - outside the crossbenchers - is the old independence? Would a government that prefers closed lists for PR elections rather than open ones find room in the new upper chamber for mavericks and trouble-makers? If you mix the directed - or indirectly elected - with nominees, what's the desirable balance? Two to one in favour of the elected, or, as some have argued, the other way round? Remember what happened in 1911. Stage one - cutting the powers of the Lords - was swiftly achieved. Stage two - the expulsion of the hereditaries - never happened. Can we be sure that stage two in the pattern that's now proposed will not be delayed, or ever defeated? It's a reasonable bet, at the least in Cranborne's calculations, that the 91 peers whom his deal has saved for the interim phase of reform will still be there in five years' time, perhaps even in ten. It looks like an outside chance. But watch out: there are Cecils - charming, courteous, seductive Cecils perhaps; but still Cecils - about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/1999/mar/29/1","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-29T01:56:33Z","webTitle":"United manager","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/mar/29/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/1999/mar/29/1","fields":{"headline":"United manager","bodyText":"You cannot, he observes with a smile, win them all. Yes, it was a mistake for him to allow his RAC membership to lapse, thereby ruling himself out of the £35,000 windfall each member could have expected from the proposed sale of the club's motoring services, even if £35,000 is not much more than a pocketful of loose change to Lord Hollick. The day following our conversation the Monopolies and Mergers Commission vetoed the RAC deal with Cendant and the collective \"ouch\" from Club members probably reverberated all the way down Pall Mall, along the Embankment and across the Thames to the Ludgate House headquarters of United News and Media. The truth is, Clive Hollick doesn't lose many. The chief executive of a company which controls the weekday and Sunday editions of the Express, the Daily Star and sundry other media interests appears relaxed, to use New Labour terminology, about business in Blackfriars Road. Well, reasonably so. What irks him is what he sees as constant press criticism of the Express. Its considerable achievements are ignored, he feels, yet its foibles are exaggerated or mis-reported. \"The coverage of national newspapers by other newspapers is probably the most inaccurate part of those newspapers,\" he says. I point out that the Express's own often largely media gossip column, Brutus, has been attacked for being fanciful and snide. There is a pause. \"I am making a general point here, not a specific point. It is part of the propaganda game - no, war, not game - that goes on. I put very little store in what I read about any newspaper in any other newspaper. It's usually replete with anecdote and gossip and, to use the current phrase, is heavily spun.\" There has been plenty of material for gossip spilling from United in recent months. Hollick's removal last spring of Express editor Richard Addis and the appointment of Rosie Boycott, who had whistled through the Independent on her way from the Independent on Sunday like a stray bullet, was controversial enough. Boycott's subsequent performance, involving firings and hirings, being portrayed by an actress in a much-ridiculed television ad and removing Amanda Platell, executive editor of the Express on Sunday, and her deputy, Ian Walker, two months after the EoS's \"Peter's Brazilian friend\" story had caused ructions, ensured that Express newspapers continued to receive what their chief executive considers the very worst kind of press coverage. Boycott's profile went into orbit when the Sunday Express published the story of Peter Mandelson's friendship with a Brazilian student. She was aware of the story, which rumour at the time suggested was emasculated in later editions following a complaint by Mandelson, who just happens to be a close friend of Hollick's. When Platell and Walker departed in January, Stephen Glover argued in the Spectator that they were the fall girl and guy for the \"Peter's friend\" debacle. Boycott subsequently wrote a letter to the magazine in which she explained why her enthusiasm for the story had diminished. Nowhere did she deny that the two sackings were connected with the Mandelson affair, although she had done so when the changes at the top of the EoS were announced. \"As far as I know there are no hirings or firings of editorial staff here which in any way are prompted by, coloured by, affected by any political considerations or pressures,\" says Hollick. Does this include the change of heart over hiring political commentator Paul Routledge, allegedly after murmurings of disapproval from Downing Street? \"Yes. My approach is a very simple one - you simply appoint on quality. If Rosie decides to choose person A over person B, as long as she does so on the grounds of quality she has my full support and backing. As for that particular story, Rosie has made public her misgivings and I applaud her for doing that - she is running an open, transparent and modern newspaper.\" Did Mandelson call his Blackfriars Road friend on the night before the story appeared? \"As far as Peter or anybody else ringing me, from my dearest friends to mere acquaintances, from the highest in the land to the lowest in the land, my answer is exactly the same to them all: I don't edit this newspaper. The decisions on what goes into it are editorial decisions. I am concerned with decency, I am concerned with fairness and all other what I would call commonplace virtues, but I would certainly not get involved in a discussion about whether a piece should go in or not. \"As to the changes she [Boycott] has made on the Sunday [title], she has a free hand as editor across seven days to make the appointments she thinks appropriate and I know she had misgivings about the quality of the Sunday product. I am satisfied that the changes she has made are solely based on the need to strengthen the Sunday product, [no matter how] inconvenient that may be to commentators.\" Already a successful television tycoon with United (control of Meridian, Anglia and HTV and a stake in Channel 5 now make him an even bigger ITV player), this son of a French polisher from Southampton first emerged as a potential press influence in 1992. There was what he describes as \"a degree of turmoil\" at Mirror Group following Robert Maxwell's one-way swim from the stern of his yacht, and Hambros, the merchant bank of which he was a non-executive director, was putting together a rescue operation which involved David Montgomery. \"They were casting around for some non-executive directors to support that project,\" he says, \"David Montgomery was not someone I had previously worked with or knew. I thought there was an important public role to play there, which I did for a few short weeks [actually four months]. I had been in the media industry one way or another for a couple of decades, and I am a voracious consumer of newspapers, so the opportunity was obviously interesting. I left because I was concerned about various corporate governance issues. Yes, the paper needed to be restructured; yes, there was a need to sort it out and that is never an easy thing to do. But I felt the approach that David had at the time was unnecessarily brutal. I felt that he was trying to remove from the company people who were independently minded, who were vocal, many of whom had been active trades unionists and many of whom were distinguished journalists who by reference to any sort of normal criteria of professional qualities and attributes you would say, \u0091I'd like to hire [them] - they're good people'. \"I felt the people around the board table were unwilling to engage in that kind of debate. So I made my case, which was ventilated in a completely inaccurate way in the press, and [then] I made my excuses and left.\" There are those who have judged Hollick's shake-up at the Express to be not dissimilar to Montgomery's savage cost-cutting exercise at Mirror Group. Many journalists departed and the company bar and the executive dining room were closed. \"What we are trying to do is arrest a 25-year decline. To do that we need to invest in the paper. I make no apology for investing in the paper rather than executive dining rooms,\" he says. \"Our readers don't benefit from three-course lunches with claret - they benefit from a better and more informative paper. You have picked a small, high-profile example of the changes we have made. Some of them have been difficult, but, firstly, all of them have been carried out in partnership with the trades unions; secondly, where we have had to reduce [editorial] head counts it has been done by editorial people making judgments about the quality of the staff. The important thing is that every penny that has been saved - and by the middle of the year we'll have saved £25 million - has been reinvested in the paper. At the same time we have been able to maintain a level of profitability to our shareholders, so it is a totally different approach and one I think would have been greatly beneficial had it been introduced at the Mirror six years ago.\" But surely some of the cuts have been swingeing? Stories abound about late-night editorial staff being denied taxis home and a reluctance to remake pages to accommodate late-breaking news because of the expense. \"I've no idea [about those],\" says Hollick. \"The newspaper is run and operated by its management. It will come as a disappointment to you, but I don't actually involve myself in these matters. The paper has money to invest in editorial, it has money to invest in printing, it has money to invest in promotion - all of those funds have been increased over the last year. It is up to the management of the paper to decide how they want to invest those, not me.\" Nevertheless his management style at the Express and elsewhere has been described as \"ruthless\", I remind him. That word and another - \"unemotional\" - lurk in much of what has been written about him. He laughs: \"I marvel at the ability of many journalists to write about a subject, in this case me, without ever having had any first hand experience. I have had to take over the years tough decisions. As for being ruthless, I take great pride in being a professional manager with responsibilities for all the stakeholders in this group and I try as far as possible to be fair-minded in implementing whatever has to be implemented. The word ruthless is used as an epithet to criticise - the papers always go on about cost-cutting, completely ignoring the fact that we invested every single penny back. \"Unemotional? I find that a sort of odd comment because one of the things I like about business is that you can be passionate - have a passion to innovate, to build product, to set up a new television channel, a new production business. So I would say that being passionate is a central part of being a successful executive.\" Outside his family life (wife Sue, a former TV producer; three daughters; homes in London and the New Forest), politics vies with business for his passion. He was an adviser to Margaret Beckett until last October, and is now involved with the independent cross-party campaign to promote Britain's adoption of the euro. Any suggestion of actual political office is speculative and premature, he insists: \"I am not looking beyond the next few years, during which I think I am going to be very fully engaged here. But I wouldn't rule anything out.\" The task ahead in resurrecting an Express which has been hung, drawn and its circulation very nearly quartered by a vibrant Mail and the general decline in national newspaper readership is not one for the faint-hearted. \"I wouldn't in any way want to minimise the challenge,\" he acknowledges, \"but I think we can take comfort from the recent history of the Mail, which 25 years ago was in serious difficulties. It was through the persistence of Rothermere that a formidably powerful newspaper [group] was built. I feel that the approach the Express operated for a decade up until 1996, which was to leave the product pretty much unchanged and to cut costs and to take money from the bottom line, was not a viable approach. \u0091There is no certainty that we will succeed, but I am greatly comforted by the success we have had over the last 12 months in moving our readership more upmarket and in getting a younger market. We are now officially younger than the Mail and some days we are more up-market than the Mail. I think we recognise that we must create a new product - we cannot simply try to reinvent past glories; we can't simply ape the Mail. I think Rosie and her editorial team have clearly identified an opportunity to create a rather more modern, a more thoughtful, a rather more open-minded, dare I say a more compassionate newspaper which is less dogmatic than the Mail and rather more optimistic than the Mail. We are a progressive, conservative - with a small c - paper. We recognise the economy needs to be run efficiently and that we need a system of social justice which provides opportunity.\" New Labour, New Express, I suggest. \"I think one of the things we want to avoid is being a party political paper. We want to be a paper for the next 10, 20, 30 years.\" Hollick sees a shift upmarket throughout the press: \"The red-top market is one that is in long-term decline and both the Mirror and the Sun have indicated they are moving up-market a little because they think that's where their readership is going. Many of our [the Express's] readers are coming from the Mirror and the Sun.\" Unmentioned so far, like some forgotten poor relation, is United's red-topped Daily Star. \"The Star is really a niche product in what I think the public call the lads market,\" says Hollick when prompted. \"It's fun, it's frivolous, it's very good on sport and what it has to do is keep banging away at those particular strengths. We have put it on a viable economic footing, it's profitable, it's got more money to invest in promotions and it has a solid core of readership. You can either be a niche paper or a mass-market paper and it is the mass-market red-tops I think have to move up-market.\" Subsequent to our talk news leaked of negotiations concerning a deal which would give Chris Evans's Ginger Group control of the Daily Star. I asked Ricardo Tejada, United's group communications director, for a comment from his boss. \"Clive says he considers it a non-story,\" Tejada reported back. \"Talks did take place , but they were purely about sharing certain resources.\" Yes, it's a tough old game - no, not game, war - all round, Hollick believes: \"I think - I sound like Alastair Campbell here - that newspapers are pretty quick to dish it out but not very good at taking their [own] medicine. \"The newspaper industry needs to put accuracy and fairness back at the top. Over the centuries the public has been amused by and shocked by the most irrelevant pieces of scandal or gossip. This affects all newspapers - the broadsheets have a high and mighty approach, but they are the first to the door when a story is to be sold, so one must smile at their hypocrisy. \"I enjoy reading some of these stories, but I think we are going over the top a bit. Our authority to comment on the affairs of the day springs from the fact that we have a respect for the truth, for balance, for understanding scale and proportion. You squander that if you simply set out your stall to deal with everything in the same shrill, high-pitched, rather vindictive way. \"I don't see a privacy bill coming. I think the Press Complaints Commission code needs to be toughened up. I do think fines should be considered - if we are going to be free to dish it out, we've got to be quick and clear about things when we get them wrong or overstep the mark, otherwise we are not going to keep the public on side. There's always going to be tears, because one of the essential roles of a newspaper is to uncover the goings-on in the establishment, to reveal hypocrisy.\" It is an almost proprietorial address from a man who, many feel, will not be wholly fulfilled until he is celebrated as a fully-fledged press baron, a title, I remind him, usually not bestowed upon those who administer rather than largely own newspapers. \"I don't own this business,\" says Hollick, without a smile. \"If we look at three companies, News International, Associated Newspapers and the Telegraph Group, they are owned or controlled by an individual or family. These are people who would tell us how to run our lives or tell us what we should be doing; who actually, by and large, are not citizens of the United Kingdom. I am a citizen of this country. I pay taxes here and I am passionately concerned about the press.

But in recent years, it was as husband of the Burmese democracy leader and Nobel Peace prize laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, that he most often appeared in the international headlines. During an industrious life, he bequeathed a remarkable legacy of original research and writings on Tibetan literature and history, Bhutan and other little-known aspects of the Himalayan world. Michael's life was always one of knowledge-seeking and travel. He was born in Havana, Cuba, where his French-Canadian mother, Josette, the daughter of the Canadian ambassador, and father John, an officer with the British Council, were living. He was then educated, with his twin brother Anthony, at the Worth School in Sussex and later Durham University, where he gained a BA Honours in modern history. During his undergraduate days he first met 'Daw Suu', the central passion of his life, through a mutual university friend, Christopher, the son of Patricia and Sir Paul (later Lord) Gore-Booth, a former ambassador to Burma, who were her guardians when she came to study at Oxford. From 1967-73, he was a private tutor to the royal family of Bhutan, then a forbidden kingdom. Embarking on research into Bhutanese history, he became head of the translation department of the government of Bhutan. However, his friendship with Daw Suu always remained, and, following a long courtship frequently conducted by letter, on New Year's Day, 1972, they were married in a simple Buddhist ceremony at the Gore-Booths' London family home. Michael then commenced his PhD in Tibetan literature at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University, and for much of the next decade they and their two young sons, Alexander (born 1973) and Kim (born 1977) shared journeys and periods of residence in remote Himalayan regions, including Bhutan, Nepal, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. In 1973, Michael also led the University of California expedition to the Kutang and Nubri districts of northern Nepal. Back at Oxford in the late 1970s, he was elected a research fellow at St John's College (and later Wolfson College). He began a prodigious output in academic articles and books, including Bhutan: The Early History of a Himalayan Kingdom; Views of Medieval Bhutan: The Diary And Drawings Of Samuel Davis, 1783 and Sources For The History Of Bhutan. Between 1985-87, he became a fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies in Simla. Michael's many talents went far beyond his writings, and, in a field of scholarship where sensitivity and diplomatic skills are frequently needed, he displayed an extraordinary ability to bring different people together in a quiet and non-judgmental way. An early example was the seminar on Tibetan studies he convened at Oxford in 1979 in honour of his mentor, Hugh Richardson, the great Tibetan scholar, after which Michael and Daw Suu together edited a volume of papers. Michael swiftly became a key fulcrum for Tibetan studies in Britain and the international academic world. His gentle and modest personality was combined with great determination and belief. On one quiet evening at home in March 1988 came the telephone call which shattered the Oxford idyll. 'I had a premonition that our lives would change for ever,' Michael wrote in Freedom From Fear. Daw Suu returned to Burma to care for her ailing mother and was swept up in the pro-democracy protests that brought down the Burma Socialist Programme Party. the government of the long-time military ruler, General Ne Win. As daughter of the late independence hero Aung San, she was a potent symbol to the crowds. From the moment she made her first public speech to half a million people on the Shwe Dagon Hill in 1988, it was clear she was a natural orator and political leader. There was no turning back. The day-to-day care of their two sons passed to Michael, a task he willingly undertook and had long been prepared for. Michael later revealed that, in one of the 187 letters she had sent him in Bhutan in the months before their marriage, Daw Suu had only one request: 'That should my people need me, you would help me to do my duty by them.' These were very difficult years of worry and personal pressure. Michael never complained. His support for Daw Suu, as well as his private commitment and belief in the goal of peaceful reconciliation in Burma, were unshakeable. When he lost his own father in 1989, Michael was initially allowed visas by the new military government to visit Daw Suu at her family home on University Avenue in Rangoon. In one much-publicised incident that year, he joined his wife and the boys for 22 days of isolation from the outside world after she was placed under house arrest, with Michael arriving to find Daw Suu in the third day of a hunger strike. 'An Oxford don is missing,' the headlines read. Subsequently, the visas stopped, and it was not until May 1992 that they were intermittently resumed, continuing until 1995, when Daw Suu was finally released from six years under house arrest. Although neither knew it, the days Michael and Daw Suu spent together over Christmas and New Year 1995 were the last time they saw each other. Michael and the boys were loyally supportive, travelling the world to pick up human rights' awards on Daw Suu's behalf, including the 1990 Sakharov prize of the European parliament and the 1991 Nobel peace prize. Family life may have been disrupted, but they enjoyed the love and support of a close family circle. Michael never sought the limelight and, other than relaying the occasional public statement from Daw Suu, was careful never to engage in Burmese political affairs. In private, in response to constant enquiries, he would encourage people to support peace, reform and education in the transition to democracy. He never publicly responded to the frequent denunciations he and Daw Suu suffered for their marriage in Burma's state-controlled press, where she was accused of losing 'her origin and lineage' by 'taking a white alien as a husband'. Instead, he thanked the military authorities for the 'courtesy' afforded him during his visits. Despite such pressures, Michael was able to maintain his own writings throughout the last decade of his life, during which he became a research fellow and member of the governing body at St Antony's College, Oxford (Dean, 1998). In 1990-92, he was also a visiting professor at Harvard University. His publications included Hidden Treasures And Secret Lives: A Study of Pemalingpa and The Raven Crown: The Origins Of Buddhist Monarchy In Bhutan; he edited Lamas, Princes And Brigands: Joseph Rock's Photographs Of The Tibetan Borderlands Of China and Hugh Richardson's High Peaks, Pure Earth. The book that was to have the most impact was Freedom From Fear, which he edited from the speeches and works of Daw Suu, and to which he wrote a moving introduction. Published in 1991, it swiftly became a Penguin Classic with forewords by the Czech leader Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa. When the seriousness of his cancer became apparent, Michael bore the news with characteristic forbearance and courage. He energetically reorganised his affairs, working until the end on his long-held dream to establish a specialist Tibetan and Himalayan studies centre in Oxford. He had made an impressive fund-raising start, but it will fall to others to complete his task. His request for a visa to visit Daw Suu for one last time was effectively rejected by the military government, while Michael and Daw Suu had long both discussed and agreed that she would never leave Burma unless she was given cast-iron guarantees she would be permitted to return. Despite the last-minute offer of a passport by the military government, there were still doubts over the conditions and it was decided Daw Suu must stay. In Freedom From Fear, Michael revealed just how prescient they had both been about the possible fate of their marriage and a likely day of reckoning. 'Sometimes I am beset by fears that circumstances and national considerations might tear us apart just when we are so happy in each other that separation would be a torment,' Daw Suu had written to him before their marriage. 'And yet such fears are so futile and inconsequential: if we love and cherish each other as much as we can while we can, I am sure love and compassion will triumph in the end.' A lifelong student of Buddhism, Michael added: 'Fate and history never seem to work in orderly ways. Timings are unpredictable and do not wait upon convenience.' \u0095 Michael Vaillancourt Aris, scholar, born March 27, 1946; died March 27, 1999."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/29/balkans23","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-29T12:33:09Z","webTitle":"Robin Cook interviewed by B92 Belgrade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/29/balkans23","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/29/balkans23","fields":{"headline":"Robin Cook interviewed by B92 Belgrade","bodyText":"INTERVIEWER: The Charter of the United Nations explicitly bans the use of force against any sovereign country. In this attack by NATO troops, 3 Permanent Members of the Security Council are involved. Do you feel personally responsible as a representative of the United Kingdom in the Security Council for this? FOREIGN SECRETARY: I feel totally confident of the backing of the great majority of the members of the United Nations. If you look at the debate in the Security Council the other night, one country did attempt to bring in a resolution condemning the military action in Kosovo. That resolution was voted down by 12 votes to 3 - in other words, 12 out of the 15 members of the Security Council backed what we are doing in taking military action. And the reason for that support across the international community, including within the Security Council, is the widespread revulsion around the world at the brutality with which the repression is being carried out in Kosovo at the present time. That is where the real aggression is: that is where women, children, unarmed men, civilians are being driven from their homes, seeing their villages burnt and blown up by heavy artillery, and are now in hundreds of thousands being made refugees and forced to march towards the border. There is genocide going on in Kosovo, and that is flatly against all the rules of the United Nations. QUESTION: How do you believe that F16s and Tomahawks could protect civilians on the ground? FOREIGN SECRETARY: Let us be quite clear, it is not the F16s or the Tomahawk missiles that are carrying out the genocide or the ethnic cleansing within Kosovo - that is being carried out by the Interior Police, supported by the Yugoslav army, and now also with the activity of a number of paramilitary thugs, for instance the Arkan Tigers and the Vicak Wolves. These are the people that are carrying out the genocide and the killing and they have absolutely no right to blame that on NATO. All our actions are clearly targeted on specific precise military targets, aiming to avoid civilian casualties. What is going on on the ground in Kosovo is the exact reverse of that - it is action against the civilians deliberately targeted at driving out the civilian population of Kosovo. That belongs to the Middle Ages, it does not belong to Europe at the end of the 20th century. INTERVIEWER: FOREIGN SECRETARY: INTERVIEWER: But the level of violence before the NATO air raids, and you must admit this, was much, much lower than today? FOREIGN SECRETARY: No, I am sorry, my point to you was that the 25,000 people made refugees in the 48 hours before the air raids began. Are you suggesting that it is NATO who is carrying out the genocide, that it is responsible? The people who pull the pistol in the backs of the heads of the women and children and old men in the villages that are being blown up - they are the ones who must accept responsibility for what they are doing, not NATO. INTERVIEWER: No, my question is rather how F16s can prevent this? FOREIGN SECRETARY: Because the people who pull the pistols and fire the machine guns only go into the villages once those villages have been surrounded by tanks and by heavy artillery. They rely on that heavy fire power to enable them to go in there and terrorise the civilians knowing nobody dare shoot back. It is an act of cowardice. If you can prevent them from having those heavy tanks, that large artillery around the villages, then they won\u0092t have the courage to go into the villages and carry out the murderous massacres that they are doing at present. INTERVIEWER: Today a missile hit the yard of our correspondent, a supporter of democracy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Luckily it did not explode, but many have. How do these people who have been so far demonstrating their will to link Serbia and Yugoslavia closer to Europe, how do you believe they feel at the moment? It is very hard for them now to differentiate Europe repeatedly saying that these air raids are against the Yugoslav government. I can tell you that this is not how the Yugoslav people feel at the moment. FOREIGN SECRETARY: I don\u0092t have confirmation of the particular incident you referred to. It sounds from what you describe as if it was not an attack but the dumping of weaponry, which pilots may do when they need to return without having the opportunity to fire their weaponry, particularly when they themselves come under fire. I find it interesting that the case you describe was not one that actually involved an explosion. We are very careful in our targeting plans, we select only military targets and we also are very careful when our pilots are over the target zone, if they cannot clearly see the target zone then they abort the mission, rather than run the risk of civilian casualties. We are trying extremely hard to make sure that the action we take does hit the military targets, and is not released if we do not have confidence in that. INTERVIEWER: Do you see an exit out of this? What is the end game? If Milosevic declares a unilateral cease-fire, what will be the NATO decision? FOREIGN SECRETARY: First of all a cease-fire is the beginning, but it is only the beginning. We have had offers of a cease-fire from President Milosevic before, and he has broken them with contempt. After all he signed an agreement with NATO and with the OSCE last October for a cease-fire, and he has continued to ignore that cease-fire. Now if he is to be credible this time, if he offers a cease-fire this time he has really got to pull back his troops, bring the tanks out of Kosovo, and also commit himself to the peace plan that is on the table. We are not going to get stability and security in Kosovo unless first of all there is a clear perspective for a political settlement, and secondly there is an international guarantee in which that settlement can take place. After the events of the last week I do not think that any Kosovo Albanian is going to trust President Milosevic\u0092s promises. INTERVIEWER: So can you spell out the end game? Who is to break through this vicious circle? If Milosevic declares a unilateral cease-fire and you don\u0092t hold him credible to that, he will just continue? FOREIGN SECRETARY: Wait a minute, first of all there is no unilateral cease-fire from President Milosevic and there is no sign that there is going to be such a cease-fire; on the contrary, he is stepping up his atrocities, he is killing more people in Kosovo, he is making more and more of them homeless. INTERVIEWER: And so does NATO. FOREIGN SECRETARY: No, I am sorry, that is not the case, we are not killing civilians in Kosovo or anywhere else in Yugoslavia. INTERVIEWER: But we are already in Phase 2, both sides are stepping up the level of violence. So what does it take to stop? FOREIGN SECRETARY: I have already said to you what is required of President Milosevic to stop it. He can stop the bombing at any time. He can do it today - all he has to do is to tell us that he is authorising a cease-fire, he is pulling out the troops that are causing the repression and he is committing himself to the peace plan. He can do that today and if I may say so, we have had months in which we have offered him every chance to avert this military action. I took part in the talks at Rambouillet and at Paris where we gave weeks in which we invested in trying to negotiate an agreed peace plan. The reason that we abandoned the Paris talks was firstly that the Serb delegation was not negotiating in good faith, it plainly had no intention of reaching an agreement; and secondly we could see the build-up of tanks and artillery in and around Kosovo. While they pretended to talk peace in Paris they were preparing for war in Kosovo. INTERVIEWER: How do you assess the divisions within the Alliance, and how do you assess Russia\u0092s reaction? FOREIGN SECRETARY: The Alliance position is very, very robust. There are 19 member states in the Alliance: they all unanimously supported the decision to start the military action, they all agreed to progress to the second phase of the military action. And 13 out of those 19 members are actually taking part in the action. Common sense must tell the people of Serbia that it is much more sensible to accept the offer of a negotiated peace settlement than continue to take on all those 19 member states within NATO. On Russia, I worked hard with Russia, and Russia played a very strong part in putting together the peace plan that we negotiated at Rambouillet. Russia was quite blunt that it was the Serb side that was responsible for those talks breaking down. I am sorry and regret the fact that there is now a different view in Russia on military action, but in terms of the future for Kosovo and in terms of who is to blame for us being in this crisis, there is a lot of common thinking between the government of Russia and the countries in NATO. INTERVIEWER: Has the UN has been by-passed in this affair? Do you believe that NATO will in future be the peace keeping force and the guarantor of peace in the world? FOREIGN SECRETARY: No, most certainly not in the world. Serbia has a common border with NATO, it is just over the border from Hungary which is now a full member of NATO, so this is not a global scene on which we are looking. But the United Nations has not been by-passed, the United Nations has passed three resolutions in the Security Council in the past year on Kosovo, all of them flagrantly ignored and broken by President Milosevic. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution which endorsed that October cease-fire. What kind of cease-fire has President Milosevic observed over the past 6 months? It is not NATO that is undermining the authority of the United Nations, it is the behaviour of President Milosevic in ignoring all those resolutions. And as I said to you, we were very happy to have a debate in the Security Council on Friday night and we won that debate 12 votes to 3. INTERVIEWER: NATO ground troops will be deployed only when the agreement is signed, or is there any strategy? FOREIGN SECRETARY: We have made it clear that we are willing to guarantee a cease-fire, we are willing to provide the security within which the political settlement can take root. Those are the circumstances in which we would commit ground troops."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/mar/30/2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-30T00:56:47Z","webTitle":"Pinochet set to challenge Straw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/30/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/mar/30/2","fields":{"headline":"Pinochet set to challenge Straw","bodyText":"The former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet must remain under house arrest while the Home Secretary decides whether to issue a new go-ahead for extradition proceedings against him, three senior judges ruled at the High Court yesterday. The judges gave Gen Pinochet leave to challenge the authority to proceed issued by Jack Straw last December, and to apply for a writ of habeas corpus setting him free. But Lord Justice Laws, Mr Justice Latham and Mr Justice Cresswell ordered that a hearing on the challenge should be postponed until after April 15, to give Mr Straw time to amend or issue a new one. The general's lawyers argue that the current authority is unlawful and flawed because it was issued on a misunderstanding of the law, following the first judgment by a different panel of law lords, which was later set aside. The law lords last week drastically cut the number of charges on which Pinochet can be extradited from 32 to three. The High Court was told yesterday that Mr Straw had no power to revoke the original authority, but he could issue a new one while the current one was still in force. However, if the court quashed the existing authority, Gen Pinochet would be entitled to be freed. Mr Straw has given interested parties until April 15 to make representations on whether the extradition case should still go ahead. Alun Jones QC, for the Spanish authorities, suggested the solution adopted by the judges yesterday to avoid a 'disorderly scramble down the motorway' Lord Justice Laws said: 'It seems to me that the interests of justice and the duty of this court are to achieve a situation consistent with the decision of the House of Lords last week in which the Secretary of State may reconsider the merits of this matter expeditiously but in an orderly fashion.' During the 90-minute hearing, Lord Justice Laws said it would not be right for the court to exercise its jurisdiction 'in such a way as might allow General Pinochet to be discharged and leave the country without the Secretary of State having the opportunity to reconsider the merits of this matter'. Clive Nicholls QC, for Gen Pinochet, argued that the application for habeas corpus should not be delayed as the first authority to proceed issued by Mr Straw plainly could not stand. Any delay until after the Home Secretary had reconsidered the case would deprive the general of his right 'to be set at liberty and returned to Chile'. He said that Gen Pinochet was anxious that these matters should be settled as soon as possible and that he should not be left in a 'custodial limbo' indefinitely. But the judges rejected Mr Nicholls' argument after being told the Home Secretary wanted time to reconsider the case afresh 'with a blank sheet of paper'. Jonathan Sumption QC, for Mr Straw, said: 'The object would be to enable the Secretary of State to reconsider the decision, not simply so as to consider the reduction in the scope of the extradition proceedings which arises from the decision of the House of Lords, but to consider whether, in the light of that reduction, it would be right to issue an ATP (authority to proceed) at all.' The law lords held that, while Gen Pinochet did not have blanket sovereign immunity, he was nevertheless immune from extradition for crimes allegedly committed up to December 8, 1988, when the international Torture Convention became binding on Spain, the United Kingdom and Chile. This cut the 32 charges originally under consideration of conspiracy to murder, hostage-taking, torture and conspiracy to torture to just two charges of conspiracy to torture and one of torture."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/mar/30/pinochet.chile","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-03-30T00:57:09Z","webTitle":"Pinochet set to challenge Straw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/30/pinochet.chile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/mar/30/pinochet.chile","fields":{"headline":"Pinochet set to challenge Straw","bodyText":"The former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet must remain under house arrest while the Home Secretary decides whether to issue a new go-ahead for extradition proceedings against him, three senior judges ruled at the High Court yesterday.

News of teams who work to order, each one stealing goods worth around £2 million a year, came as the Home Secretary called for the public to stop describing theft from shops as 'shoplifting'. 'We must stop using the word \"shoplifting\". It's like \"joy-riding\" - we're inventing euphemisms which give the sense that there is no crime,' he told the Retail Crime in Europe conference in London yesterday. David Leigh of Marks &amp; Spencer will tell the conference today that those involved in major theft from shops are also likely to be involved in other serious criminal activity, saying: 'The organised element of shop theft is quite staggering. This is organised crime at the highest level.' Mr Leigh said that there was an international element to such crime. In Middlesbrough, two travelling criminals had been arrested after stealing £10,000-worth of goods in one day from retailers. They confessed that the goods were stolen to order and were to be shipped into continental Europe. Shop thefts fund much of the drug trade. A drug rehabilitation project in Kingston, south west London, estimated that £26 million was stolen from shops in that area alone by drug users. 'There are no boundaries,' Mr Leigh believes. 'They travel extensively, across the United Kingdom and Europe. Some of our targets are known by Interpol.' Some individuals are stealing £100,000 a year.Mr Straw said that the costs of £1.4 billion retail crime were passed on to the public and that shoplifting was not a victimless crime. He urged retailers to participate in 'restorative justice' schemes whereby the offenders are confronted by the victims. He said that it was important for young offenders to realise that people could be damaged by such crimes, including staff members unjustly suspected of theft. He also noted the success of closed circuit television schemes in cutting crime, particularly in the Oxford Street area of London where pickpocketing had fallen by 50 per cent after the introduction of 24-hour closed circuit television cameras. Mark Bradshaw, director of operational resources at the British Retail Consortium said that every family in Britain paid £80 a year extra on goods because of retail crime. He said that a pilot scheme using 'civil recovery' whereby thieves are sued by the shops concerned for damages was being conducted and its success would be evaluated later this year. The 1998 Retail Crime Survey which was published yesterday at the conference indicated that people under the age of 18 committed more than 750,000 offences of theft from a shop 20 per cent of all customer theft. Violent crime had decreased, the survey found, by 43 per cent. Robbery had fallen by 18 per cent with off-licences and petrol retailers heading the risk rate. There was evidence that, as stores improved their security, robbers moved to the more vulnerable late-night independent shops. Robbery risks for independent stores were up from 12 per cent the previous year to 20 per cent. Till snatches increased from 10,000 to 12,000. There were on average 13 incidents of customer theft per outlet at a cost of £23 per incident. Retailers arrested 789,000 thieves and referred 60 per cent of them to the police. In 1997, 107,000 offenders were found guilty in court or cautioned by police. There were 16 extortion attempts some threatening contamination of food on four retailers in the past year. No money was paid over on any occasion. Fraud had increased significantly, the report found. Credit card fraud was up by 63 per cent, the use of counterfeit money up by 57 per cent and cheque fraud by 47 per cent. The biggest increase was in 'application' fraud in which people order goods using bogus identities and addresses. This has increased by 343 per cent to £44.3 million annually. Retailers spend £550 million on crime prevention, compared with £450 million in 1997. Significant areas of increase were in electronic tagging and security staff. Opening the conference, David Sieff, chairman of the British Retail Consortium, urged a different approach to locking up offenders, saying that there were too many young people in prison who could be diverted by crime prevention measures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/01/guardiandiary.matthewnorman","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-01T01:27:06Z","webTitle":"Diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/01/guardiandiary.matthewnorman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/01/guardiandiary.matthewnorman","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"I am intrigued by Paul Routledge's anecdote in the New Statesman about a recent trip to Chequers by crews from BBC and Sky News to film Mr Tony addressing the nation about Serbia.

The trustees get upset about filming inside the house.' This, says Routers, was 'stuff and nonsense', Mr T's real concern being the image of him 'lounging about in the countryside enjoying the spring sunshine' while pilots were being shot at in the skies. Routers further claims that the Press Association mentioned Chequers in its first report, but later corrected this to remove the reference. It sounds fanciful - indeed, Downing Street describes it as 'ridiculous' - and yet there is a curiosity. That PA correction states that the Chequers reference was removed 'at Downing Street's request'. Most odd. Perhaps we will return to the matter tomorrow. Meanwhile, taking a moment away from waging war, Mr Tony contributes his thoughts about the afterlife to Father Michael Seed's new book, Will I See You In Heaven? In heaven, says Mr T, turning Christian orthodoxy on its head, 'there is good and no evil'. Lord Longford imagines arriving in front of St Peter 'with my friend of the last few years Dennis Nilsen', while William Hague equates reaching God's eternal kingdom to 'the feeling I get when I reach the summit after a strenuous hill walk.' As for Ann Widdecombe, she anticipates being 'surrounded on a fluffy white cloud by scores of 20 year old men in leather thongs, every inch of their lithe, sinewy bodies glistening with baby oil...' Actually, she said no such thing. But it might have made it a more palatable little book if she had. As if splitting his time between heaven and earth were not taxing enough, Mr Tony has also been required to do a little limbo dancing to sneak under a question from Robert MacLennan. The gloriously obscure one-time SDP leader asked if he plans to amend the Ministerial Code of Conduct to prevent ministers 'attempting to procure the a) appointment, b) promotion and c) dismissal' of journalists. 'Decisions on the employment of journalists,' he replied, 'are a matter for the media organisations concerned.' This is terrific news, of course, but it would be nice if, just for once, an important change in government policy was voluntarily made public, rather than being teased out of the Prime Minister by a quizzical back bencher. In today's extract from her thoughts about television's future, we find BBC2 controller Jane Root, a keen reader of 'business creativity' texts, striking a military analogy. 'Innovation is very, very scary,' she states, which is why people often fall back 'on standard operating procedure. The Americans did this throughout the war in Vietnam. Without the imagination to work out why bombing wasn't having the desired effect, they just sent in more planes with more bombs.' The lesson Hanoi Jane draws is magnificently gnomic. 'The lesson of the past might almost be,' she observes, 'don't trust the lessons of the past.' What it means who can say, but wouldn't you love to be a producer at BBC2 right now? Our Embassy in Moscow has been addressing British nationals about the danger of revenge attacks by pro-Serb locals. Although assessing the risk as low, it offers one crucial warning: 'Keep a low profile in public places, and when driving, avoid clothing which immediately identifies you as British.' This may be sound advice, but it could be catastrophic news for Moscow's bowler hat manufacturers, and makers of comedy Union Jack underpants. Isn't that always the way with diplomats... never giving a second thought to industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/apr/02/libbybrooks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-02T02:06:02Z","webTitle":"The attack helicopter: vital for any ground fight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/02/libbybrooks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/02/libbybrooks","fields":{"headline":"The attack helicopter: vital for any ground fight","bodyText":"The Nato Apache attack helicopter could play a crucial role in any ground force attack on Serb units.

Kevin Keegan is due to take charge of his second international on April 28 but the game has been in doubt because of the Balkans conflict. But an Embassy spokesman yesterday claimed talk of a postponement was in Britain alone. 'We have not heard anything here at all,' the spokesman said. 'There has been no mention of it in the Hungarian media. The people here are quite excited about seeing England play.' 'There have been no calls for the game to be called off. It is safe to travel to Budapest and there is no problem here.' The Embassy added that the distance between the conflict and Budapest was too great to cause anxiety among England staff and supporters. 'I can understand it because Hungary is the only Nato neighbouring country but there is no problem with safety. 'The problem is that, looking from the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia appears to be quite close to Budapest. It is about 21/2 hours' drive to the border.' Manchester United are widening their net for young foreign talent by forging links with three Argentinian clubs. United already have an agreement with the Belgian club Royal Antwerp to swap loan players regularly. Three young Argentinian players have been training with United and Alex Ferguson said: 'We are trying to get an alliance with Argentina in some way. These boys are a start and we will see how it progresses, but we are looking to repeat it.' 'We are looking at Australia and now South America. We already have contacts with the clubs of the three boys here, so there are places to start.' United plan to send three of their under-19 team to Argentina this summer. Peter Beardsley, capped 59 times for England, looks certain to be dropped by struggling Hartlepool tomorrow. The 38-year-old is set to lose his place at home to Brentford as the manager Chris Turner orders a more aggressive approach. Beardsley, who has scored once in 13 league appearances, has a contract until the end of the season. A London hotelier, Firoz Kassam, has taken control of Oxford United, who are around £12 million in debt. Tottenham's defender Ramon Vega will miss the rest of the season after fracturing a bone in his foot in the Worthington Cup final. Colin Calderwood, signed from Spurs last week, makes his Aston Villa debut at home to West Ham tonight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/1999/apr/03/salmanrushdie","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-03T02:28:55Z","webTitle":"Karma chameleons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/apr/03/salmanrushdie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/apr/03/salmanrushdie","fields":{"headline":"Karma chameleons","bodyText":"England rushes towards them, then stops. Air traffic congestion, even in 1965. Unable to make their approach, they circle in the sky. Down below them, the pirate navy has assembled, an invasion is in progress. Here is a decommissioned old passenger ferry, flying the Jolly Roger, moored in the North Sea. The Frederica. Here's another, the Georgia, anchored off the Essex coast, near Frinton. Look down at the Thames Estuary: those three tiny dots - see them?- are also part of this cutthroat fleet. Ormus, tired, exhilarated, is in an airplane state of mind: hollow, unreal, a condition in which it's hard to keep a grip on things. Mull Standish seems utterly unfazed, and is talking, now, about childhood: There was a heavy glass ball that used to sit on the windowsill of my bedroom. My father would turn it to catch and refract light. There were bubbles in it, like galaxies, like dreams. The small things of our earliest days move us, and we don't know why. Now that I've started this pirate thing, I keep seeing that ball. Maybe it's innocence, freedom, I couldn't say. Maybe it's about a transparent world: you can see through it to the light. Maybe it's just a ball of glass, but somehow it's moving me, it's making me do this. It occurs to Ormus as Standish talks on that he's giving too many reasons for doing what he is doing: over-explaining what is, after all, a nakedly commercial enterprise, news of which has already reached India. At a brilliant moment in British music, British radio is deadly dull. Restrictions on 'needle time' means that when you want the latest hit records - John Lennon singing Satisfaction, the Kinks' Pretty Woman, or My Generation, by the new super-group High Numbers, who changed their name from The Who and immediately made the big time - all you get is Joe Loss or Victor Sylvester, music for dead people. But because commercial radio isn't illegal if it's not land based, the pirate ships have come to give the kids what they want. Needle time and adverts. Hello pop pickers this is Radio Freddie broadcasting on 199 this is Radio Gaga this is the Big M. The pirates aim their sounds at Britain and the country surrenders. And Mull Standish is the Lord High Desperadio: the music brigands' king. Reasons go on pouring out of him. Maybe he's in England because, to be absolutely frank, things with his lover, Sam Tropicano, are no longer what they were, the bloom is off. Or maybe it's the fault of the CIA, because, yes, they approached him on several occasions, a Chinese-language expert is assumed to be top-grade spy material, so they try and sign you up before the Yellow Peril gets to you and turns you to the dark side, and the second time he refused them - a man called Michael Baxter or Baxter Michaels had made the approach right in the foyer of the Sherry Netherland - he was accused of having an attitude and threatened with the confiscation of his passport. I crossed some line when that happened, it changed America for me, and it became possible to leave. And then, of course, it's surprising he's taken so long to get round to mentioning it, there's the war, America is at war. Ballot boxes have been stuffed full of votes for President Kennedy, war is always good for sitting presidents, his numbers are up from the tight squeeze against Nixon in 1960, he's got four more years of power and priapism at Pennsylvania Avenue, and now it's the voters, the young generation of soldier-electors out there in jungled, swamped, incomprehensible Indochina, who are being stuffed into boxes in shocking quantities and being sent home to various addresses less exalted than JFK's. Their numbers, too, are up. Mull Standish is against the war, but that's not exactly what he wants to say. He wants to say - his eyes are gleaming now, and the energy pours from him, with redoubled, frightening force - that the war has turned him on to its consequent music, because in this dark time it's the rock music that represents the country's most profound artistic engagement with the death of its children, not just the music of peace and psycho- tropic drugs but the music of rage and horror and despair. Also of youth, surviving in spite of everything, in spite of the children's crusade that's blowing it apart. (A mine, a sniper, a knife in the night: childhood's bitter end.) That's when I really fell in love with rock, Standish is off and rolling because I adored so much what it was doing, the humane democratic spirit-food fullness of its response. It was not just saying fuck you, Uncle Sam, or give peace a chance, or one two three what are we fightin for, or zap zap zappin the Cong, or even making patriotic noises, silver wings upon his chest make him one of America's best. Rather, it was making love in a combat zone, insisting on the remembrance of beauty and innocence in a time of death and guilt; it privileged life over death, hey baby won't you take a chance, let's dance, every guy, grab a girl, let your body move to the music, kiss me honey honey kiss me, put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone, and we'll have fun fun fun, the bad guys know us and they leave us alone, baby please don't go, help me Rhonda, 'cause I can't believe we're on the eve of destruction. His manner has changed completely, from patrician Bostonian to eager-beaver muso peacenik, and Ormus, watching the transformation, begins to see who he really is. Never mind all his explanations, the truth is he's just another one of us chameleons, just another looking-glass transformer. Not only an incarnation of Jason the Argonaut but also perhaps of Proteus, the metamorphic Old Man of the Sea. And once we've learned how to change our skins, we Proteans, sometimes we can't stop, we career between selves, lane-hopping wildly, trying not to run off the road and crash. Mull Standish, too, is a slip-slider, Ormus understands: a shape-shifter, a man who knows what it's like to wake up as a giant bug. That's why he picked me out, he can see we're of the same tribe, the same sub-species of the human race. Like aliens on a strange planet we can recognise each other in any crowd. At present we have adopted human form, here on the third rock from the sun. Standish, this new exhilarated high-as-a-kite Standish, says: 'I came to England to get away from a country at war. One month after I arrived, the new Labour government decided to join forces with the Americans and ship its own kids out to die. Things here stopped being theoretical. British boys and girls, too, started being mailed home in small packages. I couldn't believe it, as an American I felt responsible, as if I'd flouted regulations and imported a deadly epidemic, I felt like a flea carrier. A plague dog. This development was not as per programme. In a spin, I flew out to India, which is what I do when I need to regain equilibrium. That's when I looked in at your big moment at the Cosmic Dancer, by the way. After Bombay, Standish had gone to sit at the feet of a teenage mahaguru in Bangalore, and then up to Dharmsala to spend time at the Buddhist Shugen temple. Again - I find myself thinking when Ormus tells me the story - again the curious possessive fascination of the hedonistic West with the ascetic East. The arch-disciples of linearity, of the myth of progress want, from the Orient, only its fabled unchangingness, its myth of eternity. It was the god-boy who came through. He's an old soul in a young body, Mull says reverentially, a Tantric Master in his final incarnation. I confessed everything to that wise child, my alienation, my guilt, my despair and he smiled his pure smile and said, The music is the glass is the glass ball. Let it shine. I understood then that the limit on needle time was the enemy, the arch-fiend. The limit was General Waste-More-Land's broadcasting pal, General Haig's whore. Enough with big bands and men in white tuxes with bow ties pretending nothing was going on. I mean come on. A nation at war deserves to hear the music that's going mano a mano with the war machine, that's sticking flowers down its gun barrels and baring its breasts to the missiles. The soldiers are singing these songs as they did. But this is not the way soldiers used to sing, marching into battle bellowing hymns, kidding themselves they had God on their side; these aren't patriotic-bull-hit, get-yourself-up-for-it songs. These kids are using singing, instead, as an affirmation of what's natural and true, singing against the unnatural lie of the war. Using song as a banner of their doomed youth. Not morituri te salutant, but morituri say up yours, Jack, those about to die give you the fucking finger. That's why I got the ships. He slumps back in his seat, almost talked out. He has sold up a chunk of his American real estate holdings to purchase, equip and staff up these barely seaworthy little boats. A complete encirclement of England and Scotland is envisaged, seagoing conditions permitting. Now we're blasting the material at them round the clock, he says, Hendrix and Joplin and Zappa, making war on war. Certainly, the lovable moptops too. Also the Lovin' Spoonful, Love, Mr James Brown feelin like a sex machine, Carly Simon and Guinevere Garfunkel feelin' groovy et cetera. My one regret is that we can't moor a boat on the Thames, right outside the Houses of Parliament, mount giant speakers on the deck and blow those complacent bastards right out of their murderous seats. But never say die; this project, too, is in development. So what do you say? Are you with us or withered? There or square? The rapid disenchantment of Ormus Cama with his fantasy of the West, which will be the making of him as an artist and almost the unmaking of him as a man, begins the instant he lays eyes on Radio Freddie, that seven-hundred-ton rust bucket, pitching uncertainly, like a superannuated rodeo rider, upon the saddle of the sea. His heart sinks. His imagined journey from periphery to centre has never included the low, dank northern flats of Lincolnshire, nor this biting, sou'westered journey out from shore. He feels 'out of land,' the landlubber's version of fish-out-of-water. Briefly he wants out, but there's nowhere to go, no other course but the one on which he's set. Indentured Indian labourers arriving in Mauritius and erasing from their Bhojpuri vocabularies such words as 'return' or 'hope' would have felt, in Ormus's shoes, no less enslaved. By contrast, Standish, erect at the prow of the motor launch that is transporting him to his kingdom, aquiline of profile, silver hair streaming, looks exalted, haloed. A man with a mission is a dangerous man, Ormus thinks, feeling for the first time in their admittedly brief acquaintance a jolt of something resembling fear. Then Standish turns his head, gleaming with anticipation, points. There they are, he shouts. Look at them, Hook and Smee. The two Tweeds. They hate me, naturally; as you will soon discover. (This in an odd voice pitched halfway between tragedy and pride.) Mr Nathaniel Hawthorne Crossley and Mr Waldo Emerson Crossley, he finishes, raising an arm in salute, 'Your new colleagues. My sons.' The men standing at the Frederica's rail do not return his greeting. Hawthorne Crossley - greatcoated, long -silk-scarved, corduroy- jeaned, the sole of one shoe coming loose - has inherited his father's looks and volubility. He uses his mother's surname, but he's Standish translated into English, filled up with alcohol and spite, and aged 24 or -five. Hail Standish, he mocks, as Ormus follows Mull aboard Radio Freddie, Hail the pioneer hero, maker of charts, conqueror of nations. So must the empire builders have looked in their prime, eh, Waldorf? My baby brother, he explains to Ormus. Not named ,as Mr Standish would have you believe in honour of a great philosopher, but after a fucking salad, as eaten by his presently divorced parents on the night he was conceived. Rheumy-eyed Waldo, smaller, fuzzy-headed, leather-jacketed, Lennon-bespectacles, his mother's boy, beams, nods, sneezes. In his personal universe Hawthorne is a blazing star. Hail Standish, Waldo eagerly agrees. Think of stout Cortez in the Keats poem, only it was really Balboa, gazing at the Pacific, Hawthorne exhorts. Consider Clive of India on the battlefield at Plassey, Captain Cook sailing in Sydney Harbour. The Islamic conquerors bursting out of Arabia to face the might of Persia, only to find the once mighty superpower rotten and decayed. They blew it away like sand. It's what Standish hopes to do to the BBC Light Programme. Why isn't one of you in the studio? Mull Standish fondly interjects. Because we decided to play the whole fucking Floyd album, Hawthorne answers, every last bubble and shriek. So we've got hours. We reckoned we could trust Eno to flip the disc while we greeted the aged parent. He takes an uncorked bottle of bourbon from his greatcoat pocket. Mull Standish takes it from him, wipes off the neck, prepares to drink. Robert Johnson was poisoned by a theatre owner who suspected Johnson of fucking his chick, muses Hawthorne, thoughtfully, Sonny Boy Williamson tried to save him, knocked away the bottle he was going to drink from. Don't ever drink from an open bottle, he said. You never know what's in it. Johnson didn't like the advice. Don't ever knock a whisky bottle away from me, he said, and drank from another open bottle, and bango! End of story. Mull Standish drinks, hands back the bottle, introduces Ormus. Aha, the Indian nightingale!, says Hawthorne. (It is raining now, a fine icy drizzle that inserts itself between the men and their clothes, between Ormus and his happiness, between the father and his sons.) The bulbul of Bombay! He found you, then. About fucking time. And now you're his Koh-i-noor diamond, the fucking jewel in his arse. A little on the old side for the work, I'd have thought. All I can say is I hope you wash your mouth before applying it to my fucking microphone. Hawthorne, Jesus Christ. Standish's voice is low and dangerous, and the younger man's tongue stumbles, dries. But it's too late, the cat's out of the bag. Why me? Ormus had asked, and Standish had replied, Call it inspiration. But of course it had nothing to do with inspiration. It's love. Bareheaded in the rain, Mull Standish, exposed, shamed, confesses and apologizes to Ormus Cama: I have been less than frank. I asked around about you, I told you that. I should have admitted that my personal feelings were in fact engaged. The eagerness. The eagerness of my enquiries. I suppressed that information, which was culpably wrong. However, you have only one thousand percent guarantee that it won't become a problem between us Hawthorne snorts with mirthless laughter. Runny-nosed Waldo, not to be outdone, snorts too. Mucus explodes from his nose, like a glutinous flag. He wipes it off his face with the back of his chilblained hand. Ormus is hearing echoes again. In Hawthorne Crossley he sees Vina reborn, Vina in her childhood incarnation of Nissy Poe, in whose family history there are poignant parallels to the tale of this smart-mouthed, bitter child of a broken home. He sees, too, that Mull Standish's long autobiographical reminiscence about his lover, Sam Tropicana, who pursued him for months, then found him and changed his life, was a parable, a tale told in code, its real meaning being: This is what I can do for you. It's true: I hunted you, you have been the quarry of my own obsessive love. But now I can change your life, it is my turn to give as once I was given, to be the bringer of good things as once they were brought to me. I want nothing from you except that you permit me to be your Santa Claus. I want nothing from you, Mull Standish is saying, miserably. For you, however, I want very much indeed. Let me out of here, Ormus Cama demands, and Mull Standish, who has abruptly run out of all his words, can do nothing but drip in the rain and extend, in a profound, involuntary gesture, both his trembling, supplicant arms. Their palms are upturned, and empty. Hawthorne Crossley relents. Oh, stay. Will you stay, for fucksake. Stay for the same reason we do: viz, that here there's booze and music, no dope, alas, because the law keeps boarding us to see if there's the tiniest chance of fucking us up, but really the only thing to be afraid of is that one of these fine days the sea god might decide to open up his great gob and swallow us down. Whereas out there - he gestures vaguely with the emptying bottle of Beam towards the land - out there it's just too fucking terrifying for words. Out there there's kinky bishops, Waldo elucidates. And dodgy Scotch eggs and takeaway chop suey and bent coppers and voodoo dolls and napalm. There's anabolic steroids and cows and anti-personnel strikes north of the DMZ. And Bideford Parave and Piddletrenthide and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and country people in wellies and the Mekong delta where wellies aren't much use and Tet which isn't a place but a date, like Christmas, that's out there too. There's Arsenal FC and Ringo marries his hairdresser and Harold Wilson and Russians walking in space. And axe murderers and mother-rapers and father-rapers. The draft as well, Hawthorne concedes, belching, We're all blowing in that wind. What we're hoping is, if we do this long enough, and throw in a spot of littering and creating a nuisance on the side, we may be thought not moral enough to be in the army. If we're lucky we might be not moral enough to blow up women and children and such. We might even be not moral enough to die. Like Arlo Guthrie, explains Waldo, swaying. (They've finished the bottle of Beam.) Meanwhile, out there, the wrong people are escaping bullets. King Jigme Wangchuk of Bhutan escapes assassination attempt. A machine-gun attempt on the Shah of Iran's life fails. President Sukarno survives a Communist coup. Race riots in Watts, Hawthorne picks up the thread, Edward Heath elected Tory leader. Two charged with Moors murders. Churchill dead. Albert Schweitzer dead. T S Eliot dead. Stan Laurel dead. The British believe in God but prefer TV, polls prove. China has the A-bomb. India and Pakistan on brink of war. And England swings like a fucking pendulum do. It scares me to fucking death and back again. Stay, repeats Waldo, showing his teeth and offering a bottle of sherry, Harveys Bristol Cream. Best we can do at the moment. Welcome to wonderful 199. Ormus takes the bottle. And who's Eno? he asks. The third Stooge? You don't have to worry about Eno, Hawthorne shrugs. Eno's a prince. A man among men. A needle in a haystack. Eno's the business. It's raining harder. Mull Standish makes as if to go. His sons ignore him. His real name's Enoch, Hawthorne says, turning his soaked back on his father. He dropped the ch because he understandably didn't want a racist handle, what with him being a person of tint. It's as if you were a person of Jewishness who got named Hitler by accident and decided to be a Hit instead. Or if your name was unfortunately Stalin and you shortened it to Star. Mao's a tough one, says Waldo. But you could always answer to Dong. Hawthorne confides, Actually, he's called Eno because e knows how all this fucking equipment works and we don't have a clue. Or, Waldo offers, because e no say very much. Or, Hawthorne continues, because he takes a lot of fruit salts, poor love. It's his third-world digestion. Anyway, when you get to know him you call him Ali. Eno Barber. I expect that's a joke you'll find funny. I expect that's a joke with a cultural reference that isn't too fucking tough for you to pick up. He doesn't get it, Waldo pouts. He hasn't had halfway enough to drink, he says. Hawthorne leans in on Ormus, blasting him with a fog of whisky breath. Listen, Mowgli, he says, not without aggression, you're our fucking guest here, see. How'd you expect to understand the fucking host culture if you insist on remaining teetotal, if you obstinately refuse to fucking integrate in this obstinate fucking Paki obstinate bastard way? Maybe he's too good for us, Waldo ponders. Too good for Harveys Bristol Cream. Too good for the finest British sherry our father's money can buy. Mull Standish, with the help of the motor-launch captain, leaves the Frederica. Now that you boys have started getting on so well, he says, I'm sure the station will just go from strength to strength. God save the Queen, Hawthorne Crossley salutes his father extravagantly. And he probably ought to keep an eye on that Elizabeth Windsor as well. In Ormus Cama's classic rock 'n' roll belter Ooh Tar Baby' - an encrypted remembrance of his English years, sung in the sour-sour, down and dirty cool-cat growl that became his abiding gift to the singers of the New York underground -the Tar Baby is England itself. England kidnaps people, he says in interviews, when, on his comeback tour, late in his career, he breaks the habit of a lifetime and consents to a few journalistic encounters. England seizes hold, he says, and won't let go. It's uncanny. You arrive for whatever reason, just passing through en route to the rest of your life, but watch out, or you'll get stuck for years. That old Tar Baby, you can greet her courteously but she won't give you the time of day, you can speak to her as nice as pie but she won't act polite, 'til finally you're so ticked off that you bust her in the mouth, and then, too late!, you're held fast. Once you attack her You're in her thrall. It's a strange kind of love, what I call stuck love, but you can't get away. You're only some dumb rabbit anyhow, how smart can you be to be punching out that sticky old sister, if you know what I mean. So you're hanging there, and you can't help yourself, you're beginning to think in a way she's cute, but then you start worrying that maybe in the bushes there's that hungry fox, lying low and saying nothing and waiting for his supper. Ooh Tar Baby yeah you got me stuck on you. Ooh Tar Baby and I can't get loose it true. Come on Tar Baby won't you hold me tight, we can stick together all through the night. Ooh Tar Baby and maybe I'm in love with you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/04/scotlanddevolution.devolution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-04T08:43:47Z","webTitle":"Fling the odd stone for these Holyrood knights\u0085","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/04/scotlanddevolution.devolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/04/scotlanddevolution.devolution","fields":{"headline":"Fling the odd stone for these Holyrood knights\u0085","bodyText":"On July 1, the Scottish Parliament begins its first session.

Certainly not religion, or the worship of God. So if you tune into ITV's religious flagship, the newish programme Sunday Morning, prepare for a big surprise. This time last year, after decades of formulaic religious telly, you'd have known what to expect. ITV's The Morning Service had trundled around Britain, providing fly-on-the-wall broadcasts from parish churches of such a variable quality that even religious leaders called for vicars to be given media training before being placed before cameras. But it was greatly appreciated in old people's homes, and by those unable to go to church. It had a small but intensely loyal audience, says the Independent Television Commission. But religious programmes are feeling the winds of competition in the same way as other key forms of public service programming, such as news and current affairs. The BBC is similarly experimenting with The Heaven &amp; Earth Show, a funky studio-based Sunday morning magazine programme. The good news is that all broadcasters are trying to broaden the genre's appeal and - to some extent - cope with a multicultural society. But the bad news is that they limit themselves to lip-service by continuing to screen religious programmes in off-peak hours, with tiny budgets to match. Back to Sunday Morning, which has replaced the Morning Service, with a start-time awkwardly varying depending on whether ITV is covering a Grand Prix. Once the theme music has faded, you see a glowing, squeaky-clean yellow pine studio set, where the greatest sin would be to drop an apple core. Resembling holy clones of Richard and Judy are husband-and-wife presenters Michael Nesbitt and Lynda Bryans. Both possess educated Northern Irish accents and pleasant manners. In their secular lives, they jointly present Ulster Television's evening news. Bryans is a practising Christian, a Presbyterian, Nesbitt an agnostic. They've not been selected on religious grounds. Their differences provide a bit of grit. An hour-long magazine format is a big break with tradition, because it acts as a wrapper around a reduced helping of old-fashioned worship. This is the key reason why everyone is extremely twitchy about it, and why once a month ITV is still running a straightforward service (yesterday from King's College, Cambridge). A typical edition of Sunday Morning might look at package holidays for pilgrims, faith healing and complementary medicine. Daily Telegraph agony aunt Anne Atkins takes calls. (Sample: 'I'm a 20-stone new mother suffering from low esteem and am too demoralised to go to the gym.') There can be reviews of uplifting films, such as the animated version of the Moses story, and singing - Irish country singer Daniel O'Donnell went down best with viewers. Nesbitt says: 'We try to avoid being churchy. But by being relevant, we hope we may surprise people.' ITV has to screen two hours of religious programming a week - it's ordained in the 1990 Broadcasting Act - to include acts of worship involving the viewer and 'reflecting the predominant beliefs of the United Kingdom'. So Nesbitt and Bryans, having warmed up the audience, then hand over to a religious figure, a vicar or minister, who conducts a specially devised act of worship, including hymns and a homily. For many the uneasiest televisual moment comes when the vicar is praying in his cosy studio seat. Should he close his eyes and address God? Or stare at the camera and speak to viewers? 'The act of worship,' says editor Michael Talbot, a veteran producer of religious programmes for Anglia, 'is the part that is most debated by the programme-makers'. The Lord's Prayer is going to be reinstated each week, so people can join in. Care is taken not to offend the elderly: looking at an ad campaign comparing Jesus to Che Guevara was deemed too edgy. Talbot is also introducing a new weekly strand where well-known figures discuss their beliefs. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Chief Rabbi have been invited. The ITC did get protests at the beginning. But audiences had been falling. Sunday Morning has stabilised them. The ITC's latest performance review said of ITV's religious output: 'quality overall was variable'. The changing coverage is due to be debated in June at the next meeting of the Central Religious Advisory Committee (CRAC), which advises broadcasters. It's not the only experiment: ITV's portfolio also includes religious quizzes and an animated version of the Bible. A series on the seven deadly sins will be followed by one on 20th-century vices, such as individualism and consumerism. On BBC1, The Heaven &amp; Earth Show is lively and topical, but marred by looking like a low-budget regional magazine show masquerading as a network programme. Typical topics include Buddhism, food for Passover and the fad for saying 'sorry'. 'We deal with the ethical questions, with what makes people tick,' says producer Chris Loughlin. 'It's less about religion, more about life.' Reverend Ernest Rea, head of BBC Religious Broadcasting, says: 'We're trying to deal with the audience as they are, rather than as we would perhaps expect them to be. We recognise that the inside of a church is an alien environment for many people.' Even Songs of Praise - a BBC1 fixture for 38 years - is evolving, screening services from unexpected places and incorporating more discussion. Editor Hugh Faupel says: 'Religious departments used to be fairly ecclesiastical in the early days of public service broadcasting. Now there's a debate about religious programmes going on, about what the audience needs.' But there is a problem. Sunday morning is a ghetto: no more than 750,000 viewers tune in for religion. The other slots are late on Sunday evening, where, for example, Everyman, BBC1's provocative strand, is in good shape. ITV is also balancing Sunday Morning with the ambitious series Two Thousand Years, Melvyn Bragg's history of Christianity. The key point is that the great questions about life and death and the forces of good, evil, charity and faith never change. They are intrinsically interesting. Hardly ghetto subjects. They deserve greater attention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/apr/05/japan.socialexclusion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-05T02:23:27Z","webTitle":"Cycles of deprivation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/05/japan.socialexclusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/05/japan.socialexclusion","fields":{"headline":"Cycles of deprivation","bodyText":"Businessmen in Japan, according to a report on the Today programme, are being taught how to laugh. Classes assemble at six in the morning to take instruction from a 52-year-old 'smiling guru' whose name I didn't quite catch. This entrepreneur maintains that in the sort of recession now afflicting Japan, orders are likely to go to people who smile. Present a beaming face, the beaming guru assures his beaming pupils, and your profits will rise by 80 per cent. Once he's got Japan smiling, this miracle worker should head for East Anglia, a region which appears to have some kind of humour deficit. A survey carried out by BT and published last month names it as Britain's least amusing region. The account I read gave little explanation of how this truth was arrived at, and but for one consideration we'll come to later, I would simply have classed it as yet one more of the whimsical attempts to interpret our national life to which we are daily subjected. Another such recent enterprise was a 'National Enjoyment Report' which the Independent told us had been carried out for the car manufacturer Seat by Reading University. This claimed that most people in Britain would rather stay at home watching TV than go out or have sex. Sex was rated highest, it said, in Scotland, Wales and (allegedly unamusing) East Anglia. One is rarely told the size of samples involved, but it's clear why those who conduct them liked to give their surveys a regional twist. It hugely enhances the chances of catching the eyes of news editors in places like Norwich. Indeed I'm surprised that the BBC Radio 2 'poll' of songs of the century which most newspapers carried on Saturday didn't include any regional breakdowns, showing, for instance, that Sally, Pride of Our Alley, by Gracie Fields, was still top of the charts in Lancashire, or that A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square, rated a modest 90th nationally, was a perky 14th in London. They'll have sacrificed some local coverage there. Two questions always arise from these surveys which hardly ever get answered. If such regional differences really exist, what accounts for them? And what, if anything, short of importing smiling gurus from Tokyo, ought to be done about it? For elucidation one naturally turns to a source of regional information which, having nothing to sell, seems inherently rather more trustworthy: the government publication Regional Trends. But here we encounter a difficulty. Most commercially driven surveys use the old government statistical regions, of which East Anglia is one. But last Thursday, England's eight new regional development agencies opened their doors for business. Whether or not they are part, as a piece in the Daily Mail claimed, of a master plan by Eurocrats to destroy the United Kingdom is disputable. But they've clearly abolished East Anglia. East Anglia is now part of a package described as the East, which spreads westwards as far as Luton. And most of the figures in Regional Trends are already concerned with the East and not with East Anglia. No matter: let us try to discern such features as may be found in the East which might help explain the humourlessness of East Anglia. Its people, I see, consume unusually high proportions of milk and cream, the highest outside Northern Ireland. They are also conspicuous meat eaters. They are way ahead of all other regions in the possession of dishwashers, and just ahead on deep freezers and mobile phones. They go in more than most for swimming and gardening. They own rather more cars than the national average and travel further to work. And their crime rates are mercifully low. Could there be concealed in these figures that holy grail of statistically-minded persons, a correlation? One cannot be sure, but I think that I may have found one. The figures show that they cycle far more than the rest of us. And as readers of novels by Flann O'Brien will know, when people spend most of their time on bicycles, personalities start to merge. I become part of my bicycle, and my bicycle part of me. Since bicycles, for all their other incontrovertible merits, are remarkably humourless creatures, their prevalence may well account for the finding that East Anglians score low on amusingness. It remains to be pointed out that such allegations are nothing new. Where, I wondered on reading about this survey, had I heard such a claim made before? And then it came back to me: in a poem by an East Anglian about one of the region's fine cities. Rupert Brooke in The Old Vicarage, Grantchester: For Cambridge people rarely smile Being urban, squat and packed with guile. No claim there, I note, to any statistical significance. But perhaps he was on to something."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/apr/05/johnezard","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-05T02:23:28Z","webTitle":"BBC puts 'Brits' in their places","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/05/johnezard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/apr/05/johnezard","fields":{"headline":"BBC puts 'Brits' in their places","bodyText":"Rioting fans of English football teams must no longer be labelled as 'British' in news bulletins - and subtitles should never be used for Scots talking English even if their accents are 'indecipherable' to wider audiences. These are among new rules in BBC guidelines issued to reflect sensitivities as Scotland and Wales head towards devolution. The guidelines, disclosed yesterday, tells news and current affairs broadcasters that the words British and English used indiscriminately can be insulting. A memo released at staff seminars last week says 'British' cannot continue to be used as a blanket term: 'The words 'British' and 'English' are not interchangeable. The words nation, country and capital can be interpreted differently by different audiences. 'When we talk about things affecting 'the whole nation' or happening 'across the country', these phrases can mean different things to our audiences in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 'It is better that programmes broadcast throughout the United Kingdom talk about things happening 'across the United Kingdom' or 'UK-wide' when that is what they mean.' The stylebook, allows use of the word British in commercial contexts and in deployment of military forces. It stresses the delicacy of words in sports coverage. Supporters of an English football team who cause trouble should be reported as 'English', not 'British', hooligans. On Northern Ireland, 'particular sensitivity is required. While some people regard themselves as British, others regard themselves as Irish. When referring to the population as a whole we should use the term 'the people of Northern Ireland' - but not 'the Northern Irish'.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/apr/05/lockerbie","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-05T16:06:14Z","webTitle":"Robin Cook: 'If the two men are innocent they have nothing to fear from Scottish justice'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/05/lockerbie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/apr/05/lockerbie","fields":{"headline":"Robin Cook: 'If the two men are innocent they have nothing to fear from Scottish justice'","bodyText":"Two years ago when I first entered this building I asked for a review on the Lockerbie file. The conclusion I came to was that we were getting nowhere; and I found it hard to meet the relatives of the victims, and to hear from them how they could see no prospect of obtaining justice or of seeing a legal process. I came to the conclusion that we could not secure progress on Lockerbie without a fresh initiative, and at the end of 1997 when Madeleine Albright stayed with me at Christmas, we agreed that we would try to put together an initiative for a trial in a third country as an offer to the Libyan government. I will be frank, I am not entirely sure, when we started out on that process, that we understood quite what a long slog we were letting ourselves in for. It took 9 months of tough legal negotiation in order to secure the arrangements for that trial in a third country. I would want to express my thanks to the government of the Netherlands who willingly agreed to be the host for the trial and have reinforced the Netherlands' reputation as a seat of international justice. I have visited Camp Zeist, which they have made available to us and which is now under Scottish jurisdiction. Camp Zeist will provide excellent facilities for a modern courtroom, a strong prison and also a very large gymnasium for the ladies and gentlemen of the press who will be in attendance at the court. I would also want to record my appreciation of the close cooperation that we have had throughout this entire project from the Lord Advocate and his staff, without whose whole-hearted commitment to this project we would not have succeeded in making those legal arrangements. We launched the initiative in August in this room, and since then we have put in long, hard, patient, diplomatic effort. I do not think there has been a week since August in which at some time I have not asked what effort more we can put in to convincing Libya that this was an offer made in good faith and without a hidden agenda. By the end of last year we had met all the concerns of the Libyan government, bar one - which was the place of imprisonment - and for a while it looked as if negotiations would break down over the demand by Libya that if convicted the two suspects should not serve their sentence in Scotland. That was a point of principle on which we could not compromise, and on which we have not compromised. But at the end of the year I did offer that we would accept UN observers to monitor the conditions and the health of the two suspects if they were convicted. We have nothing to be ashamed of in Scottish prisons, we have nothing to hide, we are very happy to welcome that international observation provided our requirement that if sentences are passed are served in Scottish jurisdiction, in Scottish prisons. That offer appears to have cleared the last obstacle and all that effort and those patient negotiations have today brought the handover of the two suspects who are about to land in the Netherlands where they will quickly be handed over to Scottish jurisdiction. When that happens I will instruct our representatives at the United Nations to confer with the Secretary General about starting the process to suspend sanctions on Libya. I would want to state that it is not for me or for the government to judge whether these two men are innocent or guilty, that is a matter for the court, and they will have a fair trial in that court. I have always stressed that if the two men are innocent they have nothing to fear from Scottish justice. The obligation for the Foreign Office and for government was to secure the presence of the two accused before a court, and that we have now done. Today's development is important as a breakthrough for three reasons: first, this breakthrough ends a stalemate of 10 years in diplomatic relations and negotiations; secondly, it creates legal history, this is the first time that any country has attempted to carry out a trial under its laws and procedures in a third country; and thirdly it is important because of the relief that it can bring to the relatives of those who died that night over and in Lockerbie. I have met them a number of times over the past 18 months. The most difficult thing for me is that I have not been able to tell them what we know and what we suspect about what happened to their loved ones. Now those relatives will have the opportunity of hearing in open court all the evidence we have which is the result of the longest and largest police investigation in British history. Just before coming here I met with Pam Dicks, the Secretary of the UK Families Group. She expressed her huge relief at this development today. Often what we do in this building as diplomats must appear remote to the people we serve. In this case diplomacy is having a direct impact on the lives and the emotions of our people. Some people have said in the past that there never would be a trial into the Lockerbie bombing. I must confess there have been moments in the past year when I wondered if they might be right - but we have now proved them wrong, we have secured the surrender of the two suspects and there is going to be a criminal trial into this act of mass murder. QUESTION: How crucial was Nelson Mandela's role in this whole business? How significant was his statement at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh in 1997 about the inappropriateness of having a trial in Scotland? FOREIGN SECRETARY: Nelson Mandela and a number of other international leaders, particularly from Saudi Arabia, have been very helpful to us in securing this outcome. You are absolutely right to pick up that Nelson Mandela proposed a trial in a third country at the CHOGM in Edinburgh in October 1997, and one of the great strengths of our initiative was that these people such as Nelson Mandela had made that suggestion after consulting with the government of Libya. And when we accepted that proposal and made it as an offer to Libya, they were then able to go back to Tripoli and say, 'look, you asked us to invite Britain to make that offer, they have now made that offer, having put our own reputation behind the offer we want you to accept it.' That pressure, I think, was very helpful in getting the result. I would also wish to particularly mention the work of Kofi Annan and his legal team. We tasked them in August with making the arrangements for the handover and negotiating the detailed agreement with the government of Libya, I know that they have put in many, many hours of negotiation to make this possible and we are grateful for their patient diplomacy. QUESTION: How quickly do you anticipate relations between the UK and Libya to get back to normal? FOREIGN SECRETARY: The United Nations sanctions will now be suspended, and after 90 days will be lifted depending on Kofi Annan's support; that will resolve the international sanctions on Libya. The United Kingdom does of course also have issues of its own bilateral concerns with Libya, notably the case of the murder of WPC Fletcher. We have said that we would wish to address those issues, and we hope to achieve cooperation with Libya in resolving those issues - hopefully with some good reasonable speed now that we have resolved the Lockerbie case. QUESTION: If the two men are found guilty, are you expecting the Libyan government to pay compensation? FOREIGN SECRETARY: Yes, if the two are found guilty and if they acted on behalf of the Libyan state, we would expect the Libyan state to pay compensation. Currently that is what is underway in relation to the UTA bombing where France has produced a guilty verdict against six Libyans, and where it appears that compensation will be paid. So there is that precedent, and we would expect Libya to meet compensation in those circumstances, but that of course can only happen once we have a verdict from the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/apr/07/12","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-07T01:06:48Z","webTitle":"Lives shattered by rogue missiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/07/12","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/07/12","fields":{"headline":"Lives shattered by rogue missiles","bodyText":"It was not the hand of a nervous Nato pilot or Nato's 'rare error' in driving two deadly missiles into a civilian street in a mining town called Aleksinac, that finally pushed President Milosevic towards a ceasefire - but it was a good day to sell it to his people. The 'barbarity of the Nato fascist air force' is hurting, rattling the human psyche, no matter how tough the TV propaganda claims these people are. For the first days they seemed immune to attacks on obscure army bases; the ministry of the interior buildings in Belgrade were unmourned; but then the bridges went over the Danube to the east, the railway line to the west was cut, the central heating factory, the oil factory and the refineries. Yesterday, the much-repeated TV pictures of the dusty mining town showed the leg of an old man sticking out of the rubble with his bed socks still on - a reminder of just how dirty war can be. Since the beginning, the Serbian information ministry has kept the war's death toll secret. But yesterday for the first time the Serbian ambassador to Moscow gave his people a figure of 300 dead and 3,000 injured - a toll expected to encourage this nervous nation to back a bid for peace. But Nato's sharp and instantaneous rejection of the offer and President Milosevic's record of phoney ceasefires in Bosnia and Croatia means that a 38-year-old teacher called Vucici Muldinovic may not be the last to be buried alive with her two children, her father and her sister in the cellar of a pleasant detached house on Vuk Karadic Street yesterday. Vucici Muldinovic saved her two children, Diana, aged 14 and Milos, 10, but she could not save her 55-year-old father Dragan and her sister Martina, aged 39, an accountant. 'When the cellar came in on top of us we were suffocating and my children were crying 'Mummy, Mummy, save us.' I was digging and digging with my hands to try and get a hole so we could get out. In the end I got through it. Then I pulled my son out and stretched in for the hand of my daughter.' Outside what's left of their house, people are shuffling past to see the damage. General Lubisha Stomirivic of the Yugoslav army arrives in a black land cruiser with a message to Mr Blair, Her Majesty the Queen of England and the United Kingdom. The message is: 'In this suburban street are buried the lies about precision weapons. There are no precision weapons.' The general has a point. In Aleksinac, just off the highway from Belgrade south to Kosovo, seven civilians were killed and around 50 people injured on Monday night. At 9.45pm three of Nato's precision bombs struck. The first gouged a hole in a sugar beet field beside the main road; a second crashed down on the small houses on Kapunka Street and a third landed in the Muldinovic back garden, flattening the house and car. Next door, Serba Stominovic, aged 65, stared into the sitting room of his home that no longer had a wall: 'I began building that house when I was a child. I had two televisions and a grand piano and now everything has gone.' What remains of another two of his neighbours, Vosdam and Dragnica, both in their 80s, is hard to make out. Their bodies are covered in the same red dust of suburban bricks that coated the streets after the explosion. A policeman shines his torch into the rubble and beside their kitchen sink and a toilet bowl is the leg of Vosdam, the old man's thick woolly night sock still in place. 'They were very old and Vosdam was deaf so they didn't go to the shelter at night. Their daughter is a doctor in Nis,' said a neighbour who runs a bicycle shop across the road. Next door in the medical centre, in the room where Dr Dragan Brankovic slept and survived, a glass vase holding tulips has been blown across the table along with the remains of last night's pasta, now covered in the same dust as the old people's bodies. A nurse comes down the stairs screaming at an English photographer, shoving him towards the door: 'You can take your pictures in your own country. Is this a humanitarian action?' The photographer looks away and still full of rage she pushes him again. Dr Brankovic urges her to calm down, but wants to say this: 'In the past two weeks, the leaders in your country have been behaving like badly treated psychiatric patients.' But the general, striding along Vuk Karadzic Street, has another message. 'This is a genocidal anti-Serb air operation. America, France, Germany and Britain have proved that fascism was not buried at Nuremburg. Here in one of the oldest streets in this town named after the great Serbian poet, Vuk Karadizc, who was our Shakespeare, I ask the mothers and children of the Nato pilots to be ashamed of the work of their sons and fathers in our land in the last 13 days. Their account will be paid in the future.' Someone asks the general about the work of the sons and fathers of the Yugoslav army against the refugees in Kosovo. He blames the bombs of Nato for their crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/07/uk.politicalnews1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-07T01:07:17Z","webTitle":"Tax holds the key, says SNP leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/07/uk.politicalnews1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/07/uk.politicalnews1","fields":{"headline":"Tax holds the key, says SNP leader","bodyText":"The battle which will decide whether Scotland breaks away from the United Kingdom began in earnest yesterday as the political parties launched their election campaigns with a prediction that tax will be the main fighting point. Although the Liberal Democrats were the first to set out their stall under a 'Raising the Standards' banner, it was at the Scottish National Party's packed media centre in Edinburgh that the real combat began. Launching his party's campaign, the SNP leader, Alex Salmond, predicted that the elections to Scotland's first parliament in almost 300 years would be fought with tax as the key issue. His party has set itself apart from the political consensus by pledging to use the tax-varying powers of the Scottish Parliament to forgo the 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax announced by the Chancellor last month. Despite slipping further behind Labour in the opinion polls, Mr Salmond maintains he is confident that the Scottish electorate is prepared to give up the tax cut in favour of increased public expenditure. 'The contest between investment in public services and a penny tax bribe is one that the SNP will win decisively,' said Mr Salmond. 'The SNP are entering this election campaign with by far the strongest level of support in our history. 'There is everything to play for over the next four weeks and Scotland's party are playing to win.' But within the hour the Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, accused Mr Salmond of avoiding the real issue of the election: the SNP's desire to take Scotland out of the union. 'Divorcing Scotland from Britain has for 75 years been the sole reason for the SNP's existence,' he said. 'This must be the first time in political history that a separatist party has tried to conceal its sole purpose for existing from the electorate.' The SNP will not launch its manifesto until tomorrow, but yesterday the party unveiled its key policy commitments for the Scottish Parliament. A pledge to hold a referendum on independence within the first four-year term was part of those commitments but it comes last in the list. Over the last few weeks Mr Salmon has been shifting his party increasingly to the left, particularly with his criticism of Nato's 'unpardonable folly' in Kosovo, in the hope that he can capture the traditionally left-wing Scottish audience disaffected by New Labour. According to the latest ICM poll he has had some success, with his decision to forgo the penny tax cut finding favour with 54 per cent of voters. Despite this, support for his party is slipping in the opinion polls. The elections on May 6 to the Scottish Parliament will be in two stages. The first vote is based on the first-past-the-post system used for Westminster, and the SNP is running at 33 per cent in the polls in this section, compared to Labour's 47 per cent. The second vote in the election - the additional member vote - introduces a proportional representation element. Here the electorate must vote for a party, rather than an individual. The SNP stands at 31 per cent in this section, with Labour on 43 per cent. If these results were translated into seats on polling day it would leave Labour with 60 seats, the SNP with 41, the Conservatives with 15 and the Lib Dems with 13. The most likely scenario is that Labour will have to rely on some form of coalition with the Liberal Democrats, although the latter party's leader, Jim Wallace, has refused to rule out a coalition with the SNP, provided the SNP did not insist on a referendum on independence. Launching the party's campaign, Mr Wallace, said he would not be drawn into what will undoubtedly become an increasingly bitter battle between the SNP and Labour. 'We must not allow this election to be dominated by those who shout the loudest,' he said.

As they approached Edinburgh, and as the early evening sunlight sharpened their view of the Highlands and the Borders, the debate turned to Scotland. Would it ever become independent? With the certainty of a heavyweight politician, the future Chancellor of the Exchequer predicted that Labour's devolution plan would kill off the Scottish National Party and, with it, the demand for independence. But he was wrong. But as the election campaign for Scotland's new parliament got underway this week the SNP - and the demand for independence - are stronger than ever. Labour should emerge from the polls as the overall winner, but many in Scotland believe independence is now inevitable: not this summer, but maybe after the next Scottish election in 2003 or the one after that in 2007. Brown and Tony Blair are faced with the very real danger of the 291-year-old Union between England and Scotland being dismembered. The Scottish Question remains unanswered and the forces of the Union are having to rethink, regroup and prepare to strike back. It has been a faltering response so far. Brown, deputed by Blair to sort it out, has been in the vanguard, struggling to come up with a coherent strategy. Behind him is a ramshackle, fractured alliance that includes, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, the Queen, the BBC, Scots living in London, trade unions, TV chefs, record producers, journalists such as Andrew Neil and politicians from the right such as the former Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind. Blair was ambivalent about devolution in the first place: it was a policy he inherited. Now he is said by those round him to be 'tearing his hair' out at the lack of impact his party has had on the SNP over the past year. When SNP leader Alex Salmond announced he favoured a 1p tax rise, and again when he distanced himself from the Government strategy on Kosovo, Labour piled in with full-page newspaper advertisements denouncing his policies. In the Treasury, and in Labour's Scottish headquarters in Glasgow, Delta House, the party's brightest have been struggling with ways of making the image of Britain more attractive for Scots. 'Cool Britannia had no resonance for most people,' said one of those formulating the new image of Britain. 'They all felt it was something happening somewhere else which they had no part in.' Many Scots never regarded themselves as British anyway. That view of identity has increased with each generation: Scots now present themselves as both Scottish and European, but not British. Why should they remain part of the United Kingdom any longer? Brown and his colleagues have been working on an answer. With Douglas Alexander, the young Labour MP for Paisley South, he has been updating the last modern critique defending the Union, written by John Mackintosh, a highly respected Labour MP, in the 1970s. In March, they completed their pamphlet New Scotland, New Britain, which will form the basis for Labour's Scottish election campaign. They have had to find 'a new language' that will make the Union attractive and wrest it back from the negative images it conjures up - of thuggery abroad, Ulster Unionism, the National Front and racism. One Scottish trade unionist, Bill Speirs, noted recently that a chant popular among racists was: 'There ain't no black in the Union Jack.' Blair, making the case for the Union in a speech to the Scottish Labour conference last month, recalled how the two countries had stood 'together to fight fascism'. That is a matter of pride but one with less and less resonance, especially for those under 50. More effective was his call for joint pride in building a welfare state. Labour is repackaging the Union as cosmopolitan, inclusive, multi-national, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, an exciting experiment in social democracy and social justice that has an equal place not only for the Scots and Welsh but for Asians and blacks. 'It is essentially an anti-Little Englander view,' a Downing Street source says. There was no mention of Northern Ireland Catholics, but that may reflect Labour's unspoken belief that in the long-term their future probably lies more in an all-Ireland than all-UK solution. The Government will emphasise, as it has already begun to, 'national' institutions that people can feel pride in, such as the National Health Service, and Britain's peacekeeping role in the world. Britain's other institutions are joining in the fight against Scottish independence: the monarchy has been in discussion with the Government about how to confront nationalism, and a series of ideas have been floated to give the monarchy more of a Scottish dimension than holidaying at Balmoral. Outwardly, at least, the policy is confused. Buckingham Palace dismissed as 'speculation' reports that Princess Anne, a regular at Scottish rugby internationals, will take a higher profile in Scotland and the Queen establish a secretary north of the border. The spokesman said that the Queen's role in the opening of the Scottish Parliament on July 1 had not yet been resolved and no one was thinking beyond that. Labour MPs are not amused by the Palace's apparent failure to muck in when the Union is threatened. A source close to the campaign accused the Palace of pandering to nationalism: 'What the monarchy has to do is modernise itself, not attempt to put a kilt on itself.' But it may be that the monarchy has decided its best tactics will be to rise above the devolution/independence debate and for Prince Charles to present himself as - happily - either a future king of Britain or, if necessary, of England and of an independent Scotland. The BBC, another UK institution once regarded as a unifying force, has in recent months been doing its bit for the battered Union, resisting pressure from its Scottish staff for a Scottish Six O'Clock News to give proper prominence to day-to-day coverage of the Scottish Parliament. The fear among Unionists was that a Scottish Six would see Scots turn inwards. Meanwhile, the Government has been hauling in businessmen to write letters to the Scottish press denouncing nationalism. In a letter to Scotland on Sunday, 10 Scottish businessmen, including Tom Hunter, who built up Sports Division, and John Boyle, who runs Direct Holidays, warned of the dangers of separation. The heads of the big banking and insurance companies have kept a lower profile, many of them discredited by association with the Tory campaigns against devolution. The SNP is now able to field its own businessmen who will publicly support independence. On the celebrity front, the forces of the Union have thrown up Nick Nairn, the chef from the Ready, Steady, Cook TV programme, who warned it was 'important we get rid of the Braveheart mentality', and Paul Gascoigne's former hairdresser, Taylor Ferguson, who described the SNP as 'third division.' Carrying more weight, at least with under-30s, is Alan McGee, owner of Creation Records, who told the Daily Record: 'Artists like Primal Scream, Teenage Fanclub, Jesus and Mary Chain, Edwyn Collins and Simple Minds have put Scottish culture on the world stage and didn't need to break away from the rest of the UK to do it.' In any case, Scotland has a strong cultural identity already. In the 1980s, it underwent something of a renaissance as writers, musicians and actors sought ways to reinforce the Scottish identity under threat from Thatcherism. Independence versus devolution is now more of a political issue than a psychological, sociological or cultural one. The trade unions have been muted in the debate so far, partly because some of them are angry with the Government over being ignored for so long. But behind the scenes, Labour is approaching unions asking for funds, secretarial help and office space to help fight the election. The Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary, Bill Speirs, who happily describes himself as a 'Marxist in a suit', supports the Government's quest for a modern version of the United Kingdom. Maybe a decisive gesture is needed to persuade Scots and others that they are equal partners in the United Kingdom. Maybe a name change will do it. No one refers to Great Britain anymore, or even the British Isles, except as a geographical entity. It could be time to drop Britain and, with it, the Union Flag. Speirs says: 'The Union Jack symbolises some of the best aspects of the state for older people, but for younger people it represents thuggery. One that represents diversity might be better.' Perhaps the simplest step Labour could take to defend itself against Scottish nationalism would be to recognise the change that has taken place in Scotland. Instead of talking about devolution - an ugly word which, like subsidiarity, has no resonance - it could return to Home Rule. This idea has had a currency in Scotland since the last century, but Labour in the 1980s thought it smacked too much of independence and dropped it. Yet Home Rule explains better than devolution the huge change that is taking place in Scotland and in the United Kingdom as a whole - and recognition of the scale of change is the best way to preserve the special relationship between Scotland and England."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/1999/apr/07/balkans","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-07T01:07:30Z","webTitle":"Lives shattered by rogue missiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/07/balkans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/07/balkans","fields":{"headline":"Lives shattered by rogue missiles","bodyText":"It was not the hand of a nervous Nato pilot or Nato's 'rare error' in driving two deadly missiles into a civilian street in a mining town called Aleksinac, that finally pushed President Milosevic towards a ceasefire - but it was a good day to sell it to his people. The 'barbarity of the Nato fascist air force' is hurting, rattling the human psyche, no matter how tough the TV propaganda claims these people are. For the first days they seemed immune to attacks on obscure army bases; the ministry of the interior buildings in Belgrade were unmourned; but then the bridges went over the Danube to the east, the railway line to the west was cut, the central heating factory, the oil factory and the refineries. Yesterday, the much-repeated TV pictures of the dusty mining town showed the leg of an old man sticking out of the rubble with his bed socks still on - a reminder of just how dirty war can be. Since the beginning, the Serbian information ministry has kept the war's death toll secret. But yesterday for the first time the Serbian ambassador to Moscow gave his people a figure of 300 dead and 3,000 injured - a toll expected to encourage this nervous nation to back a bid for peace.

Behind him is a ramshackle, fractured alliance that includes, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, the Queen, the BBC, Scots living in London, trade unions, TV chefs, record producers, journalists such as Andrew Neil and politicians from the right such as the former Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind. Blair was ambivalent about devolution in the first place: it was a policy he inherited. Now he is said by those round him to be 'tearing his hair' out at the lack of impact his party has had on the SNP over the past year. When SNP leader Alex Salmond announced he favoured a 1p tax rise, and again when he distanced himself from the Government strategy on Kosovo, Labour piled in with full-page newspaper advertisements denouncing his policies. In the Treasury, and in Labour's Scottish headquarters in Glasgow, Delta House, the party's brightest have been struggling with ways of making the image of Britain more attractive for Scots. 'Cool Britannia had no resonance for most people,' said one of those formulating the new image of Britain. 'They all felt it was something happening somewhere else which they had no part in.' Many Scots never regarded themselves as British anyway. That view of identity has increased with each generation: Scots now present themselves as both Scottish and European, but not British. Why should they remain part of the United Kingdom any longer? Brown and his colleagues have been working on an answer. With Douglas Alexander, the young Labour MP for Paisley South, he has been updating the last modern critique defending the Union, written by John Mackintosh, a highly respected Labour MP, in the 1970s. In March, they completed their pamphlet New Scotland, New Britain, which will form the basis for Labour's Scottish election campaign. They have had to find 'a new language' that will make the Union attractive and wrest it back from the negative images it conjures up - of thuggery abroad, Ulster Unionism, the National Front and racism. One Scottish trade unionist, Bill Speirs, noted recently that a chant popular among racists was: 'There ain't no black in the Union Jack.' Blair, making the case for the Union in a speech to the Scottish Labour conference last month, recalled how the two countries had stood 'together to fight fascism'. That is a matter of pride but one with less and less resonance, especially for those under 50. More effective was his call for joint pride in building a welfare state. Labour is repackaging the Union as cosmopolitan, inclusive, multi-national, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, an exciting experiment in social democracy and social justice that has an equal place not only for the Scots and Welsh but for Asians and blacks. 'It is essentially an anti-Little Englander view,' a Downing Street source says. There was no mention of Northern Ireland Catholics, but that may reflect Labour's unspoken belief that in the long-term their future probably lies more in an all-Ireland than all-UK solution. The Government will emphasise, as it has already begun to, 'national' institutions that people can feel pride in, such as the National Health Service, and Britain's peacekeeping role in the world. Britain's other institutions are joining in the fight against Scottish independence: the monarchy has been in discussion with the Government about how to confront nationalism, and a series of ideas have been floated to give the monarchy more of a Scottish dimension than holidaying at Balmoral. Outwardly, at least, the policy is confused. Buckingham Palace dismissed as 'speculation' reports that Princess Anne, a regular at Scottish rugby internationals, will take a higher profile in Scotland and the Queen establish a secretary north of the border. The spokesman said that the Queen's role in the opening of the Scottish Parliament on July 1 had not yet been resolved and no one was thinking beyond that. Labour MPs are not amused by the Palace's apparent failure to muck in when the Union is threatened. A source close to the campaign accused the Palace of pandering to nationalism: 'What the monarchy has to do is modernise itself, not attempt to put a kilt on itself.' But it may be that the monarchy has decided its best tactics will be to rise above the devolution/independence debate and for Prince Charles to present himself as - happily - either a future king of Britain or, if necessary, of England and of an independent Scotland. The BBC, another UK institution once regarded as a unifying force, has in recent months been doing its bit for the battered Union, resisting pressure from its Scottish staff for a Scottish Six O'Clock News to give proper prominence to day-to-day coverage of the Scottish Parliament. The fear among Unionists was that a Scottish Six would see Scots turn inwards. Meanwhile, the Government has been hauling in businessmen to write letters to the Scottish press denouncing nationalism. In a letter to Scotland on Sunday, 10 Scottish businessmen, including Tom Hunter, who built up Sports Division, and John Boyle, who runs Direct Holidays, warned of the dangers of separation. The heads of the big banking and insurance companies have kept a lower profile, many of them discredited by association with the Tory campaigns against devolution. The SNP is now able to field its own businessmen who will publicly support independence. On the celebrity front, the forces of the Union have thrown up Nick Nairn, the chef from the Ready, Steady, Cook TV programme, who warned it was 'important we get rid of the Braveheart mentality', and Paul Gascoigne's former hairdresser, Taylor Ferguson, who described the SNP as 'third division.' Carrying more weight, at least with under-30s, is Alan McGee, owner of Creation Records, who told the Daily Record: 'Artists like Primal Scream, Teenage Fanclub, Jesus and Mary Chain, Edwyn Collins and Simple Minds have put Scottish culture on the world stage and didn't need to break away from the rest of the UK to do it.' In any case, Scotland has a strong cultural identity already. In the 1980s, it underwent something of a renaissance as writers, musicians and actors sought ways to reinforce the Scottish identity under threat from Thatcherism. Independence versus devolution is now more of a political issue than a psychological, sociological or cultural one. The trade unions have been muted in the debate so far, partly because some of them are angry with the Government over being ignored for so long. But behind the scenes, Labour is approaching unions asking for funds, secretarial help and office space to help fight the election. The Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary, Bill Speirs, who happily describes himself as a 'Marxist in a suit', supports the Government's quest for a modern version of the United Kingdom. Maybe a decisive gesture is needed to persuade Scots and others that they are equal partners in the United Kingdom. Maybe a name change will do it. No one refers to Great Britain anymore, or even the British Isles, except as a geographical entity. It could be time to drop Britain and, with it, the Union Flag. Speirs says: 'The Union Jack symbolises some of the best aspects of the state for older people, but for younger people it represents thuggery. One that represents diversity might be better.' Perhaps the simplest step Labour could take to defend itself against Scottish nationalism would be to recognise the change that has taken place in Scotland. Instead of talking about devolution - an ugly word which, like subsidiarity, has no resonance - it could return to Home Rule. This idea has had a currency in Scotland since the last century, but Labour in the 1980s thought it smacked too much of independence and dropped it. Yet Home Rule explains better than devolution the huge change that is taking place in Scotland and in the United Kingdom as a whole - and recognition of the scale of change is the best way to preserve the special relationship between Scotland and England."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/07/otherparties.uk1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-07T17:13:35Z","webTitle":"Tax holds the key, says SNP leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/07/otherparties.uk1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/07/otherparties.uk1","fields":{"headline":"Tax holds the key, says SNP leader","bodyText":"The battle to decide whether Scotland breaks away from the United Kingdom began yesterday as the political parties launched their election campaigns with a prediction that tax will be the main fighting point. Although the Liberal Democrats were the first to set out their stall under a 'Raising the Standards' banner, it was at the Scottish National Party's packed media centre in Edinburgh that the real combat began. Launching his party's campaign, the SNP leader, Alex Salmond , predicted that the elections to Scotland's first parliament in almost 300 years would be fought with tax as the key issue. His party set itself apart from the political consensus by pledging to use the tax-varying powers of the Scottish Parliament to forgo the 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax announced by the Chancellor last month. Despite his party slipping further behind Labour in the polls, Mr Salmond maintains he is confident that the Scottish electorate is prepared to give up the tax cut in favour of increased public expenditure. 'The contest between investment in public services and a penny tax bribe is one that the SNP will win decisively,' said Mr Salmond. 'The SNP are entering this election campaign with by far the strongest level of support in our history. There is everything to play for over the next four weeks - and Scotland's party are playing to win.' But within the hour the Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, accused Mr Salmond of avoiding the real issue of the election: the SNP's desire to take Scotland out of the union. 'Divorcing Scotland from Britain has for 75 years been the sole reason for the SNP's existence,' he said. 'This must be the first time in political history that a separatist party has tried to conceal its sole purpose for existing from the electorate.' The SNP will not launch its manifesto until tomorrow, but yesterday the party unveiled its key policy commitments for the Scottish Parliament. A pledge to hold a referendum on independence within the first four-year term was part of those commitments - but it comes last in the list. Over the past few weeks Mr Salmond has been shifting his party increasingly to the left - particularly with his criticism of Nato's 'unpardonable folly' in Kosovo - in the hope that he can capture the traditionally leftwing Scots disaffected by New Labour. According to the latest ICM poll he has had some success, with his decision to forgo the penny tax cut finding favour with 54% of voters. Despite this, support for his party is slipping. The elections on May 6 to the Scottish Parliament will be in two stages. The first vote is based on the first-past-the-post system used for Westminster, and the SNP is running at 33% in the polls in this section, compared with Labour's 47%. The second - the additional member vote - introduces a proportional representation element. Here the electorate must vote for a party, rather than an individual. The SNP stands at 31% in this section, with Labour on 43%. If these results were translated into seats, it would leave Labour with 60 seats, the SNP with 41, the Conservatives with 15 and the Lib Dems with 13. The most likely scenario is that Labour will have to rely on some form of coalition with the Liberal Democrats, although their leader, Jim Wallace, has refused to rule out a coalition with the SNP, provided the SNP did not insist on a referendum on independence. Launching the party's campaign, Mr Wallace, said: 'We must not allow this election to be dominated by those who shout the loudest.' Nicholas Watt adds: Gordon Brown has stamped his mark on Labour's campaign for the Scottish Parliament by transferring one of his key political advisers from the Treasury to Glasgow. Ed Miliband, who is part of the Chancellor's inner circle, will take a central role in the final weeks of Labour's campaign in Scotland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/apr/08/balkans10","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-08T02:39:19Z","webTitle":"Independent thoughts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/08/balkans10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/08/balkans10","fields":{"headline":"Independent thoughts","bodyText":"Stimulated by the shooting down of that very expensive Stealth bomber, an old friend of mine is proposing a novel solution to the Kosovo crisis.

Taken to its extreme conclusion, it might even end it all. Tony Blair's dream The May elections lead to the creation of a Labour administration in Scotland. The new proportional AMS electoral system ensures representation for the Conservative Party, which greatly assists Labour in reducing the more menacing twin threat of the Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats. Armed with considerable powers of patronage, Donald Dewar, Tony Blair's faithful new first minister in Scotland, also keeps the threat from the Labour left firmly in check. The government legislation which created the Scottish parliament left many questions on the division of power between Westminster and Edinburgh unanswered. But a clever set of \"concordats\", quietly drawn up by Mr Dewar in the months preceding the election, help to keep the division of power firmly in Mr Blair's favour. In Wales, Labour duly becomes the majority party by a massive margin. While PR provides Plaid Cymru with a stronger voice, it also fragments the opposition to Labour. And the difficult job Tony Blair had foisting loyal Blairite Alun Michael as the head of the Welsh assembly pays dividends. Mr Michael soon proves his ability to doggedly follow Mr Blair's brief without ever appearing a lap-dog. There are inevitable conflicts between Mr Blair's government and the new assemblies. But central government continues to hold the whip hand, with both assemblies ultimately utterly dependent on substantial Treasury subsidies to support their regions and their operations. Tony Blair's generous suggestion in 1999 that the eight regional development agencies could be transformed into elected assemblies heralds a transformation of local government. A burgeoning spirit of economic reform and democratic accountability sweeps through the UK's once-dilapidated regions. The raft of new unitary authorities which follow the Scottish and Welsh assemblies prove more efficient and easier for central government to manage than the morass of different tiers that existed in 1999. In Europe, the national Government continues to dominate. Although the EU's principle of subsidiarity points towards a recognition of the regions and the regional assemblies implement almost all European directives, Tony Blair's ministers continue head negotiations in EU talks. The regions, like Scotland, don't even enjoy observer status in the European Council and Council of Ministers' meetings. As other European leaders struggle with the continent's petty separatists and nationalistic squabbles, Tony Blair is lauded as the radical who reshaped the United Kingdom. He is heralded as a true moderniser, brave enough to devolve power in the name of ideals, and he reaps a grand political prize at the next general election for his devolutionary courage. Tony Blair's nightmare Tony Blair's nightmare is much, much longer. Rather than a single event, devolution could turn out to be, in the words of the Scottish Nationalists, a continuous process. The nightmare actually began back in 1994, when Tony Blair inherited the Labour's devolution plans from the late John Smith. At best a lukewarm supporter of devolution, Mr Blair felt compelled to accept the issue to demonstrate his radical intent and pacify key Scottish allies such as Gordon Brown. But Tony Blair's nightmare begins in earnest this May. Labour's selection process for its candidates' list in Scotland fails to prevent the election of a large number of left-wingers within the party. More seriously, Labour fails, like every party in Scotland since the Tories in the 1950s, to win more than 50 per cent of the vote. Thanks to proportional representation, Labour is forced to share power with the Scottish Lib Dems (also well to the left of Tony Blair). Mr Blair's nightmare could take a turn for the worse if Labour fails to get in power at all in Scotland. Instead, an unlikely SNP-Lib Dem coalition excludes Labour and instantly instigates the SNP's proposed 1p \"tartan\" income tax. To the exasperation of Chancellor Gordon Brown, this is soon expanded as the Scottish government takes full advantage of the 3 per cent difference from British income tax rates it is permitted. Shortly afterwards, as the SNP now demands, tuition fees are abolished for Scots but not for English students. The nightmare switches to Wales. Although the Welsh assembly lacks the tax-raising powers of the Scottish parliament, the May elections bring nothing but embarrassment. By a bizarre misfortune, Mr Blair's loyal Welsh Labour leader Alun Michael fails to get elected to the assembly. The Ron Davies fiasco forced Mr Blair to parachute him into the job in February, which was too late to give him a secure candidate seat. Placed on Labour's top-up list for mid-Wales instead, Mr Michael fails to get a seat because, paradoxically, Labour do so well in the constituency section they don't qualify for any additional MPs from the party list. A bit of Machiavellian manoeuvring finds Mr Michael a seat and the position as Welsh Labour leader, but the party faithful in Wales, already annoyed that favoured son Rhodri Morgan isn't leader, are incensed. Disillusioned left-wingers flock to Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Assembly becomes a vociferous and unruly focus for opposition against Blairism. There follows an endless series of conflicts between Mr Blair's Government and an obstreperous Welsh assembly and an independence-seeking Scottish parliament. Just as Britain rows with the rest of Europe over its EU rebate or its unique culture, so Mr Blair's Government faces arguments from Scotland for extra subsidies from the Treasury and demands from the Welsh for their own National Curriculum. After the 2003 election to the Scottish parliament, the SNP demands - and gets - Scottish independence from a faltering Labour Government. Mr Blair is forced to undertake a tricky reform of Westminster to exclude Scottish MPs, the vast majority of which formed Labour's now-dwindling majority in the House of Commons. And it doesn't end there. Scottish home rule and Welsh devolution push forward the debate on English regionalism. Ably assisted by money (£75,000 from the Rowntree Reform Trust) and God (the Archbishop of York as its president), the Campaign for Yorkshire's drive for an independent assembly gathers momentum. The regional bureaucracy Labour created in 1999 (in the form of eight regional development agencies) provides the motor for the creation of regional democracy. The growing clamour of the regions receives a receptive ear in Europe. By the end of his second term, Tony Blair finds himself a powerless national figurehead at European Council meetings, as the EU veers ever-nearer to a United Regions of Europe. But the most nightmarish image, the one that jolts awake Tony Blair from fretful slumbers, is closer to home. It is Ken Livingstone's grinning visage, arms aloft in triumph, on the steps of the new London Mayoral office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/10/uk.politicalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-10T02:28:53Z","webTitle":"Scottish election temperature rises as Brown and SNP clash on tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/10/uk.politicalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/10/uk.politicalnews","fields":{"headline":"Scottish election temperature rises as Brown and SNP clash on tax","bodyText":"The temperature in the Scottish election campaign was raised yesterday as more than 100 businessmen claimed in a two-page newspaper advertisement that the nationalists would raise taxes and put jobs at risk. Meanwhile, Scottish Nationalist Party leaders seized on a report from an Edinburgh think-tank which reinforced the case for Scotland going it alone. The Chancellor, Gordon Brown, had mobilised businessmen to attack the SNP's left-leaning economic policies, hours after three respected academics reported that Scotland would be better off with SNP-backed independence than with Labour's devolution. The report - by David Simpson, honorary professor of economics at Heriot-Watt university, Brian Main, professor of economics at Edinburgh university, and Sir Alan Peacock, former chief economic adviser to the Department of Trade and Industry - said independence would improve Scotland's economic performance. The finding has quickened the pace in the campaign for next month's Scottish parliamentary elections, now largely focusing on the economy, with increasingly bitter exchanges between Labour and the SNP. After meeting some of the businessmen, led by David Murray, who heads a string of companies and chairs Rangers football club, Mr Brown added: \"The people who have signed the advert agree with the case we are putting forward namely that the SNP are a threat to Scotland's economic interests.\" Tony Blair, on a two-day visit to Scotland, told a business audience in Inverness that devolution offered Scotland 'the best of both worlds\". He added: 'Services can be made more accountable to people. People can do those things that are distinctively Scottish in a distinctively Scottish way while maintaining the unity of the United Kingdom.\" The elections on May 6 would be a very simple choice between Lab-our's plans and the SNP's determination to separate Scotland from the UK. Independence would be 'disastrous for business, for rates of tax and enterprise within Scotland\". Yesterday's skirmishes were partly overshadowed by the announcement of plans for the royal opening of the first Scottish parliament in almost 300 years. At the Edinburgh ceremony, on July 1, the Queen and the royal party will dress informally. There will be no crown, or ceremonial robes traditionally worn at the opening of the Westminster. A thousand children from every part of Scotland will parade from Edinburgh's old Parliament Square to the temporary home of the parliament alongside the 129 newly elected MSPs. Celebrations will include an RAF fly-past. \u0095 William Hague gave his approval for the Tories to issue a humiliating apology to the people of Scotland for being \"arrogant and out of touch\" when they were in government, writes Nick Watt.

Atavistic English nationalism, it seemed like. But this wasn't a gathering of the right: it was a Fabian Society seminar the other day. When the gentle left starts getting hot under the collar (and the same event heard some dark foreboding from the eminent Professor Ben Pimlott) something is up(1). Of course the Fabians belong to the political class. On doorsteps, the 'West Lothian question' isn't an issue. But there's motion detectable on two fronts. If they were to come together... The first area where there's lots of talk is English identity. This is slippery terrain: old maids on bikes, warm bitter, cricket on the village green - imagery meaningless to the vast majority of urbanised, sophisticated, internet-surfing residents of the real England. But those St George's flags on cars and vans last June pointed to something beyond support for a second-rate football team. How to deconstruct Shekhar Kapur's movie Elizabeth: he's an Asian and the financing was from abroad but the film had an unmistakably English-celebratory tone. Even in debate about daylight saving time there's a new edge of English self-consciousness: why should clocks be changed for the benefit of kids going to school in Glenrothes? Some talk is little more than the good-humoured whinging which characterises every pluralist political entity. (Did you hear the one about the Englishman, Scotsman and Welshman...?)

Elsewhere on the right, there's enthusiasm - Lord Baker, the ex-Home Secretary, bemoans a new 'democratic deficit' south of the border. Eric Forth, a Scot sitting for unCeltic Chislehurst, says creating an English Parliament would precipitate the radical restructuring of representation at Westminster, something which reform of the House of Lords would demand anyway.

Where might Lord Thomas (a good English name that) take his complaint? An emerging answer is that a reformed Commons could still accommodate English needs. Why do we need symmetry? The West Lothian cliche has it that after devolution English MPs will be unable to vote on Scottish schooling policy while MPs from Banff and Buchan could vote on measures affecting the schools of Brixton and Bridport. Yet there have been virtually no occasions reported when specifically English measures have been interfered with by Scottish MPs and, besides, everyone lived happily with a West Lothian situation when the Stormont Parliament existed.

Besides, Vernon Bogdanor, the Oxford constitutionalist, argues that if the Barnett formula continues, it demands the presence at Westminster of Scots and other non-English MPs since what Scotland gets depends on changes in Britain-wide spending levels. Commons operations will alter. From next month MPs will not be able to question ministers at Westminster on issues that have been passed to the Scottish Parliament. That position mirrors the situation when Stormont functioned. Mooted is a ban on Westminster MPs attacking Members of the Scottish Parliament but not yet, a reciprocal ban in Edinburgh. The Commons leader, Margaret Beckett, has called for a 'spirit of tolerance' between the separate chambers, analogous to the code which regulates relations between the Commons and the House of Lords.

At present there are 71,000 Scottish constituents per Westminster seat compared with 93,000 English; the logic is fewer Scottish seats. But the key to fundamental change is consciousness.

Anyone expecting the colourful rowdy scene recreated in the Oscar-laden film Shakespeare in Love, will be disappointed. The Rose, the earliest and most intact surviving Elizabethan theatre, is buried for safe keeping under three feet of sand, cement and water in a specially constructed vault under a hideous 13-storey 1980s office block at Bankside, London. 'It is a sacred site,' Sir Tom Stoppard, scriptwriter of Shakespeare In Love, said yesterday. 'How can you go further than that? It will be completely without significance for some people, and of as great importance to others as any place in the kingdom. I think it is important.' 'There is no substitute for the real thing,' Janet Suzman, a patron of the Rose Theatre Trust, said. 'This wet nappied ruin can tell us more about the Elizabethans, not so we can copy them, but so we can understand their swiftness of mind and imagination, their subtlety, their humanism.' Ultimately the trust hopes to raise £8 million to complete the excavation about a quarter of the building was outside the original dig and preserve the fragile remains so they can remain on permanent view. In the meantime visitors will see a video about the theatre, built by Philip Henslowe in 1587 and enlarged in 1592 so it held more than 2,000 patrons, and eclipsed soon afterwards by a larger theatre within earshot, the Globe, which promptly poached his star playwright as well as his audiences. Lights will pick out the lines of the foundations of the building, which was abandoned by 1606."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/apr/14/peterhetherington.terrymacalister","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-14T02:08:20Z","webTitle":"Ministers urged to save shipyard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/14/peterhetherington.terrymacalister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/apr/14/peterhetherington.terrymacalister","fields":{"headline":"Ministers urged to save shipyard","bodyText":"Ministers were under mounting pressure last night to bail out the threatened Govan shipyard on the Clyde with a lucrative defence-related contract after the Norwegian owners announced they were pulling out of shipbuilding, threatening thousands of jobs. The Kvaerner group announced yesterday that it had put a swath of its engineering and construction operations in the United Kingdom up for sale, with 5,000 jobs at risk. Worldwide it plans to cut 25,000 jobs and close 13 shipyards in an attempt to cut debts of £575 million. With the yard's impending closure likely to become a key feature of the Scottish election campaign, senior Labour figures in Scotland are hoping that the Defence Secretary, George Robertson MP for Hamilton, near Glasgow will throw Govan a lifeline. The Scottish National Party principal challenger to Labour described the closure threat as a 'spoke in the wheel for Labour's faltering good news machine' . The SNP's deputy leader, John Swinney, said it would be indefensible if the Government denied Govan substantial aid after having promised BMW up to £180 million to rescue the Longbridge car plant in Birmingham. Since Kvaerner bought Govan 11 years ago, the company has received up to £90 million from the Government to help it modernise. But the Scottish industry minister, Lord Macdonald, said the yard's 1,200 workers knew that the Scottish Office soon to be absorbed by a new Edinburgh government could not be blamed for a financial crisis facing an international company. The minister insisted a contract for six roll-on-roll-off specialised ferries, which will be used partly for transporting the army's rapid reaction force, was not in the gift of the Government. Several consortiums are bidding for the work, which could be spread among several yards and engineering complexes. But there are fears that the work could go abroad. Unions urged the Government not to let that happen. 'Scotland needs engineering and manufacturing jobs: we simply cannot rely on call centre, supermarket or burger bar jobs,' said Danny Carrigan, Scottish regional secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. 'Although we expected the bad news, confirmation has brought doom and gloom and despondency to the Clyde. 'Lord Macdonald tried to sound an optimistic note. He said he believed the yard had considerable potential, adding: 'The shipyard has benefited greatly from its ownership by Kvaerner. It is now a modern, productive shipyard capable of building ships to the highest technical specification. It has good labour relations and modern working practices. 'That progress was not achieved without some pain but equally was only achievable with the wholehearted support of the entire workforce.' Unions say privately, that the Government will have some unpalatable questions to answer if the yard closes. But shop stewards remain cautiously optimistic that a government-appointed task force, led by the former engineering union leader Sir Gavin Laird, himself a Clydesider, will find some way of providing the yard with a breathing space. It is already undertaking sub-contract work for Harland and Wolff in Belfast, amid speculation of a bigger link-up between the two. Industry experts said the chances of finding a new buyer for the yard were slim although Cammell Laird Holdings, a former shipbuilder recreated as a vessel repairer, said it would be willing to 'take a look'. Sir Gavin said the task of rescuing Govan was 'difficult but not impossible'. He told workers not to give up hope. The yard's managing director, Gunnar Skjelbred, who broke the news to his staff early yesterday, praised workers for revolutionising working practices and making the yard one of the most efficient in Europe. The sale is a another blow for industrial Clydeside. Unemployment in Govan, at almost 20 per cent, is almost double the Glasgow rate, which is itself more than twice the British average. Workers were yesterday handed the statutory 90-day redundancy notices as a prelude to closure. The yard employs 850 directly with a further 350 sub-contractors. A large gas turbine plant at nearby Clydebank, owned by Kvaerner, is also under threat. It employs 720. But the Government task force believes it is a prime candidate for takeover. Overall in the UK Kvaerner has put up for sale businesses employing 5,000 staff including Cleveland Bridge Engineering and Kvaerner Metals. The Clyde has been building ships since the early part of the last century and there were once 14 yards on the upper sections of the river alone. But the Clyde builders followed the pattern seen on the Tyne and Wear, almost disappearing under the impact of foreign competition based on cheaper labour and more modern equipment and sites. Martin Stopford, former head of business development at state-owned British Shipbuilders, which controlled Govan, said the yard was in serious financial trouble even then. 'When some of the top management at British Shipbuilders were told a Norwegian company [Kvaerner] was interested in buying Govan, they couldn't believe they were serious,' he recalled yesterday. But Mr Stopford, now managing director at shipbroker H.Clarkson, said there was an honourable tradition of former UK shipbuilders recreating themselves in different sectors. Meanwhile, the Trade and Industry Secretary, Stephen Byers, was meeting Kvaerner main board director John Fletcher last night in an attempt to help with Govan and the other businesses under threat. Mr Byers said: 'We shall be working closely with Kvaerner to identify potential purchasers. These are key manufacturing facilities which we need to secure for the future.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/1999/apr/15/genetics.uknews","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-15T14:59:32Z","webTitle":"'Snips' of DNA may help fight disease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/apr/15/genetics.uknews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/1999/apr/15/genetics.uknews","fields":{"headline":"'Snips' of DNA may help fight disease","bodyText":"Ten pharmaceutical giants and five world famous laboratories are to join forces today in a £30 million attempt to create a new picture of humanity and a new kind of medicine. Everyone shares 99.9 per cent of the 100,000 genes that could make up humans, and the remaining 0.1 per cent accounts for all variety in people. These differences are hallmarked as SNPs or 'snips' single nucleotide poymorphisms, or tiny changes in the genetic code. The consortium plans to identify at least 300,000 such changes, many of which could be markers for a propensity to diabetes, asthma, or more obvious hereditary diseases. Knowledge of these could lead to medical treatment specifically tailored to individuals and open the way for entirely new treatments. Ultimately, using a new kind of diagnostic tool, a DNA chip, general practitioners should be able to tell, from a simple saliva test, whether a patient is likely to be allergic to penicillin, will respond to one drug better than another, or could be at higher than usual risk of cancer or Alzheimer's disease, and produce the right treatment at the first prescription. 'This is the first real product of the human genome project. This really is going to have a major impact,' said Michael Morgan, of the Wellcome Trust, the charity which is investing £9 million in the two year effort. 'It will also have major scientific impact at the level of understanding humans as a species where we come from and how we relate one to another, how we relate to the rest of the animal kingdom.' Even before international teams of geneticists complete their map of the human blueprint - the 3 billion letters of the genetic code - scientists and drug designers will start assembling the tiny genetic signposts that point to the differences between individual humans. Partners in the SNP consortium are the Sanger centre in Cambridge and four leading US laboratories, along with Astra-Zeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Hoffman La-Roche, Glaxo Wellcome, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Novartis, Pfizer and SmithKline Beecham. The information will not be patented, but will be available without charge to all researchers, whether members of the consortium or not, says its chief executive, Arthur Holden. One of the US partners in the consortium is the Cold Spring Harbor laboratory, research base of James Watson, who 10 years ago launched the huge international attempt to map every gene in the human population, and who more than 40 years ago helped decipher the famous double-helix structure of DNA itself. The search for the human genetic blueprint has already begun to change medicine. With the SNP database, doctors could hope for a new way to cure the patient rather than simply treat the symptoms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/apr/16/18","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-16T01:30:12Z","webTitle":"Black and Asian jobs at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/apr/16/18","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/apr/16/18","fields":{"headline":"Black and Asian jobs at risk","bodyText":"Unemployment among black and Asian workers is likely to soar as the economic slowdown forces firms to cut jobs, trade unionists warn today. As many as one in six black and Asian workers could be out of a job by the end of next year, according to a report from the TUC. Ethnic minority workers are already more than twice as likely to be jobless as white workers, and the TUC says they will be first in line for lay-offs when unemployment starts to rise. 'Given the concentration of ethnic minority communities in parts of the country with either a weak economy - inner London - or which are overly reliant on manufacturing - as in the West Midlands and Yorkshire - the future looks bleak for the 40 per cent of black and Asian workers living in these areas,' says the TUC report. White workers have the lowest unemployment rate at 6 per cent, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, followed by Indian workers with 8 per cent. Black and Pakistani workers are faring much worse with unemployment rates of 14 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. The gap between white workers' and ethnic minority workers' unemployment rates has widened during the nineties, according to ONS research. Ten years ago, ethnic minority workers were 1.7 times as likely to be unemployed as white workers. By spring 1998, the odds had risen to 2.4 - before falling back to just over two time as likely in the latest figures.

While workers from some of the ethnic minority groups are less likely to have qualifications than white workers -which makes it harder for them to get work - recent academic research suggests about half the difference between the respective unemployment rates is explained by racial discrimination.

With elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly three weeks away, Mr Brown said nationalists had risen high in polls in Scotland not because Scots wanted to break away from the union, but because institutions had failed to reflect the modern shared values of Britain. Although the SNP has for some months been neck and neck with Labour, support for the party has fallen dramatically since Alex Salmond accused Nato of 'unpardonable folly\" in Kosovo. Labour currently stands at 43 per cent, while the SNP stands at 35.7, which would leave Labour only nine seats short of an overall majority in the new parliament. In his speech to the Smith conference at the LSE, Mr Brown challenged the SNP 'to come clean about the costs of divorce the black hole in their plans\". A survey carried out for the conference said 75 per cent of people had agreed 'the people of Britain derive positive benefits from living and working together\", while 84 per cent agreed that it was important for Britain to be a strong force in the new global economy. 'People not only think that we are better off united, worse off divided, but also believe that the set of common values shared by England, Scotland and Wales is a good argument for the Union,\" said Mr Brown.

This only goes to prove that Theroux never started his travels from Sheffield, but I suppose we already knew that. The day in late November that I travelled from Sheffield to Blackpool with my oldest and best friend, Steve, we'd clocked 96 miles by the time we got there. If you live in Sheffield (as I did until I was 20, and as my friend Steve, a road safety officer by profession and an experimental electric guitarist by nature, still does), the closest seaside is either east through Lincolnshire to Skegness and Mablethorpe, or west over the Pennines to Blackpool; only a few miles further, but far more entertaining. My earliest memories are of Uncle Oliver hiring a Morris Oxford for the day, and taking a car-load of us to Blackpool. The surviving black-and-white snapshots show various family members bundled in coats and scarves, posing in front of the car, or standing on the sand next to donkeys, with the Tower dimly visible in the background. None of us looks as though we're having much fun, least of all the donkeys. Steve didn't leap at the idea of a day-trip to Blackpool. He is no more the sort of man who goes there these days than I am. He thought of it as grim, downmarket, not our kind of place. He thought he'd moved on, as indeed did I. But I wanted to see if it was really as grim as I remembered, and perhaps whether I'd really moved on at all. I don't think it had much to do with searching for our working-class roots, yet, as we drove over the Snake Pass, through fog and rain, Steve and I did compete to see who had the more authentically gritty upbringing. I recalled how my dad used to take me to the Sheffield fish market, where he'd have a plate of whelks while I had cockles. Steve countered by saying that his dad used to take him to the same market, but they'd have plates of tripe. I couldn't compete with that. The bad weather seemed perfectly appropriate, only to be expected, and, yet, as we arrived in Blackpool the rain was stopping and the sky was brightening. The town had the vastest car parks we'd ever seen, lot after lot, and most of them were completely empty. We were way ahead of those who'd decided to wait and see what the weather did before committing themselves to a day at the seaside. Blackpool day-trippers are a prudent bunch. Inevitably it was still cold, but the sun came out, and the sky turned a scarcely credible Mediterranean blue. And the sea looked blue as well, and very clear, and very nearly inviting. We remembered the sea at Blackpool resembling cold tea, the beach looking like a war zone. Now, the sands were smooth and empty, and the tide was a long way out. It was not what we'd expected at all. In 1964, when my grandfather died, my parents announced, somewhat apologetically, that my grandma would be coming on holiday with us that year. I can't remember feeling especially resentful, although my grandma was a pretty remote figure to me at that time, as she always remained. My parents had been aficionados of Butlin's holiday camps. I don't know why. I suppose they were cheap and I suppose they were good places to take kids. We'd been to Filey and Bognor Regis, and since Blackpool in those days had a Butlin's Hotel, they booked us in there probably thinking it would be a place that would suit both a kid and a grandma. The day we arrived, I wandered through the hotel looking for the swimming pool, the fairground rides, the doughnut shops, the ping-pong tables, that had been part of the holiday camp experience. They weren't there, and you can understand why. Since the hotel couldn't possibly compete with the attractions on the streets of Blackpool it didn't even try. The hotel was in sight of the Roberts Oyster Rooms, a place I remember looking at with longing. My grandma had been known to knock back an oyster or two, but my parents had never allowed me to try one, warning me against oysters in much the way they'd warned me against blue cheese (\"It's got worms in it\") and against champagne (\"It just tastes like cider\"). Since then I've learned to love oysters, but Steve, I discovered that day in November, had never tasted one, so in the spirit of leading him into gentle temptation we went to the Roberts Oyster Rooms and I ordered a plate of oysters and, after some coercion, got him to try one. He was wary, but once he'd summoned up the courage, he reckoned it slid down a treat, though one was plenty. We had some discussion about class and food, about oysters being one of the more volatile class indicators. One century they're peasant food, the next they're as posh as you can get. Not that there was anything conspicuously posh about the Roberts Oyster Rooms. The nice old guy who opened the shells for us looked like he'd been shucking since God was a boy. His hands looked like bleached lumps of frozen suet, and frankly his shucking wasn't all that wonderful. The shells splintered, and he lost, deliberately I think, most of the liquor. And I suppose if we'd been somewhere actually posh, the oysters would have come with lemon wedges or Tabasco, but here there was salt, pepper and malt vinegar. Was it intolerably effete and affected of me to want lemon juice on my oysters? I didn't think so, but I feared the old oyster man might, so I took what I was given, and the oysters were fine, really they were, but they'd have been better with a squeeze of lemon. The Butlin's Hotel is now the Metropole, and it looks rather grand; a splendid, complex, curvy redbrick affair. I think my parents might have thought it looked a bit too posh for them, but Steve reckoned that staying in any sort of hotel would have been a step up for his family. They'd always stayed in caravan sites. There's a huge, impressive war memorial outside the Metropole, commemorating dead of the world wars, and a single casualty from the Falklands. We thought this was a peculiar thing to have on the Golden Mile, but then, the Golden Mile does have certain paradoxical qualities, since it's not a mile long, and it certainly isn't golden. In November, most of its souvenir shops and rock shops were shut. The few attractions that were open had a chilly desperation about them. We passed a stall where you could play \"Regulation Darts\" for prizes; none of those nasty old unregulated darts for us. The barker who tried to draw us in seemed both forlorn and threatening. It wasn't tempting. Steve and I are men of a certain age, and independently we, or perhaps our spouses, have decided we look best when we dress to show a certain gravitas. We were both wearing long, sober if stylish, wool overcoats. Everyone else in town seemed to be wearing sporty, shiny, man-made outfits, and it brought back some memories. Steve and I went to the same posh grammar school in Sheffield - not that posh at all, in retrospect, but these were the days of school uniforms, of school caps for God's sake, and these had the same effect on certain tough kids that the sight of Reynard has on fox hounds. They'd have the urge to attack you because of what you were wearing, and sometimes they gave in to that urge. The rationale was simple. Only stuck-up puffs wore school uniform, because only stuck-up puffs went to the posh grammar school. The fact that we lived on the same council estate as they did made no difference. Stuck-up puffs deserved a good hiding. QED. We didn't think we were in danger of getting beaten up in Blackpool, but we knew we didn't look as though we belonged. People looked at us with suspicion, and nobody is more aware of working-class suspicion than those of us who like to think we've edged out of the working class. When my father died, the family rallied round, and Uncle Jim and Auntie Brenda took my mother to Blackpool. Jim had a recommendation for the best working-man's club in Blackpool, and he could get them in because there was reciprocal membership with the club he belonged to in Sheffield. \"I don't know why we need to go to a working-man's club,\" my mother said. \"The whole place is like one big working-man's club, anyway.\" I was never sure to what extent she meant this as a condemnation. As a matter of fact, Blackpool wasn't always like this. In the late 18th century, rich folks went to Blackpool for the \"bathing season\". Given the climate, this must have been one of the shortest seasons imaginable. In 1846, the railway arrived, and so did the working classes - from the Lancashire mills. The barbarians came flooding in. Now, Blackpool is not only proud to be working class, it's in danger of turning itself into a sort of working-class theme park. For example, you'll not only find a Coronation Street museum there, you'll see illuminated images of the cast diplayed on the lamp-posts, Ena Sharples and Elsie Tanner included. Steve and I tried to recall how many years ago Ena Sharples left the show, how many years ago she died. But Steve insisted he still had great affection for Elsie Tanner, or at least for Pat Phoenix, who played her. In the Sixties, Pat had opened a new off-licence near where he lived. Real glamour. Blackpool and Coronation Street have this in common: they both celebrate a warmly inauthentic version of working-class life. They're nostalgic for a past that never existed, yet they somehow know this. I'm not sure this makes Blackpool a masterpiece of irony, but it does mean there's something winningly self-aware and self-mythologising about the place. Naturally, the Coronation Street museum was closed, and, frankly, Steve and I weren't sure which of Blackpool's attractions were really for us. We were fascinated by the sign for the \"World Famous Palace Discotheque\", though, as Steve pointed out, its fame hadn't spread quite as far as Sheffield. There were also posters up for a bare-torsoed dancer, who was referred to as Vladimir from Las Vegas, and we wondered if he was known in Vegas as Vladimir from Blackpool. Everyone tells you that Blackpool is considered a gay hot-spot these days. Evidence for this was limited. We came across a gay sex shop, and there was a vast, ship-like pub, Funny Girls, that had a transvestite cabaret. Actually, one of the signs said \"Unny Girls\", because the first letter had fallen off. The window display said, \"Come in and see our ladyboys,\" and there were pictures of the performers, who didn't look much like ladies, or, for that matter, like boys. In fact, they looked like chunky men with big knuckles and lantern jaws, but maybe that was the point. And, of course, drag acts aren't exactly synonymous with gay culture. Any end-of-the-pier comedian will don a frock and impersonate a seaside landlady at the drop of a hat. At the end of the North Pier, someone called Joey Blowers was in residence, a chubby-faced young geezer with a dodgy blond haircut. To be plying the North Pier out of season can't be the best gig in the world, but there are far humbler places to appear. All along the front there were biggish pubs offering their own brand of entertainment. Ian \"Sludge\" Lees had his name in lights at one of them. Steve and I went to the Winter Gardens and we read the roll of honour displaying the names of performers who'd appeared at the theatre in the past. Some of them seemed pure Blackpool - Stanley Holloway, Arthur Askey, Frank Randall, George Formby; but also there were Mrs Patrick Campbell, Weedon Grossmith and the latest addition to the list, Kid Creole. They say there are only three solo acts that fill the Winter Gardens these days; Victoria Wood, Shirley Bassey and Ken Dodd. Needless to say, none of these people would be seen dead there in November. Steve and I decided we'd have fish and chips. They, we agreed, don't much change their status as a class indicator. We found a perfectly good place, fluorescent-lit, Formica-clad, glass-fronted. It was empty when we arrived, but the sight of two men of a certain age in the window eating their fish and chips brought a number of large family groups running in. We ate up and moved on. It was getting cold now, and it would soon be time to go home, so we went to take a last good look at the sea. We agreed that Blackpool hadn't been nearly as \"bad\" as we'd been expecting, and wondered if that wasn't because it was so empty and out of season. Had it actually been functioning at full throttle, if the throngs had been in situ, we'd have felt much more alienated, much more out of place. But we also agreed that what we liked best about Blackpool was the fact that it doesn't feel cosy. It feels rough and hard-edged. The kind of pleasures available here aren't soft or middle-class or Middle England. We could appreciate that, yet we couldn't quite partake. And maybe that was inherent in this project right from the beginning. Steve and I weren't just there to enjoy Blackpool; we were there to observe it and, perhaps, also to observe ourselves observing it; but you trying telling that to the guy on the \"Regulation Darts\" stall. Self-awareness, it'll ruin your day at the seaside every time. Before going home, we decided to go to the Yates's Wine Lodge, which offers \"Champagne on draft\". We imagined the big-biceped barmaid pulling a pump to deliver foaming pints of the stuff, but, in reality, she just served us the house brand straight from an already open bottle. It was a bit warm and a bit flat, and we did think about complaining but decided against it. We didn't want her to think we were a couple of stuck-up puffs. \u0095 Geoff Nicholson's novels, Female Ruins (£9.99) and Flesh Guitar (£5.99), are published by Gollancz."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"theguardian/1999/apr/17/weekend7.weekend2","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-17T04:19:21Z","webTitle":"The butterfly, memory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/17/weekend7.weekend2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/apr/17/weekend7.weekend2","fields":{"headline":"The butterfly, memory","bodyText":"It is 100 years since Vladimir Nabokov was born. It is 50 years since he wrote in his autobiography, \"I confess I do not believe in time.\" It is just under 50 years since he wrote Lolita, which has gone on to sell some 50 million copies. And it seems an eternity since the worlds he calls up in Speak, Memory disappeared. Speak, Memory is the one Nabokov work outside his finest novels - The Gift, Lolita, Pale Fire, Ada - that is a masterpiece on their level. It has been rated the greatest of autobiographies, but since such judgments depend so much on the criteria we bring to them, I will call it only the most artistic of autobiographies. It lacks the probing self-analysis of St Augustine or Tolstoy, or the overt and the inadvertent self-display of Rousseau, the historical and categorical aplomb of Henry Adams, or the sparkling anecdotal flow of Robert Graves. But more than these, and any other autobiographies, it fuses truth to detail with perfection of form, the exact with the evocative, an acute awareness of time with intimations of timelessness. Nabokov confided to his friend Edmund Wilson in April 1947: \"I am writing two things now 1. a short novel about a man who liked little girls - and it's going to be called The Kingdom By The Sea - and 2. a new type of autobiography - a scientific attempt to unravel and trace back all the tangled threads of one's personality - and the provisional title is The Person In Question.\" Partly for financial reasons - a gigantic irony, in view of Lolita's eventual sales - he wrote the autobiography first. It was published in the United States in February 1951 as Conclusive Evidence (\"conclusive evidence of my having existed,\" he would write in 1966), and in Britain as Speak, Memory later that year. Part of the special spell of Speak, Memory is the gap between, on the one hand, his \"perfect past\" (his trilingual upbringing as the favourite child of loving, sensitive, liberal, cultured, fabulously wealthy parents, in St Petersburg, on idyllic country estates, on the beach resorts of southern Europe) and, on the other, the losses that would follow: the poverty and dislocation of exile, the assassination of his father, the long widowhood of his mother, then a second dislocation from the cultural refuge that the Russian emigration in Europe had become, once he crossed the Atlantic. Nabokov, his wife Véra and young son Dimitri migrated to America in May, 1940. The family settled in Massachusetts, where Nabokov, a research fellow at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, wrote his major scientific papers on butterflies. He completed Chapter Fifteen of Speak, Memory in early April 1950 and spent the next month writing a sixteenth. This took the form of a supposed double review of Nabokov's autobiography (with Nabokov referring to himself in the third person) and another, When Lilacs Last, by the invented Barbara Braun. Nabokov decided against publishing it. Bryan Boyd \"Chapter Sixteen\" is published here for the first time in this country, and will, in full, form an appendix in a new edition of Speak, Memory. The two books of memoirs before me, one by a Russian-born author, now a citizen of this country, the other by the granddaughter of a great American educationalist, are extremely elaborate affairs. It is seldom that two such accomplishments reach a reviewer's desk practically on the same day. The small bunch of Mr Nabokov's admirers will be not unreasonably elated by the publication of his new work. Although to subtitle it \"memoirs\" seems an obvious step, there are certain features - not necessarily virtues - about Conclusive Evidence that set it completely apart from extant autobiographies, true, more or less true, or deliberately fictitious. If its originality is not quite as attractive as the deep human glow that suffuses every page of Miss [Braun's] When Lilacs Last, it contains, on the other hand, special sources of pleasure that no intelligent reader should miss. A unique freak as autobiographies go, Mr Nabokov's book is easier to define in terms of what it is not than in terms of what it is. It is not, for instance, one of those garrulous, formless and rambling affairs, heavily relying on a diarist's notes, that experts in other arts or the administrators of our public existence are apt to produce (\"Wednesday night, around 11.40, General so-and-so telephoned. I said to him - \"). Nor is it a professional writer's kitchen, with bits of unused material floating in a tepid brew of literary and personal stuff. Emphatically, it is not the popular slick kind of reminiscences where the author keys himself up to the lofty level of grade-C fiction, and with quiet impudence sets down reams and reams of dialogue (Maw and the neighbor. Maw and the children. Bill and Paw, Bill and Picasso) which no human brain could have preserved in anything approaching that particular form. It would seem to the reviewer that the permanent importance Conclusive Evidence has, lies in its being the meeting point of an impersonal art form and a very personal life story. Nabokov's method is to explore the remotest regions of his past life for what may be termed thematic trails or currents. Once found, this or that theme is followed up through the years. In the course of its development it guides the author into new regions of life. The diamond-pattern of art and the muscles of sinuous memory are combined in one strong and supple movement and produce a style that seems to slip through grass and flowers toward the warm flat stone upon which it will richly coil. Obviously Nabokov's method would lose all sense unless the material were as true an account of personal experience as memory could make it. The selective apparatus pertains to art; but the parts selected belong to unadulterated life. Nabokov's memory, especially in regard to the first 20 years of his life, is almost abnormally strong, and probably he had less difficulty than most memoirists would have had in following the plan he set himself: to stick to the truth through thick and thin, and not be tempted to fill gaps with logical verisimilitudes posing as preciously preserved recollections. The reader will surely enjoy finding for himself the convolutions, the stepping stones, the various smiling disguises of this or that thematic line running through the book. There are some main lines and there are numerous subordinate ones, and all of them are combined in a way recalling chess compositions, riddles of various kinds, but all tending to their chess apotheosis form, in fact, a theme reappearing in almost every chapter: jigsaw puzzles; an armorial checkerboard; certain \"rhythmic patterns\", the \"contrapuntal\" nature of fate; life's \"blending of lines of play\"; a chess game on board ship while Russia recedes; Sirin's novels; his interest in chess problems; the \"emblemata\" on pieces of broken pottery; a final picture puzzle completing the spiral of the theme. Very engaging, too, is the \"rainbow\" theme, which begins with a casual array of colours - stained glass, festive lights, paint, jewels and so forth - and then comes into its own as a prismatic entity in a mountain landscape or beyond dripping trees under which an adolescent poet experiences his first fit of adolescent versification. The reader will follow with pleasure the theme of walks and trails in private parks and ancestral forest that starts in an alley of oaks, leads to curious visions of America in Russian woods and peat bogs, and finally develops into the public gardens and parks that escape to the sea and to other horizons. Possibly the most moving theme in the book is the line of \"exile\", to which I shall have to refer again. In a way Nabokov went through all the sorrows and delights of nostalgia long before the Revolution had removed the scenery of his young years. He is out to prove that his childhood contained, on a much reduced scale, the main components of his creative maturity; thus, through the thin sheath of a ripe chrysalis one can see, in its small wing cases, the dawning of colour and pattern, a miniature revelation of the butterfly that will soon emerge and let its flushed and diced wings expand to many times their pupal size. Vladimir Nabokov was born in 1899, in St Petersburg. His father, also Vladimir, was a highly cultured European, a scholarly statesman, a robust and cheerful rebel, whose brothers and brothers-in-law were, at the best, easygoing conservatives and, at the worst, active reactionaries, but who belonged himself to the Liberal Group that opposed, in Parliament and in widely read periodicals, the autocratic trends and iniquities of the Tsar's regime. American readers of today, whose information concerning Tsarist Russia is thoroughly permeated by Communist propaganda and pro-Soviet accounts that were spread here in the Twenties, will be surprised to learn from various passages in Conclusive Evidence how freely opinions could be expressed and how much could be done by civilised people in pre-Revolution Russia. Life in the wealthy, landowning upper stratum to which the Nabokovs belonged had some affinities with southern opulence in this country [America] and was very similar to manor life in England and France. The summers, spent by the author as a boy in the country, seem to have been especially responsible for shaping him. The region, with its scattered villages among great forests and marshes, was meagrely populated, but numerous ancient footpaths (the mysterious trails that webbed the whole Empire from immemorial times) kept the berry gatherer, the tramp, the squire's pretty children from losing themselves in the woods. And because most of those ways, and the wastes they passed by or led to, were nameless, landowning families, from generation to generation, designated them by the names that under the influence of French governesses and tutors had naturally come into being during the children's daily promenades and frequent picnics - Chemin du Pendu, Pont des Vaches, Amérique and so on. The author of Conclusive Evidence - and, by a pleasing coincidence, the author of When Lilacs Last, too - were the eldest of five children. But unlike Miss [Braun], Nabokov has very little to say about his siblings - two brothers and two sisters - born, respectively, in 1900, 1911, 1902 and 1906. The powerful concentration on one's own personality, the act of an artist's indefatigable and invincible will, has to bear certain consequences and the above phenomenon is, no doubt, one of them. With the author's permission, I am en-abled to mention here some of my accidental contacts with his family. A first cousin of his, also a citizen of this country, tells me that, in their youth, Nabokov's sisters and youngest brother wrote lyrical verse with uncanny facility (shared by countless young Russians of that generation). At a literary soirée in Prague, some time in the early Twenties (1923, probably), I remember Franz Kafka's friend, -, the talented Czech translator of Dostoevski and Rozanov, pointing out to me Nabokov's mother, a small grey-haired woman in black accompanied by a young girl with limpid eyes and a radiant complexion, Nabokov's sister Elena. In the Thirties, when living in Paris, I happened to meet Nabokov's brother, Sergei: despite less than a year's difference between the two, they seem to have led totally separate lives since early adolescence, attending different schools and having different sets of friends. When I knew Sergei he was drifting in a hedonistic haze, among the cosmopolitan Montparnassian crowd that has been so often depicted by a certain type of American writer. His linguistic and musical gifts dissolved in the indolence of his nature. I have reason to think that his childhood had never been as happy as that of his parents' favourite son. Accused of Anglo-Saxon sympathies, Sergei, an outspoken and fearless man, despite his effeminate looks, was arrested by the Germans and died in a concentration camp in 1944. In the beautiful pages of When Lilacs Last that tell of Miss [Braun's] earliest recollections, she alludes to the security of a world in which the tapping of sugar maples or the birthday cake their mother made were natural and permanent fixtures, as familiar and dear to the New England patrician or Philadelphia princeling of today as they had been to his simple, hardworking forefathers two or three generations before. The world of Nabokov's past, on the other hand, has a singular air of luminous brittleness that is one of the main themes in his book. With great perspicacity, Nabokov stresses the very curious previsions of later losses, which haunted his childhood - enhancing perhaps its delights. In a conspicuous spot of his St Petersburg nursery there hung a small coloured picture \"in the bright sportive English style, used for hunting scenes and the like, that lends itself so well to the making of jigsaw puzzles\"; it represented, with appropriate humour, a French nobleman's family in exile: daisies studded a meadow and there was a cow somewhere under a blue sky, and the fat elderly nobleman, in his brilliantly speckled camisole and puce breeches, sat dejectedly on a milking stool while his wife and daughters busied themselves with some daintily hued washing on a clothesline. Here and there on the Nabokovs' estate in the country, the author's parents, as if come home after years of travel, would point out the fond landmarks of events unfolded in an impalpable but somehow ever-present past. In the cypress alleys of Crimean gardens (where Pushkin had walked a hundred years before), young Nabokov amused and annoyed a girl friend of his, who had a taste for romantic literature, by commenting upon his own movements or words in the reminiscent, slightly mincing manner his companion might be supposed to develop many years later when writing her memoirs (in the style of memoirs connected with Pushkin): \"Nabokov liked cherries, especially ripe ones,\" or \"He had a way of slitting his eyes when looking at the low sun,\" or \"I remember one night, as we were reclining on a turfy bank - \" and so forth - a game that was surely silly but seems less silly now when it is seen to fall into the pattern of predicted loss, of pathetic attempts to retain the doomed, the departing, the lovely dying things of a life that was trying, rather desperately, to think of itself in terms of future retrospection. When the Revolution broke out in spring 1917, Nabokov senior participated in the Provisional Government and later, when the Bolshevik dictatorship took over, was member of another short-lived Provisional Government in the frail still free South. The group to which these Russian intellectuals belonged, Liberals and non-Communist Socialists alike, shared the basic views of Western democrats. However, American intellectuals of today, who got their Russian history from Communist or Communist-sponsored sources, simply know nothing about the period. Bolshevik histories naturally played down pre-Revolution democratic struggle, minimised and violently distorted it, and hurled at it coarse propaganda insults (\"reactionaries\", \"lackeys\", \"reptiles\" etc), not unlike the way Soviet journalists dub today surprised American officials \"Fascists\". The surprise is 30 years late. The readers of Nabokov's book will notice the extraordinary similarity between the present attitude of former Leninists and disgruntled Stalinists in this country toward Soviet Russia and the unpopular opinions Russian intellectuals kept expressing in émigré periodicals during the three decades immediately following the Bolshevik Revolution, while our enthusiastic radicals were prostrating themselves in adoration before Soviet Russia. One has to assume that the émigré political writers either were many years ahead of their time in the understanding of the true spirit and inevitable evolution of the Soviet regime, or that they possessed an intuition and a foresight bordering on the miraculous. We vividly visualise Miss Braun's college years. Not so with the author of Conclusive Evidence, for he has nothing to say whatsoever about the classes he surely must have attended. After leaving Russia at the outset of the Soviet era, Nabokov completed his education at Cambridge University. From 1922 to 1940, he dwelt in various parts of Europe, mainly Berlin and Paris. Incidentally, it is curious to compare Nabokov's rather gruesome impressions of Berlin between the two wars with Mr Spender's contemporaneous but far more lyrical recollections (as published in the Partisan a couple of years ago), especially the bit about \"relentlessly handsome German youths\". In describing his literary activities during the years of voluntary exile in Europe, Mr Nabokov adopts the somewhat annoying method of referring to himself in the third person as \"Sirin\" - a literary pseudonym under which he was, and still is, well known in the limited but highly cultured and discriminating world of Russian expatriates. It is true that having practically stopped being a Russian writer, he is free to discuss Sirin's work as separate from his own. But one is inclined to think that his true purpose here is to project himself, or at least his most treasured self, into the picture he paints. One is reminded of those problems of \"objectivity\" that the philosophy of science brings up. An observer makes a detailed picture of the whole universe but when he has finished he realises that it still lacks something: his own self. So he puts himself in it too. But again a \"self\" remains outside and so forth, in an endless sequence of projections, like those advertisements that depict a girl holding a picture of herself holding a picture of herself holding a picture that only coarse printing prevents one's eye from making out. In fact, Nabokov has gone a step further and under the mask of Sirin has projected a tertiary persona called Vasili Shishkov. This action was the outcome of a ten-year-old feud he had been carrying with the most gifted of the émigré critics, George Adamovich, who had rejected at first, then reluctantly accepted and finally admired with many an enthusiastic flourish Sirin's prose, but still kept pooh-poohing his verse. With the sporting co-operation of a review's editor, Nabokov-Sirin assumed the name of Shishkov. On an August day in 1939 Adamovich, reviewing in the Russian- language newspaper Posledni ja Novosti (published in Paris) the 69th issue of the quarterly Sovremennyja Zapiski (also published in Paris), lavished inordinate praise on Shishkov's poem The Poets and suggested that at this late date the Russian emigration might have at last produced a great poet. In the fall of the same year, in the same newspaper, Sirin described at length an imaginary interview he had had with \"Vasili Shishkov\". In a groggy but still game reply Adamovich said that he doubted it was a hoax but added that Sirin might be inventive enough to enact inspiration and genius that would greatly surpass his, Sirin's, capacities. Very soon after that the World War II put an end to Russian literature in Paris. I am afraid I cannot quite believe the author of Conclusive Evidence when, in his recollection of literary life, he stresses the perfect indifference he has always had in regard to criticism, adverse or favourable. Anyway, a ghoulish, vindictive, and sometimes rather foolish streak used to show in his own critical articles. How do we learn the great secret wrapped in words? We see that a foreigner generally fails to acquire a perfect, native sense of their import. He has not lived from infancy in the quiet reception and unconscious study of them, and felt how one word is allied to others and how one age - with its writings, its unrecorded traditions and its common style of conversation - flows into another. In her beautiful, compassionate, intensely feminine quest in the kingdom of things past, Miss Braun has one difficulty less to surmount than Nabokov has. True, the Russian author had English governesses when he was a child and spent three college years in England. To bring up Conrad's case in reference to Nabokov's novels written in English (The Real Life of Sebastian Knight and Bend Sinister) would mean missing the point of the latter's achievement. Conrad - whose English style, anyway, was a collection of glorified clichés - had not had 20 years of intense participation in Polish literature behind him when he started on his British career. Nabokov, on the other hand, when he switched to English, was the author of several novels and numerous short stories in Russian, and indeed had gained a lasting place in Russian literature, despite the fact that his books were banned in his mother country. The only analogy in this respect is that both men might have chosen French as readily as English. As a matter of fact, Nabokov's first attempt, in the middle Thirties, at original prose in a language not his own was a story he wrote in French (Mademoiselle O) which Paulhan published in Mesures (an English version of this, with most of the fiction weeded out by its author, appeared in The Atlantic Monthly and was reprinted in Nine Stories). The present reviewer has an odd recollection of hearing Nabokov lecture in brilliant French at a certain soirée littéraire - in 1937, I believe - in a Parisian concert hall. A Hungarian lady writer, today forgotten but then very much à la mode as the author of a French bestseller (something about a fishing cat), who was scheduled to speak that night, had wired a few hours before the lecture that she could not come, and Gabriel Marcel, one of the organisers of that series of talks, had prevailed upon Nabokov to appear as a last-minute substitute with a lecture in French on Pushkin (later published in the Nouvelle Revue Française). The lecturer's acte gratuite (as Mr Auden charmingly misgenders it) was prefaced by a curious movement, a kind of whirlpool in the audience. The whole Hungarian colony had bought tickets; some of them were leaving upon finding out about the change in the programme. Other Hungarians stayed on in blissful ignorance. Most of the French contingent had drifted away too. In the wings, the Hungarian Envoy was violently shaking hands with Nabokov whom he mistook for the lady's husband. Alerted Russian expatriates had loyally rallied and were doing their best to stitch up the ever widening holes in the house. Paul and Lucy Léon, faithful friends of Nabokov, had brought James Joyce as a special surprise; a Hungarian soccer team occupied the first row. Today Mr Nabokov must find it strange to recall the literary vagaries of his young years. With his wife and son, he now lives in this country of which he is a citizen; lives happily, I understand, in the simple disguise of an obscure college professor of literature with spacious vacations devoted to butterfly hunting in the West. In lepidopterological circles, he is known as a somewhat eccentric taxonomist with analytic rather than synthetic leanings. In American scientific journals, he has published various discoveries of his own relating to new species or forms of butterflies; and - a scientific tradition that seems to impress so much lay reporters - other entomologists have named butterflies and moths after him. The American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard preserve Nabokov's type specimens. On a visit to the latter institution I was shown several tiny moths - belonging to a marvellously multiform genus - which Nabokov discovered in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah in 1943. One of these McDunnough has named Eupithecia nabokovi. This is a delightfully satisfying resolution of a certain thematic line of Conclusive Evidence where Nabokov tells how passionately he had dreamed in his boyhood of discovering a new member of that particular group. Barbara Braun's poise and taste, the purity and simplicity of her style as sparkling as a New England brook, are qualities not shared by the author of Conclusive Evidence. One cannot help being irritated by certain peculiarities of Nabokov's manner, by his casual use of terms that little-known scientists have invented for little-known diseases; by his general tendency to dabble in esoteric sensations; by his methods of transliteration (he uses one system - the correct one - for rendering samples of Russian speech, and another system, pockmarked with compromise, for transliterating names); or by such whims of his as suddenly throwing in a chess problem (without giving the key move which is Bishop to -). His admirers may, however, retort that the author of Alice Through The Looking Glass devoted his frontispiece to an excellent chess composition that surely not many of his little readers could be presumed to enjoy. Another matter that cannot fail to offend a certain type of reader (upper-middle-class in the cultural sense) is Nabokov's attitude toward such writers as Freud, Mann and Eliot, whom tradition and good manners have taught one to respect together with Lenin and Henry James. At the oneiromancy and mythogeny of psychoanalysis Nabokov has been poking rude fun since the Twenties. Thomas Mann he places in the Jules Romain Rolland-Galsworthy subfamily, somewhere between Upton and Lewis, as he irreverently phrases it (Romain being mathematically equal to Sinclair). He is prone to throw a veritable fit of sarcastic glee when high middle-class critics place the plaster of Mann and Eliot beside the marble of Proust and Joyce. Few people will share his contention that Eliot's poetry is essentially platitudinous. As Mr Cleanth Brooks so ably puts it somewhere, \"whether or not Mr Eliot noticed this passage (something in poor Miss Weston's work) or intends a reference, the violation of a woman makes a very good symbol (my italics) of the process of secularisation\". I suppose Nabokov is merely trying to be witty when he remarks that the popular success of Eliot's recent play belongs to the same order as \"Zootism, Existentialism and Titoism,\" and, surely, all those whose muse, née Eliotovich, is so huskily vocal in little magazines, will fervently agree that calling T S E \"the Wally Simpson of American literature\" is a sally in very bad taste indeed. Then, too, there is his contempt for Dostoevski which makes Russians shudder and is disapproved of in the academic circles of our greatest universities. Perhaps Nabokov's immunity to the sentimental cults American critics have preserved since the Twenties and Thirties is due to his having gone, during those years, through a Zeitgeist-less phase in the world of Russian ascetic exile far removed from \"Jazz Age\" and \"pre-Crash\" fashions. But with all its shortcomings Conclusive Evidence still remains a significant contribution. It is \"conclusive evidence\" in regard to many things, among which the most obvious is that this world is not as bad as it seems. Mr Nabokov is to be congratulated on having performed a very capable and very necessary job. His memoirs will find a permanent place on the book lover's shelf side-by-side with Leo Tolstoy's Childhood, T S Elmann's Amen Corner and Barbara Braun's When Lilacs Last, which I now propose to discuss. n This is the greater part of Chapter Sixteen of Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited.

We see the same kind of exclusivist chuavinism, invariably based on specious historical claims, afflicting the Scots, Welsh, Cornish and other constituent citizens of a not-much-longer United Kingdom.

Apologies. Lessons of war Has Stephen Case (Letters, last week) not himself learnt the lessons of the years since World War II? In the last 50 years, not in the course of 'war': Pol Pot killed about a third of Cambodia's people; in Ruanda about a million Tutsi were killed; and Indonesians in East Timor killed about a quarter of the population. Going to war might have reduced the deaths. Was the rest of the world right to let the internal slaughter go on? If Hitler had limited his territorial ambitions, would we have been right to let him slaughter every last German Jew? David Barnard Tring Herts If, as you reported (War in the Balkans, last week), George Robertson really thinks Kosovo is the size of Wales, Nato is in even more trouble than we thought.

There he would see that these two quite small regions actually adjoin each other.

However, those wishing to change the current arrangements always argue that 'shorter, more intensive terms' would lead to better results. In fact, the five-term academic year would lead to longer (though not necessarily more intensive) working periods for most pupils, since the current three-term year always gives half-terms of between six and seven weeks before pupils get a week's holiday. A.F. Litten Croydon Surrey Unhappy Britain 'How come we're still not happy?' asks Anthony Browne at the end of his 'rosy picture of healthy, wealthy Britain' (Focus, last week). The fact that a significant minority is neither healthier nor wealthier in a Britain which is much more unequal and scarred with greater poverty than 20 years ago could be one reason. The increasingly acute contrast between 'private affluence and public squalor' (J.K. Galbraith), as tax cuts are prioritised over public spending, could be another.

Meanwhile, my council tax has substantially increased, the interest on my meagre savings has been cut, and other insurance costs have risen, so that I am fast becoming poorer and poorer. Mrs E.M.

Open letter Dear New Labour For us in Spain who understand and share many of the ideas of New Labour, last weekend's joint declaration signed by the Tony Blair and Spanish conservative Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, is very worrying. The declaration proposes common purpose over employment, economic reform and the European social model. Our preoccupation stems from the fact that, while the document on the British side is supported by the practice of the British Government, on the Spanish side it severely contradicts some policies. There is, for example, no attempt by Spain to emulate the large-scale schemes, like the New Deal, aimed at lowering structural unemployment as the Declaration calls for. After three years in power, youth unemployment is virtually unchanged. The problem of young women and over-45s, where unemployment is high in Spain, is unaddressed. There is talk of the need to promote part-time work. Part-time work in Spain has not risen above 8 per cent of the labour force - half Europe's average. As for the call for tax concessions to promote low-paid work, Spain has done the opposite, and privatisation has lead to more industrial concentration and jobs for the party entourage. The declaration defends the modernisation of the health system, yet in Spain, reforms are centred on the creation of 'internal markets', going beyond what Margaret Thatcher ever did, by giving fiscal incentives to private insurance companies to compete with the public system. But changes introduced by the new Labour government in Britain have abolished internal markets. The declaration favours effective equality between women and men, but the government has cut by 23 per cent the funds for the creation of nurseries and infant schools, which would have helped the integration of Spanish women in the labour market. The declaration emphasises the need of education and training for all, but the Spanish conservative government has a clear bias in favour of private schools. New Labour and the Third Way should keep and increase their prestige in Spain and Europe. There should be a process of convergence between the new political projects of European social democracy and British political innovation. But it will be very difficult to obtain a positive impact with a European initiative signed by a government that, under the Tony Blair's leadership, truly fights against unemployment, undertakes structural reforms and builds a fairer economy, and another government working in the opposite direction.

Irish pubs are packed on St Patrick's Day and the Welsh mark St David's Day with daffodils and leeks. But few English get high on St George's Day. Until now. As the Scots, Welsh and Irish go their own way, the 40-odd million inhabitants of the British Isles who once rather uneasily proclaimed themselves as English will hang out the bunting on Friday 'for England and St George'. More mythical dragons will be slain and maypoles danced around than ever before. Tourism chiefs can hardly cope with a new craze for medieval jousting, King Arthur lookalikes and gingerbread dunking. Pub chains are planning to open late into Friday night and Clinton, the country's biggest greeting cards chain, is giving St George the Valentine's treatment this year. Card sales are up 50 per cent. Leisure companies that specialise in English pageantry cannot keep up with demand. 'A few years ago it was dead quiet but it has really taken off now. St George is no longer stuck on the shelf,' said Richard Timson of the Lancashire theme park Camelot. English nationalism is on a roll. The patriotic Royal Society of St George which was so broke three years years ago that it moved from London to Folkestone, has quadrupled its membership over the past year to more than 20,000. John Bailey, the society's secretary, said English people 'want to be English, to do English things again'. Devolution in Scotland, Wales and Ulster had stirred stout English hearts. 'English people feel their country is being left out of Britain,' he said. 'There are parliaments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont but nobody is talking about us. 'The present Government does not give a damn because they are all Scots or Welsh. I say good luck to the Celts. They are clever and wonderful people but as the backbone of the United Kingdom, it is time for us English to shake our feathers.' On Thursday the Royal Society will launch a campaign to make St George's Day a national holiday like St Andrew's Day or St Patrick's Day. 'England has fewer national holidays than any other country,' Bailey said. Tourism chiefs agree. 'The English are too understated,' said Tim Bartlett, chief executive of the English Tourist Board. 'It's about time we stopped taking ourselves for granted. A national celebration is the ideal way to do it.' Stiff-upper-lip English nationalist journalists and authors welcome the resurgent nationalism. Simon Heffer, author of Nor Shall My Sword: The Reinvention of England, said: 'What identity we, the English, do have is wrapped up entirely in being British. That deficiency has to be rectified. Our old identity, which relied on our union with Scotland, is no longer real. It is a British identity, and Britain is over.' While most Scots and Welsh nationalists welcome England's new-found national pride, not everyone in Blighty is convulsed with patriotism. Mark Leonard, director of the independent think-tank the Foreign Policy Centre, struggles against England's 'warm beer and thwack of leather on willow' image as he sells 'Cool Britannia' abroad. 'Slaying dragons is very backward-looking and irrelevant to all but a handful of hardcore nutters. It's high time the English grappled with their identity but let's bury St George and come up with a new icon,' he said. So how will he celebrate his love of his homeland on Friday? 'I won't call it St George's Day. It is Shakespeare's birthday so I think we should have a new national holiday: Shakespeare Day. The world's most famous author epitomises everything that the English are good at - creativity, openness, humour, wit, internationalism, story-telling. That's what being English is all about.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/apr/19/alantravis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-19T01:52:47Z","webTitle":"First wave of refugees could arrive this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/19/alantravis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/apr/19/alantravis","fields":{"headline":"First wave of refugees could arrive this week","bodyText":"Expectations are growing that the first mass airlift of Kosovan refugees to Britain will take place later this week. Although the home secretary, Jack Straw, was instrumental in persuading the European Union not to conduct a mass evacuation of the Kosovans in Albania and Macedonia to northern Europe, he stands ready to honour an official promise to take 'some thousands' if a request is made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A spokeswoman for the home office confirmed yesterday that, despite general requests from the UNHCR for Britain to stand ready to accept more Kosovan refugees, ministers have not received a specific request. Paula Ghedini, the UNHCR spokeswoman in Macedonia, appealed over the weekend for the government to keep its word that it would accept refugees. 'We are talking about the first refugees arriving in Britain by [next] weekend. My guess is that Britain will take 5,000,' she is reported as saying. Mr Straw has been careful not to put a specific figure on how many Britain will take and he and his immigration minister, Mike O'Brien, have always stuck to the more general formula that they are willing to accommodate 'several thousands'. This makes no particular commitment, but nor does it put a ceiling on the number that might come. Britain and France were instrumental 10 days ago in ensuring that a European-wide airlift of Kosovans did not take place. They argued that such a programme with individual country quotas at that time would have undermined the attempts to deal with the refugees in Albania and Macedonia and would have played into President Milosevic's hands. Since then, Whitehall has been making detailed plans for the reception of several thousand should it prove necessary. It is believed that Stansted airport, near London, is their most likely port of entry. Mr Straw has told the Guardian that those who did come to Britain would be 'on the basis of nomination from the UNHCR', which would make a specific request. Those nominated would be given temporary protection status, which means they would be expected to go back as soon as it was deemed safe for them to return. This would be done by stamping their passports with 'exceptional leave to remain' status. Those that came to Britain would be selected principally on the criteria of having close relatives among the 10,000 Kosovan asylum seekers already in the United Kingdom, although some others might be admitted on the basis of medical need. 'We would lay on a proper support package for them,' Mr Straw said. Although Britain has made much of the fact that it has already taken 10,000 Kosovans in the past year the vast majority are still caught up in the bureaucratic rigours of the asylum system. Only 3,000 have had decisions on their asylum applications, with 89 per cent proving successful. The remaining 7,000 are still waiting to hear, and many are living on local authority vouchers and are unable to work. Many of those who came before the Nato bombing started were single young men trying to escape the Serbs. Mr Straw has made clear that there will be no special arrangements for Kosovans who arrive outside the UNHCR programme. They will still need a visa to enter Britain, the requirement stopping many of the Kosovans in Calais trying to cross the Channel. The home secretary says claims for asylum from Kosovans as opposed to Albanians who arrive in Britain will be looked at sympathetically but they will not get special treatment. They will, however, be able to make an application under the UN 1951 Geneva convention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/19/uk.politicalnews1","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-19T01:52:48Z","webTitle":"An evolving revolution in the state of the union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/19/uk.politicalnews1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/19/uk.politicalnews1","fields":{"headline":"An evolving revolution in the state of the union","bodyText":"Evolution or revolution?

The last year of our century will thus take its place in the catalogue of events which have changed the constitutional landscape of Britain and the nature and powers of its parliament.

The marriage of England and Wales came first, transacted by Henry VIII, a Tudor (and therefore Welsh), in 1536. The legislation was put through a parliament which had no Welsh members. In any case, the official (English) version was that nothing had happened. Wales had always been joined with England: this act was merely confirming that fact. Unlike the subsequent marriages in this series, this one provoked little resentment. 'As from that moment, as by a charm,' wrote Edmund Burke in 1780, 'the tumults subsided. . . peace, order and civilisation followed in the train of liberty.' 'For centuries,' says a modern historian, 'the 'union' was considered to be an unmixed blessing to Wales.' The marriage of England and Scotland in the 1707 act of union might logically have been completed a century earlier. In 1603 James VI of Scotland became James I of England. English and Scottish commissioners were set to work to devise a system of union, but their work came to nothing and the project was lost in the press of more vivid events. There followed civil war and a real revolution which abolished the king, abolished the lords, and in time shut down the Commons. Initially the union was fractured. After the execution of Charles I the Scots crowned his son at Scone. But Oliver Cromwell swiftly brought them under control. The restoration of 1660 which brought back the monarchy also re-established parliament, which in 1688 deposed James II in favour of William and Mary. That put the union of England and Scotland firmly back on the agenda. England, which feared a Scottish attempt to call back the Stuarts, and a Scots alliance with France, embarked on a course of coaxing mixed with coercion. Negotiations were rigged. Of 31 Scottish commissioners, only three had opposed a union in the Scottish parliament. The ambitious and deeply contentious enterprise was lubricated by sleaze. Bribes and sweeteners were enthusiastically offered and snatched at. The Scots succeeded in keeping their legal and judicial systems but elsewhere were short-changed. The English outnumbered the Scots by roughly five to one. Yet the Scots were forced to make do with 15 peers against England's 190, and 45 commoners against England's 513; a ratio in each case of 12 to 1. But the Scottish parliament voted itself out of existence. 'There's ane end of ane auld sang,' said the Scottish Lord Chancellor. A new political entity, Great Britain, had been created. There were wild celebrations in London: in Scotland, days of fasting and humiliation were declared in many parishes. Thirty-one white whales, it was fearfully said, had been washed up dead on the banks of the Forth. And such omens were not out of place. Trade advantages failed to materialise: instead came taxes which damaged Scottish industry. The kirk, apprehensive throughout, got what it feared: its protector, the Scots privy council, was swept away. When Scots complained at Westminster, one English MP explained the new facts of life: Scotland was now subject to England, and must therefore be governed by English laws. In 1713 a motion in the lords to rescind the union was supported by every Scottish member, Whig and Tory alike. But the English outvoted them. Ireland was given the union treatment in 1800 in response to that country's rebelliousness. Everything else had been tried; everything else had failed. By an act of union, the trublesome, alienated Catholics of Ireland would cease to be a majority, and become a mere minority within the union. If Ireland lost its former freedom to govern itself, it lost very little. The executive in Dublin had invariably done as London told it. The Irish parliament (from which Catholics, of course, were excluded) had been for much of the time a poor, uninfluential creature. Initially it said no to union, but the sweeteners started to flow and in time it said yes. And so the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into beingon January 1 1801. William Pitt wanted, once the deal was concluded, to give the Catholics rights long been confined to Protestants: George III declared it unthinkable (whereupon Pitt resigned). Pitt's solution proved to be no more appropriate or effective than those which preceded it. It did not tranquilise Ireland. And few had foreseen the consequences of having 100 Irish MPs at Westminster. By the end of the century, two bills for Irish home rule had been tried and lost. Part of the case was idealistic: to let the Irish govern themselves, though within a United Kingdom framework. But another attraction was to extirpate the difficult, wrangling, obstructive Irish MPs from the UK parliament. The reduction of the powers of the lords in 1911 made home rule possible. A bill was enacted, but frozen because of the war. The Irish did not wait. Nationalist MPs elected in December 1918 refused to come to Westminster and met, as the Dail, in Dublin instead. The home rule bill of 1920 sought to create subordinate parliaments for Belfast and Dublin. But the 1921 treaty which sent up the Irish free state disposed of all that. The home rule solution was reserved for the north, whose Protestants had so long and fiercely resisted it. Thus was born yet another constitutional concoction: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since then we have had further evolutions, some of them, in terms of the changes they mean in the way we govern ourselves, revolutionary. By joining the European Community in 1973, we assented (though the implications were muffled) to a progressive transfer of power upwards to Brussels. Thus in a quite exceptional spasm of self-abnegation the British government and parliament are simultaneously surrendering power upwards to Brussels and downwards to Scotland and Wales. Also, if things work out, on a limited scale to a Northern Ireland which lost its right to home rule in 1973 with abolition of its parliament at Stormont. The changes happening now reverse previous practice. Before, through most of this history, things were done at the behest of the English, and largely for English advantage. This time, it has been the other constituent parts of the kingdom that have forced the pace. And this time, it has all been done without money, honours and favours. Evolution or revolution? It is still too early to say. Will some 21st century Edmund Burke be able to write of Scottish devolution: 'as from that moment, as by a charm, the tumults subsided\u0085 peace, order and civilisation followed in the train of liberty'? Or will Scottish devolution prove to be the slippery slope that has long been warned about, setting up an inexorable pressure for Scottish secession from the UK?

With less than three weeks to go until Scotland's first general election, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, meet business and union leaders this morning to prepare a sustained attack on the SNP's policy of independence, focusing the latest round of campaigning on the costs of Scotland splitting from the UK. In what party sources are championing as a great coup, Labour has managed to persuade business and union leaders to present a united front against the SNP. 'We will be showing that there is common ground bringing us all together to prevent the break up of the UK,' said a cabinet source. Although Labour has already secured the public support of 100 business people, last week the party found itself under attack from public service union officials unhappy at plans to use private finance schemes to build schools and hospitals. But, ahead of this week's Scottish Trade Union Congress's annual conference, Labour appears to have coaxed union leaders into quelling their disquiet until after the elections on May 6. It is all but certain that a motion condemning independence will be passed by conference. With the SNP faltering in the polls and rumours that it is ready to concede an independent Scotland would have a £2 billion fiscal deficit, Labour is hoping the alliance can win over the Scottish electorate by forcing the nationalists on to the back foot over the costs of independence. 'We will be challenging the SNP to explain the costs of separation the costs of creating a separate currency, an army, navy and airforce, and a separate social security system,' said the source. The election campaigns in Scotland had been billed as a battle for the Union, but the first two weeks have been dominated by the SNP's 1p income tax rise proposal and Alex Salmond's criticism of Nato's operation over Kosovo. Independence has slipped down the news agenda - the nationalists themselves place it bottom on their list of 10 promises to Scotland and the alliance intends to launch a sustained attack from what it considers assured ground. Labour will point out that some 367,000 jobs in Scotland depend on exports to the rest of the Britain with 100,000 in manufacturing alone and, while 7% of Scotland's trade is with America and 7% is with Asia, 50% is with the remainder of the UK. The business arm of the alliance will also be used to give credence to Labour's claims that independence would be bad for business. Labour will say that of the top 50 Scottish companies, seven are registered outside the UK, more than half are registered outside Scotland, and, of the those who are registered within Scotland such as General Accident, Standard Life, ScottishPower and Scottish &amp; Newcastle most have substantial interests in the rest of the UK. The alliance will also attack the SNP's increased tax proposal, which it says will affect 2.1 million people in Scotland, many of them low earners. 'We will be saying Labour's fair budget is being made unfair by tax rises for 200,000 pensioners and 240,000 small businesses,' said the cabinet source."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/apr/19/johnezard1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-19T01:53:26Z","webTitle":"All-night Monet breaks records","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/19/johnezard1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/apr/19/johnezard1","fields":{"headline":"All-night Monet breaks records","bodyText":"The Monet exhibition ended yesterday evening after setting a string of records and drawing a final burst of 44,000 visitors over the weekend in the virtual 24-hour opening introduced to cope with the public interest it aroused. A spokeswoman for the Royal Academy said more than 813,000 people had visited the Royal Academy in Piccadilly, London, since it opened in January helping to establish the exhibition as the most popular event in the history of British art galleries. Its exact, repeated studies of the play of light and water on lilies and other natural things drew more than 8,500 of the weekend crowds after 11 o'clock on Saturday night. Monet's canvases, done in the last 26 years of his life, drew the highest average daily attendance figure reached by an exhibition in the United Kingdom, - 8,552 people. The extended opening lasted from 8am on Saturday till 6pm yesterday, with visitors starting to queue overnight on Friday. Last night an academy spokeswoman said: 'The atmosphere in the middle of Saturday night was incredibly buzzy and lively. 'Nearly everybody who came spent about an hour each looking at the paintings, listening to the full commentary through earphones. It was as if the day was continuing.' The academy took £3.9m through ticket office receipts, easily topping the £1.8m cost of mounting the display, which opened on January 23. It brought together, for the first time, 79 paintings from Monet's late work, assembled from public and private collections across the world.

Although the home secretary, Jack Straw, was instrumental in persuading the European Union not to conduct a mass evacuation of the Kosovans in Albania and Macedonia to northern Europe, he stands ready to honour an official promise to take 'some thousands' if a request is made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A spokeswoman for the home office confirmed yesterday that, despite general requests from the UNHCR for Britain to stand ready to accept more Kosovan refugees, ministers have not received a specific request. Paula Ghedini, the UNHCR spokeswoman in Macedonia, appealed over the weekend for the government to keep its word that it would accept refugees. 'We are talking about the first refugees arriving in Britain by [next] weekend. My guess is that Britain will take 5,000,' she is reported as saying. Mr Straw has been careful not to put a specific figure on how many Britain will take and he and his immigration minister, Mike O'Brien, have always stuck to the more general formula that they are willing to accommodate 'several thousands'. This makes no particular commitment, but nor does it put a ceiling on the number that might come. Britain and France were instrumental 10 days ago in ensuring that a European-wide airlift of Kosovans did not take place. They argued that such a programme with individual country quotas at that time would have undermined the attempts to deal with the refugees in Albania and Macedonia and would have played into President Milosevic's hands. Since then, Whitehall has been making detailed plans for the reception of several thousand should it prove necessary. It is believed that Stansted airport, near London, is their most likely port of entry. Mr Straw has told the Guardian that those who did come to Britain would be 'on the basis of nomination from the UNHCR', which would make a specific request. Those nominated would be given temporary protection status, which means they would be expected to go back as soon as it was deemed safe for them to return. This would be done by stamping their passports with 'exceptional leave to remain' status. Those that came to Britain would be selected principally on the criteria of having close relatives among the 10,000 Kosovan asylum seekers already in the United Kingdom, although some others might be admitted on the basis of medical need. 'We would lay on a proper support package for them,' Mr Straw said. Although Britain has made much of the fact that it has already taken 10,000 Kosovans in the past year the vast majority are still caught up in the bureaucratic rigours of the asylum system. Only 3,000 have had decisions on their asylum applications, with 89 per cent proving successful. The remaining 7,000 are still waiting to hear, and many are living on local authority vouchers and are unable to work.

It may sound harsh but it's broadly true. Look at the accompanying table. Every Scottish resident gets 19 per cent more public money than the United Kingdom average and 24 per cent more than people in England. Here's ammunition for fiscal warfare. An eminent Scottish economist, Gavin McCrone, a former Scottish Office mandarin, warns of \"raucous discontent\" over how spending is divvied up. We've already started to hear it. Charles Clarke, before he became a minister and took the Sicilian oath of silence which applies to members of Britain's executive, extracted from the Treasury the confession that if his Norwich constituency had been in Scotland it would be getting an extra £100 million a year in grants. Until now, questions of territorial justice have been sorted out inside the family. From May 6, the net balance becomes starkly visible to non-members of the ruling party. Perceived injustice (to Scotland) is going to be the Scottish Nationalists' stock in trade. Perceived injustice the other way round is harder to figure, but English Tories in the Westminster parliament and the English regions (some of which can produce chapter and verse on their relative deprivation) are likely to make hay. These calculations are not fireproof. How do you allocate the 'benefits' to Scotland of defence? And how to subtract the way spending in Scotland benefits residents of other parts of the country? Scotland is a great educator - ask your local vet where he or she was trained. Scots have enjoyed higher spending for a long time. There has been an official formula for sharing public money between the constituent parts of Britain since the Victorian era - Gladstone was intensely aware that this was a country whose constituent parts needed palliating. As Jim Callaghan's Labour government wrung its hands over devolution, the formula was redone by Treasury chief secretary Joel Barnett. But the figuring was only intended to relate Scotland's share of spending increases to its relative population. When Scotland's needs were assessed in 1976-77, spending per head of 16 per cent higher than in England was held to be justified. Why has it grown by 8 per cent? What seems to have happened in the intervening years is that 'adjustments' have regularly been made on an ad hoc basis. Scotland has got more prosperous, certainly relative to northern England, but it still gets more support. Tony Blair says he doesn't think there's great resentment. Donald Dewar, the prospective prime minister of Scotland, said last week that a \"new assessment\" is a possibility, particularly if concern grows about the English regions. That will have to look anew at such needs as how best to allow for sparsity of population and support for such special populations as crofters in the Highlands or the Hebridean islanders. Plenty of scope for backbench intervention by Members of the Scottish Parliament there. The Treasury envisages it will have broadly the same relationship with the Scottish and Welsh as it does now with individual Whitehall departments. In this spirit, Gordon Brown has publicly warned his fellow countrypeople not to breach their &amp;15 billion allocation, which is \"fair and seen to be fair\". In principle how the money is spent is Scotland's business alone. It will even have its own auditors (there is a civil service jobs boom taking place in Edinburgh). In practice the Treasury is going to be concerned if standards start to diverge too much. As for spending that springs from policy decisions... Will the Scottish parliament be forbidden from trying to abolish tuition fees for students at Scottish universities - a much touchier subject north of the border? Blair has indicated fees are a key policy and Scotland won't be allowed to deviate. The Scottish Parliament can't borrow except to cover short-run outlays and borrowing will be recouped from its annual Westminster grant. But what if it decided to push ahead with risky long-run public finance initiative (PFI) schemes which contain future commitments on spending? To supervise them, the Treasury will need as much detail about Scottish spending as it now has, which rather spoils the point of devolution. The Treasury will also eye Scottish council tax levels. The only thing it is supposed not to care a jot about is the Scottish parliament's right to increase or lower income tax by three pence in the pound. Subsidies for industry and investment are touchy, for there's enormous scope for rivalry with other parts of the United Kingdom. Scotland now takes about 16 per cent of inward investment, which may reflect the success of the Scottish Development Agency - a public body whose capacity to move, shake and subsidise, the North East of England would dearly like to emulate. But some of that Scottish success is down to extra money: if Scotland's share of investment assistance were cut to a fairer level (perhaps 8 per cent of the UK total) what would happen to Scottish efforts, say, to re-employ those thousands laid off because of the implosion of ship-building on the River Clyde? There's trouble ahead. If parliament and Treasury fall out, a committee of ministers (English-born?) will adjudicate - which only goes to show how much we are still under Whitehall's thumb, say some Scots. So here's a pessimistic scenario: Scotland gets less from Westminster (because Barnett is from now on strictly applied). The nurses get a generous pay settlement but Edinburgh has to find the money from its existing budget. Even if the Scots use all the tartan tax, there's a gap between money in and the on-going cost of public services. The Nationalists make a fuss. But experts point out that even if Scotland got 80 per cent of the proceeds of taxation on North Sea oil, there would still be a looming fiscal gap. \u0095 Source: Fraser of Allander Institute, University of Strathclyde, Quarterly economic commentary, March 1999."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/apr/19/devolution.uk2","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-04-19T01:54:25Z","webTitle":"An evolving revolution in the state of the union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/apr/19/devolution.uk2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/apr/19/devolution.uk2","fields":{"headline":"An evolving revolution in the state of the union","bodyText":"Evolution or revolution?

Next month's elections in Scotland and Wales will set off a process in which central government and the Westminster parliament will progressively surrender old powers and responsibilities on a quite astonishing scale. Scotland will get full-blooded home rule, Wales a watered-down version. If negotiations succeed, Northern Ireland will be included as well. The beginnings are also emerging of a pattern of regional government for the English: so far in terms of regional government offices with no sign yet of elected assemblies, but those may follow in time. And if Britain goes into the European Monetary Union, that will signal its entry into a process whose effects could in time be more revolutionary still. The last year of our century will thus take its place in the catalogue of events which have changed the constitutional landscape of Britain and the nature and powers of its parliament. It is a long and insalubrious story, in which for the most part events moved majestically forward on a lavish tide of sleaze, with virtually every episode until this one reflecting a theme: the English getting their way, and the rest putting up with it. Convenient marriage The marriage of England and Wales came first, transacted by Henry VIII, a Tudor (and therefore Welsh), in 1536. The legislation was put through a parliament which had no Welsh members. In any case, the official (English) version was that nothing had happened. Wales had always been joined with England: this act was merely confirming that fact. Unlike the subsequent marriages in this series, this one provoked little resentment. 'As from that moment, as by a charm,' wrote Edmund Burke in 1780, 'the tumults subsided... peace, order and civilisation followed in the train of liberty.' 'For centuries,' says a modern historian, 'the \"union\" was considered to be an unmixed blessing to Wales.' The marriage of England and Scotland in the 1707 act of union might logically have been completed a century earlier. In 1603 James VI of Scotland became James I of England. English and Scottish commissioners were set to work to devise a system of union, but their work came to nothing and the project was lost in the press of more vivid events. There followed civil war and a real revolution which abolished the king, abolished the lords, and in time shut down the Commons. Initially the union was fractured. After the execution of Charles I the Scots crowned his son at Scone. But Oliver Cromwell swiftly brought them under control. The restoration of 1660 which brought back the monarchy also re-established parliament, which in 1688 deposed James II in favour of William and Mary. That put the union of England and Scotland firmly back on the agenda. England, which feared a Scottish attempt to call back the Stuarts, and a Scots alliance with France, embarked on a course of coaxing mixed with coercion. Negotiations were rigged. Of 31 Scottish commissioners, only three had opposed a union in the Scottish parliament. The ambitious and deeply contentious enterprise was lubricated by sleaze. Bribes and sweeteners were enthusiastically offered and snatched at. The Scots succeeded in keeping their legal and judicial systems but elsewhere were short-changed. The English outnumbered the Scots by roughly five to one. Yet the Scots were forced to make do with 15 peers against England's 190, and 45 commoners against England's 513 a ratio in each case of 12 to 1. But the Scottish parliament voted itself out of existence. 'There's ane end of ane auld sang,' said the Scottish Lord Chancellor. A new political entity, Great Britain, had been created. There were wild celebrations in London: in Scotland, days of fasting and humiliation were declared in many parishes. Thirty-one white whales, it was fearfully said, had been washed up dead on the banks of the Forth. Bad omens And such omens were not out of place. Trade advantages failed to materialise: instead came taxes which damaged Scottish industry. The kirk, apprehensive throughout, got what it feared: its protector, the Scots privy council, was swept away. When Scots complained at Westminster, one English MP explained the new facts of life: Scotland was now subject to England, and must therefore be governed by English laws. In 1713 a motion in the lords to rescind the union was supported by every Scottish member, Whig and Tory alike. But the English outvoted them. Ireland was given the union treatment in 1800 in response to that country's rebelliousness. Everything else had been tried everything else had failed. By an act of union, the trublesome, alienated Catholics of Ireland would cease to be a majority, and become a mere minority within the union. If Ireland lost its former freedom to govern itself, it lost very little. The executive in Dublin had invariably done as London told it. The Irish parliament (from which Catholics, of course, were excluded) had been for much of the time a poor, uninfluential creature. Initially it said no to union, but the sweeteners started to flow and in time it said yes. And so the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into being on January 1 1801. William Pitt wanted, once the deal was concluded, to give the Catholics rights long been confined to Protestants: George III declared it unthinkable (whereupon Pitt resigned). Pitt's solution proved to be no more appropriate or effective than those which preceded it. It did not tranquillise Ireland. And few had foreseen the consequences of having 100 Irish MPs at Westminster. By the end of the century, two bills for Irish home rule had been tried and lost. Part of the case was idealistic: to let the Irish govern themselves, though within a United Kingdom framework. But another attraction was to extirpate the difficult, wrangling, obstructive Irish MPs from the UK parliament. The reduction of the powers of the lords in 1911 made home rule possible. A bill was enacted, but frozen because of the war. The Irish did not wait. Nationalist MPs elected in December 1918 refused to come to Westminster and met, as the Dail, in Dublin instead. The home rule bill of 1920 sought to create subordinate parliaments for Belfast and Dublin. But the 1921 treaty which sent up the Irish free state disposed of all that. The home rule solution was reserved for the north, whose Protestants had so long and fiercely resisted it. Thus was born yet another constitutional concoction: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . Since then we have had further evolutions, some of them, in terms of the changes they mean in the way we govern ourselves, revolutionary. By joining the European Community in 1973, we assented (though the implications were muffled) to a progressive transfer of power upwards to Brussels. Surrender of power Thus in a quite exceptional spasm of self-abnegation the British government and parliament are simultaneously surrendering power upwards to Brussels and downwards to Scotland and Wales. Also, if things work out, on a limited scale to a Northern Ireland which lost its right to home rule in 1973 with abolition of its parliament at Stormont. The changes happening now reverse previous practice. Before, through most of this history, things were done at the behest of the English, and largely for English advantage. This time, it has been the other constituent parts of the kingdom that have forced the pace. And this time, it has all been done without the old inducements of money, honours and favours. Evolution or revolution? It is still too early to say. Will some 21st century Edmund Burke be able to write of Scottish devolution: 'as from that moment, as by a charm, the tumults subsided... peace, order and civilisation followed in the train of liberty'? Or will Scottish devolution prove to be the slippery slope that has long been warned about, setting up an inexorable pressure for Scottish secession from the UK?

She was at work at the time, in the environmental health department of Haringey council in north London; she was already having a bad day. A dead man's body, in a sticky state of decay, had just been found in a local flat. Usually, she had about six of these a year; she never much enjoyed the clean-up. And this time, a BBC television crew wanted to come along too. When they all got to the flat, and found the corpse, several weeks over-ripe, lying in the kitchen, the four BBC people became quite animated. 'Normally when I do a clearance, I just supervise the people doing the clean-up,' says Moreland. 'But this time the TV crew were saying, \"Can you point to that for us? Can you lift that up?''' While the shovelling and scraping went on, though, and one of the men from the mortuary explained the difficulties to camera - 'we can't use water because it'll mix with the body fat, and we'll be pushing him around all day' - a small tension made itself felt. Moreland was worried her colleagues would start swearing. 'I know what they're like, so I had to rush round and tell them to tone it down... ' She pauses. 'It just sounds worse on television if it's full of beeps.' Docusoaps have never been terribly consistent on taste. Their makers and viewers need shocks, more and more, to make these tiny slivers of the everyday absorbing. But the wrong kind of rawness will send the audience, like unpleasantly surprised voyeurs, scrambling for their off buttons. For their series about Moreland and her co-workers, A Life Of Grime (9.35pm, BBC1), the documentary makers finely filtered their material from the very start. First, they sent researchers to several boroughs, before persuading Haringey, which welcomed the exposure. Then the BBC set up a staff meeting in the environmental health department: anyone who wanted to take part in the programme declared themselves; any of them, as long as they were TV-compatible, was signed up. This compatibility was narrowly defined. 'They didn't want to film ordinary day-to-day work,' says Moreland. 'People complaining about dumped rubbish, that kind of thing. They had ideas about what they wanted. They wanted anything shocking. They picked the big cases.' Tonight's opening programme includes two cockroach infestations, a council flat overrun by defecating cats, and a stake-out at an illegal smoked goat importer's. There is a wry voiceover from John Peel, and a few soft panoramic shots of the inner-city in summertime, but quite quickly, the cameras are poking into dark, poor places and the stuff of sad-seeming lives. A woman snores, naked in the mid-afternoon, halfway up a tower-block; a council officer, warned about roaches, shouts vainly through the keyhole. A dozen bewildered students, with Spanish accents, watch the carpets being sterilized in their two-bedroom house. A gap-toothed pensioner walls himself in behind a garden of salvage. Barely anyone has their identity concealed. Initially, Moreland felt the film-makers were being a bit tactless: 'The BBC were absolutely convinced they were going to get in everywhere. But my cases can be quite confrontational. In effect, you're saying to people, \"You're dirty.\" You're knocking on their door.' Yet the cameras had the opposite effect to the one she expected. At one stinking front door, 'I said to the crew, I'm a bit worried about this one. You're not going to get in. But they came in and kept on filming. Eventually, the woman inside said to them, \"Who are you? Why are you filming?\" They explained, and she said, \"Fine\". I was amazed.' Most people, Moreland came to discover, were more cooperative when the BBC came along. Over the six months of filming, they accompanied her half a dozen times. Six of her colleagues received similar attention; while they were out shooting, everyone else had to cover for them. If a case that had been filmed threatened suddenly to come to a conclusion, the officer involved had to phone the camera crew. No one at Haringey got paid anything extra. Moreland feels rewarded in another way: 'I think my job is very interesting, and I want people to know it exists.' She refers to the local stacks of street-corner refuse as \"my'' rubbish. She drives fast up and down the north London hills, relishing her kingdom of fly-tippers and random dumpers. She has a black bin-bag on the back seat. There are drawbacks, though, to making all this public. 'We don't wear uniforms, but now we'll be marked,' Moreland says. And minor fame can be perilous. In an earlier interview, she says, for Ceefax or the Sun or TV Quick, one reporter was very keen to ask something. Could she sing at all?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
