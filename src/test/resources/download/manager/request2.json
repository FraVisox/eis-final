Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T15:00:42Z","webTitle":"Stoke-on-Trent residents to sue council over ‘mis-sold’ solar power contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","fields":{"headline":"Stoke-on-Trent residents to sue council over ‘mis-sold’ solar power contracts","bodyText":"More than 230 residents in Stoke-on-Trent are to launch a class action lawsuit against the city council after they claim they were “mis-sold” 25-year solar power contracts which have left some with faulty panels and unexpected bills. Council house tenants in the city said they feel “lied to” after being signed up to the contracts without realising, and facing years of what they believe is poor quality customer service and installation. Community Energy Scheme (CES) was launched in 2018 by the city council in conjunction with Solarplicity Energy, which sent staff door to door to encourage residents to sign up to the solar panel scheme. It now has 4,800 customers in the city. Tenants signed up to contracts on the spot with a signature on an iPad, but many residents said they thought they were only agreeing to have their home assessed for its suitability for solar panel installation. Cassandra Burton, 50, has lived in her three-bedroom semi-detached council property for 15 years, and was alone at home when someone from CES came. “I thought it was for them to do a survey on the property, check the roof basically. I signed the iPad and that was it, I never heard anything else from them,” she said. “I had no idea I’d signed up to a 25-year contract until we read a story in the newspaper about them.” She later found out her digital signature had been copied on to three separate documents. “I’m autistic, I was by myself, I didn’t have my partner with me, I just thought it was a council thing. I feel like they took advantage,” said Burton, adding that her solar panels were never hooked up to her electricity supply but she still received bills. “It’s a constant stress. Every single day I’m on the CES community group on Facebook to check what’s happening, what the latest advice is. I won’t let anybody in my house now,” she said. “Who doesn’t want more renewable energy? Who doesn’t want to help the Earth be a better place? But it makes me really angry.” Bibby Thomas, 58, said she specifically asked the salesperson to explain what she was signing when he came to her door in 2019. “He gave me this iPad, and I said: ‘I’m dyslexic, so I can’t read the whole lot. I’m not signing anything that shouldn’t be signing, am I?’ He said no, everything was fine, so I did a squiggle on it.” She claims no one mentioned a 25-year contract. A number of residents are to launch a class action lawsuit against the council and CES over how the scheme was sold to them. In response to concern expressed by customers, CES said they were given the option to keep their existing contract, swap to an updated contract with more user-friendly language and terms, or exit the agreement and switch back to receiving all of their electricity from the grid. The company insists the fact the agreements were for 25 years was stated on the CES website, literature, contracts and by sales teams, and that all tenants received a letter from the council explaining the scheme before being signed up. It also said the majority of tenants received a verification call to check they had been given the information. The Conservative-run Stoke-on-Trent city council gave Solarplicity Energy exclusive rights to install the panels on its housing stock, initially handing over the details of more than 1,000 homes it thought would be suitable, in return for £100 for each installation. Solar panels were also installed on empty council house properties, meaning prospective tenants had to sign up to the solar energy scheme as a condition of tenancy. The Stoke-on-Trent Labour councillor Desiree Elliott said the scheme had been “a failure and a scandal from the beginning”. She said: “The company involved has demonstrated time and again that it is not up to delivering a project of this size with any semblance of professionalism.” Residents said they were promised the solar panels would come with batteries, allowing them to store surplus solar energy to use in the evenings and on darker days, but these have only recently started being rolled out. CES said 200 tenant properties have had batteries installed since 2020. In 2019 Solarplicity Energy ceased trading after criticism from Ofgem and the Energy Ombudsman, who received 3,324 complaints about the company, and tenants have been switched to a different supplier, while still remaining part of the 25-year CES contracts. A Stoke-on-Trent city council spokesperson said the scheme was designed to support tenants “in lowering their energy bills and reducing carbon emissions”. “Supporting households to generate more sustainable, cheaper and greener energy is even more significant given the considerable rises in energy prices this winter. It is clearly not appropriate to comment any further on a matter that is subject to legal proceedings.” A spokesperson for CES said: “We have worked hard to get sustainable and affordable energy to those who would otherwise completely miss out. We’ve listened to concerns raised about the accessibility of language used in our contracts, and we’ve offered tenants the opportunity to make their own choice about how the solar energy being generated on their home is used. “We remain committed to making access to solar as easy and beneficial as possible, and tenants are welcome to contact us if we can provide them with any support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/07/hydrogen-clean-fuel-climate-crisis-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T08:30:31Z","webTitle":"Is hydrogen really a clean enough fuel to tackle the climate crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/07/hydrogen-clean-fuel-climate-crisis-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/07/hydrogen-clean-fuel-climate-crisis-explainer","fields":{"headline":"Is hydrogen really a clean enough fuel to tackle the climate crisis?","bodyText":"Hydrogen is the smallest, lightest and most abundant molecule in the universe. On Earth, it does not occur by itself naturally, but can be separated from water (H2O) or hydrocarbon compounds (fossil fuels) like gas, coal and petroleum to be used as an energy source. It’s already used for rocket fuel, but it is now being pushed as a clean and safe alternative to oil and gas for heating and earthly modes of transport. Political support is mounting with almost $26bn of US taxpayer money available for hydrogen projects thanks to three recent laws – the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Chips Act. Hydrogen is politically hot, but is it the climate solution that its cheerleaders are claiming? Why all the hype about hydrogen? The short answer is that the fossil fuel industry sees hydrogen as a way to keep on drilling and building new infrastructure. Friends of the Earth has tracked how the industry has successfully deployed its PR and lobbying machines over recent years to get policymakers thinking that hydrogen is a catch-all climate solution. Research by climate scientists (without fossil fuel links) has debunked industry claims that hydrogen should be a major player in our decarbonised future, though hydrogen extracted from water (using renewable energy sources) could – and should – play an important role in replacing the dirtiest hydrogen currently extracted from fossil fuels. It may also have a role in fuelling some transportation like long-haul flights and vintage cars, but the evidence is far from clear. However, with billions of climate action dollars up for grabs in the US alone, expect to see more lobbying, more industry-funded evidence and more hype. What’s the difference between blue, grey, brown, pink and green hydrogen? Extracting hydrogen is energy intensive, so the source and how it’s done both matter. Currently, about 96% of the world’s hydrogen comes from coal (brown) and gas (grey), with the rest created from nuclear (pink) and renewable sources like hydro, wind and solar. Production of both grey and brown hydrogen release carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburnt fugitive methane into the atmosphere. This super-polluting hydrogen is what’s currently used as the chemical base for synthetic nitrogen fertilisers, plastics and steel among other industries. Blue hydrogen is what the fossil fuel industry is most invested in, as it still comes from gas but ostensibly the CO2 would be captured and stored underground. The industry claims to have the technology to capture 80-90% of CO2, but in reality, it’s closer to 12% when every stage of the energy-intensive process is evaluated, according to a peer-reviewed study by scientists at Cornell University published in 2021. For sure better than nothing, but methane emissions, which warm the planet faster than CO2, would actually be higher than for grey hydrogen because of the additional gas needed to power the carbon capture, and likely upstream leakage. Notably, the term clean hydrogen was coined by the fossil fuel industry a few months after the seminal Cornell study found that blue hydrogen has a substantially larger greenhouse gas footprint than burning gas, coal or diesel oil for heating. Green hydrogen is extracted from water by electrolysis – using electricity generated by renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro). Climate experts (without links to fossil fuels) say green hydrogen can only be green if new renewable sources are constructed to power hydrogen production – rather than drawing on the current grid and questionable carbon accounting schemes. The industry disagrees: “Strict additionality rules requiring electrolytic hydrogen to be powered by new renewable energy is not practical, especially in the early years, and will severely limit the development of hydrogen projects,” said BP America. “There may be some small role in truly green hydrogen in a decarbonised future, but this is largely a marketing creation by the oil and gas industry that has been hugely overhyped,” said Robert Howarth, professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, a co-author of the paper on blue hydrogen. What’s at stake? In addition to $26bn in direct financing for so-called hydrogen hubs and demo projects, another $100bn or so in uncapped tax credits could be paid out over the next few decades, so lots and lots of taxpayers’ money. Fossil fuel companies are also using hydrogen to justify building more pipelines, claiming that this infrastructure can be used for “clean hydrogen” in the future. But hydrogen is a highly flammable and corrosive element, and it would be costly to repurpose oil and gas infrastructure to make it safe for hydrogen. And while hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas, it is not harmless. It aggravates some greenhouse gases, for instance causing methane to stay in the atmosphere for longer. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in actual zero-emission solutions, but could be a disaster if the federal government pours scarce resources into infrastructure and technologies that could make the climate crisis worse and cause further public health harms,” said Sara Gersen, clean energy attorney at Earthjustice. “Sowing confusion about hydrogen is a delay tactic, and delay is the new denialism.” Is there any role for hydrogen in a decarbonised future? Yes, but a limited one – given that it takes more energy to produce, store and transport hydrogen than it provides when converted into useful energy, so using anything but new renewable sources (true green hydrogen) will require burning more fossil fuels. According to the hydrogen merit ladder devised by Michael Liebreich, host of the Cleaning Up podcast, swapping clean hydrogen for the fossil fuel-based grey and brown stuff currently used for synthetic fertilisers, petrochemicals and steel is a no-brainer. The carbon footprint of global hydrogen production today is equivalent to Germany’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, so the sooner we swap to green hydrogen (created from new renewables) the better. This could also be useful for some transportation, such as long-haul flights and heavy machinery, and maybe to store surplus wind and solar energy – though none are slam dunks for hydrogen as there are alternative technologies vying for these markets, said Liebreich. But for most forms of transport (cars, bikes, buses and trains) and heating there are already safer, cleaner and cheaper technologies such as battery-run electric vehicles and heat pumps, so there’s little or no merit in investing time or money with hydrogen. Howarth said: “Renewable electricity is a scarce resource. Direct electrification and batteries offer so much more, and much more quickly. It’s a huge distraction and waste of resources to even be talking about heating homes and passenger vehicles with hydrogen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T14:00:06Z","webTitle":"Solar to soon offer grid more capacity than coal, consultancy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","fields":{"headline":"Solar to soon offer grid more capacity than coal, consultancy says","bodyText":"Australia’s rooftops now boast 20 gigawatts of solar panels and will soon have the capacity to produce more electricity than the country’s entire coal industry, according to the industry consultancy SunWiz. Almost one in three Australian households have solar photovoltaics – or solar panels – the highest penetration in the world. Queensland had the highest share of solar panels installed on dwellings deemed suitable for the technology with an 82% penetration, ahead of South Australia’s 78%, New South Wales’ 51% and Victoria’s 43%. The take-up of solar PV has quickened. It took about 11 years for Australia to reach its first 10GW of capacity, while the second 10GW took just four years, according to SunWiz. Combining the household solar panel capacity with the 11GW of large-scale solar plants, “solar energy is already Australia’s largest fuel source for electrical power in Australia”, according to Warwick Johnston, the managing director of SunWiz. Once AGL Energy closes the remaining units of its 1680MW Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW’s Hunter Valley next month, rooftop solar alone will have more so-called name-plate capacity than Australia’s remaining coal fleet, SunWiz said. That measure refers to the output a device is intended to be able to produce. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Queensland’s relatively sunny climate has encouraged residents there to host 5.2GW of solar PV, with the 1 millionth rooftop solar panel system to be installed soon. NSW is installing the most additional capacity of any state, with almost 100MW being added monthly, SunWiz said. Rooftop solar is often the largest supplier of electricity during the middle of the day, helping to drive demand in the national electricity market to record lows, including during the December quarter. The relative abundance of solar power, though, is creating challenges for large-scale generators, particularly operators of coal plants that struggle to ramp output up and down to meet fluctuating demand. According to a report by Green Energy Markets for the Clean Energy Regulator, the next 10GW of rooftop solar will take just over three years to be installed. Total installations will near 3GW in 2023 and exceed 3.2GW next year, setting a new annual high after the industry recovered from the Covid-related disruptions to supplies from China. Consumers, too, are increasingly focused on the prospect of power prices rising and staying high, according to Tristan Edis, director of analysis at Green Energy Markets. “The price of a system had gone up quite a bit” in 2021-22, at a time when electricity prices had started to drop, Edis said. “And then kind of all hell broke loose with the forward market,” he said, referring to future prices on the electricity market. The Australian Electricity Regulator in May 2022 lifted its default power prices by as much as 20% in a decision delayed by the Morrison government until after the federal election. Since then, the Albanese government has intervened with price caps for coal and gas in a bid to limit the size of further increases. Households that have solar are also increasingly looking to expand or more likely replace older, smaller units, the Green Energy Markets report said. “Upgrades and replacements accounted for 19% of total PV capacity installed in 2022 and we expect that this will increase to 27% by 2027,” the report said. SunWiz’s Johnston said the market for rooftop solar “is not at saturation point – that’s still a long way off”. More households were also taking up larger solar systems particularly if they planned to add batteries or operate electric vehicles. About 15% of solar system installations now also include batteries, he said. The prospects for large-scale solar, though, were not so promising, at least in the near-term. “The pipeline of solar farms under development has dried up, and we expect it to be the worst year for solar farms since Australia started their rollout in earnest in 2018,” Johnston said. The headline on this article was amended on 1 March 2023 to clarify that while solar now has more capacity than other energy sources in Australia, it is not the largest single source of electricity generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/22/climate-spending-republican-states-clean-energy-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T09:00:20Z","webTitle":"Republicans in the US ‘battery belt’ embrace Biden’s climate spending ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/22/climate-spending-republican-states-clean-energy-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/22/climate-spending-republican-states-clean-energy-funding","fields":{"headline":"Republicans in the US ‘battery belt’ embrace Biden’s climate spending ","bodyText":"Georgia, a state once known for its peaches and peanuts, is rapidly becoming a crucible of clean energy technology in the US, leading a pack of Republican-led states enjoying a boom in renewables investment that has been accelerated by Joe Biden’s climate agenda. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August, billions of dollars of new clean energy investment has been announced for solar, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing in Georgia, pushing it to the forefront of a swathe of southern states that are becoming a so-called “battery belt” in the economic transition away from fossil fuels. “It seems like all roads are currently leading to Georgia, it’s really benefiting disproportionately from the Inflation Reduction Act right now,” said Aaron Brickman, senior principal at energy research nonprofit RMI. Brickman said the $370bn in clean energy incentives and tax credits in the bill are a “complete game changer. We’ve just frankly never had that before in this country. The IRA has transformed the landscape in a staggering way.” Georgia is part of a pattern where Republican-headed states have claimed the lion’s share of new renewable energy and electric vehicle activity since the legislation, with Republican-held congressional districts hosting more than 80% of all utility-scale wind or solar farms and battery projects currently in advanced development, according to an analysis by American Clean Power. States blessed with plentiful wind and sunshine, along with significant rural and industrial communities, such as those across the Great Plains and the south, appear best positioned to capitalize on the climate bill. Texas, already a bastion of wind power, could see $131bn in IRA-linked investment this decade, Florida may see $62bn and Georgia $16bn, according to an RMI analysis. The irony of this bonanza, which is coming despite no Republican voting for the climate spending, was alluded to by Biden in his recent state of the union address. “My Republican friends who voted against it – I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well,” the US president said, to jeers from some members of Congress. “But don’t worry, I promised I’d be a president for all Americans. We’ll fund these projects and I’ll see you at the groundbreaking.” A mixed political groundbreaking did take place in Georgia in October, when Brian Kemp, the Republican governor, was served champagne by a robotic dog before ceremonially shoveling dirt alongside Democratic senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to kick off Hyundai’s first dedicated electric vehicle plant in the US. The $5.5bn facility in Bryan county, which will create around 8,000 jobs when it opens in 2025, came about because “we heard the clarion call of this administration to hasten the adoption of new electric vehicles and reduce carbon emissions”, according to José Muñoz, Hyundai’s global president. Ossoff told the Guardian he has long held a vision that Georgia “should be the advanced energy innovation and manufacturing hub for the US” and credits a bill he wrote, the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which was then folded into the IRA, for helping convince Hanwha Qcells, another South Korean-owned company, to commit $2.5bn for two new solar panel factories in the state in January. “This targeted legislation was by no means a foregone conclusion but passing it has opened the floodgates in Georgia,” Ossoff said. Democrats have touted the bill for not only helping tackle the climate crisis but also as a way to wrest the initiative from China, which has dominated the manufacturing of parts for clean energy systems and electric cars until now. Georgia’s embrace of clean energy technology was under way before the IRA, with Atlanta, bolstered by leading renewables research at Georgia Tech, increasingly viewed as an innovative fulcrum. In 2022, Freyr, a Norwegian company, announced a $1.7bn battery plant for Coweta county, south of Atlanta, while SK Battery, yet another South Korean-owned firm, said last spring it will hire another 3,000 workers at its battery factory in Commerce, north-east of Georgia’s capital. Rivian, the electric car company, meanwhile is keen to build a sprawling $5bn facility east of Atlanta although it has faced opposition from some residents in the small town of Rutledge, who have sued to stop the development. But last year’s IRA, with its sweeping tax incentives for emissions-reducing technologies, has made the environment even more enticing. Scott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells said that Georgia has been a “great home” since 2019 but that the IRA is “some of the most ambitious clean energy policy passed anywhere in the world” and gave the Hanwha-owned company certainty to triple capacity at its site in Dalton, which already cranks out around 12,000 solar panels a day, as well as create a new complex in Cartersville that will manufacture ingots and wafers, the basic building blocks of solar panel components, made from polysilicon. “There’s a ton of opportunity and excitement in [the] clean energy sector right now,” Moskowitz said. “We’ve always had strong support from both sides of the aisle, even if there hasn’t always been agreement.” Barry Loudermilk, a Republican congressman whose House of Representatives district includes Cartersville, denied that the rush of investment is politically awkward for the GOP, accusing Biden of an “elementary school-level response” to the issue in his state of the union speech. “I’m not against this industry and I’m all about bringing in new technology, but it has to be market-driven,” Loudermilk told the Guardian. “When the government heavily subsidizes something it will crest and then fall down because the market hasn’t matured. “We aren’t ready for this (full EV and clean energy adoption). This is just subsidizing one industry over another and just throwing taxpayer dollars at something usually just leads to failure, and sets you back a decade.” Georgia is a draw for businesses due to its relatively low tax rate, transport links – including Atlanta’s busy airport and Savannah’s deep port – and a diverse and adept pool of workers, according to Loudermilk. “The days of the backwoods country bumpkin are in the past, we have educated, skilled workforce,” he said. It’s uncertain whether Loudermilk will be at the Cartersville groundbreaking, nor Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right extremist who represents the neighboring congressional district that includes Dalton. Greene has previously said the IRA is an “energy disaster” and erroneously said that global heating is “actually healthy for us”, although she has said she welcomes any new jobs to Georgia. Kemp, meanwhile, has offered state-level incentives for firms to set up in Georgia, while denouncing Democrats for “picking winners and losers” with the national climate bill. The governor recently pitched his state as a destination for clean tech investment at Davos and has denied any hypocrisy in his stance. “Georgia is a destination state for all manner of new jobs and opportunity despite the bad policies coming out of DC – not because of them,” said a spokesman for Kemp. “Companies are choosing Georgia over places like New York and California because they know they’ll find success here, not because of the IRA.” Even if the causes for the renewables investment are in dispute, the trajectory of the transition is becoming more undeniable. As the cost of renewables continues to plummet and more Americans turn to electric cars, thanks in part to the “unprecedented scale” of the IRA, partisan divides on the issue may soften, according to Ashna Aggarwal, an associate at RMI, the energy research nonprofit. “This is a bill that benefits everyone and it actually benefits the people who weren’t necessarily in favor of the bill the most,” Aggarwal said. “I think what’s really exciting about the clean energy economy is that party lines don’t really matter here. There’s more opportunity for Republican states and I hope that Republican policymakers see that and really think this is good for the people who are living in our states.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2023/feb/07/welsh-universities-face-jobs-being-lost-eu-research-funding-ends","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T17:57:08Z","webTitle":"Welsh universities face 1,000 jobs being lost as EU research funding ends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/feb/07/welsh-universities-face-jobs-being-lost-eu-research-funding-ends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/feb/07/welsh-universities-face-jobs-being-lost-eu-research-funding-ends","fields":{"headline":"Welsh universities face 1,000 jobs being lost as EU research funding ends","bodyText":"Universities in Wales face more than 1,000 skilled jobs being lost because of the withdrawal of EU structural funds, with leaders saying that the replacement finance promised by ministers will not match the lost support. Since 2014 Welsh universities have received about £370m in research projects from EU structural funds but, after the UK’s withdrawal, its support for 60 ongoing projects will end this year. Prof Paul Boyle, vice-chancellor of Swansea University and chair of the Universities Wales research and innovation network, told MPs that the projects and the jobs could be saved with an urgent injection of £71m in bridging finance to keep them running. “Stepping back from the cliff edge would save hundreds of jobs, support a range of cutting-edge innovation projects that are driving economic growth, and provide direct investment in areas that the UK government has stated are at the heart of its own levelling up ambitions,” Boyle said. “In an increasingly competitive global marketplace, we risk failing to exploit one of this country’s most enduring and internationally recognised strengths.” One example, funded through the European structural and investment fund, is Swansea University’s Specific project, which aims to create buildings that can store and release heat and electricity from solar energy, including through printable solar cells and material that can store summer heat for use in winter. The project has created seven spin-off companies, and works with hundreds of private sector partners. Geraint Davies, the Labour MP for Swansea West, said: “These projects are important to our UK ambition to crank up sustainable economic growth, so their sudden loss would be a big blow to our communities our economy and all our longer-term interests. “That’s why providing immediate bridging funding of just £71m is of such importance.” The payments from the structural fund comes to an end this year, with the Westminster government promising to cover the funding through its £2.6bn UK shared prosperity fund. But delays and uncertainty over distribution means the current projects may be forced to close down before the funding is allocated. Cardiff University said 12 of its projects were due to end this year, and a further five projects already in the process of closing after funding ran out last year, with about 100 jobs at risk. Colin Riordan, Cardiff University’s vice-chancellor, told Research Professional News: “The aim of these projects was to create jobs and stimulate economic activity through innovation, so it’s going to be a big loss not just in terms of the university but also the region.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T12:00:45Z","webTitle":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","fields":{"headline":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","bodyText":"Great Britain has one of the most diverse ranges of electricity generation in Europe, with everything from windfarms off the coast of Scotland to a nuclear power station in Suffolk tasked with keeping the lights on. The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action. The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources. The technology behind Great Britain’s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain’s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity. Methodology The charts visualise Great Britain’s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures. Energy generation data is fetched from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service public feed, provided by Elexon – which runs the wholesale energy market – and is updated every five minutes. Elexon’s data does not include embedded energy, which is unmetered and therefore invisible to Great Britain’s National Grid. Embedded energy comprises all solar energy and wind energy generated from non-metered turbines. To account for these figures we use embedded energy estimates from the National Grid electricity system operator, which are published every 30 minutes. Import figures refer to the net flow of electricity from the interconnectors with Europe and with Northern Ireland. A positive value represents import into the GB transmission system, while a negative value represents an export. Hydro figures combine renewable run-of-the-river hydropower and pumped storage. Biomass figures include Elexon’s “other” category, which comprises coal-to-biomass conversions and biomass combined heat and power plants. The Guardian does not make any attempt to fix potential mistakes in the data feeds; all figures should be taken as indicative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/30/eu-plans-to-loosen-state-aid-rules-renewables-investment-tax-credits-biden-green-subsidy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T15:02:24Z","webTitle":"EU plans to loosen state aid rules to boost renewables investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/30/eu-plans-to-loosen-state-aid-rules-renewables-investment-tax-credits-biden-green-subsidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/30/eu-plans-to-loosen-state-aid-rules-renewables-investment-tax-credits-biden-green-subsidy","fields":{"headline":"EU plans to loosen state aid rules to boost renewables investment","bodyText":"The EU is stepping up its green subsidy race with the US through plans to loosen state aid rules on tax credits for renewable energy projects. European policymakers have been under pressure to respond to the US president Joe Biden’s $369bn (£298bn) Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to encourage renewables investment in everything from electric cars to wind turbines. The European Commission plans to loosen state aid rules to enable investment into production facilities in green industries, according to draft plans. EU member states are divided over whether to introduce the new rules and how long for, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the plans. The draft proposals reportedly suggest some of a €800bn (£705bn) Covid-19 recovery fund could be redirected towards tax credits. “The provisions on tax benefits would enable member states to align their national fiscal incentives on a common scheme, and thereby offer greater transparency and predictability to businesses across the EU,” the draft said. Europe’s energy system has been under intense scrutiny since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent throttling of gas supplies into Europe. Brussels intends to set new targets for green industrial capacity and simplify the approval process for renewables projects. It plans to increase the level at which deals are scrutinised by the commission under state aid rules. Biden’s new rules, introduced last autumn, have reinvigorated the renewables market in the US, leading to a wave of new projects. The president hailed the legislation as “the biggest step forward on climate ever” on signing the bill last year. It has been estimated that the legislation could reduce US emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, bringing Biden close to the goal of cutting US emissions in half by the end of the decade. Companies, investors and politicians have called for Europe and the UK to follow suit, with Jozef Síkela, the Czech minister of industry and trade, equating the US programme with “doping in sport”. In Britain, ministers have been accused of discouraging renewables investment by extending a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas firms to electricity generators, including wind and solar projects on older contracts. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK, has accused the government of offering more generous tax terms to oil and gas projects and “tilting the playing field against renewables”. Meanwhile, the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband has said a Labour government would form an “anti-Opec” alliance of countries dedicated to renewables, to bring down energy prices and promote clean technology. On Monday, the oil and gas company BP said global carbon emissions were expected to fall quicker than it had previously expected as a result of the war in Ukraine and Biden’s efforts to encourage green investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/plants-that-thrive-in-colder-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T08:15:43Z","webTitle":"Plants that will thrive in our colder homes | James Wong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/plants-that-thrive-in-colder-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/plants-that-thrive-in-colder-homes","fields":{"headline":"Plants that thrive in colder homes","bodyText":"It’s a time of year when plant shops seem to be flooded with many of my favourite old-school Victorian houseplants, which these days are thought of – paradoxically, thanks to the widespread adoption of central heating – as incredibly tricky to grow. As so many of these cool-climate species look incredibly exotic, we tend to assume that their decline soon after we get them home is down to our own failure to spoil them with the steamy jungle conditions we are convinced they must require. I think it’s reassuring to know that the reality is usually the exact opposite. With the current energy crisis causing many of us to consider reducing how many rooms we heat, and the temperature across our homes generally being lowered to a level that’s decidedly chillier, some of these species could really start to come into their own. I first saw Cymbidium orchids at one of the huge displays of seasonal plants that filled plant nurseries in Singapore during Chinese New Year in the late 1990s. Every year, these stores would literally quadruple in size, with all sorts of unusual, imported species, from 10ft cherry trees in flower, to picture-perfect rice plants sporting full ears of grain and decorated with red silk ribbons, spilling out on to pavements, grass verges and even adjoining car parks. Back then, the sheer size of these orchids’ blooms and their incredible “corsage” forms just blew my mind. Little did I know that they would prove to be totally impossible for me to keep alive in the heat of the lowland tropics. Three decades on, wandering around central London in the depths of winter, I frequently spot the same genus all over the place in the yards of basement flats, in pots on the concrete patios of council blocks and sitting on forgotten window ledges, where they seem to be thriving outdoors in cold, damp and distinctly un-jungly conditions. It’s a similar case with almost all citrus plants. Given the combination of warm temperatures and low light levels in winter, many will react by almost instantly shedding their leaves, which can be really tricky to recover from in the spring, leading to a rapid decline. While these light-loving species will handle a wide range of temperatures, the combination of warm temperatures driving up their metabolic rate coupled with the lack of light (meaning they don’t have the solar energy to fuel this desire for growth) is kind of like hitting the brakes and the accelerator at the same time on their biology. This is also exactly the case for a wide range of cool-climate houseplants from gardenias and forest cacti, to maidenhair ferns and cyclamen. In fact, cooler winter conditions can be of benefit to houseplants in general, most of which were originally popularised long before central heating became the norm. When you remove central heating from the equation, you remove the damaging effect it has on plant metabolics, and also the raised humidity that comes with it.

On Tuesday, intense storms and heavy rain left thousands without power in Geelong and the Bellarine peninsula in Victoria, while lightning lit up the skies in New South Wales. According to Weatherzone, about 133,000 lightning strikes were recorded within a 100km radius of Blacktown in western Sydney. Ben Domensino, a Weatherzone meteorologist, has forecast that “Australia will see widespread and locally heavy rain over the course of this week.” “The rainfall being predicted over eastern and south-eastern Australia this week will come from daily shower and thunderstorm activity,” he said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Why are storms more common in summer? Most storms occur between September and March, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Thunderstorms require warm, humid air to form, and strike more commonly in the summer months when solar energy is abundant. There are three key components required to produce a thunderstorm, according to the BoM: High moisture in the atmosphere, which can sometimes be identified by the presence of low clouds or haziness in the morning. An unstable atmosphere, with high temperatures near the ground that fall sharply with increasing height. A trigger that lifts air up vertically in the atmosphere, through differences in air density. This can arise from local variations in heating, or the approach of a front or low pressure trough. “High moisture levels, especially near the coast, affect the tropical north of Australia in the summer half of the year,” the BoM has previously noted. Conditions in the northern half of Australia between October through March were favourable for thunderstorms, it said. “Lower pressure lies across northern and central Australia, and gives rise to the vertical motion and low level convergence that favour thunderstorm development.” But it also said “severe winter storms linked to cold fronts are common in the south-west of Western Australia and south-east South Australia.” What effect does climate change have on thunderstorms? According to the CSIRO’s 2022 state of the environment report, daily rainfall totals associated with storms have increased in Australia since 1979, especially in northern parts of the country. “This is primarily due to an increase in the intensity of rainfall per storm,” it found. In future decades, Australia is projected to experience fewer tropical cyclones, but an increased proportion of high-intensity storms with higher rainfall. Rainfall events are predicted to intensify with global heating, as the atmosphere is able to hold about 7% more water vapour for each degree of warming. Rapid storm-related extreme rainfall events may intensify at an even higher rate, according to the Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub, because “the additional moisture in the atmosphere may also cause more intense convection for thunderstorms”. Short duration rainfall intensity could increase by about 15% for each degree of warming, it has warned. Historical analysis by the BoM found no consistent link between peaks and troughs in thunderstorm frequency and El Niño or La Niña events. However, it found “some evidence that thunderstorms tended to be less frequent over south-eastern Australia” – Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra particularly – during strong El Niño years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/jan/25/late-night-recap-jimmy-kimmel-mike-pence-classified-documents","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-25T16:28:32Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Kimmel on Mike Pence’s classified documents: ‘It’s an epidemic’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/25/late-night-recap-jimmy-kimmel-mike-pence-classified-documents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jan/25/late-night-recap-jimmy-kimmel-mike-pence-classified-documents","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Kimmel on Mike Pence’s classified documents: ‘It’s an epidemic’","bodyText":"Jimmy Kimmel Oscar nominations were announced on Tuesday morning, and though Avatar: The Way of Water received a nod for best picture, James Cameron was not nominated for best director. “Which is what you get for making us put on those dumb glasses for four hours,” Jimmy Kimmel joked on Tuesday evening. Another nomination for best animated short went to a movie called My Year of Dicks, whose title cracked presenter Riz Ahmed up. “I’d never heard of the movie before,” Kimmel laughed. “I went to look up My Year of Dicks and now my computer won’t turn on.” Kimmel then returned to the perennial late-night topic of late: classified documents found in various politicians’ private residences. This time, it was Mike Pence, who returned about a dozen classified documents found in his Indiana home to the FBI. “Mike Pence has them too now!” Kimmel exclaimed. “This is unbelievable. It’s an epidemic.” The Pence news was especially interesting, Kimmel noted, because the former vice-president was specifically asked about taking classified documents home in an ABC news interview from November. Asked if he kept any, Pence answered: “I did not.” “Is that your final answer?” Kimmel said. “Because according to his lawyer, they discovered the documents in January” in “Mike’s kitchen, behind the Pence family mayonnaises”. Of all the people, Donald Trump came to Pence’s defense, posting on Truth Social: “Mike Pence is an innocent man. He never did anything knowingly dishonest in his life. Leave him alone!!!” “Unfortunately that post came two years and 18 days late,” Kimmel said. “When they were planning to hang him, he was like ‘you made your bed, I wish I could help.’” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed Pence’s classified documents. “Wow, that is tough news for Mike Pence, and fantastic news for Joe Biden,” he joked. “Unlike Pence’s former boss, Pence wasn’t hoarding the documents,” Colbert added. The former VP said he took them home by accident, and they were found by one of his lawyers who Pence asked to search his home out of an “abundance of caution”. “An ‘abundance of caution’ is why Mike Pence leaves the room when TV commercials come on,” Colbert quipped. “So evidently, everybody in US government just has classified documents lying around their houses,” he continued. “This never used to happen. Previous veeps had methods to dispose of this kind of thing. Al Gore would immediately recycle documents, and Dick Cheney would shoot them in the face. “I mean, to think Mike Pence’s legacy could be tarnished by one stupid mistake. Well, two stupid mistakes,” he said over a photo of Pence with Donald Trump. Additionally, four more Oath Keepers were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for January 6 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. “They should be happy – they tried to break into a government facility, and now they get to live in one,” Colbert said. The Daily Show And on the Daily Show, guest host Wanda Sykes panned a television ad for oil and gas – not a particular company, just the concept of oil and gas. “Those greedy, oily bastards,” she said. The ad, paid for by a group called Energy Transfer LP and run during a football game, ponders what would happen if oil and gas disappeared by having various objects – phones, clothing, hair color, a football about to be kicked on TV, the TV itself – turn to dust. “See this proves, y’all, that we’re doing something right, because they’re getting nervous,” said Sykes. “Because we’re buying electric cars, we’re switching to solar energy, and they’re like ‘but we also make footballs!’ “But you know what, I will agree with them on one thing: if there was no oil our world would be unrecognizable,” she added. “It would look like this,” she said next to a picture of a screensaver-green meadow. “What’s all that green shit at the bottom? Is that grass? I mean, I heard about it in history class, I don’t know.” Sykes also noted that the household objects turning to dust resembled the Thanos snap in the Avengers. “So these guys are in the boardroom like, ‘we need to improve our image – we could be more like Thanos, right?’” she laughed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘No miracles needed’: Prof Mark Jacobson on how wind, sun and water can power the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","fields":{"headline":"‘No miracles needed’: Prof Mark Jacobson on how wind, sun and water can power the world","bodyText":"“Combustion is the problem – when you’re continuing to burn something, that’s not solving the problem,” says Prof Mark Jacobson. The Stanford University academic has a compelling pitch: the world can rapidly get 100% of its energy from renewable sources with, as the title of his new book says, “no miracles needed”. Wind, water and solar can provide plentiful and cheap power, he argues, ending the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis, slashing deadly air pollution and ensuring energy security. Carbon capture and storage, biofuels, new nuclear and other technologies are expensive wastes of time, he argues. “Bill Gates said we have to put a lot of money into miracle technologies,” Jacobson says. “But we don’t – we have the technologies that we need. We have wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, electric cars. We have batteries, heat pumps, energy efficiency. We have 95% of the technologies right now that we need to solve the problem.” The missing 5% is for long-distance aircraft and ships, he says, for which hydrogen-powered fuel cells can be developed. Jacobson’s claim is a big one. He is not just talking about a shift to 100% renewable electricity, but all energy – and fossil fuels still provide about 80% of that today. Jacobson has scores of academic papers to his name and his work has been influential in policies passed by cities, states and countries around the world targeting 100% green power. He is also controversial, not least for pursuing a $10m lawsuit against researchers who claimed his work was flawed, which he later dropped. The evidence that proves he is right is collected in the new book, Jacobson says. Not only is a 100% renewables-powered world possible, it also promises much lower energy bills, he says. The first reason for that is that electrified vehicles, heating and industrial processes are far more efficient than those powered by fossil fuels, where much of the energy is wasted as heat. Add in better-insulated buildings and ending the drilling and mining for the fossil fuels that consume about 11% of all energy, and you get 56% less energy use on average from 2035 to 2050, Jacobson says. Wind and solar energy are cheaper too, so average bills will fall 63%, he says. Jacobson divides approaches to the energy transition into two camps: “One says we should just try everything – they’re the ‘all-of-the-above camp’ – and keep investing huge amounts of money in technologies that may or may not be available to work in 10 years. But 10 years is too late.” Carbon emissions must fall by 45% by 2030, scientists agree, to keep on track for no more than 1.5C of global heating. His camp takes a different approach, Jacobson says: “Let’s focus on what we have and deploy as fast as possible. And we will improve those technologies just by deploying, bringing better solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and so on. Some people just don’t realise the speed that we need to solve these problems, especially air pollution – 7 million people die every year. We can’t wait.” However, there are major barriers to a rapid rollout of a 100% renewable energy system, he says: “The No 1 barrier is that most people are not aware that it’s possible. My job is trying to educate the public about it. If people are actually comfortable that it’s possible to do, then they might actually do it.” He adds: “The policy of all-of-the-above is also a big barrier to a transition. In the US, for example, in the recent [climate legislation], a lot of money was spent on carbon capture, small modular nuclear reactors, biofuels, blue hydrogen. These are all what I consider almost useless, or very low-use, technologies in terms of solving the problems. And yet, a lot of money is spent on them. Why? Because there are big lobby groups.” Another barrier is funding the upfront costs of renewable energy in poorer countries – rich countries need to help, he says. Jacobson believes progress towards a 100% renewable energy system can be fast: “The goal is 80% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. But, ideally, if we can get 80% by 2030, we should get 100% by 2035 to 2040.” Solving the stability problem A big concern about a world overwhelmingly reliant on electricity is maintaining the stability of grids powered by renewables. Where there are large amounts of hydropower from dams this is relatively easy – at least 10 countries already have 100% renewable grids. But in other places reliance on intermittent wind and solar is more challenging. The answer, says Jacobson, is energy storage, managing the demand, and connecting up renewables over wider areas to enable greater continuity of supply. Storage can be batteries, pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed air and lowering and raising heavy weights. Jacobson thinks batteries will win, but says others could contribute if they can compete on cost. New research indicates that electric vehicle batteries alone could provide the short-term storage needed by global grids as early as 2030. Jacobson also advocates heat storage for some buildings: “Storing heat in boreholes, aquifers or water pits is dirt cheap, excuse the pun. It’s less than $1 a kilowatt hour of storage.” Managing demand, by varying electricity prices with demand, is already growing fast, he says. When the renewables supply exceeds the demand, the electricity should be used to produce green hydrogen, he says, to power the fuel cells needed by energy-intensive users. “Managing the grid is just an optimisation problem, not a rocket science problem,” he says. “I don’t want to say there’s zero problems, but usually these challenges are ironed out over time just by experience.” Another criticism of a major renewables rollout is the mining required for the metals used. But Jacobson says such a rollout would in fact hugely reduce extraction from the earth by ending fossil fuel exploitation: “The total amount of mining that’s going to be needed for wind, water, solar, compared to [the] fossil fuel system, is much less than 1% in terms of the mass of materials.” Jacobson is scathing about many nascent technologies being promoted as climate solutions. “Carbon capture and storage is solely designed to keep the fossil fuel industry in business,” he says. Only some of the CO2 is captured and buried, he says, and deadly air pollution continues unabated. Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil gas with some CO2 then captured and buried, is far inferior to green hydrogen produced directly from renewable electricity, Jacobson says: “Blue hydrogen is just really convoluted.” New nuclear plants are too slow to build and too expensive compared with wind and solar, in Jacobson’s view: “You end up waiting 15 to 20 years longer, for a seven to eight times higher electricity price – it just makes no sense. Even if they improve [build times], say to 12 years, that’s still way too long. We have cheaper, faster, safer technologies. Why waste time?” Biofuels are also dismissed by Jacobson: “The biofuels push was really not helpful. They hold constant, or increase, air pollution and they use a huge amount of land.” He is a little more measured when it comes to direct air capture (DAC): technologies that can suck CO2 from the air for burial. It has no role today, he says, with spending on renewables far more cost effective in cutting emissions. But even when fossil fuel burning ends, many scientists have concluded that CO2 will have to be drawn from the air to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. At that point, Jacobson says, the costs of DAC should be compared with other ways to sequester carbon and limit global heating, such as reforestation and cutting emissions of other more powerful greenhouse gases, including methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fertilisers. Supporters and critics Jacobson’s book has attracted support from some experts. Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania, says the book “presents a comprehensive and detailed blueprint for the options we have right now to address the climate crisis”. Mann has said those insisting we lack the tools to decarbonise the economy today are wrong. Prof Claudia Kemfert, at the German Institute for Economic Research, who has advised the German government and European Commission, says: “[The book] shows impressively that numerous crises can be killed with one stone, without us having to wait for miracles.” But others are critical of a focus on only wind, water and solar. Prof Ken Caldeira, at the Carnegie Institution for Science in the US, says: “Having a broader set [of technologies] in the toolbox only makes it easier to solve problems. We will only use the tools that it makes sense to use in any particular circumstance, but maintaining and expanding our options is a good thing. “The key question is not what is physically possible in an ideal world, but what is practically possible in the world as we know it,” he says. Prof Rob Gross, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre, is somewhere in the middle of the debate: “I broadly agree that we can largely use existing technologies, but we will need to put those to new applications, such as using bulk stores of hydrogen in order to provide interseasonal storage.” “Moonshot efforts to invent entirely new things are almost certainly a distraction,” he adds. “Jacobson is right that the principal need is to deploy what we have. He is wrong to the extent he makes this sound easy.” Asked about the controversy around his work, Jacobson says: “Usually, the people against us don’t like the fact that we don’t include their technologies.” On the lawsuit over a critical paper, he says: “That was not a question of a scientific disagreement.” He claims it was an attempt to protect his reputation. He dropped the case in 2018. Jacobson remains optimistic: “There is a technical and economic solution to the climate, air pollution and energy security problems we face. But we do have major challenges in trying to implement that solution. The challenges are getting the political willpower to focus on a narrow set of solutions that we can implement quickly. The vested interests are very much a problem because they are pushing this ‘all of the above’ approach.” No Miracles Needed: How Today’s Technology Can Save Our Climate and Clean Our Air by Mark Z Jacobson is published by Cambridge University Press on 2 February 2023, £11.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/12/rishi-sunak-stop-start-policies-harming-uk-green-investment-says-net-zero-tsar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-12T16:32:27Z","webTitle":"Sunak’s stop-start policies harming UK green investment, says net zero tsar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/12/rishi-sunak-stop-start-policies-harming-uk-green-investment-says-net-zero-tsar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/12/rishi-sunak-stop-start-policies-harming-uk-green-investment-says-net-zero-tsar","fields":{"headline":"Sunak’s stop-start policies harming UK green investment, says net zero tsar","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has been criticised by his own net zero tsar, who says the UK risks missing its green targets due to inconsistent policies and lack of commitment to pledges. In his net zero review, seen by the Guardian, Chris Skidmore said a large barrier to renewable energy was a lack of confidence in the government, which has inconsistent policy support for green energy, with measures such as Sunak’s new electricity tax. Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood, was asked by the former prime minister Liz Truss to write a review on the policy to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. He was asked to find out what was working with the policy regarding not putting more carbon into the atmosphere than the UK absorbs, and to make the business case for the goal. One issue mentioned throughout the report is a lack of policy commitment. Skidmore said: “The overwhelming impression I got was we will make net zero more affordable if we are able to deliver further and faster, which requires certainty and consistency of approach. We need to de-risk investment, which will actually drive down the costs of net zero, and if the recommendations put forward by my review are followed we will create incentives to invest in renewables. “The review recognises we have fallen behind, but it sets out how we can be world-leading in these areas once again. We need to remove the barriers that are in place at the moment.” Dan McGrail, chief executive of the trade body RenewableUK, said: “Sudden policy changes like the imposition of the electricity generator levy, which kicked in at the start of this year, have put investment at risk.” Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK, said: “Skidmore is right to demand the replacement of stop-start policies with certainty for investors.” Skidmore cited agriculture as one of the main culprits of carbon emissions, and said its share of emissions could, by 2030, grow from 12% to 30%. To encourage people to eat more environmentally friendly foods, Skidmore recommended “eco-labelling” rather than a tax or ban on foods such as red meat. He also said that farmers had been disincentivised from farming in an environmentally friendly way by the confusion around the government’s post-Brexit nature-friendly agriculture payments, and that there had been missed opportunities for nature-based solutions with most policy focused on woodlands and peatland rather than many other carbon sinks such as wetlands. In the review, Skidmore called for a stable policy environment, with consistent support for renewables, as well as a reform of the way the government financially helps renewable energy projects to make that more attractive for investors. But climate campaigners criticised the review for being unambitious and for not calling for strong policies to avert the climate crisis. Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “Whilst there is much useful analysis of the problem the review stops short of recommending the kind of muscular policies that would really drive change towards the massive growth in renewables which will be necessary. “Without a strong push from government the renewables revolution will still proceed, because the economic logic dictates it should. But it won’t happen at the pace it needs to in order to forestall some of the worst effects of climate change.” While the review says the UK needs a “rooftop revolution” for solar panels and suggests making planning decisions easier to enable this, it stops short of recommending mandates for solar panels on new builds, or more funding to encourage take-up. Parr added: “All credible scenarios of our future economy rely on renewable energy being the backbone of the future energy system, and the review should have said government needs to change the remit of the regulator to include net zero delivery, insist on solar panels being on new roofs, expand the scale of renewables contracts and rapidly lay out the location of the offshore electricity grid. Instead, the government seem like a mildly curious spectator, wondering why their aspirations aren’t materialising without ever intervening to make them happen.” The renewable energy industry has tentatively welcomed the review, with industry leaders saying it contains good ideas that should be adopted by the government. McGrail said: “If the government is looking to increase the economic benefits of the UK’s decarbonisation ambitions, Chris Skidmore’s review has some really clear easy wins. As he suggests, setting targets for new onshore wind and solar capacity would certainly increase investor confidence, as well as ensuring we can decarbonise our electricity system by 2035.” He also praised Skidmore for promoting the use of “a wide range of renewables to strengthen Britain’s energy security, including innovative technologies like floating wind and tidal stream”. He said that he would have liked the review to have told the government to take a “war room” approach to tackling grid connectivity, “with the prime minister bringing all relevant bodies together to address this urgently”. Hewett said: “We very much hope that Whitehall will embrace his call to establish a joint taskforce with the solar industry to work on a roadmap for reaching 70GW of solar [capacity] by 2035 – about four-and-a-half times what we have now. “The number-one priority of this group will have to be unblocking access to the grid – which is pushing back the completion of many large projects well into the next decade.” Polly Billington, chief executive of the UK100 group of local government leaders, said the review showed that local authorities must play a leading role in implementing policy. “This independent review confirms what UK100 has been saying for years: local authorities are the key to achieving the UK’s net zero goals,” she said. “[We particularly welcome] the recommendation to end the disjointed mess of short-term, competitive local authority funding pots. This move would help communities maximise the economic and social benefits of net zero while making the most cost-effective use of resources.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “Another day, another Conservative MP calling out the total failure of this government over many years to act with the urgency and consistency that the climate crisis demands. Chris Skidmore is right about the fact that 13 years of delay, dither and a refusal to go all-in on a green energy sprint under the Conservatives, is depriving our country of the economic opportunities climate action offers. “The tragedy is that Rishi Sunak is making things even worse. He is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age who has never understood what this report reaffirms – that going green is pro-business, pro-worker and is a vital part of growing our economy.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has been approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/jan/11/australia-news-live-floods-bushfire-emergency-western-australia-broome-derby-voice-politics-dutton-albanese-china-immigration-cost-of-living","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T07:42:21Z","webTitle":"PM prepares for PNG trip – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jan/11/australia-news-live-floods-bushfire-emergency-western-australia-broome-derby-voice-politics-dutton-albanese-china-immigration-cost-of-living","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/jan/11/australia-news-live-floods-bushfire-emergency-western-australia-broome-derby-voice-politics-dutton-albanese-china-immigration-cost-of-living","fields":{"headline":"PM prepares for PNG trip – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap up the blog for the night. Here’s what happened today: Cardinal George Pell, the former Catholic archbishop of Melbourne and of Sydney, died in Vatican City aged 81. There was reaction to the death across the country, with some honouring Pell and others remembering the controversy that surrounded him. A bipartisan coalition of members of Congress has written to the US president, Joe Biden, expressing its support for the Aukus deal. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced new funding being brought forward for the Rocky Ring Road despite the project being stalled under the previous government. The New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog said it is now unlikely to finalise its probe into the former premier Gladys Berejiklian before the March election. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the $600m decarbonisation fund for big business is in the national interest. A “massive” disaster relief operation is in full swing in the Fitzroy River catchment area, where many people remain isolated by flood waters and damaged roads. Sun Cable, the company aiming to supply Darwin and Singapore with electricity from a giant solar farm in the Northern Territory, was placed into voluntary administration. Residents near Menindee warned to avoid mosquito bites due to Murray Valley encephalitis fears Authorities in NSW are urging residents near Menindee to be wary of mosquitoes and of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), a virus that can spread from mosquitoes to humans. MVE virus is spread by mosquitos from infected animals to humans. Rarely it causes severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and people cannot get the virus by touching an infected animal or eating animal products. In a statement the executive director of Health Protection NSW, Dr Richard Broome, urges people to avoid mosquito bites and says that MVE only causes symptoms in a minority of people: Only a small proportion of people infected with the virus will experience symptoms, which include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and muscle aches. Among those who get a severe infection, some may die or have lifelong neurological complications. There is no vaccination or specific treatment for MVE and the best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are most active between dusk and dawn. Avoiding mosquito bites will also protect against other mosquito-borne infections including Japanese encephalitis, Ross River fever and Barmah Forest virus. Coalition welcomes US bipartisan show of support for Aukus The federal opposition has welcomed a move by members of the US House of Representatives to declare their strong support for Aukus. The supportive letter to the US president, Joe Biden, was signed by nine US House of Representatives members from both parties, including the Democratic representative Joe Courtney who led the effort. The letter says the US will gain from providing “our closest ally with an undersea capability to better posture itself in the region”. Courtney’s grouping says while it is essential for the US to stick to its own plan to build a minimum of two submarines a year to meet American requirements, “we are supportive of expanding the industrial base to meet Aukus expectations”. That could include the US providing or building new submarines for Australia before domestic construction is ready. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said the opposition “welcomes the bipartisan support and commitment of the US Congress for Aukus”. In a statement issued this afternoon, Hastie said: The Coalition, which alongside our US and UK partners formed the historic security pact in 2021, recognises that delivering future capability, including Australia’s first nuclear submarine, will require a significant step up from industry and government. Production lines must be scaled up to get boats in the water as quickly as possible – whether it be to support ‘off the shelf’ options or to domestically produce nuclear powered submarines. Or both concurrently. We know that Aukus is a nation building opportunity for Australia and call on the Albanese Government to do whatever is necessary to drive contribution in a timely manner. The Opposition remains committed to supporting the shared vision of Aukus to secure Australia’s national interests. Key decisions are due in March. Anthony Albanese has spoken to ABC Queensland about his trip to Papua New Guinea. He said: I will have the great honour tomorrow morning of being the first foreign leader to ever address the parliament of Papua New Guinea [and] Thursday the 12th of January isn’t normally when the parliament would be sitting. So the PNG government of Prime Minister [James] Marape, are giving Australia, a great honour, in all of the MPs being brought together for this address and then we’ll have our PNG-Australia annual leaders dialogue take place after that. Minister Pat Conroy who has responsibility for the Pacific is coming with me as well as Senator Nita Green, who’s the local senator based here in Cairns will be traveling, as well as senior members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This will be important. There’s no more near neighbour with such a strong history as Papua New Guinea in the links with Australia, of course, and next year, we will commemorate the 50-year anniversary of independence for PNG ... The economic relationship and economic development there is critical. National security – we will be talking about our enhanced security arrangements and cooperation there, which is critical as our near neighbour to the north. But also, our common interest in acting on climate change and will be having a discussion as well about advancing the vision that Prime Minister Marape has to have a rugby league team based in PNG, made up of people from PNG, the Pacific Islands and around the region. And that is something that, of course, those links are so important that we have those cultural links and our common interest, and one of our common interests is, of course, passion for rugby league. Bushwalker spots three men in the water off Sydney sparking rescue Three men whose boat capsized in rough seas off Sydney have been rescued thanks to a bushwalker’s keen eye, AAP reports. The walker saw the men in the water near Wedding Cake Rock in Sydney’s south today and called for help, sparking a rescue involving three helicopters. The men had been in the water for about an hour before being spotted, the NSW ambulance Inspector Andrew Bibby said. “All agencies worked well together to coordinate the rescue, with the men winched from the water and taken to NSW ambulance paramedics to be assessed,” Bibby said. The men were treated for hypothermia at Wattamolla beach before being taken to Sutherland hospital in a stable condition. Bibby said the use of life jackets was key in preventing a more serious outcome. “This is a timely reminder to anyone heading out on the water to be prepared,” he said. Marine Rescue NSW said boaters should ensure to bring an emergency beacon, called an Epirb, when heading out on the water, particularly more than two nautical miles. The beacon emits a continuous radio signal when activated, alerting search and rescue services. A spokeswoman for NSW police confirmed the overturned boat has been safely towed to shore. We’re getting a bit more clarity over what happened between billionaire investors in Sun Cable, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest. So, Grok, which is MCB’s family firm, points to one investor standing in the way of the company. Forrest isn’t named, but he’s the one they have in mind. “In the circumstances, including where all but one shareholder agreed with the company’s funding strategy – the Board was left with no other option, but to enter into voluntary administration,” the Grok spokesperson says. Grok remains “a strong supporter of Sun Cable delivering the world’s largest solar energy infrastructure network and the Australia-Asia Power Link (AAPowerLink)”, the spokesperson said, adding they are confident the firm “will be an attractive investment proposition and remain at the forefront of Australia’s energy transition”. The “circumstances”, so Guardian Australia has been told, involve the need for emergency funding in the order of $60m that investors had to decide on just before Christmas. Forrest had his view and MCB had a different one. Why the company needed the funds, having raised $210m last March, seems to hinge on how fast Sun Cable was “burning” through the cash. Management was – according to one source – also failing to meet its agreed goals, with Indonesian agreements being one source of angst. MCB’s Grok reckons Sun Cable “has made tremendous progress” over the AAPowerLink in the past few years and sees voluntary administration as providing the best opportunity for it to access “appropriate funding sources”. Those sources could yet include money from Twiggy Forrest, but that would seem unlikely unless the board and management changed, and that includes turfing out MCB who is Sun Cable’s chair. Moral of the story? As the African parable goes, “when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. When elephants make love, the grass also suffers”. One elephant per pasture, then, might be the way to go. Scott Morrison loses Twitter blue tick status In another loss, the former prime minister Scott Morrison has been stripped of his blue Twitter verification tick. It comes after the Twitter CEO, Elon Musk, introduced a paid verification program, and after Twitter Support said (in a tweet, of course) that verified accounts that change their display name or profile photo will lose their check until their account can be reviewed. Morrison’s Facebook and Instagram accounts are still verified though, and also more active than his Twitter. His last tweet was a link to an explainer on how to vote for the Liberal party on election day: Ten-year-old boy critical but stable after Gold Coast helicopter crash Sydney boy Nicholas Tadros is in a critical but stable condition a day after he was due for surgery following the helicopter crash that killed his mother and three others on the Gold Coast, AAP reports. The 10-year-old is one of three survivors who were in a helicopter that collided with another chopper and crashed into a sandbar near Sea World on 2 January. Four people died including Nicholas’s mother, Vanessa Tadros, 36, Britons Ron and Diane Hughes, 65 and 57, and the 40-year-old pilot Ashley Jenkinson. Nicholas’s lungs were flooded with aviation fuel but their capacity has improved over the past few days and he was transferred on the weekend to Queensland Children’s hospital for an operation on Tuesday. His father, Simon Tadros, told friends it would be a “major test” with five surgeries for broken bones in his left hand and both legs, which are broken in multiple places. Nicholas’s condition has been “critical” since the crash, but he appeared to have slightly improved as of Wednesday. “Nicholas Tadros is in a critical but stable condition,” a hospital spokesperson said. Simon Tadros’s friend Charlie Bakhos invited people to pray a special rosary for Nicholas at St Charbel’s Monastery Punchbowl, in south-west Sydney, on Wednesday night. “For his recovery and to give his family strength during this time,” he wrote on Facebook on Wednesday. “Everyone is welcome.” The nine-year-old Victorian boy Leon de Silva, who was in the same helicopter as Nicholas, is in a stable condition at the hospital after suffering a brain injury in the accident. Leon’s mother, Winnie, 33, is also stable in a Gold Coast hospital after undergoing another operation for her injuries that include two broken legs, a damaged left knee, a broken right shoulder and a broken collarbone. The Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, has remembered Cardinal George Pell as “a fine priest” and “a good Christian soul”. In a statement, Fisher says Pell “lived up” to his own episcopal motto, “Be Not Afraid”, and that he had seen Pell last week for the funeral of Pope Benedict, where Pell was “in good spirits”. Fisher also adds that the archdiocese of Sydney “thrived” under Pell’s leadership and that Pell worked for “openness in Church affairs”: The Archdiocese of Sydney thrived under his leadership. He saw great promise in youth, and his vision in bringing World Youth Day 2008 to Sydney saw a whole generation of young Catholics respond to Christ’s call. Our community as a whole was uplifted by this colossal event and moved by the testimony it offered. His Eminence was an author of books and a regular newspaper columnist, a lecturer and leader in Catholic education, and a scholar in his own right. He served the broader Church as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vox Clara Commission, the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Congregation of Bishops. As Prefect for the Secretariat of the Economy, member of Pope Francis’ Council of Cardinal Advisors and one of the highest-ranking church officials in the world, the Cardinal’s work for openness in Church affairs was hugely important. His final years were marked by his wrongful conviction and imprisonment, but he bore this with grace and goodwill and gave us all an example of how to accept suffering with dignity and peace. His words of reconciliation with his detractors and concern for survivors increased in authenticity as he steadfastly and successfully maintained his innocence. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued severe thunderstorm warnings for central Queensland: Retailers call on government to help fix ‘chronic labour shortages’ Following on from the release of labour numbers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia’s peak retail body, the Australian Retailers Association, is urging the government to introduce measures to alleviate “chronic labour shortages”. In a statement, the ARA said the data released today showed the scale of the crisis, showing 49,900 vacancies across the retail sector in November 2022 – an increase of 8.2% compared to August 2022. The association’s CEO, Paul Zahra, has urged state and federal governments to intervene: Retail businesses are at the coalface of Australia’s economy and our daily lives, yet they can’t secure enough staff. The Government has made great strides in this space, increasing the cap on migration, improving support for women in the workforce and introducing the Work Bonus for pensioners – but it’s clear from today’s data that further work is urgently needed. These shortages were exacerbated during the frenetic Christmas trading period, the most critical time of the year for retail. And the strain of labour shortages is far reaching. You end up with staff who can find themselves overworked and burnt out, and shoppers languishing in longer queues. With longer waiting times, shoppers become impatient and the risk of antisocial behaviour increases. A 10-strong Australian team has just completed a 1,200km traverse across Antarctica, reaching a site where they hope to drill a core of ice at least one million years old. Tractors set off from Casey station – 3,880km south of Perth – on 23 December, dragging heavy-duty sleds, snow groomers, accommodation vans, science labs and tents. After passing a European ice core team carrying out a simultaneous mission, the Australian team arrived at its selected drill site at Little Dome C in the last few hours. The Antarctic traverse is the furthest inland for the Australian program since 1962. “We made it,” tweeted the glaciologist and cryosphere modeller Dr Lenneke Jong. The aim of the Australian Antarctic Program’s Million Year Ice mission is to drill down 3km and extract a core of ice that will give a continuous record of the Earth’s climate going back one million years. After setting up the mobile research station, the drilling program is expected to take four to five summers to complete. As snow falls in Antarctica it traps air pockets as it compresses year after year, preserving a record of the atmosphere at that time. Ice cores have been a central tool for climate scientists to understand the planet’s past conditions, and are used to help calibrate climate models. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, tweeted congratulations to the team. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has released a statement on Cardinal George Pell’s death, calling him an “important intellectual figure and a towering presence in the Catholic community”. The statement rattles off all the places Pell has been, including when he was ordained, his appointment as cardinal (which Dutton calls a “good day for Australia”) and his appointment in 2014 as head of the Vatican’s Secretariat for the Economy. Dutton goes on to say that Pell’s convictions being quashed by the high court should have caused some reflection for the Victorian Labor government that “led this modern-day political persecution”: No other Australian has risen to a higher position in the Catholic Church. A fierce defender of the Catholic faith and Christian ideals, Dr Pell made friends – and enemies – along the way. On his passing, the fact he spent a year in prison for a conviction that the High Court of Australia unanimously quashed should provide some cause for reflection for the Victorian Labor Government and its institutions that led this modern-day political persecution. Pell never lost faith in his God, his country, and in justice – despite the tests and trials he endured in life. Sun Cable, the company aiming to supply Darwin and Singapore with electricity from a giant solar farm in the Northern Territory, has been placed into voluntary administration. The company had the backing of both Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, including raising $210m from the billionaires and other investors last year. The plans had included a solar farm of as much as 20 gigawatts of capacity, and had been eyeing a project cost of $30bn all up. In a media statement today, Sun Cable said it had “made the difficult decision to enter voluntary administration”. It’s hoped the move would “unlock a path forward for the company to access additional capital for continued development of its marque project, the Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) and progress the next stage of its development portfolio in a strong market”. The administrators, Christopher Hill, David McGrath and John Park of FTI Consulting, will likely “seek expressions of interest for either a recapitalisation or sale of the business”. “The appointment followed the absence of alignment with the objectives of all shareholders,” the statement said. It notes Sun Cable currently has a portfolio of a further 11GW of proposed projects. Cannon-Brookes, as chair of Sun Cable, may not be going away, it seems. “Sun Cable has achieved so much since it was founded in 2018. I’m confident it will play a huge role in delivering green energy for the world, right here from Australia,” MCB, the co-founder of Atlassian, said. “I fully back this ambition and the team, and look forward to supporting the company’s next chapter.” Let’s see if any of these ventures can be revived. PM says Australia will continue to engage China on dropping tariffs Asked whether Australia might drop its World Trade Organization challenges against China’s tariffs on Australian wine and barley in order to progress the diplomatic relationship, Anthony Albanese said the government would “engage in our national interest”. He said Australia would “continue to put our case that any impediments which are there towards trade should be removed in Australia’s interest and in China’s interest”. He said Australia was looking for a “win-win” outcome (using one of Beijing’s favourite phrases), but that the two countries would continue to have differences: The dialogue has been constructive. No one can argue that the mood in the relationship has not been enhanced substantially since I’ve been prime minister. I’ve been busy making sure that that occurs. We’ll continue to engage in a constructive way. But we do have differences with China, and we’ll continue to stand up for our interests where we must … The fact that yesterday, again, the ambassador made positive soundings is a good sign. But we’ll continue to engage diplomatically. For more on the Chinese ambassador’s intervention, see our news report here: Anthony Albanese asked about Chinese ambassador’s comments on Japan The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has declared that Australia has “a very positive relationship with Japan” in response to a question about the Chinese ambassador’s warning that Canberra should be wary of Tokyo’s intentions. Albanese attempted to remain above the fray as he was asked a series of questions today about the 90-minute press conference conducted by China’s ambassador, Xiao Qian, yesterday. The main message that Albanese took from that press conference was that China was “positive and constructive” about the prospect of continued improvement in relations between Canberra and Beijing this year. Xiao yesterday took a swipe at the Japanese ambassador to Australia, Shingo Yamagami, who has repeatedly warned publicly about security threats posed by China. Xiao said ambassadors posted to Canberra should not try to stop Australia from developing a normal relationship with a third country such as China: “I’m afraid our colleague from Japan is not doing his job.” Xiao argued Japan had never properly apologised for its actions during the second world war – including bombing Darwin and mistreating Australian prisoners of war – and he questioned whether “they might repeat the history”. That intervention prompted a journalist to ask Albanese in Rockhampton today: Yesterday, the Chinese ambassador raised world war two and that Australia should be wary of a possible military attack from Japan in the future. Do you think that’s a serious prospect? Albanese responded: We have a very positive relationship with Japan. I have visited Japan twice as prime minister and hosted Prime Minister Kishida at a very successful visit in Perth at the end of last year. I look forward to hosting Prime Minister Kishida here in some time in 2023 as part of the Quad leaders meeting. With China, we also want to see an improvement in relations. I believe that the ambassador’s comments were positive and constructive about those issues. I met with President Xi last year. That was a positive meeting; it led to the foreign minister visiting Beijing on the 21st of December to commemorate the 50th anniversary of positive relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of China. I look forward to continuing to build on that constructive dialogue, I want to cooperate with China where we can, we will disagree where we must, but will engage in our national interest. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, beginning with a quick thanks to Rafqa Touma and Natasha May for their work this morning. Handing over to Mostafa Rachwani, who will carry the blog into the evening. PM urges politicians ‘to not put up furphies’ on the voice referendum The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has implored federal politicians not to put out “furphies” on the voice to parliament referendum, and says social media companies have a responsibility to not let misinformation thrive on their platforms. Going back to Albanese’s press conference in Queensland earlier on, he was asked a few questions about the voice at the tail end, specifically about fears of misinformation online. As we reported this morning, several legal experts raised concerns that the scrapping of the official information pamphlet traditionally distributed at referendums would lead to further false details being spread online. Albanese said the government would continue to put out clear factual information on public websites about the vote. After criticising the Coalition frontbencher Jane Hume who admitted she hadn’t read the voice co-design report from Marcia Langton and Tom Calma, the PM also made a pointed remark about the role of “public office holders” (ie politicians) in the referendum. I would just say that people should not put out disinformation. It will be combated where it can. But I would say that there’s a need to be responsible, particularly public office holders, to be responsible and to not put up furphies in order to to confuse the situation going forward. Pressed further on whether the government had actively sounded out social media companies in a bid to address misinformation on the voice, Albanese admitted he hadn’t personally. I have not had those discussions. But social media platforms have a responsibility to make sure that misinformation isn’t got out there. Social media has a responsibility to do the right thing here. Archbishop Peter Comensoli says he hopes his work with victims of child sexual abuse defines “appropriate compensation and redress”. I would hope on my own journey with them, which is something happens on a weekly basis for me, that I am walking with and seeking justice for, defining of appropriate compensation and redress, and there are ongoing care and support, all things we as a local church group in Melbourne strive to do as best we can. And each of us will be judged accordingly on how we might be able to handle that. Archbishop Peter Comensoli tells a press conference that Cardinal George Pell was “one of the great churchmen of Australia”. He, over many years, has been a forthright defender of the faith, a great gospel man I find him. And that dimension of his life will remain, I think, a very important dimension. There probably has not been a churchman in Australia quite like the cardinal. His response in the Australian context and the international context has been quite instrumental, and I think for many years to come that will be known and thought about. The Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, is holding a press conference on the “really unexpected” death of Cardinal George Pell. I am a sinner, all of us are sinners, and all of us in that sense we failed in ways. In a sense, our beliefs as Christians is towards a God who is full of tenderness and we strive to live that in our own lives. None of us do that well, all the time. We are all sinners and in need of our Lord’s mercy and forgiveness. Comensoli says Pell was “quite a good mentor, a really important mentor, a father figure for me”. I have known him well for about 12 years, and it is seen as something of a real friend. Of these last few years, when he has been in retirement, either in Rome or back in Sydney, that he has been able to continue to exercise his role as a cardinal and to do so in ways that were then able to build up the life of faith in those sort of settings. Million-year ice core researchers travel 1,200km over icy landscape to reach project site Australian researchers have made it to Little Dome C in Antarctica to drill down into million-year-old ice in an effort to learn about climate change. The team of 10 traversed 1,200km over 19 days in temperatures as low as -50C on their Antarctic expedition. The researchers will analyse air bubbles trapped in ice cores to help inform what we know about the climate system’s stability over the past 1m years, and help scientists make predictions about the future. Retail sales rise 1.4% in November, boosted by Black Friday spending More from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with retail sales growth surprising on the upside too. Completing the trifecta of higher-than-tipped November numbers from the ABS today were retail sales. These rose 1.4% for the month alone, and 7.7% from a year earlier. The ANZ, for instance, tipped a 0.6% monthly rise and CBA expected a 0.8% increase. Given rising prices and an expanding population, total spending hit new record highs, as you might expect (sans pandemics etc). Among the pointers to the economy being robust towards the end of 2022, October’s retail sales were also revised to a 0.4% increase compared with an initial decrease when first reported. Ben Dorber, the ABS head of retail statistics, attributed Black Friday sales for boosting spending on clothing, footwear, furniture and electronic goods. (Not to be confused with “Black Friday” related to bushfires – this is some marketing ruse for the day after the US Thanksgiving day on the last Thursday of November.) “Given the increasing popularity of Black Friday sales, the smaller increase in October may reflect consumers waiting to take advantage of discounting in November, particularly in light of cost-of-living pressures,” Dorber said. All up, then, the November numbers might well be noted by the Reserve Bankers at the beach or wherever they spend their summer sloth. Not a lot of sign of the economy losing steam even with the flurry of rate rises to November (with another in December). John Howard releases statement on death of George Pell The death of George Cardinal Pell in Rome has taken from us a person of enormous influence, not only in the Catholic Church, but in the nation more generally. He was a strong and determined religious leader. His episcopal motto was ‘be not afraid’. In the senior roles he held in the Church, he displayed consistent courage in expressing Christian views in the public space. Believers and non-believers alike were left in no doubt where George Pell stood on issues. His deep and compassionate faith sustained him during more than 400 days in prison for alleged crimes which many, me included, believed should never have been the subject of charges. Cardinal Pell’s trust in Australia’s justice system was vindicated when the High Court of Australia unanimously quashed his conviction. A great sports lover, having been an accomplished Australian Rules player, he then embraced the more widely played Rugby codes in Sydney. Until recent years he and his late sister were regulars during the traditional New Year Cricket Test in Sydney. We often spent time together at the cricket discussing all manner of issues. I liked and respected the late Cardinal a lot. His passing is a great loss to the intellectual and spiritual life of our country.” Teal independents say safeguard mechanism revamp ‘falls short’ and has ‘room for improvement’ Zali Steggall, the federal member for Warringah, says the Albanese government’s proposed changes to the safeguard mechanism “falls short”. Kate Chaney, the federal member for Curtin, thinks there is “room for improvement”, but says the proposal still “looks pretty good”. The New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog says it is now unlikely to finalise its probe into the former premier Gladys Berejiklian before the March election, citing the complexity of the investigation. Operation Keppel began as an investigation into the former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire before widening to include Berejiklian after details of her “close personal relationship” with him were revealed in 2020. Berejiklian resigned as premier in 2021 after the Independent Commission Against Corruption revealed it had widened its probe to include whether she broke the law by failing to report his alleged conduct. Berejiklian repeatedly denied any alleged wrongdoing, including during her grilling at a fresh set of hearings in October 2021. The commission had been expected to hand down its findings last year, but it has repeatedly pushed the finalised report, including as recently as October. On Wednesday the commission confirmed the commissioner, Ruth McColl, was “continuing her work in relation to the Operation Keppel report” but was now unlikely to deliver the final report until the second quarter of this year. In a statement, the commission said: Substantial parts of the report have been drafted. At the same time, it must be recognised that the report concerns complex matters of law and fact, two public inquiries which proceeded over 30 days, over 2,800 pages of transcript, 516 exhibits comprising approximately 10,600 pages and 957 pages of submissions (the last of which were received on 18 October 2022). It is necessary that the issues relevant to the investigation are addressed carefully. Ms McColl is working to complete a draft of the report as soon as possible but, given these matters, it is not possible to specify a date by which it will be completed. It said that once the report was complete it would still need to be subjected to “review, editing and production processes” and was “now unlikely” to be handed in during the first quarter of the year. Icac said: On the information presently available the Commission anticipates it is more likely to be available for furnishing in the second quarter of 2023. Abuse survivor network calls for Catholic church to avoid funeral service with full honours for Pell SNAP, a network of 25,000 abuse survivors based in the United States, has called for the Catholic church to avoid a “funeral service with full honors for Cardinal Pell”. In a statement, the group said: We hope Catholic officials will show compassion to abuse victims and betrayed Catholics by avoiding a funeral service with full honors for Cardinal Pell. Restraint would be appropriate unless the church hierarchy wants to deepen already deep wounds. In our view, Pell’s serious wrongdoing is already ignored and minimized by the church’s hierarchy. The group encouraged abuse survivors to seek support from trusted friends and families or from support groups. Louise Milligan: ‘Think about how painful it is’ for victim survivors ABC reporter Louise Milligan, who has reported extensively on Cardinal Pell, tells ABC News how alleged survivors of child abuse may take news of Pell’s death. This is the end of a very dark chapter in the life of the Australian church which is connected to the life of the international church. George Pell was at the pinnacle of that history in Australia and then rose to become the third most senior Catholic in the world. For victims and survivors, including complainants who made allegations against him, it is, I think, still brings up all of that pain. And the pain never goes away. I would always say to people to think about those people. Think about how painful it is for those people and have a bit of empathy and kindness towards those people. Aerial shots show Broome-bound freight pushing through roads inundated with water, amid flooding in Western Australia. Community disenchantment means Catholic church’s influence ‘waning rapidly’: Francis Sullivan Francis Sullivan, CEO of the Truth, Justice and Healing Council, tells ABC news the Catholic church’s influence is “waning rapidly”. We saw through the royal commission the absolute horror the community felt when it realised the degree to which the church would conceal and do everything to protect its image, even though the damage to survivors was so obvious. And the persistence and inertia that the hierarchy of the church has demonstrated for decades has only led to great disenchantment and disinterest now, from so many Catholics and the wider community. And in turn, the church’s influence in areas where it should have quite a lot of it is waning rapidly. On Pell’s handling of sexual abuse complaints against clergy, Sullivan says: The whole sex abuse scandal is prominent because he, along with others, administered the church in a period where they sought to contain rather than be completely open. The Truth, Justice and Healing Council was established by Catholic representative bodies in response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Global economic growth forecast downgraded by nearly half The World Bank has downgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2023 by almost half – from 3% to just 1.7%. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says “this report leaves little no doubt the international economy is facing its third crisis in 15 years – following the hammer blows caused by the GFC and pandemic”. We should be optimistic about the future of our economy and our country but realistic about what the deteriorating international outlook means for us in Australia. Global prospects in 2023 will be shaped by the energy shock caused by the war in Ukraine, China’s Covid management, the fate of major economies, and the trajectory, severity and impact of interest rate rises around the world. And here in Australia, we know all too well our communities and economy are also facing greater threats from floods, fire, storms and drought. While Australia won’t be immune from a global slowdown, the Albanese government is continuing its work towards creating a stronger, more inclusive and more resilient economy that can better withstand future shocks. Thanks for your attention this Wednesday morning. Take it away, Rafqa Touma! Snap analysis on US jostling on Aukus It’s worth taking a moment to step through why a group of US politicians felt the need to write to Joe Biden in strong support of the Aukus security deal – and where the points of contention remain as key decisions loom. Under Aukus, Australia plans acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with the help of the US and the UK, and March looms as the deadline for more details about which design will be adopted and the timeframe for construction. That’s why there is an uptick in activity to bed down exactly how this might be achieved. The letter to the US president, published overnight, was signed by nine US House of Representatives members from both parties, including Democratic representative Joe Courtney who led the effort. They were implicitly pushing back at an argument advanced recently by two key senators about risks to the US’s own submarine needs if the Biden administration agrees to sell one or two Virginia-class submarines to Australia this decade. The idea has been floated as a potential way to bridge the gap before Australia is ready to start building its own nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. Domestically built ones may not start to be operational until the late 2030s or early 2040s, but Australia’s existing conventional Collins class submarines will start to be retired in the late 2030s. The stopgap idea is clearly being taken seriously by the Biden administration. But it’s well known that the US production line is already under stress as the US navy seeks to ramp up construction of its own submarines. That is what led Democratic senator Jack Reed – the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee – and then-Republican senator James Inhofe to implore Biden not to stress “the US submarine industrial base to the breaking point”. Reed and Inhofe raised concern that “what was initially touted as a ‘do no harm’ opportunity to support Australia and the United Kingdom and build long-term competitive advantages for the US and its Pacific allies, may be turning into a zero-sum game for scarce, highly advanced US [nuclear submarines]”. But the new letter by the Courtney-led bipartisan group says the US will gain from providing “our closest ally with an undersea capability to better posture itself in the region”. Courtney’s grouping says while it is essential for the US to stick to its own plan to build a minimum of two submarines a year to meet its own requirements, “we are supportive of expanding the industrial base to meet Aukus expectations”. Far from a zero-sum game, the potential for the United States to provide or build new submarines under Aukus, should that be the recommendation of the trilateral consultation, could very well be a ‘rising tide that lifts all boats’ … We particularly believe that an expansion of our industrial base beyond two submarines would support the early provisioning of existing Virginia class submarines to be made available concurrent with the retirement of the Collins class attack submarines. These realities should not be viewed as a reason not to pursue US build submarine options in Aukus but rather as a unique opportunity to leverage the support and resources possible under Aukus to grow our industrial base to support both US and Australian submarine construction, recognizing that the full fruition of Aukus over many decades will result in Australia’s ability to domestically produce nuclear-powered submarines. It should be pointed out that none of the US politicians who have been active on either side of this debate have been hostile to the broad security partnership known as Aukus. The contention is about exactly how the US can help Australia in the short to medium term without undermining its own submarine needs. For his part, Reed popped up on Twitter overnight to made clear his recent letter should not be seen as opposing Aukus; he just wanted “responsible oversight and a stable industrial base”. Reed said Aukus was “central to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, dramatically improving the capabilities of our allies, and increasing our engagement in the region”. Expect to see this debate heating up in the weeks ahead. Number of job vacancies slide further but remain far above pre-Covid levels Another key number out today from the ABS is the one for job vacancies, and that result is a slight down arrow. In November, vacancies totalled 444,000 – down 5% or 23,000 – from the August reading. That tally is now off 8% from the May peak. The number of job openings, though, remains high by historic measures, and is still almost double the pre-Covid level of 228,000. The number of businesses reporting at least one vacancy is still rising, with about 28% of firms looking for staff, according to Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS. Jarvis said: These figures continue to show the high demand for workers across many businesses and all industries, in a tight labour market. Interestingly, vacancies to work in the public sector were up 6% while those in the private sector were down by that margin, compared with August. Such large vacancy numbers might suggest the jobless rate, at 3.4% in November, might have further to fall before it inevitably starts to climb as the higher interest rates start to drag on the economy. Next up, some retail numbers that are mildly therapeutic. Father of deceased ex-choirboy will continue civil action against Pell despite cardinal’s death A father of a deceased ex-choirboy who alleged that Cardinal George Pell sexually abused him while he was archbishop of Melbourne will continue his civil action against the cardinal despite his death. Pell was acquitted in 2020 after the high court quashed his convictions for child sexual assault related to allegations he molested two choirboys in the sacristy at St Patrick’s Cathedral while he was archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. He served 13 months in prison before being released. One of the choirboys died aged 31 from a drug overdose. His father filed a civil claim against the Catholic archdiocese of Melbourne and Pell in the supreme court in July last year. The man is suing for damages for psychological injury, which he claims he suffered after learning of the allegations his son had been sexually abused. The case is being defended. His lawyer, Shine Lawyers chief legal officer, Lisa Flynn, has issued the following statement: Shine Lawyers is progressing a civil claim on behalf of the father of a former altar boy who alleged he was sexually abused by George Pell. The Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne is also listed as a defendant in this matter. The claim will continue against the church and whatever estate Pell has left behind. A civil trial likely would have provided the opportunity to cross examine Pell, and truly test his defence against these allegations. There is still a great deal of evidence for this claim to rely on, and the court will be asked in due course to make its ruling on that evidence. Taking questions, Albanese is asked about Cardinal George Pell’s death. He expresses his condolences for those mourning and says it will “come as a shock to many”. He also says the Department of Foreign Affairs is assisting bringing Pell’s body back to Australia. For many people, particularly of the Catholic faith, this will be a difficult day and I express my condolences to all those who are mourning today. I discussed with Archbishop Fisher this morning, I expressed my condolences to Archbishop Fisher on behalf of the government. Archbishop Fisher informed me that there will be a service held in the Vatican in coming days but then there will be a service at St Mary’s Cathedral at sometime in the future. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade trade [is] providing assistance to ensure that Cardinal Pell is brought back to Australia and those arrangements are being put in place and further announcements will be made when they are finalised. Asked whether he will be attending the funeral, Albanese said: It hasn’t been set yet for when, for any of those dates. There will be an event in the coming days in the Vatican and that will be held as appropriate. The announcements will be made, they haven’t been finalised yet of course, this will come as a shock to many. This was a hip operation and the consequences of it unfortunately have been that Cardinal Pell has lost his life, and I’ll express my condolences to all those who will be mourning today. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking live from Rockhampton in Queensland. He’s speaking about new funding being brought forward for the Rocky Ring Road despite the project being stalled under the previous government. Now that you have a federal Labor government working with the Queensland Labor government, we are getting on with this project, and that is why we have brought forward $280m to commence a project that will cost more than $1bn. We are still doing the final costing because it wasn’t done properly by the former government. Albanese says the project will mean more than 2,600 heavy vehicles are taken off Rockhampton CBD every day which will improve efficiency and road safety. Consumer prices in November were up 7.3% from a year earlier, with the cost of food, transport and new houses rising the most, the Australian Bureau of Statistics says. In the first batch of notable ABS stats for the year, headline CPI quickened in the month from the 6.9% pace recorded in October. Analysts had been tipping 7.2%, so the outcome was slightly above those expectations. Within the mix, the cost of building a new home rose 9.6% from a year earlier. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were 9.4% more pricey, while transport was 9% more expensive. The trimmed mean measure of inflation, which the Reserve Bank is interested in, rose 5.6% from a year earlier, or slightly above the 5.5% market consensus. Prior to today’s numbers, investors had tipped a roughly three-in-five chance the RBA would hike its key interest rate another 25 basis points when its board meets early next month. Such a rise would extend the record series of rate rises to nine, and bring the cash rate to 3.35%. That’s getting a bit ahead of things, but today’s CPI numbers on the margin will likely increase the odds of that rate rise on 7 February. A couple of other economic stats to look at … stay tuned. Reports Pell’s body will be flown back to Australia for burial Cardinal George Pell has died in Rome, but Catholic media outlet Crux Now is reporting his body will be flown back to Australia for burial. Pell will be flown back to Australia following his Vatican funeral, and he will be buried in St. Mary’s Cathedral in Sydney, where he served as archbishop for 13 years before moving to the Vatican. The president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, has just issued a statement on the death of George Pell. Costelloe said Pell had provided “strong and clear leadership” for the church in Australia. The world, as his Vatican appointments as Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy and as a member of the Council of Cardinals, an advisory group to Pope Francis, testify. Cardinal Pell’s impact on the life of the Church in Australia and around the world will continue to be felt for many years. As we remember him and reflect on his legacy, I invite all Catholics and other people of goodwill to join in praying for Cardinal Pell, a man of deep and abiding faith, and for the repose of his soul. Government considering introducing carbon tariffs, Bowen says Circling back to the ABC Radio interview with the energy minister, Chris Bowen, following the government’s changes to the safeguard mechanism yesterday: Bowen said the government is considering introducing carbon tariffs in the way that the EU has talked about doing, so that Australian businesses now facing these obligations remain competitive internationally. Yes, this is something we should look at alongside all the other options available to government to ensure that now that Australia has a decent climate policy, Australian industry is guided on that, and just as Europe has gone down this road, Australia will consider its options alongside other options. Australia’s lucrative international student sector appears set for a huge boost due to improving relations with China. Government data shows Chinese student visa holders more than halved between 2019 and 2022, falling from 165,149 to 78,234 during the pandemic period. China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said yesterday “bad political relations” had contributed to students’ reluctance to come to Australia, but more stability in the relationship should see that trend reversed. He told reporters: Some Chinese students are not happy with the policies and then they might be hesitant to come to study. Once we have an improvement [in the] relationship, that absolutely is going to send messages to students [that] you should have confidence about the future, you should have confidence about the relationship between the two countries, you should have confidence to come back to study in Australia. Xiao said “absolutely extraordinary” policies for international students could also deter students from coming to Australia. Student visa holders require approval from the Department of Home Affairs to switch courses and some require initial approval before they can begin a course. Xiao said: Some of the policies by the previous government, they have been a negative influence on Chinese students’ attitudes to come to study in this country. This is absolutely extraordinary … this is very much not a normal kind of practice in many other countries. Australia’s international student sector was valued at a cool $40bn in 2019. The employment and workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, said the Labor government was approaching Chinese-Australian relations differently from its predecessors. He told Nine: … the refrain now is, you cooperate where you can, you disagree where you must, and you pursue the national interest. Out of that we have seen a thawing of relationships; things are much better than they were twelve months ago. - AAP Archbishop of Melbourne confirms George Pell died of heart complications following hip surgery The archbishop of Melbourne, Peter A Comensoli, has confirmed George Pell died of heart complications following hip surgery in Rome. In a statement, he said: It is with great sadness that I have learned that Cardinal George Pell, the seventh Archbishop of Melbourne, has died overnight from heart complications following hip surgery in Rome, Italy. Cardinal Pell was a very significant and influential Church leader, both in Australia and internationally, deeply committed to Christian discipleship. Cardinal Pell led the local Church of Melbourne from 1996 to 2001 with strong leadership in the Catholic faith and with good governance, before being transferred to Sydney and then to Rome. At this immediate moment, let our prayers go out to the God of Jesus Christ, whom Cardinal Pell wholeheartedly believed in and followed, that he may be welcomed into eternal life. Our prayers of comfort and condolence are also with his family, especially his only surviving sibling David Pell. May eternal light shine upon him, and may he now rest in peace and rise to glory in the Lord. Australian charities forced to spend millions to deal with donation dumping Australian charities are forking out millions of dollars to deal with donation “dumping” amid increasing demands for their help as the cost-of-living crisis bites. The St Vincent de Paul Society in South Australia knew that the Christmas break increased the risk of donated goods being left strewn across the ground outside bins, so it organised daily cleanouts of the bins – but it wasn’t enough. Images show piles of goods stretching the length of its storefront in Mount Barker. In the end, it had to hire trucks to remove the goods, some of which will end up in landfill. WA bushfire threats downgraded Two bushfires that threatened properties in Western Australia have been downgraded from emergency warnings to watch and act alerts. Residents near a fire burning east of Donnybrook in the state’s southwest were told on Tuesday they were in danger and should evacuate. The warning was issued for people in parts of Beelerup, Brookhampton and Charley Creek, and an evacuation centre was opened at Donnybrook Recreation Centre. That blaze was downgraded to watch and act on Wednesday morning. The Department of Fire and Emergency Services said the fire, caused by lightning, was stationary but not contained or controlled, with 30 firefighters building and strengthening containment lines. Meanwhile, a second blaze that on Tuesday threatened homes about 10km southeast of Bridgetown in the rural areas of Sunnyside, Kingston and Yornup has also been downgraded from an emergency warning to a watch and act. The fire started near the intersection of Gomm Lane and Kingston Roads on Sunnyside, in the state’s heavily wooded southwest. An earlier blaze threatening homes near the tiny town of Kununoppin, north of Merredin, has been contained. - AAP Returning back to the Aukus submarines, which have been in the news since a US senator expressed concerns about what the deal would mean for America’s own defence capabilities. A bipartisan coalition of members of congress have written to the president, Joe Biden, expressing their support not only for Aukus but for the commitment to help Australian develop its nuclear powered submarine capability. We write to reiterate strong support not just for the Australian-United Kingdom-United States security pact (Aukus) but also, in particular, the commitment to develop an Australian nuclear powered submarine capability. You can see their full letter here: The Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, has released a statement on the death of George Pell. He says: It is with deep sadness that I can confirm His Eminence, George Cardinal Pell, passed away in Rome in the early hours of this morning. This news comes as a great shock to all of us. Please pray for the repose of the soul of Cardinal Pell, for comfort and consolation for his family and for all of those who loved him and are grieving him at this time. You can read the Guardian’s obituary for Cardinal George Pell, who has died aged 81, here: Cardinal George Pell has died in Vatican City, aged 81. Cardinal Pell, the former Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, died on Tuesday evening, AAP has confirmed. He was the Vatican’s top finance minister before he left in 2017 to stand trial in Australia for child abuse offences. In 2020, Pell was cleared on appeal of his 2018 conviction for molesting two teenage choirboys in the sacristy at St Patrick’s Cathedral while he was Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. The convictions were quashed in an unanimous decision by the high court. Next big wet may be in north Queensland and heat builds in the south PM Anthony Albanese and other government ministers have lately been out to the Kimberley in the nation’s north-west to inspect flood damage. We’re approaching halfway in the cyclone season, so there could be more places to visit to inspect the disasters that the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, told us earlier in the week were becoming “less natural” as the planet heats up. A look at the Bureau of Meteorology’s rain forecasts suggest the north Queensland coastline could see some sizeable accumulated rainfall totals over the next week or so. The south, meanwhile, has been warming up, and another heatwave is on the way for the south-east in the next few days. Melbourne is looking at a top of 38C on Saturday, the latest bout of peaky hot days this summer. Adelaide is also tracking for a toasty 37-38C on Friday and Saturday. By contrast, Sydney is yet to clock a 30C day this summer (with 29.7C in December the nearest miss so far). A few days over the next week may nudge 29C and perhaps tick over the 30C level for the first time since last February. Acting defence minister unfazed by comments from China’s ambassador RN Breakfast host Hamish McDonald also asked Keogh about some of the more incendiary comments that came from China’s ambassador Xiao Qian’s press conference yesterday, but the acting defence minister says the rhetoric is nothing new. Qian warned that the Aukus deal will end up as a costly mistake. However, Keogh said he does not interpret his words as a threat. The comments that were made yesterday are the same sort of comments that China has made about the Aukus deal since it was initially announced. We’re familiar with the concern that China has raised but putting that one side I think the more important element of what was spoken about yesterday by the Chinese ambassador was the improving of the relationship that comes from a new government here in Australia and looking at how we improve those trade relationships in particular, with China reopening those markets for Australia into China. McDonald: Interestingly, the ambassador waged a war of words, if you want to put it that way, on the Japanese ambassador, who warned Canberra against believing too much of what China is saying. In return, the Chinese ambassador seemed to suggest that Japan could once again pose a military threat. What do you make of this style? Keogh: Well, again, this is not sort of rhetoric that we haven’t heard before from China, about other countries like Japan. But I don’t think we need to be getting ourselves concerned into day to day commentary on what one country said about another country in speeches like this. McDonald: Respectfully, this is no day to day diplomacy. I mean, the Chinese ambassador was talking about the second world war, Japan invading Australia, bombing Darwin and never apologising for it. This is fairly extraordinary stuff. Keogh: Look, it’s it’s, as I said before, it’s not rhetoric that we haven’t heard before.… It’s not something that it’s useful for us as a government to provide running commentary on those sort of things that have been concerns expressed between two other countries. Australian involvement in construction of Aukus submarines important, acting defence minister says More on submarines. In an interview with ABC Radio, the veterans affairs and acting defence minister, Matt Keogh, has reaffirmed the government’s confidence it can reach its deadline of acquiring nuclear submarines by the end of the next decade. Asked if the government has been in contact with these US senators that have raised concerns about the procurement process and the impact on the US construction process of its own submarines, Keogh said: We’re certainly alive to the concerns that were raised in that letter that those congressmen wrote, but we’ve been engaging with the Biden administration, very positively … The American government and the UK Government are as committed as the Australian government to this project and see that there is a pathway forward on how we will go about procuring these submarines. The industrial base for all of the three countries – Australia included - is critical to achieving those outcomes and making sure that we’re able to grow the pie by bringing the Australian industrial base into those existing industrial bases is very important. So it’s important for from an Australian point of view that there’s Australian involvement in the construction of these submarines … it’s important that we do grow the Australian industrial base not just to support submarines, but to support our defence capability more generally, looking at things like missile technology, for example, as well, but also to the broader Australian industry. US senator tweets support for Aukus submarine deal An influential US senator who warned that the Aukus pact could push the US submarine-building industry to breaking point has tweeted he is proud to support the “powerful partnership”. Democrat Jack Reed and Republican James Inhofe wrote to the US president, Joe Biden, late last year imploring him not to let the security pact between Australia, the US and the UK come at a cost to US capability. They urged the president not to sell Virginia-class submarines to Australia, an option that the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been pushing as a way of filling a gap in Australia’s defence capability. In response to the leaked letter, the Albanese government has stood by the nuclear-powered submarine project and says it remains on track. On Tuesday, senator Reed tweeted his support for the “powerful partnership” struck in September 2021 by Biden, the then Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and the former UK leader Boris Johnson. Reed said successful implementation of Aukus required “responsible oversight and a stable industrial base”, particularly when it came to submarine programs. - AAP Anniversary is opportunity for us to reflect on the mental health effects of war, Keogh says The veteran affairs minister, Matt Keogh, says the 50th anniversary of the end of Australia’s involvement in the Vietnam War is “an opportunity for Australians to reflect”. Keogh told ABC News Breakfast how the Vietnam War has shaped better understanding of mental health for contemporary veterans: The 3,000 Australians injured and the 523 that lost their lives serving our nation … were part of the 60,000 Australians that were involved in the Vietnam war effort from Australia. It’s really our Vietnam veteran cohort that led us to really understand the impact of war from a mental health point of view and to understand things like PTSD ... what we’ve learned from that cohort has allowed us to be in a much better position to support our contemporary veterans as well. On whether Australia should have never gotten involved in the Vietnam war, Keogh says: I don’t think it’s useful to reflect on if Australia should have been involved or not involved in those conflicts. What’s important is to think about the sacrifice of the individuals and their families from their involvement. When it came to Vietnam, we had national service involved in that time, we had conscription. That led to some massive protests across Australia and a lot of negative views from Australians about that conflict. What is important ... is to think about how that reflected on those individuals and there’s an opportunity in this 50th anniversary year ... to be very clear in communicating to our veterans that their service is respected, and honoured, and that we thank them for that service and the sacrifice that they made and the sacrifice their families made by putting on the Australian uniform with the Australian flag and serving their nation and we thank them for that service. 50 years since Australia announced withdrawal from Vietnam War Today marks the day that Australia’s governor general officially ended Australia’s involvement in the war in Vietnam, 50 years ago. During the course of Australia’s involvement, 60,000 served in Vietnam, 523 were killed and almost 2,500 were wounded. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has taken to social media to acknowledge the anniversary and pay tribute to those Australians. Bowen defends carbon credit review amid criticisms from whistleblower who first blew lid McDonald also asks Bowen about some of the criticisms that have emerged from the Chubb review into Australia’s carbon credit scheme, which found the scheme did not need an overhaul. Andrew McIntosh, the academic who initially blew the whistle with concerns about the scheme, told ABC Radio earlier this morning he found the review’s findings bewildering: The panel has not presented any analysis or evidence to support its conclusions that there’s nothing essentially wrong with the scheme. We and others have presented a veritable mountain of evidence that there’s significant problems. Bowen defends the independence of the review and its findings: This panel took many many submissions, held many stakeholder groups, went out and saw these projects, went out to places like Cobar and saw the controversial methods being implemented and saw regeneration on one side of the fence and sparse environments on the other side of the fence and saw the real world impacts of this now. Carbon credits are important, they are a complement to emissions reduction at the facility level, at the coalface if you will. They will not be ever replaced that but they are important part of the journey and I’m absolutely determined that there will be rigour. We will take legislation through to implement the recommendations when I come to appoint the members [in] this new committee and nobody will be in any doubt. When I appoint the new members of the rigour, their independence, their credentials, their scientific background, and there will be, I think, an opportunity for great confidence in the system. Hamish McDonald asks Bowen about the $600m fund that has been set up to help cover the costs of decarbonisation, and how the government justifies subsidising big business. Bowen says it’s in the national interest and a continuation of previous Labor policies to advance the transition to net zero. McDonald: Many of these businesses are trading … against businesses overseas. There will be an impact on their capacity to operate because of these obligations, and you’re making grants available to them from a $600m fund to help cover the cost of decarbonising. These are big businesses. They are enormous polluters, why should taxpayers be subsidising these businesses transition programs? Bowen: Because this is a national endeavour. Because it is vital for those companies to make this transition but it’s also vital for our country … We need to be all in, and these companies need to be all in and they are in many instances making many hundreds of millions … billions of dollars of investment, including big traditional fossil fuel industries, and they know they need to do that. Just as the CSC and Arena [Australian Renewable Energy Agency] have played a vital role in what we have achieved previously – and we’re very proud of them being Labor creations – we would not have achieved anywhere near as much without the investments [and] coinvestments as CFC and arena helping businesses make this transition. We are … putting an obligation on businesses to decarbonise at quite an ambitious rate. We will make the $600m out of the $1.9bn, [the] powering the regions funds [are] available to help you if you can satisfy us that it is real investment in real abatement and real reductions in emissions, then this is a national endeavor. Now we can’t afford not to be all in. We need all businesses doing all levels of government doing it, all society. And so this is a real partnership. And yes, of course, we are requiring businesses to make big investments but where we can provide that extra bit of support to provide that extra certainty and again, as I said, enabled, in some cases management to convince the boards that this is a good instance. I think this is very much in the national interest. Safeguard mechanism will take 205m tonnes of carbon out of atmosphere, Bowen says The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, yesterday released the government’s plan to revamp the safeguard mechanism, a Coalition policy that was promised to limit emissions from more than 200 industrial facilities but in practice has failed. Now, the Albanese government says Australia’s big polluting sites from mid year will have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 5% a year until 2030 but will face no limits on the use of carbon offsets. Bowen is this morning speaking to ABC Radio about some the concerns that have emerged since the changes were announced, including whether there is enough incentive to reduce emissions, rather than simply buying offsets. Bowen says there “absolutely” is. This is a very ambitious package that we announced yesterday. 5% reductions each year is an ambitious step forward, between now and 2030, it will take 205m tonnes of carbon emission out of our atmosphere. Now that’s equivalent to two thirds of the emissions from all of Australia’s cars over that period. So this is a big deal. You can read more about the safeguard mechanism from our environment editor Adam Morton and economics correspondent Peter Hannam: Fitzroy Crossing airstrip now dry enough to land larger aircraft A “massive” disaster relief operation hits full swing in the Fitzroy River catchment area, where many people remain isolated by floodwaters and damaged roads. More than nine tonnes of food and 10 boxes of medical supplies have been flown in to flood-ravaged Fitzroy Crossing as more planes join the airlift. WA’s fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, told reporters: This is a massive operation underway to get essential supplies into that community and its surrounds. It was earlier reported that the airstrip was too flooded to get large aircraft in, but the airstrip was now dry enough to land larger aircraft. It will significantly increase capacity to resupply the town of about 1,200. He said: I want to reassure the people in the Kimberley region we are bringing a significant amount of food into the region to ensure we have adequate supplies. Authorities, with assistance from the Australian Defence Force, have also started the damage assessment and cleanup operation in the areas they can access. - AAP Long wait before flooded WA bridge reopens A Western Australian bridge destroyed by once-in-a-century flooding could take more than a year to rebuild, the state’s emergency services minister has said. The roadway over the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley region is the state’s only sealed roadway to the north. The emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, said there was significant damage to the bridge at Fitzroy Crossing and the Great Northern Highway. Engineers and divers are expected to start inspecting the structure in the coming days to determine what can be salvaged and how much work will be required before the transport link can reopen. Dawson told reporters: That will give us [an] indication [of] how many months or indeed years [it will take] to build that bridge back up again. Early indications are that that work will take a significant amount of time. He said any work was likely to start after the wet season ends. State authorities are also looking at temporary transport alternatives, such as an old flood crossing across the river bed, and talking to the Australian Defence Force about building a temporary bridge. In the meantime, road trains with freight for Kununurra and the Northern Territory have been diverted from southern WA in South Australia to travel up the Stuart Highway through central Australia. A barge is also transporting essential goods from Perth Hedland to Broome, with authorities saying an airlift and boats might be the only way to reach some communities until the roadway is repaired. - AAP Western Australia is facing the prospect of another natural disaster, with bushfire emergency warnings in place in the south of the state only a week after the once-in-a-century flooding in the Kimberley. In the early hours of this morning a bushfire emergency warning was issued for parts of Beelerup, Brookhampton and Charley Creek in the Donnybrook-Balingup shire. A watch and act warning has also been issued for the Noggerup, also in the Donnybrook-Balingup, and part of the Wellington National Park in the shire of Dardanup. In the north of the state, a barge containing food, medicine and other essential supplies is arriving in Broome, after last week’s flooding devastated the region’s road and air infrastructure. The roadway over the Fitzroy River, the state’s only sealed roadway to the north, was left looking as thought it “had a big bomb dropped on it” was how the emergency services minister Murray Watt described it yesterday. However, that main freight route could take more than a year to rebuild, according to Stephen Dawson, WA’s emergency services minister. In international news, the 80th Golden Globes are due to be held today with Australians including Cate Blanchett, Margot Robbie, Hugh Jackman, Baz Lurhmann, and Elizabeth Debicki nominated for some of the top prizes. We’re also expecting to hear from the energy minister, Chris Bowen, on ABC Radio following the government releasing their plan to revamp the safeguard mechanism.

Here’s what we learned: • Major flooding in the Kimberley is “far from over”, authorities say, with the Fitzroy River at Fitzroy Crossing currently sitting at 15.75 metres, around 1.82 metres higher than the previously recorded peak. • The Bureau of Meteorology says 60,000 cubic metres of water per second is moving down the Fitzroy River – more water than it has ever seen in an Australian river. The amount moving down the river in one day is equal to the amount of water used in Perth over 20 years. • Severe storms have hit parts of New South Wales and south-east Queensland, with reports of at least golf-ball-sized hail and storm damage across regional NSW and outer suburban areas of Sydney. • The federal Coalition has continued its criticism of the Labor government’s recent announcement that it will require travellers from China to return negative Covid tests, with the Coalition health spokesperson, Anne Ruston, saying the government ignoring advice from the chief medical officer “undermines the trust Australians have” in government advice. • The Nationals’ Darren Chester has defended his party’s decision to oppose the Indigenous voice to parliament before campaigning has even begun. • Surf Life Saving NSW is urging beachgoers to ensure they only swim at patrolled beaches, after the state recorded three drownings in a week – all at unpatrolled beaches. Lifesavers say they have performed more than 1,200 rescues already this summer. • Eight zones have been established along the Murray River in South Australia to progressively lift restrictions on river activities as flood waters in that state recede. • The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is continuing its investigation into the fatal helicopter accident on Monday that left four people dead and severely injured three more. Aviation experts have speculated that the number and frequency of joy flights may factor into the investigation. Thanks for your company today. We’ll be back with you early birds first thing tomorrow for more. Look after yourselves. Man charged with murder after body of escaped prisoner found outside Hobart home A young man has been charged with murder a day after the body of an escaped prisoner was found outside a Hobart home, AAP reports. Police were called to the house in the northern suburb of Granton about 1.30am on Tuesday following reports of a gunshot. Officers discovered the body of Nicholas Aaron Scott, 26, who had allegedly escaped custody several hours earlier while being treated at Royal Hobart hospital. Tasmania police on Wednesday charged the 20-year-old Granton man Brock Callum Davey with murder. He remained in custody after his matter was briefly mentioned in Hobart magistrates court. Davey did not enter a plea and was scheduled to next appear in court on 20 January. A 20-year-old man who was found inside the house with head injuries had helped police with inquiries, Det Insp Troy Morrisby said on Tuesday. A police investigation into how Scott allegedly escaped was ongoing while the Tasmanian prison service was conducting its own probe. Police have said Scott borrowed a phone from an unwitting member of the public at a restaurant after leaving the hospital. Four people have died after a car and a ute collided in Pine Lodge near the Victorian rural city of Shepparton. A Victoria police spokesperson said emergency services were called to Pine Lodge North Road, near Cosgrove-Lemnos Road, about 4.45pm. Five people were in the car, which ended up in a nearby paddock, and four of them died at the scene. The driver of the vehicle has been airlifted in a serious condition. The driver of the ute was not seriously injured and stopped to help. The exact cause of the collision is under investigation and detectives from the major collision investigation unit are on their way. Police are calling on anyone who witnessed the collision, has dashcam footage or other related information to contact Crime Stoppers. Severe weather warning for damaging winds and intense rain for Kimberley Here’s the Bureau of Meteorology’s update about the expected track of ex-tropical cyclone Ellie, which has been hovering over the Kimberley. It’s expected to move slowly around its current location over the next 18 hours before moving to the south-east on Thursday. Severe weather warnings for damaging winds and intense rainfall are still in place, as well as the flooding. Helicopter joyrides likely to be examined after Gold Coast crash Investigators will likely examine the number of helicopter joyrides operating at Sea World after a mid-air collision killed four people, an expert says. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the cause of the crash which occurred when one helicopter was landing and the other had taken off at the Gold Coast theme park on Monday afternoon. The pilot Ashley Jenkinson, Sydney woman Vanessa Tadros and British couple Diane and Ron Hughes died in the crash. Tadros’s 10-year-old son, Nicholas, remains in hospital along with the Geelong woman Winnie de Silva, 33, and her nine-year-old son. Across Australia’s tourism sector, the aviation expert Neil Hansford said reduced flying during the Covid pandemic has increased the commercial imperatives for quick flights. He said this has put immense pressure on pilots who need to complete flights around major tourism landmarks in blocks of five or 10 minutes. Read the full story here: Coalition calls on government to explain new Covid rules for China arrivals The Coalition is amping up the pressure for the government to better explain the Covid testing rules for Chinese arrivals, claiming Labor has “flip-flopped” on the decision. The shadow foreign affairs spokesman, Simon Birmingham, speaking on 2GB radio, claimed the government needed to explain why the rules had been brought in just days after the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said they weren’t needed. Most members of federal parliament are on a break in this first week of January (indeed, Birmingham said in the interview that he himself was on holidays and was calling in on his way to a brewery for lunch with his family), but the Coalition has criticised the health minister, Mark Butler, for not further explaining the changes. Birmingham, the former trade minister, turned up the heat on the prime minister, Anthony Albanese: The Albanese government has acted against the advice of the chief medical officer here and that’s why it is so perplexing and concerning that Anthony Albanese doesn’t seem to be fronting the cameras or hitting the airwaves himself to explain why they’ve ignored the advice of the chief medical officer. Albanese today posted an Instagram story of his dog, Toto, sitting on a beach. The photo was captioned “summer”. Birmingham said: Why it is that they have flip-flopped in their position over the course of the last week or so, and just what the actual rationale for it is, because the story just seems to keep changing. Finally, WA’s emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, says there will be disaster relief funding available for pastoralists and other businesses that have received damages. He does not give details on how that will roll out, but I expect those details will emerge in the coming days. More on that point below: if you’re not familiar with how the wet season works in the far north, roads frequently become impassable in the summer months and communities are partly or totally isolated for periods as there is regularly a lot of rain in that part of the country at this time of year. This flooding event, though, is unprecedented – the water level is extraordinarily high, and the inundation is well beyond usual wet-season levels. ADF to help get food and essential supplies to stranded WA communities We’re hearing from the emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, again. He says part of the reason they’ve asked for ADF assistance is to help get food and other essential supplies into stranded communities. In the smaller Aboriginal communities, restocking started in December, because for many of those communities they are cut off at this time of year anyway … obviously the weather we’re seeing is different to what we’d see normally, so there are plans in place to replenish food stocks [and medicines etc]. Fitzroy River sees extraordinary amount of water, Bureau of Meteorology says Some extraordinary numbers in this press conference: James Ashley from the Bureau of Meteorology says 60,000 cubic metres of water per second is moving down the Fitzroy River – that’s more water than they believe they’ve seen in any river in Australia, ever. Moving down the river in one day “is about what Perth uses, water wise, in 20 years”, says Ashley. The risk of the ex-cyclone moving over the ocean and reforming into another cyclone is now unlikely, Ashley says: The really unique thing about this system is that it’s hovered so long over a similar area. It came into WA last week … not only has it been slow moving but it’s also been well structured and been drawing the moisture from the monsoon in the north and producing heavy rain. Transport routes through the western part of the Kimberley are expected to be cut off soon as flood waters move through there, Ashley says. The weather system is expected to cross into the Northern Territory area over the weekend, when the weather in Broome will start to ease. Before then, though, Broome can expect in excess of 200mm of rain in 24 hours. Kimberley flood event is unprecedented, WA BoM manager says The Fitzroy River at Fitzroy Crossing is currently sitting at 15.75 metres – that’s “six feet” (around 1.82 metres) higher than the previous recorded peak levels. “This really is an unprecedented flood event,” says the WA manager of the Bureau of Meteorology, James Ashley. There are reports of storm damage to homes in Broome, Klemm says. He says arrangements are being made for people in the Kimberley region who need dialysis to be transported to Broome. Broome itself, though, is experiencing heavy rain and severe weather too. Klemm says listening to local ABC radio and following official Facebook pages is the best way to stay up to date with official and verified information. Authorities are asking anyone who had plans to travel into the Kimberley region to postpone those plans: basically, don’t go there. The fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, says the flooding event is “far from over” and will affect the area for the days and weeks to come: This continues to be a very dangerous and fast-changing situation, and more rain is expected over the coming days. He also urges people not to rely on social media for information, but to seek out and rely on official sources. Klemm says flood warnings and messages have been translated into local Kriol to assist the Aboriginal communities in the region. We will continue to undertake rescues where possible but people need to understand that this will take time. The Fitzroy Crossing evacuation centre is near capacity, and there are plans to open another one. WA floods press conference: 39 requests for help so far, minister says We’re now hearing from authorities in Western Australia about the record-breaking flooding situation in the Kimberley region, which has left communities isolated and the Fitzroy River completely impassable. The emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, is speaking. He says there have been 39 requests for assistance so far from people in the region. Three Australian defence force aircraft have been deployed to assist, two of which will arrive tomorrow. Fitzroy Crossing is completely isolated now and can only be accessed by helicopter; the flooding levels have also broken the previous record – set in the 90s. Australia ‘decades’ behind in phasing out cage eggs, advocates say Animal welfare activists have called on Australia to bring forward its ban on cage eggs after battery cages for layer hens became illegal in New Zealand on 1 January. The Australian government last year committed to phasing out battery cages for hens by 2036, a 14-year lead time for a reform that followed seven years of negotiation with the egg industry to update the animal welfare standards and guidelines for poultry. New Zealand announced its 2023 phase-out in 2012. Australia is more than a decade behind similar nations in responding to consumer sentiment and improving chicken welfare, according to Glenys Oogjes of Animals Australia. Europe phased them out in 2012 and that’s about when New Zealand started their phase-out. So we’re not just 10 years behind. We are at least 20 if not 30 years behind in regard to the science and the ethics. Read the full story here: Press conference on WA floods to be held shortly We’re expecting a press conference shortly out of Western Australia, with an update on the Kimberley floods. I’ll bring you the details when we get them. Lost cow rescued twice in two days A poor Sydney cow is not having a good time at the moment, having been removed from the Caddens Corner shopping precinct by NSW Fire and Rescue on Tuesday night, and then getting stuck in a bog in the paddock they put it in. La Niña lingers in the Pacific but an El Niño might be lurking too As we mentioned earlier, Australia’s big wet might make way for the big dry if the models pointing to a possible El Niño forming in the Pacific in 2023 are accurate. The Bureau of Meteorology has filled in more of the blanks with its fortnightly update of the main climate drivers for Australia. The La Niña is still hanging on but it may not be too long before the Pacific returns to more neutral conditions. La Niñas typically have the usual easterly equatorial winds strengthening. Rain is more likely than normal in Australia’s north and east, and after three La Niña events in a row we would rather not have more floods, thank you very much. Looking ahead, there is the prospect of an El Niño developing in the Pacific later in the year, as BoM’s own model shows: Meteorologists, though, will caution not to read too much in the prospects just yet. For one thing, an autumnal productivity gap needs to be cleared. We’ll have a clearer view in the next few months. Stay tuned. Decades-old music retailer Sanity to close remaining 50 stores Are you still buying CDs? If so, I regret to inform you that your options are about to reduce even further than they already have in the last 15 years, as decades-old music retailer Sanity has just announced it will be closing its remaining 50 stores. In a statement to Nine News, the company’s owner, Ray Itaoui, said the shift to digital platforms for music and film meant continuing with physical stores was “impossible”: With our customers shifting to digital for their visual and music content consumption, and with diminishing physical content available to sell to our customer, it has made it impossible to continue with our physical stores. Our online business – sanity.com.au – will continue to operate, and will service the many loyal customers the brand has continued to be dedicated to over the decades. Our priority right now is to ensure each of our team members knows exactly what this means for their career and employment future. Sanity had its origins in a single store called Jetts, in the Melbourne suburb of Pakenham, in 1980, which sold vinyl and cassettes. It rebranded and expanded as Sanity in 1992. Itaoui bought the business 13 years ago. He said in his statement that all physical stores would be closed by the end of April. There are some pictures circulating on various NSW local Facebook pages of reportedly very large hailstones, between golf and tennis-ball sized, in the Lithgow area. Another Twitter outage hits Australian users Here’s my excellent colleague Josh Taylor on the recent apparent Twitter outage for Australian and New Zealand users, who reported difficulty accessing the social media site for several hours on Wednesday – its second outage in the past few weeks. The website Downdetector received thousands of reports from about 7am AEST on Wednesday saying that load times for the site were slow, they were given error messages, or they were unable to access it entirely. “Feed has a 50-50 chance of not loading and timing out,” one user posted.

This time it’s a video from Graeme McCrabb of the Darling River at Yampoola Creek, courtesy Sarah McConnell at the ABC. Severe thunderstorm warning for parts of south-east Queensland There are also severe thunderstorm warnings in place for parts of south-east Queensland. Damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall are forecast for parts of Maranoa and Warrego, Darling Downs and the Granite Belt and Southeast Coast forecast districts. There’s also a severe thunderstorm crossing the Queensland/NSW border into parts of the Scenic Rim council area.

Australian company launches ‘satellite stack’ into space to help track aircraft An Australian company established as a spinoff from UNSW Canberra has launched a “satellite stack” into space, and says it’s the biggest payload (meaning space cargo) Australia has ever launched. Skykraft says the 300kg payload weighs more than all other Australian-built space objects put together. The satellites were on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida overnight. They will form part of a constellation of satellites to help track aircraft. The Skykraft chief executive officer, Dr Michael Frater, said: We rely on air traffic control to avoid mid-air collisions, even in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. With Skykraft’s service, air traffic controllers will be able to see the aircraft at all times and talk directly with the pilot anywhere in the world. There’s a big storm coming in New South Wales – the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a warning for damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall for the Grafton, Penrith, Parramatta, Katoomba, Tamworth and Gunnedah areas, among others. All the details are on the BoM website. If you can see this tweet (Twitter has been very buggy today) there’s a map here: Hello folks. Lovely to be back with you again this week, and I’ll be here until early evening.

Thanks for reading. Pilot rescued after small plane crashes in Victoria’s high country AAP is reporting that a pilot has been rescued after crashing his small plane in Victoria’s high country. It comes after earlier reports of the small aircraft crashing into trees in the Mount Buffalo area after it took off from Porepunkah, near Bright in the state’s north-east, about 4.40am on Wednesday. The male pilot, who is believed to be the sole occupant and aged in his 50s, suffered upper and lower body injuries. He was treated at the scene by paramedics before being flown to Melbourne’s Alfred hospital in a stable condition, Ambulance Victoria said. Four conservation workers are waiting to be rescued from a remote wildlife camp, with canoes at the ready in case they’re forced to flee to higher ground, AAP is reporting. Record flooding in Western Australia’s Kimberley region has forced the evacuation of two sanctuaries run by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. One mission is complete, with three people choppered off the Charnley River-Artesian Range Wilderness Camp after the power and water systems went out. Four others were airlifted from the Mornington Wilderness Camp on Wednesday, but four more remain after flood waters swamped most of the buildings at the site. It’s hoped those still stuck there can be rescued later in the day but much will depend on the weather generated by ex-tropical cyclone Ellie. The four are safe and dry, sheltering in the highest of the structures that didn’t go under, says Aled Hoggett, the regional operations manager for AWC in the Kimberley. That’s where everybody has been sitting for the last couple of days. Everybody’s safe. They have been dry and sheltered but obviously it’s been a long and anxious wait for them. With the weather conditions the way they are, there’s been no certainty about our ability to evacuate them. The flood waters rose to within 20 metres of the group’s safe haven. The houses are at the base of a ridge of rock. They’ve got canoes to the houses just in case they had to evacuate, and get up on to even higher ground. But fortunately the water only came so high and it has started to recede. Hoggett says the water rose very quickly after more than 350mm of rain was recorded at Diamond Gorge a few days ago. He says it will take some time to determine how the floods have impacted scientific work including an ongoing project to monitor a population of the endangered purple-crowned fairywren. Four of the eight people caught up in the flooding at Mornington were from Monash University, and were there to carry out annual field work. “They monitor the birds, including collecting samples for genetic analysis. At the moment we’re trying to make sure we rescue those samples and don’t lose the work they’ve already done this year,” Hoggett says. “But it will put a significant hole in that continuous dataset. And in terms of science, continuous datasets are precious and we always try to avoid breaks in them.” Pre-flight testing won’t result in additional data on Covid variants, Coalition says The Coalition health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has been somewhat making the rounds today, as the opposition attempts to pin the government on its introduction of entry restrictions for travellers from China. This time, Ruston was speaking to AAP, where she repeated that the government ignoring advice from the chief medical officer “undermines the trust Australians have” in the advice provided by the government: Right the way through the pandemic, Australians have been provided the confidence that the Australian government was responding to the best available advice of Australia’s chief medical experts. Until now. The current arrangements for pre-flight testing will not result in any additional data on new or emerging Covid variants, because the tests will not provide Australia with any genomic sequencing. Small plane crashes in Victoria’s north-east AAP is reporting that a small plane has crashed in Victoria’s high country, sparking a rescue operation. Victoria police say the aircraft took off from Porepunkah, near Bright in the state’s north-east, about 4.40am on Wednesday before crashing into trees in the Mount Buffalo area. Paramedics are treating the plane’s male pilot, who is believed to be the sole occupant, at the scene. His condition is unknown. Government announces $41.5m in grants to improve solar energy performance The Australian Renewable Energy Agency has granted 13 research and development projects around the country $41.5m to improve the performance of solar photovoltaics and boost commercialisation of new technologies. The funding is in addition to $45m to support the University of NSW-based Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP) granted by the Albanese government back in June. As with that earlier funding, the work began under the Morrison government. Still, the government has made climate action, particularly in the energy sector, a higher priority since taking office in May. (The issue tended to be an embarrassment to the previous government and so they sometimes avoided publicity about the better things they did to avoid bringing attention to their gaps.) Projects to receive funding include research into screen printing of industrial solar cells at the terawatt scale, and the use of robotics to roll out and maintain solar fields. “Renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy, and it’s getting cheaper,” the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said in a statement: Australia has been a world leader on solar PV research for decades. The same universities that blazed the solar PV trail will step up again to help get utility-scale technology off the ground and help transform Australia into a renewable energy superpower. The UNSW, Australian National University and University of Sydney will share in the funding. Renate Egan, who heads the ACAP work at UNSW, said the latest grant had been in the works for about 12 months. Among the recipients will be Martin Green, a UNSW professor who has been a global pioneer in developing more efficient solar panels. About half of the $41.5m will go to improving panel efficiency and the rest on commercialisation efforts, Egan said. Arena’s target is to boost panel efficiency in converting solar energy to electrons from about 24% now for commercial panels to 30% by 2030. Price per watt of capacity would also drop from about 50-60 cents to 30 cents by then, Egan said, referring to the 30/30/30 goal. Given the quickening (but not yet quick enough) global race to decarbonise, we might expect more government assistance in this industry. Watch this space, as they say. Beachgoers urged to swim at patrolled beaches after three drownings in NSW The Surf Life Saving NSW CEO, Steve Pearce, is urging beachgoers to ensure they only swim at patrolled beaches, after the state recorded three drownings in a week. Pearce told ABC News that lifesavers had performed “over 1,200 rescues” during the summer, and that “every beach is overwhelmed and overrun”, adding that all of the drownings had occurred at unpatrolled beaches: This is the first true, hot Australian summer we’ve seen since 2019, and since those bushfires. Since then we had the Covid lockdowns and the floods, and big heavy rain. So we’ve seen a mass inundation of people coming down to the coastline, and every beach is just overwhelmed and overrun. And it’s just so important while we’re trying to push this message about swimming at patrolled locations because every drowning that has occurred has happened at an unpatrolled beach. I think it comes down to people trying to find spots that aren’t as crowded, but the issue is, if you’re trying to find a spot that’s uncrowded, essentially, it’s unpatrolled. If you don’t see any red and yellow flags there, essentially we can’t see you to save you. We’re just imploring people, if you’re coming down to the coastline, if you are on holidays, make sure you find a spot where you see our lifesavers, because we’ve seen so many tragic drownings already this summer. Our lifesavers have performed over 1,200 rescues, they’ve conducted so many CPRs and successful resuscitations as well. South Australia sets up eight zones along Murray River to progressively lift flood restrictions Eight zones have been established along the Murray River in South Australia to progressively lift restrictions on river activities as flood waters recede, AAP reports. Recreational activities, including fishing and swimming, were banned along the river late last year amid safety concerns as water levels rose to heights not seen for more than half a century. The peak has now passed Renmark and other Riverland towns but is yet to reach communities downstream, including Mannum, east of Adelaide. The premier, Peter Malinauskas, said it made sense to treat the various parts of the river differently as the flood waters moved through the system. Restrictions are never an easy thing to apply. It hurts some businesses, it makes life inconvenient for some communities. But naturally when we’ve got a huge volume of water coming down the river at a record pace, that provides dangers as does the amount of debris. By having these eight zones, we’re acknowledging the fact that what is occurring in the Riverland is very different to what’s occurring in Murray Bridge. The police commissioner, Grant Stevens, said work was under way to develop a set of principles to guide the lifting of restrictions across the river zones. Stevens said officials hoped to lift restrictions as soon as possible but it was too early to tell when they would start to be eased. The flooding in SA has so far impacted about 3,400 properties, including nearly 400 primary residences. It has also closed 119 roads across river communities with nine ferries shut down. The Murray is expected to peak at Waikerie and Morgan this weekend and at Blanchetown, Swan Reach and Mannum by 13 January. Frequency of joy flights may be a factor in fatal Gold Coast helicopter collision, experts say Aviation experts have speculated that the number and frequency of joy flights may factor into the investigation into the fatal helicopter collision on the Gold Coast. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is continuing its investigation into the accident that left four people dead and severely injured three more. Aviation expert Neil Hansford told the ABC that the number of joy flights being carried out may come under scrutiny in the investigation: That’s a lot of movements if you’re doing a five-minute or even 10-minute land, get the people off, get the people on and go again. That’s a fairly stressful environment. I think it’s the business model that’s existed for years and, with good pilot management, we haven’t had an accident. Helicopter joy flights are, in themselves, absolutely safe. But there will be a complete rethink, I would think, by Queensland Maritime, Queensland Police, but most importantly, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Ticket racket warning ahead of Australian Open AAP is reporting that tennis and concert goers have been urged to do their research to avoid ticket scalpers ahead of the Australian Open and major concerts. Consumer Affairs Victoria fielded more than 1,100 reports about event ticketing and resales in the 2021-22 financial year, prompting warnings from authorities to be vigilant. “I urge everyone to do their research to ensure resale sites are legitimate before purchasing tickets and avoid the pain of missing out on an event you’ve been looking forward to,” the consumer affairs minister, Danny Pearson, said. All event organisers and ticketing agencies should have contingency plans and understand their obligations if things don’t go as expected. Victoria was Australia’s “events capital” and no one should miss out on live sport and music because of a scammer, Pearson said. The Australian Open begins in Melbourne on 16 January. Victorian laws prohibit ticket resellers from reselling tickets at more than 10% above their original face value. The federal health department has clarified that Moderna’s Covid jab is still “widely available” in Australia, clearing up a statement on its website which was misinterpreted by vaccine sceptics to claim the rollout had been shelved. Australia is now administering the upgraded bivalent Moderna vaccine for adults, with the department saying the original Moderna vaccine is no longer being manufactured or delivered to clinics. That upgraded vaccine, which targets both the original Covid strain and the Omicron variant, is available for all adults over 18 as a booster dose. However, a statement on the health department’s website for vaccine bookings caused some confusion in recent weeks, after it noted that “the ‘Moderna (6-11 years)’ and ‘Moderna (12 years +)’ vaccine types will no longer be available in Australia from mid-December 2022”. The note was quoted by numerous Covid sceptic accounts on social media over the holiday period to claim the Moderna rollout had ceased. But the same website also notes that the “Moderna (6 months to 5 years)” and “Moderna bivalent (18+ booster)” were still available. The health department clarified to Guardian Australia that the note about the Moderna types no longer being available referred specifically to the original vaccines only, which are being replaced in the stockpile by the bivalent vaccines. “The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine continues to be widely available across Australia,” they told Guardian Australia. “The Australian government advises that the Moderna (original) Covid-19 vaccine is no longer being manufactured. This vaccine is being replaced by increased production and availability of the Moderna bivalent Covid-19 vaccine,” they said. The spokesperson said the last deliveries of the original vaccine to administration sites occurred in late November. “Based on shelf-life, the Moderna (ancestral, or original) vaccine is no longer available for routine administration in Australia,” they said. Darren Chester defends Nationals’ decision to oppose voice to parliament The Nationals’ Darren Chester has defended his party’s decision to oppose the voice to parliament before campaigning has even begun. Chester, who has been moved to become opposition spokesperson on regional education, regional development and local government and territories, told ABC News he supported constitutional recognition but was opposed to enshrining the voice into the constitution. There is nothing stopping the prime minister from coming to the parliament in the first week next year and legislating for such an organisation. But once you move to enshrine it in the constitution, you’re saying for all times, in the content of constitutional Australia, our founding document, that this body has to exist, and I have a problem with that. Defence personnel have been called in to help evacuate people isolated during “once-in-a-century” flooding hitting a remote town in Western Australia’s Kimberley region, according to AAP. Homes have been inundated by flood water in Fitzroy Crossing – home to about 1,200 people – and the Great Northern Highway is cut in both directions as some residents are airlifted 400km to Broome by helicopter. The fast-flowing waters also washed away part of a major bridge as the region is swamped in record flooding of the Fitzroy River. Authorities warned the Fitzroy River level was still rising early this morning ahead of a possible peak of 15.7 metres, smashing previous records for Fitzroy Crossing. Federal emergency services minister Murray Watt said the Albanese government had approved a WA request for Australian defence force aircraft and personnel to help evacuate residents from Fitzroy Crossing and nearby areas. Downstream at Noonkanbah, major flooding is also likely. Fire and emergency services commissioner Darren Klemm warned residents in the communities of Willare and Noonkanbah on Tuesday they would be inundated in the next 24 to 48 hours. People in those areas need to get to higher ground. He said roads had been cut and it was too late to leave as the region faced “at least a one-in-100-year” flood event. The rain is coming from ex-tropical cyclone Ellie, which has dumped between 200mm and 600mm since Saturday and is predicted to deliver further widespread heavy falls into the week. The weather system has been moving slowly towards the coast and was located immediately east of Broome this morning, lashing the region with strong winds and intense downpours. An evacuation order remains in place for properties expected to be impacted by flooding. Twitter uses still struggling to access site Twitter users in Australia and New Zealand have reported difficulties accessing the social media site for the past two hours or so. In addition to people who managed to tweet about their problems in accessing the site, website Downdetector suggests it has received thousands of reports from people in Australia about the site’s sluggishness. It’s not clear what the cause may be and when it might be resolved. Since Elon Musk took over the platform last year, Twitter no longer has a communications department, let alone Australian representatives to ask about the issue. This week the company was reportedly sued for failing to pay rent on its San Francisco headquarters amid reports the company had ceased paying rent on its offices globally. Ruston calls China travel decision a ‘breach of faith’ with Australian public Opposition health spokesperson Anne Ruston has doubled down on comments issued yesterday, demanding that the government explain why it ignored advice from the chief medical officer on entry restrictions for travellers from China. Ruston was on Sky News and said it was a “breach of faith” in not taking the advice while continuing to “learn to live with Covid”: This government made a commitment to the Australian public that we were going to learn to live with Covid. A decision that has been based without any medical advice or medical necessity shows we aren’t really pursuing that. It’s a breach of faith with the Australian public about that commitment to say we were going to get on with our lives. Indexed increase of income support payments on 1 January ‘simply not enough’ The Australian Council of Social Service is calling for the Albanese government to increase income support payments, saying routine indexation is “simply not enough”. In a statement, Acoss CEO Cassandra Goldie said the routine indexation of payments on 1 January were not enough, adding that as rents and the cost of living continue to rise, the government needs to support those on the payments and not leave them at below-poverty levels: The routine indexation of payments on January 1 does not deliver the real increase that so many people desperately need. Income support payments were woefully inadequate before the prices of food, rent, medicines, energy and other essentials sky-rocketed and they will still be totally insufficient after indexation. Youth Allowance and Austudy payments are only indexed once a year and are even lower than other income supports. Even with 6.1 per cent indexation, Youth Allowance will increase by $16.20 per week to $281.40 for a single person living away from home. That’s just $40.20 a day. There are more than three million people living in poverty in Australia and this Christmas one in five of us were struggling to afford food. People battling floods in South Australia and now the Kimberley in Western Australia will be among those glad to see a shift back to more typical rainfall patterns. As it happens, that sort of shift in climate influences looks to be under way, particularly as the La Niña in the Pacific continues to weaken. We looked at the outlook in this piece, with early signs of a possible El Niño to develop this year: We’ll get a more formal update from the Bureau of Meteorology later today but we probably won’t know for sure about an El Niño for a couple of months yet. Still, should we get such an event, we can expect conditions in eastern Australia at least becoming relatively dry, with heatwaves (and bushfires) more of a risk. In the meantime, it looks as though the Kimberley has a lot more rain to fall in the next couple of days, so those communities are likely to be on edge for a while yet. Returning to the Gold Coast, the father of the 10-year-old boy fighting for his life in hospital has taken to social media to say his son Nicholas “needs all the prayers he can get”. Simon Tadros was watching when his 36-year-old wife Vanessa Tadros was killed in a helicopter collision on Monday. Tributes have poured on to social media for the four people who lost their lives in the accident, with Tadros saying: I ask everyone to pray for the little man. He is on life support in a critical condition. May God pull him back with me and make a good recovery. He is in an induced coma on a life support machine to help him breath[e]. He is in a very serious and critical state. I’m asking for all your prayers to bring my little man back to me. An online fundraiser has been set up by family friend Rochelle Fajloun, with Vanessa Tadros described as a loved mother and friend: We are praying for a miracle that our Nicky, (as he is playfully known) can be brought back to his grief-stricken father Simon. If by God’s grace Nicky survives his catastrophic injuries, he will have an intense and protracted recovery period. Simon distressingly witnessed the accident unfold and is totally shattered. The Bureau of Meteorology has maintained its severe weather warning for northern Western Australia, as ex-tropical cyclone Ellie continues to batter the region. The storm is expected to slowly track west to be centred just east of Broome sometime this morning, with the bureau forecasting heavy rainfall for Broome, Roebuck Plains and the Dampier Peninsula from Tuesday to Thursday. Daily rainfall of 100mm to 200mm with isolated falls of 250mm and very isolated falls of 300mm are possible. A major flood warning for the Fitzroy River has been maintained overnight, with major flooding at Noonkanbah this morning. Record major flooding is occurring at Fitzroy Crossing, with river levels still rising and with further rises expected later in the week. AMA calls for coherent strategy in place of ‘political responses’ AAP is reporting that the head of the Australian Medical Association, Prof Steve Robson, is calling for a genuine strategy rather than a “series of political responses” being needed to address the Covid outbreak in China. Despite chief medical officer Paul Kelly advising that imposing restrictions on travellers from China, or any other country, at this time was “unnecessary and inconsistent with Australia’s Covid-19 management”, health minister Mark Butler imposed the testing measure. Butler has defended the decision, saying he was acting with “an abundance of caution”. Multiple countries around the world including the US, UK and European nations have already imposed the same restriction. Robson said it was another example of why a far-reaching plan would hold the country in good stead: We really would love to see a comprehensive strategy about how to deal with the Covid situation in the northern hemisphere, at a time when there’s a huge amount of travel going on and almost no mitigations rather than what would look to people like a series of political responses. We want to see a comprehensive strategy that’s informed by public health practice, to just say, ‘What needs to be done to protect Australians at this vulnerable time?’ Acknowledging Australians were going into their fourth year of Covid, Robson said while he understood the fatigue people were feeling, more people would die unless fundamental principles were adopted: We’ve just literally come out of the most lethal year of the pandemic by a long shot … We want to see a strategy that’s evidence-based, nimble … and based on good public health principles. We haven’t really heard anything from the government except a plan that really seems cobbled together … it’s time for this cobbling to stop and coherence to start. ‘Countries will make their own decisions about travel arrangements’ The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has commented on China’s apparent threat to impose counter-measures if countries pursue excessive or discriminatory Covid travel policies. Chalmers said he would not “pre-empt or guess” what counter-measures China might take but indicated Australia would make its own decisions about measures like the pre-flight travel tests. Chalmers told Radio National: I think countries will make their own decisions about travel arrangements and how they manage covid more broadly. We’ve been pretty clear we’ve taken this decision out of an abundance of caution. Now, I don’t think it’s an especially onerous requirement, to be frank. And it’s consistent with the steps being taken in other countries. Asked about whether the imposition of pre-flight testing was part of an internationally coordinated move to pressure China to release more information, Chalmers did not exactly deny it: I don’t see it precisely like that, but there certainly is a lot of concern around the global health community ... around the transparency and quality of data we see out of China on Covid. China hits back against entry restrictions Last night Chinese authorities warned that there could be retaliatory measures after the Australian government introduced entry restrictions on travellers from China. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a briefing last night that the restrictions being introduced by various countries lacks “scientific basis”: Some countries adopt entry restriction measures only targeting China, which lacks a scientific basis. We firmly oppose the practice of manipulating epidemic prevention and control measures to achieve political goals, and will take corresponding measures according to the principle of reciprocity according to different situations. New strains can emerge anywhere, so there is no need for special entry restrictions on China. China always believes that the epidemic prevention measures of various countries should be scientific and appropriate, and should not take the opportunity to engage in political manipulation, discriminatory practices, and normal personnel exchanges, exchanges and co-operation should not be affected. Australian officials have reiterated multiple times that the lack of detail surrounding the outbreak in China has led to the concerns behind the entry restrictions. You can read more on these comments at the story below: It appears Twitter is down – in Australia at the least – with two websites that track the status of websites, Down for Me and Downdetector, reporting problems. Down for Me says Twitter has been down for approximately 23 minutes, while Down Detector is reporting a spike in user-reported problems in the last 24 hours. The website is not working for me, with tweets not showing and only an error message on screen. We will keep you updated on how this develops. Two Nationals appointed to shadow ministry The Coalition has announced the appointment of two Nationals – Darren Chester and Anne Webster – to the shadow ministry to take the roles vacated when MP Andrew Gee quit to become an independent. Gee resigned in December, citing the Nationals’ opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, and Nationals leader, David Littleproud, revealed Chester would take on the shadow regional education, development, local government and territories portfolios. Webster will become assistant shadow minister for health. Dutton said: These new appointments will strengthen the Coalition’s representation of regional Australia and I look forward to continuing to work with Mr Chester and Dr Webster as they carry out their new roles. I thank my Coalition team for their hard work and their unity in holding the government to account. I can assure all Australians that the Coalition will continue to focus on delivering positive plans and policies for the future of our country in 2023 and in the lead-up to the next election. Chester is a moderate National who has served as minister for infrastructure and veterans affairs but had a torrid time in government, in and out of cabinet three times from 2016 to 2021, a victim of power struggles with former leader Barnaby Joyce. Webster was elected in 2019 and has served as shadow assistant minister for regional development since June. Chalmers defends entry restrictions on visitors from China Federal treasurer Jim Chalmers is on RN Breakfast this morning, responding to some of the criticism raised of the government’s decision to introduce entry restrictions on travellers from China. Chalmers repeats yesterday’s line that he doesn’t think the measures are “especially onerous”, regardless of the pressures on the Chinese health system (RAT tests need to be ratified by a health professional under these measures). He is also asked about potential countermeasures but says managing Australia’s relationship with China is a “complex task”: I think countries will make their own decisions about travel arrangements and how they manage Covid. More broadly, we’ve been pretty clear we’ve taken this decision out of an abundance of caution. I don’t think it’s an especially onerous requirement, to be frank, and it’s consistent with the steps being taken in other countries. We’ve said for some time that we think it’s in Australia’s national interest interest to stabilise that relationship. There have been some welcomed developments on that front but we’re realistic about it too. You know, managing the relationship with China is a complex task. It’s a difficult task. Nobody pretends it’s easy. There will be bumps along the road. But our objective remains pretty clear and consistent. But there certainly is a lot of concern around the global health community and the global economy, about the transparency and quality of data that we see out of China on Covid. I think that’s very clear. If you look at what the World Health Organization has been saying about the sorts of steps that people have countries have been taking to manage travellers out of that part of the world, they said that these kinds of steps are understandable and that’s because they have a concern. We share that concern about the quality and transparency of the data. We do need to make sure that we’ve got the best possible surveillance of strains as they emerge, but also waves as they emerge and become more difficult to manage. And so that’s really one of the key considerations here as we put these responsible restrictions in place. Good morning, and happy first Wednesday of the year. Mostafa Rachwani with you, to take you through the day’s news. We begin on the Gold Coast once again, where two boys are fighting for their lives after the fatal helicopter collision this week. Four other people remain in hospital as investigators continue to look into the crash. Ten-year-old Nicholas Tadros and nine-year-old Leon De Silva, from Geelong, were both in a critical condition in hospital overnight, while Leon’s mother, Winnie De Silva, was in a serious condition. Historic flood waters have hit Western Australia’s Kimberley region, with the Fitzroy River forecast to hit record levels and Fitzroy Crossing residents warned to find higher ground as homes were inundated and the Great Northern Highway cut. WA emergency services minister Stephen Dawson told reporters that the situation was “dangerous and fast-changing”: We have not seen rain like this for at least a hundred years so it’s kind of shocking to see the water as high as it is. We will bring you more on both situations as news emerges, as well as everything else happening around the country.

Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the day’s main news events. The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, reaffirmed his nation’s ongoing support for Ukraine during a call with the latter’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The two men discussed further defence cooperation, separate statements said. Russia is planning a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” Ukraine, Zelenskiy warned in his Monday night address. Ukraine, he said, had to “act and do everything so that the terrorists fail in their aim, as all their others have failed.” On national television in Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the Ukraine air force, said nearly 500 Russian drones have been downed since September. The Ukrainian strike on a Russian base in Makiivka, Donetsk, has generated “significant criticism of Russian military leadership”, according to a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Several prominent Russian pro-war bloggers and commentators acknowledged the attack on Makiivka, with many suggesting the number of casualties was higher than the figures officially reported. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said up to 10 units of Russian military equipment of various types in occupied Makiivka were damaged or destroyed. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine, but its military reported the Makiivka attack as “a strike on Russian manpower and military equipment”. Satellite images taken by the US-based company Planet Labs that purportedly show the aftermath of the strike on Makiivka have circulated online, showing the building that allegedly housed the Russian troops before and after it was hit. The images, dated 2 January, show a building almost completely razed to the ground. Unverified footage posted online of the aftermath of the blast also showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble. It is unlikely Russia will achieve a significant breakthrough near Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region in the coming weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. This is due in part to Russia likely conducting offensive operations in the area at only platoon or section level, it said. The French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, said this morning she was more confident over the situation of French energy supplies for the next few weeks. She cited lower consumption and an increase in nuclear output capacity. Nato countries will discuss their defence spending targets in the coming months as some of them call for turning a 2% target into a minimum figure, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told the German news agency DPA. Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, Zelenskiy’s office said on Monday. Daily life continues in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, even amid power cuts and as fighting rages on in the country. In Bakhmut, the scene of heavy recent fighting, civilians have been helping out at a humanitarian aid centre that provides food, warm drink, medicine and other emergency supplies to people in need. Ukraine’s government plans to accelerate the country’s transition to clean and green energy as it tries to strengthen the national power network against Russian attacks, says the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine faces an energy shortage and blackouts following Russian missile and drone strikes, which Ukrainian officials say have damaged about 40% of the national energy infrastructure. Reuters quotes Shmyhal as telling a meeting of the Ukrainian government: Plans for the decarbonisation of energy and the green transformation remain relevant. The war has made these challenges even more urgent. We will use the potential of renewable energy – solar, wind, hydrogen generation, hydrogen technologies – more actively. The Russian attacks push us towards fundamental reform – building a decentralised energy system. It will be less vulnerable to enemy attacks. Shmyhal said creating the conditions to build mini-electricity stations and small generating facilities would be a priority this year. The government is also focused on repairing damage and strengthening security at energy facilities, especially at nuclear power plants, he said. Industry experts say Ukrainian solar plants see their power generation falling in winter, and that the clean power sector has experienced significant destruction during 10 months of war. The energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in October that up to about 50% of Ukraine’s solar energy facilities, and about 90% of wind farms, were out of service because they had been damaged during the war or occupied by Russian forces. Russian troops have spent weeks attempting to capture a single house in the contested Donbas city of Bakhmut, the head of the Russian Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said. In a grim video released over the new year, Prigozhin – an ally of Putin – was filmed visiting a basement near the eastern front filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city, a key Russian objective since the summer. In the makeshift morgue, Prigozhin is seen being shown bodies on stretchers and in body bags. One pile of bagged bodies can be seen stacked shoulder-high in the corner of one of the rooms. Prigozhin can be heard saying: Their contract has finished, they will go home next week. These are getting ready to be sent. We all work during New Year’s Eve. Here lie Wagner fighters who died at the front. They are now being put in zinc coffins and they will return home. Zelenskiy and Sunak spoke today and discussed the UK’s ongoing support for Ukraine, as well as the provision of more supplies to help the latter in its fight against Russian invaders, Downing Street confirms. A No 10 statement released just now reads: The prime minister spoke to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, this afternoon. The leaders discussed the abhorrent drone attacks on Ukraine in recent days, and the prime minister said the thoughts of the UK were with the Ukrainian people as they continued to live under such bombardment. The prime minister said Ukraine could count on the UK to continue to support it for the long term, as demonstrated by the recent delivery of more than 1,000 anti-air missiles. Work was also under way to provide further equipment in the coming weeks and months to secure Ukraine’s victory on the battlefield, the prime minister added. Discussing the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) summit in Latvia last month, the prime minister thanked the president for joining virtually and said the UK and JEF partners were working closely to provide the vital equipment requested. The leaders agreed to stay in close touch in the coming weeks. In a message posted to Telegram, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that he and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, have taken “concrete decisions”. Zelenskiy posted: Together with prime minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak, we discussed further defence cooperation. We agreed to intensify our efforts to bring victory closer this year already. We already have concrete decisions for this. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has restated Ukraine’s position on peace talks on social media. He has tweeted: The key thing must be kept in mind. Especially when you want to “talk about war or negotiations”. The Russian Federation came to a foreign country to kill its citizens. The Russian Federation is massively shelling Ukraine. The Russian Federation is trying to seize part of foreign territory. The Russian Federation is the only author of an unprovoked war in Europe. Russia state-owned media RIA is reporting the claims of the Russian defence ministry to have destroyed two Ukrainian Himars launchers near Kramatorsk, which is in the region of Donetsk, one of the areas of Ukraine which Russia claims to have annexed. RIA quotes a military report stating: In the course of a counter-battery fight in the area of the city of Kramatorsk, positions were opened and two launchers of the US-made HIMARS multiple launch rocket system were destroyed, from which shelling of settlements in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) was carried out. Prior to the claim of annexation, the DPR was only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Young acrobats from circus schools across Ukraine dazzled audiences in Budapest this week when the city hosted a Ukrainian youth circus festival to showcase the talents of children forced by the war to train underground or without electricity. Reuters reports that, after months of practice in their home cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, Dnipro, Odesa and Donetsk, the children aged between six and 17 years gave more than 30 performances alongside competitors from Hungary, Switzerland, Mexico and Italy at Budapest’s Capital Circus. Its director, Peter Fekete, said: As these children are training in air raid shelters by candlelight from morning to night, [we thought] there must be a place where they can show their talent and knowledge. We must give them faith that it is worth doing the work, it is worth the training, so we stopped our regular programme for two days this January and … handed over the circus to our Ukrainian friends. Circus artist Mariia Kravchenko, 13, from the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro, had trained for the circus festival in unheated shelters amid the Russian attacks. “I trained in the circus in Dnipro but we have the war in Ukraine and I was training with air raid sirens [on] and it was hard,” she said with a faint smile, as she prepared to perform her hula hoop show dressed in Ukrainian colours with flowers in her hair. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, reaffirmed that Ukraine “needs our support more than ever”, as he hosted Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, in Paris, with Sweden having taken over the rotating presidency of the European Union. Germany’s defence ministry is looking into whether it will need to extend its leadership of a Nato joint task force beyond 2023 due to delays by the UK, the next country in line to lead, according to local media reports that cite German army sources. Germany’s Bundeswehr took over command of the Very High Joint Readiness Task Force (VJTF) for 12 months, which requires the leader to be operational within 48 to 72 hours. Germany is providing up to 2,700 soldiers as lead nation. According to the sources, the UK will only be able to take over leadership in 2024, several months later than planned, the news outlet said. The VJTF was created after Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and was deployed for the first time for collective defence after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. It was not immediately clear what effect a delay in change of leadership might have on operations. The leadership position is rotated among members to share the burden that it places on the military, and brigades are bound to the VJTF for three years to help with the stand-up, stand-by and stand-down phases, meaning they are not available for other missions or international obligations. “There is nothing official I can tell you about this at the moment,” a German defence ministry spokesperson told Reuters. The UK’s defence ministry has not responded to the news agency’s request for comment. Russia is planning a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned in his Monday night address. Ukraine, he said, had to “act and do everything so that the terrorists’ fail in their aim, as all their others have failed.” On national television in Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the air force command of the armed forces of Ukraine, has claimed that nearly 500 Russian drones have been downed since September.

It is unlikely Russia will achieve a significant breakthrough near Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region in the coming weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. This is due in part to Russia likely conducting offensive operations in the area at only platoon or section level, it said. The French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, said this morning she was more confident over the situation of French energy supplies for the next few weeks, citing lower consumption and an increase in nuclear output capacity. Nato countries will discuss their defence spending targets in the coming months as some of them call for turning a 2% target into a minimum figure, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told the German news agency DPA. Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, Zelenskiy’s office said in a statement on Monday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. I am handing you over to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson for the next few hours. Ukrinform reports that on national television in Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the air force command of the armed forces of Ukraine, has claimed that nearly 500 Russian drones have been downed since September. Ukrinform quotes him telling viewers: We will prepare. We shoot down drones. As you can see, 84 drones were shot down in two days – on New Year’s Eve and the following day. 100% were shot down by air defence forces. Such results have never been achieved before. The number of drones is already approaching 500 since September 11. That is 500 drones shot down. If you missed it overnight, there was a moment on French TV when a blast occurred behind a journalist who was doing a live two-way from Kramatorsk. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv, has posted to Telegram to reiterate that residents must act if they hear air alarms. He writes: It is also important to keep safety in mind at all times, especially during the holidays. The enemy does not manage to spoil the holiday for Ukrainians. Don’t lose your vigilance. If you hear an alarm, go to safe places. He also reiterated the message that the power supply is expected to work continuously at the moment, but cautioned over consumption, saying: As of now, the Kyiv region is fully supplied with electricity. Emergency and planned blackouts are not introduced in the region. However, this situation may change. It is extremely necessary to continue economical consumption. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a selection of images from the war to Telegram alongside the following message: There are no small actions in a big war. There are no unnecessary ones. Each of us is a fighter. Each of us is a front. Each of us is the basis of defence. We fight as one team – the whole country, all our regions. It is unseasonably warm in Ukraine today, and for that reason Ukrenergo has predicted that there will be no planned electricity outages before 2pm. However, Suspilne reports that Ukraine’s energy company has predicted that consumption limits will be required in the afternoon and evening as demand rises. Here is an image out of Kyiv from the last few days showing Ukrainian armed forces receiving a van from a repair shop that has been converted to doing work for the war effort. The Autocomp shop formerly specialised in collision repairs, but that changed after Russia invaded in February and volunteers reached out about preparing vehicles to send to the front. Suspilne, Ukraine’s public broadcaster, is reporting details of attacks on Kherson yesterday. It has posted to Telegram: During the day of 2 January, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 79 times. Two people died, nine were injured, said the head of [the region, Yaroslav] Yanushevich. The Russian army attacked Kherson itself 32 times. Shells hit a car dealership, a utility company, private and apartment buildings. Reuters has a quick snap to say that the French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, said this morning she was more confident over the situation of French energy supplies for the next few weeks, citing lower consumption and an increase in nuclear output capacity. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, the governor of Sumy region, has also updated residents on events overnight. He claimed Russia fired at three settlements, including an attack on railway infrastructure in Krasnopillia. He gave no details of any casualties. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, has posted his daily operational briefing for residents on Telegram. He says that overnight there were no air alarms in his western region of Ukraine, and that the electricity supply has no scheduled blackouts for today. The Russian state-owned media agency Tass is reporting that the drone company Filming from the Air has said it is supplying new small imaging drones to the Russian military for use in Ukraine. Tass quotes a company spokesperson saying that the drones are much cheaper than the Chinese-manufactured equivalent that Russia has been using, and that each “is equipped with a compact thermal imager capable of detecting the presence of enemy forces at any time of the day, and also has the ability to be equipped with a grenade-drop device”. Tass reports that the company first presented the model in November at an exhibition in Moscow. Nato countries will discuss their defence spending targets in the coming months as some of them call for turning a 2% target into a minimum figure, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told the German news agency DPA, according to a Reuters report. Some allies are strongly in favour of turning the current 2% target into a minimum,” DPA quoted Stoltenberg as saying in an interview published on Tuesday. Stoltenberg said that he would head the negotiations. We will meet, we will have ministerial meetings, we will have talks in capitals,” he said. He did not say which Nato countries were calling for a more ambitious target, according to DPA. The Nato chief said he aimed to reach an agreement no later than Nato’s next regular summit, which will be in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, on 11-12 July. Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, Zelenskiy’s office said in a statement on Monday. The parties discussed expected results of the next Ukraine-EU summit to be held on 3 February in Kyiv and agreed to intensify preparatory work,” the statement read. Zelenskiy said he also expects the first tranche of EU macro-financial aid to arrive in January after speaking to European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen on Monday. He thanked Von der Leyen for her support, adding the €18bn ($19bn) worth of financial assistance “is extremely important right now, when Russia is trying to gather new forces for aggression”. Russia is planning a protracted campaign of attacks with Iranian drones to “exhaust” Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned in his Monday night address. It is probably banking on exhaustion. Exhausting our people, our anti-aircraft defences, our energy.” Ukraine, he said, had to “act and do everything so that the terrorists’ fail in their aim, as all their others have failed.” Zelenskiy said the country’s forces have shot down more than 80 drones since the start of 2023. The Ukrainian military claimed to have destroyed 40 Russian drones heading for Kyiv on Sunday night alone, with 15 destroyed over neighbouring regions, three in the Kyiv region and 22 directly over the capital. It is unlikely Russia will achieve a significant breakthrough near Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region in the coming weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. This is due in part to Russia likely conducting offensive operations in the area at only platoon or section level. “In mid-December, Russian military and Wagner proxy forces likely increased the frequency of their infantry assaults around the Donetsk town of Bakhmut. However, many of these operations were poorly supported,” the ministry noted in its latest intelligence report. “Over the last 10 days, Ukraine has committed significant reinforcements to defend the sector and the frequency of Russian assaults have likely reduced from the peak in mid-December. Both sides have suffered high casualties.” A quick snap here from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, which has just released its daily operational report. The military confirmed an attack by Ukraine’s forces on 31 December on “the enemy’s life force and military equipment” in the town of Chulakivka in the Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. The enemy’s losses were about 500 soldiers wounded and killed,” the report said. In the Kherson direction, Russian forces “do not stop shelling settlements along the right bank of the Dnipro River”, the force added. The Ukrainian strike on a Russian base in Makiivka, Donetsk, has generated “significant criticism of Russian military leadership”, according to a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). In its latest update, the US thinktank said: Russian MoD is likely attempting to deflect the blame for its poor operational security (OPSEC) on to Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) officials and mobilised forces, but its vague acknowledgment of the strike nonetheless generated criticism towards the Russian military command. Such profound military failures will continue to complicate Putin’s efforts to appease the Russian pro-war community and retain the dominant narrative in the domestic information space.” A number of prominent Russian pro-war bloggers and commentators acknowledged the attack on Makiivka, with many suggesting the number of casualties was higher than the figures officially reported. “What happened in Makiivka is horrible,” wrote Archangel Spetznaz Z, a Russian military blogger with more than 700,000 followers on Telegram. Who came up with the idea to place personnel in large numbers in one building, where even a fool understands that even if they hit with artillery, there will be many wounded or dead?” he wrote. Commanders “couldn’t care less” about ammunition stored in disarray on the battlefield, he said. “Each mistake has a name.” The attack sparked renewed criticism among pro-invasion bloggers and some officials over the state of Russia’s military and the decision to use civilian infrastructure to house soldiers. Housing personnel in buildings instead of housing them in shelters directly aids the enemy. From the situation in Makiivka it is necessary to draw the toughest conclusions,” wrote Andrey Medvedev, an ultra-conservative journalist who is deputy chairman of Moscow’s city parliament. Bezsonov called for the punishment of “those guilty of the decision to use the facility. The Donbas has enough objects with strong infrastructure where you can house army personnel.” Vladlen Tatarsky, a military blogger whom Putin met in the Kremlin in September, called for a tribunal for the Russian military leadership, describing Moscow’s top officers as “untrained idiots”, in a post on Telegram. Russia’s acknowledgment of scores of deaths in one incident was almost without precedent. Moscow rarely releases figures for its casualties, and when it does the figures are typically low – it acknowledged just one death from among a crew of hundreds when Ukraine sank its flagship cruiser Moskva in April. Satellite images taken by US-based company Planet Labs dated 20 December and 2 January show the aftermath of Ukraine’s strike on the Russian-held city of Makiivka. The vocational school reportedly housed recently mobilised troops sent by Moscow when it was hit on 1 January. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said up to 10 units of Russian military equipment of various types in occupied Makiivka were damaged or destroyed in a statement published late on Monday. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. But its military reported the Makiivka attack as “a strike on Russian manpower and military equipment”. On December 31, up to 10 units of enemy military equipment of various types were destroyed and damaged” in the town of Makiivka in the eastern region of Donetsk. It said the human “losses” were still being established. Ukraine’s military command initially claimed up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed in the incident in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. “Santa packed about 400 corpses in bags,” a statement from Ukraine’s department of strategic communications of the armed forces read on Sunday. Russia’s defence ministry gave a much lower figure and in a rare admission on Monday claimed 63 Russian soldiers died in the strike, the biggest loss of life reported by Moscow so far. The ministry said four US-supplied Himars missiles struck “a temporary deployment facility”. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The Guardian has been unable to confirm an official number of casualties. As Ukraine reels from a series of devastating strikes aimed at its key infrastructure this week, its president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned of further attacks to come.

It said the human “losses” were still being established. The attack on Makiivka killed dozens of recently mobilised troops sent by Moscow, in what could be one of the deadliest known incidents involving Russian conscripts so far. Ukraine’s military command said up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed in the incident in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, but this claim was not independently verified. Russia’s defence ministry said 63 Russian soldiers died when Ukraine hit “a temporary deployment facility” with four US-supplied Himars missiles. Satellite images taken by US-based company Planet Labs that purportedly showing the aftermath of the strike on Makiivka have circulated online, showing the building that allegedly housed the Russian troops before and after it was hit. The images, dated 2 January, show a building almost completely razed to the ground. Unverified footage posted online of the aftermath of the blast also showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble. Several waves of Russian drones targeted critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and surrounding areas early on Monday morning. Debris from a destroyed drone hit Kyiv’s northeastern Desnianskiy district, wounding a 19-year-old man who was later taken to hospital, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Energy infrastructure facilities in the city were damaged, causing power and heating outages. Ukraine claims to have destroyed 40 Russian drones heading for Kyiv on Sunday night, with 15 destroyed over neighbouring regions, three in the Kyiv region and 22 directly over the capital.

The Conservative-run council in Essex admitted three weeks ago that it faces big cuts and job losses after revealing it had lost £275m on investments it made in solar energy and other businesses, and has set aside a further £130m this year to pay back investment debts. It is to approach the government for a financial bailout, saying it will not be able to meet its legal duty to balance the books over the next few months. The council will meet in the new year to discuss how it will manage its deficit. Thurrock becomes the fourth council to issue a section 114 “bankruptcy” notice in recent years, after Northamptonshire county council, Croydon, and Slough. Several other authorities have warned they are also struggling to balance the books. A section 114 notice, seen as the last resort for financially struggling councils, requires the authority to stop all but the essential spending needed to provide vital services, pay staff and meet its legal duties, while it works out a way of stabilising its finances. Mark Coxshall, the leader of Thurrock council, said: “Residents and staff should feel safe knowing that our street lights are still shining, our roads are continuing to be gritted during bad weather, and our most vulnerable friends and family are being looked after. “They can also be reassured that under my leadership we have started to grip our situation and have a clear sight of what needs to be done. The section 114 notice is a clear indication we are on the road to recovery. “I have already made it clear as the incoming leader that I have been shocked by the position the council is in and we do not take lightly the seriousness of the step we are being asked to take today.” However, the scale of the crisis in Thurrock has stunned the wider local government world, after revelations by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed that senior council officials had ignored warnings from financial experts over the “unprecedented risks” it was taking with public money. Thurrock had become one of the most indebted of all English local authorities in recent years after borrowing £1.5bn cheaply from the Treasury and fellow local authorities – 10 times its annual spending on local services – to enable a string of investments in solar energy and other businesses. It has been run on a day-to-day basis by government-appointed commissioners since September after ministers first became alarmed at the exceptional levels of debt and risk incurred by the council. John Kent, the leader of Thurrock’s Labour opposition, said: “The formal issuing of Thurrock council’s section 114 notice – the local government equivalent of bankruptcy – was, sadly, inevitable. For years, we have been warning about the possible consequences of the Conservatives’ disastrous financial mismanagement, but time and again we were laughed at, fobbed off and misled. “The suggestion that a section 114 notice is somehow good news – a ‘clear indication that we are on the road to recovery’ or merely a procedural step – is frankly insulting to the many council staff who will be fearing for their jobs, to vulnerable people fearing for the services they rely on and to all of us who will be paying the price for the Conservatives’ disastrous financial mismanagement of Thurrock council for decades to come.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Power to the people: the neighbours turning their London street into a solar power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Power to the people: the neighbours turning their London street into a solar power station","bodyText":"Lynmouth Road appears unremarkable. It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words “Power Station” printed in the font used by polling stations. Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This year’s Cop27 climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power, generated closer to home, should feel like an obvious goal. But, at the moment, there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell. These two are on the roof of their house, sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket, bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street, Lynmouth Road, which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. “I think it will be fine,” says Hilary, who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. “I only get scared when the children say they want to come up, then I turn to jelly.” The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street, with their children, Esmé, 12, and George, 10, and the family’s two dogs. “It is a street that has a sense of community,” says Hilary, down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. “That became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.” And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettifor’s book, The Case for the Green New Deal, which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness, struck both of them. The phrase was: “Every building a power station.” “We clung on to that,” says Hilary. There was also People’s Power by American writer Ashley Dawson. “He wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry,” she adds. The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home, but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around £10,000, they discovered. Linking them together would be hard – the technology is complex, especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours. “Well, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, you’d be over the moon, wouldn’t you?” says Ejaz Hussain, 71, now retired. “If it comes off, I’ll know that I’ve been blessed.” Sipke Visser, 45, is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife, their two children and his father-in-law. “I know Dan and Hilary, so I wasn’t that surprised,” he says, “But I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door, I would be very sceptical.” “We looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much,” says Pippa Evans, 57, who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. “So I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.” The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018, the couple started working in an empty building, a former bank on one of Walthamstow’s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes, complete with pictures of people from local community projects, and sold them, raising £40,000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining £20,000 they bought up £1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. “You can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it won’t be paid off,” says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay, although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf, the towers of the UK’s financial sector looming in the background. The documentary they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. “It’s also a show-and-do project,” says Dan. “We’re learning as we go and we’re sharing it as we learn it.” “We’re not setting ourselves up as experts,” adds Hilary. “There isn’t just one solution and we don’t know everything about kilowatts per hour, so we’re a conduit. We’re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.” Their own expertise, they say, is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling. As of 2019 there were around 300 community energy projects in the UK covering 67,000 homes, according to the thinktank Green Alliance. The sector was hit when the government’s community energy strategy was scrapped, with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked, powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private, leasehold and freehold, and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. “It turns out that not many people fully own their roof,” says Dan. While the whole street can’t be linked now, Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who can’t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved – nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road – there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power. The project, as it stands, will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations, such as the London Community Energy Fund. There’s the crowdfunder, running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell, the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down, so participating residents can offer to pay, but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly. As we sit on the bed on the roof, the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat, although he doesn’t make it all the way up. “It’s a bit ironic, in my line of work, but I’m not great with heights,” he says. Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. “Some people just shut the door before we started speaking,” says Dan. “Then there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.” Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels, but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work. Andy Richford, 70, is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology, he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. “I’ve been banging on about it for years,” he says. “I might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels, but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses, with a direct feed into the house, means energy isn’t lost in transmission and we don’t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.” The ground on which Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away, some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers, dog walkers, runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area, says Hilary, who has been looking into its history, was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstow’s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links, the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century, but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow, with its garden terraces, good schools and decent transport links, became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019, house prices more than doubled. “It used to be full of very long-term residents,” says Hilary. “One family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.” Dan also mentions a former resident, Dorothy Burroughs, who spent her 100 years living on the street, only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. “She said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.” Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life, including 20 years at a local food processing factory, now demolished to make way for flats. “I’m struggling, although the mortgage is paid. I’ve got two daughters, one at college, one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and I’m on my pension,” he says. Like many of his neighbours, he had also looked at solar panels, but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. “In the early days it was brilliant, simple. You said good morning to your neighbours, they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello, people would give you a funny look.” The Power Station project, he says, has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. “This is what we want, the community spirit,” he says. “It costs nothing to look after one another.” The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. “We all have concerns about the environment,” says Chris Humphreys, 49, who works in education and lives with his wife, Catherine, and their two sons. “And you try and do your little thing, but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see what’s happening in the news at the moment and you know it won’t be those people who make changes for the better. It’s got to start at the grassroots. I’ve never been especially active politically, but I’m very happy to stand alongside our neighbours in what I think is hopefully a practical and positive solution.” “I want to be part of the solution, even if it’s just a small part,” says Dee Tweedie, 48, who has been involved with the project from the beginning and went door-to-door with Dan and Hilary to explain the idea. “We all want to save the planet and the prices of everything are rising in tandem… energy, food, mortgage. But you don’t always know what you can do when it’s just you and your family. It’s been lovely to meet so many of our neighbours. There’s camaraderie. Maybe that’s how it felt during the war.” “It’s building on the sense of community that started to grow during the pandemic,” says Pippa Evans. “To me, it’s almost as important as the energy. It’s within human nature to be self-centred at times and I think the political climate has encouraged that. But humans are sociable and we’re interdependent and those aspects can be emphasised when we’re working together and helping create something. As a community, we can make bigger changes than as individual people.” “The energy for what we do is drawn from anger, but I don’t think you would necessarily see that as a tone in our films or in our work,” says Dan. “But you wouldn’t see us here, doing all this, if we didn’t feel an intense sense of how absurd our political and social realities are. We’d like to see a kinder world, but we’ve created a system that profits a very narrow minority and so many more people could be living more meaningful and useful lives.” “I can be really angry,” says Hilary. “We live in a society where Matt Hancock can be on celebrity TV and you think, ‘What the fuck is going on? This is sick, it’s like The Hunger Games. And we acquiesce. And the corruption and vandalism of those in charge are just forgotten. At the same time, we can’t be paralysed,” she continues. “I hope this can wake others up and make them realise you can take action, and that the worst thing would be to sit in despair and do nothing.” The Power Station may not be actively producing energy just yet, but it has generated an idea that is already flowing to the rest of the area. Dan and Hilary are working with five local primary schools, including the one their son attends, to arrange funding and installation via the Solar for Schools project. People in neighbouring streets have started asking how they could join in. “We’re busy behind the scenes, working out how it could become a street-by-street model,” says Hilary. “I hope, after the first wave, when there are people sharing testimonials, others will want to be involved, too.” On their wall they have an aerial photograph of the road, with the houses already involved marked by coloured Post-It notes. “I was kind of heartbroken when the obstacles to doing the whole street started to pile up,” says Dan. “But I started to realise it doesn’t really matter. We have 30 households, and more and more people expressing interest. Three nearby streets are starting to organise themselves. And we can share what we’ve learned. You need someone to coordinate, otherwise scheduling the surveys is tough. You need at least 20 people. But you can go from there.” The surveys on Lynmouth Road are just wrapping up. If all goes to plan, the panels will start to go up in January. “I feel like we’ve promised people something and I want everyone to see it’s really happening,” says Hilary. But even without the solar panels, the street has started to change. “When society is organised from the top down, you feel reliant on the government to change things,” says Pippa Evans. “But if you have brave individuals who stand up and gather other people around them… We can stand up for ourselves, we can do things ourselves.” “We can be powerful, us, the people who should be powerless,” says Dan. He is on his rooftop with the street – and the geraniums and cats and wheelie bins – spread out two storeys below. “We do have the power to change things.” For all information on the Power Station, go to power.film.

Joe Biden says he’s “all in” on Africa’s future after unveiling a package of investments and supports at a summit with the continent’s business leaders in Washington DC. The president says infrastructure and the climate emergency are among his top priorities for Africa, as he seeks to build closer ties and limit Russian and Chinese influence in the region. Here’s what else we’ve been watching: Survivors from mass shootings at gay nightclubs in Florida and Colorado gave harrowing testimony at a hearing of the House oversight committee looking into surging violence against the LGBTQ+ community. Democrats say Republicans have “stoked the flames of bigotry” with hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ laws nationwide. A new poll shows voters have little appetite for a presidential election rematch in 2024 between Biden and Donald Trump. Almost two thirds of registered Democrats and Republicans say they don’t want their 2020 nominees to run again. Georgia’s secretary of state Brad Raffensperger said it was time to drop the general election runoff system that forced Democrat Raphael Warnock to beat Republican challenger Herschel Walker twice within weeks to retain his Senate seat. In a statement marking the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 20 children and six adults, Biden said the US should have “societal guilt” at taking so long to address the problem of gun crime.

Governor Doug Burgum signed an executive order Wednesday afternoon, joining Republican colleagues from other states, including South Dakota and Texas, to have previously done so over concerns about the platform’s Chinese ownership and perceived data sharing and national security worries. In addition to prohibiting downloads of TikTok on government-issued equipment or while connected to the state’s network, it bars visiting the TikTok website. “TikTok raises multiple flags in terms of the amount of data it collects and how that data may be shared with and used by the Chinese government,” Burgum said in a statement, according to the AP. In its own statement Wednesday, TikTok said it was “disappointed that so many states are jumping on the bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded, politically charged falsehoods”.

It might sound frivolous, but the bill seeks to enshrine in federal statute a measure already passed in 19 states to prevent racial discrimination on the grounds of hair style or color. “You go to my city right now and you’ll find hairstyles of different types, locks, cornrows with braids, Bantu knots, and of course what I once had, afros,” the famously bald Booker said. “[But] there’s a decades-long problematic practice of discrimination against natural hair in this country.” He cited the case of Andrew Johnson, an 18-year-old student in 2018 whose dreadlocks were cut off on the orders of a judge at a high school wrestling match before he was allowed to compete. The episode was caught on video. “You can see the deep hurt and pain on the face of this young man,” Booker said. “It’s the pain felt by many. Traumatic at times, hurtful experiences that make you question your very belonging in a community. “The beauty of your hair, its natural style, your immutable characteristics, your cultural beliefs, your connection to your heritage. No person in America should have to deal with this pain.” Opposing Booker’s plea to advance the bill, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul said it was not necessary. The bill, he said, might compromise the safety of workers who could have the legal right to refuse to wear a helmet in the workplace because of their hair. “Using hairstyle as a pretext for racial discrimination is already illegal,” Paul claimed. The state that prolonged November’s midterms until 6 December won’t be able to do it again, if a proposal by its top election official gets approved. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, says it’s time to get rid of the runoff system that requires a revote any time that no candidate in a general election reaches 50% of the votes cast. It’s the reason incumbent Democratic senator Raphael Warnock had to beat Republican challenger Herschel Walker for the second time in a month after coming close to, but not quite reaching, the 50% threshold in November. “Georgia is one of the only states in country with a general election runoff. We’re also one of the only states that always seems to have a runoff,” Raffensperger said, according to Fox5 Atlanta. “I’m calling on the general assembly to visit the topic… and consider reforms.” He said the current system made it difficult for counties, especially those in rural areas with few staff, to handle two elections within weeks of each other, a period that includes Thanksgiving. “No one wants to be dealing with politics in the middle of their family holiday,” he said. Raffensperger was the recipient of an infamous telephone call from Donald Trump asking him to “find” enough votes in Georgia to reverse his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. A huge part of the Biden administration’s just-announced investment in Africa’s future will be a half-billion dollar investment in infrastructure, specifically the building and maintaining of roads linking ports to interior countries. The money, Joe Biden says, will come from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent government foreign aid agency with a brief to reduce global poverty. The president said that MCC had made new investments of almost $1.2bn in Africa, and expected to commit an additional $2.5bn across the continent over the next four years: This compact will invest $500m to build and maintain roads, put in place policies that reduce transportation costs, make it easier and faster for ships to ship goods from the port of Cotonou [in Benin] into neighboring landlocked countries. The climate emergency, Biden stressed, will be another top focus, with work already under way, funded by $80m in public and private finance, to replace 12 coal-fired power plants in South Africa with renewable energy sources, and to develop “cutting edge energy solutions” such as clean hydrogen. He cited a $2bn deal to build solar energy projects in Angola, and a $600m high speed communications cable linking south Asia and Europe through Egypt, and $800m to help protect African countries against cyber threats. One of the most essential resources for many entrepreneurs and small business owners who want to participate in the global economy is reliable and affordable access to the internet. So today, I’m announcing a new initiative, the digital transformation with Africa. We’re here with Congress to invest $350bn, to facilitate more than almost a half a billion dollars in financing to make sure people across Africa participate in a digital economy. Biden brought his speech to a close just before the kick-off of the France v Morocco World Cup semi-final. Joe Biden has committed to strengthening Africa’s food supplies, tackling the climate emergency and partnering with the continent’s nations to take on the rising global power in the region of China and Russia. In an address at the US Africa Business Leaders forum in Washington DC, the president says “the US is all in on Africa’s future”. He’s outlining a multi-prong approach to strengthen those ties, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding that Biden says will “unlock new opportunities for trade and investment between our countries and bring Africa and the US even closer than ever”: It’s an enormous opportunity for Africa’s future, and the US wants to help make those opportunities real. Included in the package are, he says, up to $370m from the US international development finance fund for new projects, including investing $100m for clean energy for sub-Saharan Africa. Entrepreneurship and innovation are at the top of Biden’s list, he says. And he wants $350bn from Congress for a “digital transformation” for Africa, which includes involving companies such as Microsoft to build networks and infrastructure to bring internet access to five million Africans who are currently not connected: When Africa succeeds, the United States succeeds and, quite frankly, the whole world succeeds as well,” Biden says. Joe Biden is speaking now at the US-Africa leadership summit where he’s about to announce partnerships with African nations and a pathway to better ties and business relations. But the president said he was aware of people knowing the France v Morocco World Cup game was starting at the top of the hour, and were thinking: “Make it short Biden. There’s a semi-final game coming up”. We’ll bring you the best of Biden’s comments. Earlier this month, the Guardian’s Joan E Greve travelled to Newtown, Connecticut to speak with Nicole Hockley and Mark Barden of Sandy Hook Promise, the parents of Dylan and Daniel, who were killed 10 years ago today. For the Guardian’s Politics Weekly America podcast, Joan also met teenagers from the Junior Newtown Action Alliance, who now go through terrifying lockdown drills as preparation for another shooting and who want to see more change in gun legislation, and spoke to Senator Chris Murphy, who helped draft the first significant gun control policy in the US in 30 years this year. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is pressing Congress to adopt bipartisan legislation which would force crypto firms to abide by the same regulations as banks and corporations, in an attempt to crack down on money laundering through digital assets. Ed Pilkington reports… Warren is pushing for the new controls on the crypto industry in the wake of the spectacular collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. On Tuesday its founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was charged with eight criminal counts including conspiracy to commit money laundering. Warren’s bill is being co-sponsored by the Republican senator from Kansas Roger Marshall. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would essentially subject the world of crypto to the same global financial regulations to which more conventional money markets must conform. Under current systems, crypto exchanges are able to skirt around restrictions designed to stop money laundering and impose sanctions. Should the bill be enacted into law it would authorize the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) to reclassify crypto entities as “money service businesses” which would bring them under basic regulations laid out in the Bank Secrecy Act. In a statement to CNN, Warren said “commonsense crypto legislation” would protect US national security. “I’ve been ringing the alarm bell in the Senate on the dangers of these digital asset loopholes,” she said, adding that crypto was “under serious scrutiny across the political spectrum”. Bankman-Fried, 30, was indicted by prosecutors at the southern district of New York and is being held in custody in the Bahamas. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also brought civil charges against him, accusing him of creating a firm that was a “house of cards” Some news out of Oregon that came later yesterday, which we wanted to record: the outgoing Democratic governor Kate Brown has commuted the sentences of all 17 of the state’s death row prisoners to life without parole. “I have long believed that justice is not advanced by taking a life, and the state should not be in the business of executing people – even if a terrible crime placed them in prison,” Brown said in a statement released by her office. “Since taking office in 2015, I have continued Oregon’s moratorium on executions because the death penalty is both dysfunctional and immoral. “Today I am commuting Oregon’s death row so that we will no longer have anyone serving a sentence of death and facing execution in this state. This is a value that many Oregonians share.” Brown’s order will also see the closure of the state’s execution chamber. Oregon’s most recent execution was in 1997, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Governor John Kitzhaber first declared a moratorium on executions in 2011, which Brown has kept in place ever since. Full story: Voters have little appetite for a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump for the presidency in 2024, a poll released Wednesday lunchtime has found. Roughly six in 10 Republicans, and the same margin in the Democratic party, don’t want their respective 2020 nominees to run again, according to the CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Support from registered Republicans for Trump, especially, has plummeted, a reflection of the former president’s burgeoning legal troubles and, perhaps, the rising star of rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis. In January, CNN found, 50% said they hoped Trump would be the nominee and 49% wanted someone else. By July, 44% wanted Trump to be the party’s nominee, and now, only 38% say the same. Trump announced last month his third run at the White House as a Republican. There’s slightly better news for Biden. 40% of registered Democrats want the president to run again in 2024, the poll says, up from only 25% in the summer. But both figures are a drop from the 45% support he received in January. You can read about the poll here. The former Trump campaign chair and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has repeatedly praised the Republican National Committee on Fox News while failing to disclose that it has paid her firm more than $800,000 since last year, Media Matters reports. Eric Hananoki, an investigative reporter for the liberal media watchdog, writes: “The lack of disclosure about Conway’s financial ties goes against the ethics-challenged network’s purported policy”. He adds: A Fox News spokesperson told the Washington Post in 2019 regarding work Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer did with the RNC that ‘Fox News requires contributors to disclose ties related to any topic he or she discusses on the air in which the contributor may have a financial interest.’ The spokesperson added that such a rule would apply when talking about ‘the RNC on air.’ Elsewhere, the Daily Beast adds that “Karl Rove, another Fox News contributor with deep ties to the GOP, was allowed to keep his paid network gig while overseeing Senate Republicans’ fundraising efforts in 2020”. As Hananoki notes, the RNC and its chair, Ronna McDaniel, have faced fierce criticism since the midterm elections, in which Republicans took back the House but by a slim majority and failed to win back the Senate – a disappointing performance widely blamed on former president Donald Trump, who endorsed a string of defeated candidates. Conway, Hananoki writes, “has used her Fox News platform to praise the RNC and play defense for McDaniel”. According to Media Matters, the RNC “has paid KAConsulting $829,969.38 since 2021 for a variety of expenses. The RNC’s most recent payment was on 4 November for ‘political strategy services’. The organisation recently announced that Conway would serve on a Republican Party Advisory Council ‘to inform the Republican Party’s 2024 vision and beyond’.” Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The final witness testimony before a Q and A session at today’s House hearing into anti-LGBTQ violence was a chilling account of inside Orlando’s Pulse nightclub as a gunman murdered 49 mostly gay and transgender patrons in 2016. “There were gunshots, endless gunshots; the hair standing up on the back of my neck; the stench of blood and smoke burning the inside of my nose,” said Brandon Wolf, a survivor who lost his two best friends in the massacre, and who has now become a prominent gun control and LBGTQ+ advocate. “A nervous huddle against a wall; a girl trying desperately so hard not to scream. I could feel her trembling on the tiles underneath us. “There was a sprint to the exit, all atop this bang, bang, bang, from an assault weapon. A man filled with hate an armed with a Sig Sauer MCX charged into Pulse, an LGBTQ safe space, and murdered 49 of those we loved.” Wolf called out the bigotry and hatred of extremists who have fomented violence against the LBGTQ+ community, and spread hateful narratives that have resulted in attacks, threats and clampdowns on everything from drag shows, to donut shops to school libraries. “For years cynical politicians and greedy Grifters have joined forces with right wing extremists to pour gasoline on anti LGBTQ hysteria and terrorize our community,” he said. “My own governor Ron DeSantis has trafficked in that bigotry to feed his insatiable political ambition and propel himself toward the White House. “We have been smeared and defamed. Hundreds of bills have been filed in order to erase us; powerful figures have insisted that the greatest threats this country face are a teacher with they-them pronouns, or someone in a wig reading Red Fish, Blue Fish.” Barack Obama has called the Sandy Hook massacre “the single darkest day of my presidency”. In his own statement marking the 10th anniversary of the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the former president also said he believed “the tide is turning” on gun violence. His administration was unable to renew a nationwide assault weapons ban, lamenting that inaction on gun safety laws was the “biggest regret” of his time in office. Here’s Obama’s statement today: The news from Sandy Hook Elementary was devastating, a visceral blow, and like so many others, I felt not just sorrow but anger at a world that could allow such things to happen. Even then we understood that mere words could only do so much to ease the burden of the families who were suffering. But in the years since, each of them has borne that weight with strength and with grace. And they’ve drawn purpose from tragedy – doing everything in their power to make sure other children and families never have to experience what they and their loved ones did. The journey hasn’t always been easy – and in a year when there hasn’t been a single week without a mass shooting somewhere in America, it’s clear our work is far from over. But of late, I’ve sensed that slowly, steadily, the tide is turning; that real change is possible. And I feel that way in no small part because of the families of Sandy Hook Elementary. Ten years ago, we all would have understood if those families had simply asked for privacy and closed themselves off from the world. But instead, they took unimaginable sorrow and channeled it into a righteous cause – setting an example of strength and resolve. They’ve made us proud. And if they were here today, I know the children and educators we lost a decade ago would be proud, too. Back at the House oversight hearing into anti-LGBTQ+ violence, Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) says her group has recorded an alarming surge in hate-related killings: Over the last 10 years, the campaign has tracked over 300 incidents of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people. In 2022 so far, we’ve recorded the murder of 35 people. It’s fueled by nearly unfettered access to guns, political extremism and rhetoric that is deliberately devised to make our community less safe, less equal, and less free. Violence has become a lived reality for so many in our community. Robinson condemns “unrelenting efforts by extremist lawmakers help reinforce inflammatory narratives of our community”. In 2020 alone, she says, HRC recorded efforts to pass 344 “anti-LBGTQ+” bills in 23 states, but regardless of how many were passed “these narratives have been weaponized many times” and “encourage extremist rhetoric and to enable violence”. She calls on Congress to pass the Equality Act (which passed the House but stalled in the Senate) “to level the playing field and ensure that LGBTQ plus people are protected from discrimination”. Joe Biden has released a statement marking the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting, in which 20 young children and six adults were killed in Newtown, Connecticut. Ten years ago today, the president says, “our nation watched as the unthinkable happened. Twenty young children with their whole lives ahead of them. Six educators who gave their lives protecting their students. And countless survivors who still carry the wounds of that day. We should have societal guilt for taking too long to deal with this problem. We have a moral obligation to pass and enforce laws that can prevent these things from happening again. We owe it to the courageous, young survivors and to the families who lost part of their soul 10 years ago to turn their pain into purpose. A few months ago, I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law. We’ve reined in so-called ghost guns which have no serial numbers and are harder to trace. We’ve cracked down on gun trafficking and increased resources for violence prevention. Still, we must do more. I am determined to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like those used at Sandy Hook and countless other mass shootings in America. Enough is enough. Our obligation is clear. We must eliminate these weapons that have no purpose other than to kill people in large numbers. It is within our power to do this – for the sake of not only the lives of the innocents lost, but for the survivors who still hope. Biden was vice-president to Barack Obama when Sandy Hook happened, on 14 December 2012. In the aftermath, with Democrats in Congress, the two men launched a push for meaningful gun reform – which failed. In his own statement today, Obama said the day of the shooting was “the single darkest day of my presidency. The news from Sandy Hook elementary was devastating, a visceral blow, and like so many others, I felt not just sorrow but anger at a world that could allow such things to happen.” As Biden said, some progress has been made on gun control reform this year – after the shooting deaths in May of 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Obama said: “I’ve sensed that slowly, steadily, the tide is turning; that real change is possible. And I feel that way in no small part because of the families of Sandy Hook elementary.” Further reading: As the House oversight panel hearing into anti-LBGTQ+ violence continues, committee chair Carolyn Maloney accuses Republicans of “fanning the flames of bigotry”. She says Democrats, meanwhile, “have remained committed to protecting and advancing the health, safety and rights of the LGBTQ+ people”. Unsurprisingly, Republican ranking member James Comer of Kentucky is having none of it. He starts by paying tribute to the Club Q victims, but veers quickly on to a rant about the hearing itself. “Democrats are using committee time and resources today to blame Republicans for this horrendous crime,” he says. “This is not an oversight hearing. This is a ‘blame Republicans so we don’t have to take responsibility for our own defund the police and soft-on-crime policies’,” he insists, without citing any. The Club Q shooter, he says, was “known to law enforcement”, and he follows up with a list of crime statistics in various cities he says shows the Biden administration is “reckless and irresponsible”. The panel is now taking a brief recess before witness testimony begins. Also facing criticism and anger for a rise in anti-LGBTQ+ hate speech online is Elon Musk, the billionaire Twitter owner and former world’s richest man accused overseeing a degradation in standards in the social media network. Maloney played a video made by Sarah Kate Ellis, chief executive of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). “A new GLAAD poll found 48% of LGBTQ people and 72% of transgender respondents fear for their safety in the current political environment. Why is this happening?” Ellis wonders. She says it “starts with candidates and politicians who deliberately spread disinformation and anti LGBTQ inflammatory political messaging. It continues with media”. Ellis says Fox News aired 170 anti-transgender segments in a three week span. She accuses the New York Times of approaching transgender healthcare as a debate, not “settled medicine”. She adds: This rhetoric gets amplified on social media, where hate gets organized into action. Facebook too often refuses to act on the content that spreads lines. On Twitter New Media Matters data shows the malicious, defamatory slurs and rumors increased over 1200% from nine accounts since Elon Musk took over. This behavior is all exacerbated when bad actors have easy access to assault weapons. House oversight committee chair Carolyn Maloney is laying into Republicans for a wave of anti-LBGTQ+ legislation she says “villainizes” that community and is fueling a surge of violence against them. Her comments came at the opening of the panel’s hearing into the rise of the violence, including last month’s Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs that killed five. Maloney, a New York Democrat, said: These actions are the culmination of years of anti LGBTQ extremism that began in state houses across the country and spread to social media, boiling over into the communities where we reside. In 2018, Republicans and state governments across the country introduced 110 pieces of legislation targeting the health and safety of LGBTQI people. In the past legislative session, this number tripled, to more than 340 pieces of anti LGBTQI legislation. These bills villainized LGBTQI+ people in classroom settings, and targeted health care for LGBTQI people, and more directly threaten the freedom of LGBTQI people to live authentically and safely. She is singling out Florida’s so-called Don’t Say Gay law, and the state’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, for special criticism: This “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law erases the existence of LGBTQI people, and families, and muzzles our nation’s brightest educators. Within a month of Florida passing this legislation, two additional states passed similar bills. In total 48 bills in more than 20 states have considered eliminating or suppressing LGBTQI people and history in the school curriculum. The House hearing on anti-LGBTQ+ attacks is not this morning’s only event looking at the scourge of gun violence. It’s the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting that cost 26 people their lives, including 20 six and seven-year-olds, and Connecticut senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal will speak on the chamber floor at 10.30am to commemorate those lost. Murphy, in particular, has become a strong gun control proponent. He issued a statement this morning ahead of his Senate speech: The nation is a different place, 10 years since 20 innocent children and six dedicated educators were senselessly killed inside Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mostly today, I will think of all the greatness and beauty that was robbed from this world, when these promising lives were cut short. Mostly, I will spend my day today sending every good thought I have to the family members who lost loved ones that day, to the survivors of the shooting, to the first responders, and to the community of Newtown that will never be the same. But also today, I will be thankful. I will be thankful for all the good that has resulted from this horror. Those parents, and the community of Newtown, have chosen to rise from that tragedy and build dozens of efforts that have changed lives for the better all over our nation. And many in Newtown have helped build the modern anti-gun violence movement, that finally this summer achieved the first federal gun safety bill in almost 30 years. Today, I’m so sad for what we lost. But I’m also so inspired and hopeful for all the grace and kindness that has grown out of tragedy, and for all that will come in the future.

But it’s not what you might think, according to Martin Pengelly: A Republican who urged the Trump White House to declare martial law to stop Joe Biden taking office has only one regret: that he misspelled “martial”. The text from Ralph Norman of South Carolina to Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s final chief of staff, was given to the January 6 committee by Meadows and revealed by Talking Points Memo this week. On 17 January 2021, 11 days after the deadly Capitol attack and three days before Biden’s inauguration, Norman wrote: “Mark, in seeing what’s happening so quickly, and reading about the Dominion law suits attempting to stop any meaningful investigation we are at a point of no return in saving our Republic !! Our LAST HOPE is invoking Marshall Law!! PLEASE URGE TO PRESIDENT TO DO SO!!” No response from Meadows was revealed. On Tuesday, a HuffPo reporter asked Norman about the message. Norman said: “Well, I misspelled ‘martial’.” He added: “I was very frustrated then, I’m frustrated now. I was frustrated then by what was going on in the Capitol. President Biden was in his basement the whole year. Dominion was raising all kinda questions.” The reference to Biden’s basement was to the then Democratic candidate’s decision largely to stay off the campaign trail in 2020, the year of the Covid pandemic. Read the full story: While we wait for the House hearing to begin on violence against the LGBTQ+ community, here’s the report by by colleagues Lauren Gambino and David Smith on last night’s signing by Joe Biden of the landmark Respect for Marriage Act: Joe Biden on Tuesday signed into law landmark legislation protecting same-sex marriages, hailing it as a step toward building a nation where “decency, dignity and love are recognized, honored and protected”. The signing ceremony on the White House South Lawn was a celebration, with guests waving rainbow flags and performances by the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC, Sam Smith and Cyndi Lauper. “This law and the love it defends strikes a blow against hate in all its forms,” Biden said, before signing the Respect for Marriage Act. The ceremony was personal for many in attendance. The transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay cabinet member, was there. Also present was Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin, a lead sponsor of the bill and the first openly gay member of that chamber. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he was wearing the same purple tie he wore to his daughter’s wedding. Schumer’s daughter and her wife are expecting their first child next year. “Thanks to the dogged work of many of my colleagues, my grandchild will live in a world that will respect and honor their mothers’ marriage,” the New York Democrat said, his voice catching. There was sustained applause for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. The long-serving congresswoman from San Francisco, a prominent champion of LGBTQ+ rights, praised the crowd of advocates and activists for their “patriotism” and “impatience”. Pelosi, who will soon step down from Democratic leadership, said it was fitting that “one of my final acts as speaker” was to gavel down the vote protecting same-sex marriage last week. The historic legislation protects same-sex and interracial marriages, prohibiting federal and state governments from denying the validity of a lawfully performed union on the basis of sex, race or ethnicity. Read the full story: Survivors of last month’s Club Q attack in Colorado Springs are expected to deliver powerful testimony this morning as the House oversight committee grapples with a surge of violence against the LGBTQ+ community. Five people were killed in the shooting, and three people who were there will appear today to give evidence alongside a survivor of the 2016 attack on Orlando’s gay Pulse nightclub that killed 49. Democrats are highlighting a rise in anti-LGBTQ+ extremism and rhetoric that they say is fueled by “despicable policies that Republicans at every level of government are advancing”, according to committee chair Carolyn Maloney. The panel is looking at hundreds of pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation passed in recent months, including Florida’s infamous “Don’t Say Gay” law that bans discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in many classrooms. The Human Rights Campaign recorded a more than 400% rise in online hate talk, including branding LGBTQ+ people as “groomers” or “pedophiles”, after the Florida law was passed. Such policies, Maloney says: Attack the health and safety of LGBTQ+ people, are harming the LGBTQ+ community, and contributing to tragedies like what we saw at Club Q. Republicans on my committee and across the country will be forced to face the real-life impact of their dangerous agenda.” The hearing comes in the wake of last night’s landmark signing by Joe Biden at the White House of the Respect for Marriage Act protecting same-sex unions. “This law and the love it defends strikes a blow against hate in all its forms,” the president said. Club Q survivors Michael Anderson and James Slaugh, and the club’s co-founder Matthew Haynes, will give testimony today, along with Brandon Wolf, a gun control activist and Pulse survivor. Wolf wrote in the Guardian last month about how a rise in rightwing anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric has made such attacks inevitable. Read more: Good morning politics blog readers. Violence against the LGBTQ+ community will be the focus of a House hearing this morning, with survivors of mass shootings giving testimony about recent attacks. Democrats are highlighting a rise in anti-LGBTQ+ extremism and rhetoric, fueled by “despicable policies that Republicans at every level of government are advancing”, according to House oversight committee chair Carolyn Maloney, for the surge in violence. Three survivors of last month’s deadly Club Q mass shooting in Colorado Springs will be among the witnesses for a hearing that’s scheduled to start at 10am. Here’s what else we’ll be following on what promises to be a lively day: Joe Biden will make remarks at 1.30pm ahead of a business meeting with African leaders this afternoon, and a dinner tonight. Connecticut senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy will speak on the chamber floor at 10.30am on the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting. The Senate banking committee will hold a hearing about the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The House is expected to vote at lunchtime on a short-term spending measure that will keep the government funded for a week beyond Friday.

Here’s the key points for today: After a meeting of energy ministers in Brisbane today, Chris Bowen announced an agreement on a “capacity mechanism” which he said would be “keeping the lights on” so there were fewer outages when there was high demand. This comes ahead of the national cabinet meeting tomorrow where it is expected the federal government will seek an agreement with the states on a cap on coal to lower energy costs across the country. The NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, indicated NSW was close to an agreement but stressed the state was not seeking compensation for missed royalties, but for the impact it would have on families and businesses. A former Department of Social Services official told a royal commission he was “directed” to water down legal concerns about the robodebt scheme when the policy was been designed in early 2015. The federal government announced overhauls to Australia’s environment laws, including plans to establish an environmental protection agency. The Greens said they would use their boosted numbers in the parliament to push the government to ensure the environmental protection agency is independent and has teeth, while the Coalition expressed concern it would be detrimental to business ahead of a briefing on the plans tomorrow. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, announced the government would embark on a new cybersecurity strategy led by three eminent Australians, the former Telstra CEO Andy Penn, Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre CEO Rachael Falk and Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld. O’Neil also announced two new department-led reviews looking at Australia’s national resilience and democracy resilience. The federal government is looking at counterterrorism legislation to see whether it adequately covers far-right extremism. John Pesutto has been chosen to lead the Victorian Liberal party after defeating Brad Battin in a party room ballot. The NSW government will support an Indigenous voice to parliament being enshrined in the constitution. Until tomorrow, enjoy your evening. ‘Convivial’ energy ministers' meeting a ‘universe away’ from Morrison times Energy ministers are heading for Brisbane airport (save Mick de Brenni, Queensland’s minister), generally satisfied with the “team Australia” outcomes today. What might be surprising is that the issue of coal and gas price caps barely got a mention at the event. Federal, state and territory ministers focused on medium- to long-term issues, leaving the immediate issue of price caps and compensation (if there is any) to the “first ministers” when they meet tomorrow. Indeed, whether the price of coal will be capped at $125 a tonne and gas at $8-$12/gigajoule (or lower than the $13/GJ being bandied out) remains to be seen. “Numbers were studiously not mentioned” in the chatter on the sidelines of the event, one participant tells Guardian Australia. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, and NSW counterpart (and treasurer), Matt Kean, were “quite convivial” throughout, said our insider. Indeed, the whole meeting was of such a mood. “It’s a universe away from what it used to be,” this person tells us, adding such gatherings during the previous Coalition government of Scott Morrison had been “a complete waste”. The main achievement was the creation of a capacity investment scheme as noted in earlier posts, which effectively kills off work done by the Energy Security Board to create a capacity market that might have paid mothballed coal- and gas-fired power plants to stay in business. Other work to watch includes a National Renewable Energy Supply Chain Action Plan (not a very snappy name) that will create job opportunities in manufacturing. It is to be developed by the end of 2023, and is being led by Queensland’s de Brenni. Landholders petition NSW energy minister over Santos Narrabri gas project More than 200 concerned landholders have petitioned the NSW energy minister to stop Santos from entering farming land for its proposed 400km underground gas pipeline, AAP reports. The Hunter gas pipeline would connect the $3.6bn Narrabri gas project on NSW’s northern tablelands to Newcastle and the east coast market. However, oil and gas giant Santos can’t proceed with land surveys without approval from the energy minister, Matt Kean. Farmers and environmentalists on Thursday delivered a petition from 215 landholders along the pipeline’s route to Kean’s office. The petition said the pipeline would disrupt and jeopardise high-value farmland and become a stranded asset as the energy sector transforms. Victoria Congdon, whose property in the Upper Hunter Valley touches the 30-metre-wide pipeline corridor, said the project would require substantial environmental damage. “It’s an obscene imposition on landholders, who have to modify their lives for a project that is outdated and not wanted,” she said. The western Liverpool Plains beef farmer Margaret Fleck said the gas pipeline could upset the delicate environment in the area, particularly groundwater feeding the Great Artesian Basin. Santos has said the proposed land survey activities would be undertaken by specialist consultants operating under the company’s supervision. “Before any survey works commence, Santos will meet with landholders to obtain consent on the areas of property to access and on what and when this will occur,” it said. Victoria’s Andrews government is set to surpass its 2018 historic “Danslide” on Friday with Labor claiming the seat of Pakenham on Thursday afternoon. Emma Vulin, Labor’s candidate for the newly created seat, in Melbourne’s south-east, claimed victory on Thursday afternoon. The electorate equals 55 seats in the lower house for Labor – the same landslide victory the party achieved in 2018. Vulin won the seat on a two-party preferred basis by 307 votes with a margin of 0.39%. In a Facebook post, Vulin vowed to advocate for the “diverse community” and ensure infrastructure met the area’s needs: I would like to thank the people of the Pakenham district for putting their faith in me. I will advocate for our community in Spring Street with the same fight that saw me rehabilitate after my stroke. I am eager to meet everyone and listen to the needs of our wonderful fast growing and diverse community and ensure we have the services and infrastructure that we need as we grow. Labor is also ahead in the seat of Bass – the final seat to be called – but the Victorian Electoral Commission said the formal distribution of preferences would be finalised on Friday. Capacity plan would unlock $10bn in new clean energy, Bowen says As we flagged, the energy ministers have agreed on a capacity investment scheme that will drive as much as $10bn of investment into “new renewable dispatchable capacity” for the grid. Critics have sought to deride the intermittency of wind and solar energy as meaning they were fundamentally less reliable than “baseload” coal and gas-fired power plants (when the latter don’t break down). Anyway, under this new arrangement, the commonwealth will open tenders for projects that add storage and even new generation projects themselves. There will be an agreed minimum payment for the winning bidders as a way to underwrite them, and also a “ceiling price” should revenue exceed a certain level (and the profits shared). Critically, fossil-fuel plants, existing or future, would not be eligible to apply. (No mention of small modular nuclear reactors but presumably that’s a problem to resolve in a decade or later.) States like NSW and Victoria reckon the capacity investment scheme will be very good for their existing programs to ramp up renewables – as do the other states or they wouldn’t have signed up. Groups like the Smart Energy Council have applauded the results as finally delivering a national plan for renewable energy generation and storage. “That means cheaper, cleaner and more reliable power for all Australians,” the council’s CEO, John Grimes, said. He called on governments to turn their gaze now to a small-scale scheme that would roll out batteries for homes, much like a similar program accelerated the take-up of rooftop solar panels that now dot about one-third of Australian homes. Likewise, Kane Thornton, the CEO of the Clean Energy Council, hailed today’s approval as likely to “unlock the next wave of renewable energy projects”. “Energy storage will play a crucial role in supporting the massive amounts of new wind and solar needed for the future,” Thornton said. “While measures to accelerate storage rollout are important, we also need to develop the markets and technical frameworks that will enable stable, long-term investment in storage.” Here is today’s Afternoon Update if you are looking to catch up: Medibank to go offline this weekend for system overhaul Medibank is advising it will take its systems offline for Medibank and ahm customers from 8.30pm AEDT Friday 9 December “as we undertake some maintenance to further strengthen our systems and enhance security protections”. It’s the first major overhaul of the company’s systems since the massive cyber-attack resulted in the personal details of close to 10 million current and former customers being posted on the dark web, including the personal medical claims for 210,000 customers. Medibank has advised customers this is “a planned operation with Microsoft and is the next necessary phase of our ongoing work to further safeguard our network”. The systems will be back online by Sunday 11 December, the company has said, but while they are down, customers won’t be able to access Medibank or ahm services online or through the app, and on-the-spot claims won’t be available. Retail stores and customer contact centres will be closed on Saturday and will reopen on Monday. Amplar Health services will not be affected. Melissa Caddick’s jewellery and designer clothes a hit at auction The fraudster Melissa Caddick’s extensive array of jewellery has sold at auction in Sydney for more than $800,000, with some items attracting as much as three times their estimated value, AAP reports. Buyers overwhelmed Smith &amp; Singer auction house on Wednesday night for a chance to bid on the 53-piece collection once owned by the con artist, as well as a selection of designer clothes and accessories. Caddick, 49, disappeared in November 2020 after federal authorities raided her home as part of an investigation into a $23m Ponzi scheme she had been running. With the notoriety likely to have intensified interest in the items, a number fetched far in excess of their reserve. The most spectacular piece, a Canturi necklace with diamonds surrounding 13 black sapphires, went for $130,000. Caddick originally bought the Stella necklace for $370,000 in 2015. The matching Stella ring sold for $14,000, while the accompanying earrings fetched $7,500. Her 18-carat gold, diamond and emerald Geometric Lace earrings, valued at between $2,500 and $3,400, went for $10,000. Another pair of white gold Canturi Cubism earrings sold for $8,500, despite a starting price of $2,000. A matching bracelet, valued at $7,000, sold for $24,000. Caddick’s artwork, luxury goods and designer clothes have also gone under the hammer with the profits to be returned to her scam victims. Four artworks alone sold for a total of $48,000. Victoria’s First Peoples’ Assembly urges Labor to raise the age Victoria’s First Peoples’ Assembly has urged the re-elected Andrews government to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 ahead of a meeting of the nation’s attorneys general on Friday. Raising the age of criminal responsibility will be on the agenda when attorneys general from federal, state and territory governments meet virtually on Friday. The assembly – the body democratically elected to negotiate an Indigenous treaty framework in Victoria – says the state government is “now on notice” to move on the law reform. The co-chair of the assembly, Geraldine Atkinson, says the reform should not wait for the state’s formal treaty negotiations which are due to kick off next year: I’m bitterly disappointed that there’s been no movement, so the government is now on notice. Our children will not be used as bargaining chips, the reform needs to happen and it needs to happen now ... Ten years old, that’s so young. It’s like a baby to me. Our children need love and a helping hand, not to be thrown into concrete cells. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, this week said his government backed a nationally consistent approach on changing the age of criminal responsibility. The Northern Territory has become the first jurisdiction to raise the age of responsibility from 10 to 12 but Indigenous and legal advocacy groups say it doesn’t go far enough and still locks children in detention. State energy ministers hail capacity mechanism agreement The Queensland energy minister, Mick de Brenni, says the new scheme to underwrite renewables will be the death of “Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison’s CoalKeeper”, and will be sensible market reform resulting in new energy insurance on the grid: This is about prices, because only when the market is dominated by clean, renewable energy will we see wholesale energy prices come down permanently. Secondly, Australia’s renewable energy transformation is our opportunity to bring back manufacturing to Australia. The NSW minister, Matt Kean, thanks Bowen for constructive discussions. He says on coal caps that NSW is not seeking compensation for lost royalties, but financial assistance for families and businesses for doing what needs to be done to lower bills. He says they’re close to landing a deal but will say more tomorrow. After Kean, there’s the Victorian minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, who says the deal signed today will help Victoria meet its renewable energy targets: Victoria has always had a strong view when it comes to the creation of a capacity mechanism. That is it was to have no fossil fuels incentivised for a future that has to be carbon emissions free. Today, I am really pleased we have all agreed on a capacity mechanism that will do just that. Thank you very much, Chris, it has been fantastic working with you today, it will enable us as a state to meet our ambitious renewable energy target. No more coal generation by 2025, but importantly also supporting our nation-leading energy storage targets that we announced back in September. Tomorrow’s national cabinet to discuss power prices, Bowen says Bowen adds there will be more coming out from national cabinet tomorrow, where possible ways to reduce power prices will be discussed. It is no secret we are also engaging with the states. Frankly, particularly with those states with coal production, New South Wales and Queensland, about the right model going forward to ensure the impact of Vladimir Putin’s war does not flow through without a response from Australia’s government on energy prices. The fact of the matter is we have certain powers at the federal level, states have certain powers, and we have been working together to work out how those powers can come together. It is not the fault of Australians our power prices are so high. The cost of production hasn’t gone up. What is happening, because every country around the world, every government is dealing with these challenges, and we are dealing with them as well, and I look forward to further discussions and announcements tomorrow. It is fair to say that governments are working very closely together. After a meeting of energy ministers in Brisbane today, the federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announces an agreement on a “capacity mechanism” he says will be “keeping the lights on”. Bowen says: The capacity mechanism, which we will implement in partnership with the states and territories, will see the commonwealth call options, for bids, for the special renewable energy that the commonwealth will underwrite going forward. This is a sensible, carefully designed mechanism which will unleash investment in clean, dispatchable energy right across Australia. It will firm up our grids, providing extra capacity as more and more power stations leave the power grid, as more and more coal-fired power stations close, we will firm the grid going forward. As we know, in the last decade four megawatts of energy left the system and only one came in. He says there will be more detailed discussion about the design elements but today is a big step forward. I’m delighted with the conversation we had around the table, delighted with the support from state and territory colleagues as always. It is one team working together to get the job done. Environmental law reforms aren’t balanced enough towards business: Coalition After Hanson-Young, there’s the Coalition’s environment spokesperson, Jonathon Duniam. He says he is “very concerned” there isn’t enough balance towards business in the environment package, but notes it is light on detail. At a time when energy prices are going up and you hear all this rhetoric around no new coal and gas, and shutting down certain elements of the economy, that is not good legislative reform. We’ve got to get a balance here, that’s what the minister promised, and I’m concerned that’s not what we’re going to get at the end the process. He mentions he hasn’t had a briefing yet – but will tomorrow. He is also concerned about an independent agency having the powers to make decisions separated from ministers or the parliament. It’s a big problem if you don’t design it properly. I don’t know what the minister has in mind. A number of business groups, individual businesses and other sectoral interests have gone to the minister and suggested she look at a better decision process. A five-year appointment perhaps, this person can only be removed in some the most extreme circumstances. To interpret whatever information they have before them. Again, at the end of the day, will the green groups and others who are opposed to certain elements of economic activity take this to the courts? We have to find balance. It’s what we’ve been promised and I’m looking desperately for it but yet to find it. Environmental law reforms ‘a long time coming’: Greens The Greens’ environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to discuss the government’s announced plans for a federal environmental protection agency and associated law reforms. Hanson-Young says the law reforms are “a long time coming” but the devil will be in the detail as to whether the agency will have teeth to act on putting the environment first. One of the problems we’ve had now is that our environment laws have really been servicing the needs of business and development. Meanwhile our forests, bushland, native animals have suffered. We are now in an extinction crisis, we have to hold that and turn it around, we need to end native forest logging and put a climate trigger in these environment laws to make sure we can put a stop to those damaging, more damaging to loosen from new coal and gas. She said the timeframes outlined today were too long, and the Greens would be using their power with the balance of power in the Senate to push the government further on it. We are not rubber-stamping anything, we will use our power in the parliament to make sure we look to push the government to go faster and stronger. She says the laws need to be strong enough, and enforced, and the agency must be independent, and stresses “the environment is in crisis. We need to go faster sooner”. This is core business for the Greens. We are in the balance of power, we do have clout, and we want to work with the government, we want to work with the government to fix our environment laws and make sure this package delivers for the environment. They are meant to be environment protection laws, not business protection laws. Energy ministers’ meeting extended as capacity plan gets nod The federal, state and territory energy ministers meeting in Brisbane today have added another half hour to their planned five-hour gathering to get through their lengthy agenda. Guardian Australia understands a plan to provide incentives to accelerate the take-up of new storage has got the nod from the ministers. Many jurisdictions now have targets to introduce new batteries and other forms of storage to help stabilise electricity supplies when the proverbial “wind doesn’t blow and sun doesn’t shine”. More shortly, when the ministers turn up for a media conference at 3.30pm local time (4.30pm AEDT). In the meantime, you can follow along here too: Flood-affected tourism operators open for business Flood-affected tourism operators along the Murray River are open for business and want to spread the word to holiday-makers, AAP reports. At Echuca on the Victorian-NSW border, Campaspe Lodge owner David Connally said businesses were facing cancellations and trepidation from tourists. “People are just unsure,” Connally told AAP. “If the media could start to give us some positive press that we are open and it’s all good, that would be great.” The motel owner said road closure notifications were often out-of-date and flood warnings painted a pessimistic picture for tourists. “You’re driving around and the radio station is saying minor flood warnings for Echuca and downstream from Rochester, which is probably accurate as measurement goes, but not accurate by what is happening,” he said. Connally, whose motel overlooks the Campaspe River, said bookings were significantly below typical early summer levels. “We have had cancellations for sure,” he said. “When people Google you they’re like, ‘Oh gee, they’re right next to the river’.” Between October and December, floods in Tasmania, NSW and Victoria have led to $477m in insured losses across 17,200 claims, according to Insurance Council of Australia data. Tourism operators face a third summer without a peak season since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020. A Murray River Tourism Board survey found almost 80% of tourism and accommodation businesses had suffered at least a 40% reduction in bookings for the upcoming high season. Board acting chief executive Will Flamsteed said tourism businesses no longer had the financial buffers to withstand the disaster and one in five had been forced to stand down staff. “As many as two-thirds of tourism businesses in the region have only minor infrastructure damage or were not directly inundated,” Flamsteed said. “But they are severely impacted by the lack of visitors and summer booking cancellations, resulting in an estimated $128m in lost income.” The board and the Victoria Tourism Industry Council welcomed state government assistance to date, but they have called for more support to cover lost income for cancelled bookings and public events, and to drive the industry’s recovery in 2023. “If we want a tourism industry along the Murray next Easter, we need to step up and support these businesses,” council chief executive Felicia Mariani said. Emergency services reported a relatively settled 24-hour period overnight, with 84 requests for assistance, including 55 trees down across Victoria. Emergency Victoria has issued a final flood warning for the Campaspe River downstream of Rochester, where no further flooding is expected. Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus have been detected in mosquito populations in Campaspe, Horsham and Loddon local government areas. The chief health officer has warned people in or travelling to those areas to cover-up, use repellent and remove stagnant water from around the home. A major flood warning remains in place in northeastern parts of Mildura in northwest Victoria. Authorities warn it is not safe to return for residents of Nichols Point, Bruces Bend and surrounding areas. Storms worsening in Queensland Glenn Alderton, the director of Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, told ABC News that they had 40 jobs overnight as a result of mostly wind damage. He said people should prepare for the coming storms this afternoon. It is anywhere from I guess Rockhampton through the Central Highlands and down through the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane, Gold Coast and out through the Lockyer Valley. So anywhere in the area, severe thunderstorms are probable. Just outside of that, some possibility of some severe thunderstorms as well. It is quite a large area. Whether the whole area gets affected or not, we will wait and see, but generally if you are in south-east Queensland, even the Sunshine Coast area, urge you to do some preparation this afternoon should we see them tonight. Calls for Queensland to slash ‘absolute rip-off’ learner’s permit fee Queensland drivers pay more than any other state or territory for a learner’s permit, prompting calls for the government to slash the $186.55 fee, AAP reports. Young drivers are slugged more than seven times the permit cost of other states in what Liberal National leader David Crisafulli labelled an “absolute rip-off”. In comparison, a permit costs $25 in the Northern Territory and $26 in NSW and Victoria. “Queensland learners pay the highest fee in the country by a country mile to get their learners,” Crisafulli told reports on Thursday. “These learner drivers are starting out in life ... the learner’s is a key to opening up a future for a young person. It’s the ability to take a step towards getting your own job and your own independence. “It is time to end this rip-off, and it is time to stop the madness of Queenslanders paying the highest fees in the nation to get their learners.” Crisafulli said Queenslanders were already feeling the pinch as everyday costs spiral out of control. “It’s time this government gave these kids a break,” he said. Transport minister Mark Bailey transport confirmed the costs were being scrutinised. “A review is now under way into all Queensland licence fees, including C class, R and RE class, P class, L class, and others,” Bailey said. However, the minister fell short of promising to lower licence fees, saying “I’ll let the department conduct that review and provide an update to any potential changes to licence fees as soon as possible.” Baggage handlers filmed throwing luggage fired The ABC is reporting two of the baggage handlers who were filmed throwing luggage and slamming bags onto a conveyor belt at Melbourne airport have been fired. The men were employees of Qantas subcontractor Swissport, which Qantas uses to perform “ground handling services” at Melbourne airport. The men were stood down pending an investigation by Swissport, and Qantas would not have allowed them to service Qantas airlines again. Former social services official voiced robodebt concerns with DHS officials [continued from previous post] Whitecross said he had earlier articulated his concerns about the proposal in a meeting with DHS officials including Mark Withnell, who was involved in drafting documents explaining the plan. I felt very strongly about this issue and I wanted to convey the strength of my feelings [about the lack of quality of the proposal],” he said. [Withnell] seemed to be particularly unhappy that I was suggesting we wouldn’t be able to realise the level of savings he’d estimated. I formed the impression there was an attachment at more senior levels to that level of savings. It was that sort of sense that the [$1.2nbn] number was not a number that had come out of a methodology, but that the number itself was a goal of the process. Whitecross assumed Golightly had been among those attached to the plan. He couldn’t comment on whether Campbell was also when asked. But the inquiry heard yesterday the ultimate policy proposal “misrepresented” the nature of the robodebt scheme, apparently paving the way for it to be implemented without legal change. Halbert will give evidence later today while Withnell is scheduled to give evidence tomorrow. The royal commission continues. A former Department of Social Services official has told a royal commission he was “directed” to water down legal concerns about the robodebt scheme when the policy was been designed in early 2015. Andrew Whitecross, a former mid-level official at DSS, had been involved in commenting on what became the initial plan for the robodebt scheme that was briefed to the then social services minister Scott Morrison. The royal commission heard Whitecross and a colleague, Murray Kimber, had fiercely criticised the proposal in January 2015, questioning its legality and fairness as well as the estimated budget savings. But Whitecross said he was told to water down those concerns by his boss, acting deputy secretary, Catherine Halbert, before the feedback was passed onto the Department of Human Services (DHS), which was formulating the plan. Whitecross claimed Halbert had said she had spoken to her counterpart at DHS, Malisa Golightly, who had “expressed her concerns about the strength of DSS’ comments”. “She [Halbert] wanted me to tone down the comments that Murray had provided in his response,” Whitecross said. “I took it as a direction,” Whitecross added. “We had a disagreement in the conversation about that. I believed the policy wasn’t well developed and lacked merit … and we should be fairly forceful in communicating that.” Whitecross subsequently provided new comments that watered down the advice, though his revisions still noted the robodebt plan would need legislative change. Those proposals were sent to Morrison in February 2015 after being finalised by Golightly and the secretary of the department, Kathryn Campbell. [continued] NSW ‘almost ready to sign up’ to coal price cap, Kean says Matt Kean, NSW’s treasurer and energy minister, has told reporters in Brisbane that his state is “almost ready to sign up” to a price cap on black coal. The comments, made as Kean arrived at an energy ministers’ meeting with his federal counterpart Chris Bowen, came a day before the premiers and chief ministers are due to discuss ways to lower energy prices. Guardian Australia understands the coal price cap being discussed is still $125/tonne, with a $12-$14/gigajoule price being discussed at the “first ministers” level. “It’s not about royalties, it’s about consumers,” Kean told the reporters, in comments broadcast by Sky News. “NSW is prepared to take the hit” by not seeking compensation. Such a move would no doubt be welcomed by the Albanese government – if that is indeed NSW’s position. The Queensland government anticipates it will come under pressure to back down on its compensation claims should its southern neighbour offer concessions. Separately, the energy ministers’ meeting remains on track to agree to the next steps for a capacity investment mechanism. That scheme is likely to set up a minimum price to support the acceleration of new batteries and other storage to be added to the grid. Related renewable energy may also get added incentives. Anyway, we’ll get more details at 4pm AEDT (3pm in Queensland) when the energy ministers’ meeting breaks up. Queensland receives funding for plan to use drones to collect patient samples Pathology test times would shorten by up to six hours under a plan for drones to collect samples from hard-to-reach patients in south-east Queensland, AAP reports. The project between Mater Pathology and drone logistics company Swoop Aero has been awarded $1.8m in federal funding to expand operations. Faster deliveries are predicted to slash times for urgent blood samples and other tests at Mater’s Springfield laboratories, with patients on islands off the Queensland coast among those to benefit. The new drone fleet is expected to collect more than 80,000 samples a year. “There’s no doubt that drones can help to improve a range of health services for Queenslanders ... especially those living in remote or hard to access locations,” Mater director of innovation Maree Knight said. The service will cover patients at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Health Service on Stradbroke Island, as well as other patients across Russell Island, Macleay Island, the Redlands and Hope Island on the Gold Coast. Mater general manager Deb Hornsby said it would be the first pathology service in Australia to collect samples with drones. “Drones are safe, reliable and so much faster than ferries and cars, which means we save valuable time in diagnosing and treating vulnerable patients,” she said. The Emerging Aviation Technology Partnerships funding will also provide end-to-end logistics services to the Darling Downs Health and Hospital Service and Pathology Queensland. Infrastructure minister Catherine King said the program will improve health services for regional communities, while also enhancing the capability of Australian businesses to deliver more complex aviation operations. Swoop Aero CEO Eric Peck said the partnership will support “the world’s first and largest fully integrated drone logistics network”. Australia raises concerns with Indonesia after Bali bomb maker’s release The Australian government has sought assurances from the Indonesian government that Bali bomb maker Umar Patek will be subject to ongoing supervision and says his release from prison will “deeply hurt” many Australians. The government also says it has raised concerns about Patek’s release with the Indonesian government numerous times. Patek, 55, was jailed for 20 years in 2012 after being found guilty of mixing bombs that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, in 2002. He was released from prison in Surabaya yesterday morning. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has issued the following statement: Many Australians will be deeply hurt by the release of Umar Patek. Today our thoughts are with the victims and survivors of the Bali bombings and their families. We have registered our concerns about Umar Patek’s release with the Indonesian Government on multiple occasions. Umar Patek’s release is a matter for the Government of Indonesia and its domestic legal processes, but we have sought assurances from the Indonesian Government that he will be subject to ongoing supervision and monitoring, in accordance with Indonesia’s approach to de-radicalisation. Australia condemns acts of terrorism and those who perpetrate violence on innocent victims, and will continue to work closely with the Indonesian Government on counter-terrorism cooperation. Earlier, the minister for home affairs, Clare O’Neil, told the National Press Club it was a “horrible” day for families of the Bali bombing victims. Australians would be feeling aggrieved by the development, she said. With those adorable images of Pocock with baby animals, I bid you adieu and leave you in the excellent hands of Josh Taylor. Pocock supports inclusion of native forestry logging in new environmental laws ABC’s Ros Childs also asked David Pocock about two of the issues that the Australian Conservation Foundation flagged they wanted to see the government go further on – applying the laws to all industries, including native forest logging, as well as the need for a climate trigger to give the minister the option to block fossil fuel projects. Pocock is on the same page as the ACF, saying he would support both. On logging: That was very clear in the Samuel review, we have to ensure that our regional forestry agreements are brought under our environmental laws. It is potentially something that can be done relatively quickly while the big consultation and drafting process happens. I would absolutely support that. There is a whole bunch of species that are now endangered that rely on habitat that could potentially be logged. On a climate trigger: I’m on the record saying that the minister should absolutely have that ability. So many of our endangered species are heat sensitive. You look at something like the greater glider – climate change is and will affect them. The Great Barrier Reef affected by climate change. Graeme in his review, his view was that a climate trigger or that sort of mechanism could be elsewhere. We currently don’t have it elsewhere so it would make sense even in the meantime to include that environmental law while we do the bigger piece of work drafting environmental laws that are fit for purpose. We have to be looking after environment for future generations, Pocock says We brought you the news earlier of David Pocock’s response to the new federal environmental laws, urging the Albanese government to commit enough funds to deliver on the environment minsiter Tanya Plibersek’s promises. In his interview with ABC News, Pocock said committing funds to stop extinction is an investment in the future. It’s a sentiment that was underscored for him at a press conference he held specifically on the occasion of the release of the Samuel Review, which featured baby wombats, possums and humans. Pocock told the ABC: Seeing the way that kids light up when they see our wildlife up close, we have to be looking after it for future generations. We are [only] spending about 15% of what we need to spend to halt extinctions. It’s a bold commitment but it is something that we absolutely should be doing. Nathalia warned to stay indoors as chemical hazard warning issued The town of Nathalia in northern Victoria is being warned to stay indoors after a chemical hazard warning was issued by authorities. ‘We stood up to a bully and we won’: home affairs minister on Medibank hacker O’Neil is asked about the Medibank hacker group’s last upload to the dark web saying it was the final tranche of stolen information. I think the best evidence that we have at the moment is that the hackers have dumped the remaining data and walked away, seeing that they are not going to get payment out of the attempted situation that they tried to create. But one of the most disturbing aspects of these incidents is that once stolen, the data is gone. And this is the same with Optus. However, she goes on to praise the way the nation reacted to the attack: As cybersecurity minister, I felt so proud of how Australia handled that situation. There was data circulating about Australians that was extremely sensitive and hurtful. I did not see any of it printed in newspapers, didn’t see it circulating on social media, and I didn’t see anyone seriously argue that Medibank should have paid the ransom and then we could have all gone off into our fairyland thinking that would solve the problem. From my perspective we stood up to a bully and we won. Guardian Australia’s very own Josh Butler asks about rightwing extremism. Where does this issue rank in terms of threats that you have to address in your portfolio and what work is being done in this area generally and specifically about hate speech and radicalisation online? O’Neil: One of the trends I just referred to earlier is this proliferation of ideologies that are driving people to violence. We see big groups of people who are still on a religious fundamentalism pathway but now a very large group of people who are of interest who subscribe to various forms of rightwing nationalism, Nazism, those sorts of things and it’s obviously enormously concerning. We had the Christchurch bombing which was an Australian committing a heinous act of terror in Christchurch and New Zealand and so this is a problem that I do take very seriously. We are actually looking at the way we think about and manage terrorism in Australia to consider whether it is appropriate for these new forms of terrorism that we are seeing. There was a lot of legislation passed in the second half of the last decade which was very targeted at a specific type of terrorism and some of the elements or features of the criminal law require features that are not present in the way that rightwing groups organise themselves. Mark Dreyfus and I are working together to look at some of those laws and see whether there are legal changes that will be needed to capture violent conduct in the rightwing terror world which perhaps isn’t being caught by what is going on in religious fundamentalism. Albanese government still committed to Redspice cyber security investment Circling back to the national press club address, O’Neil is now taking questions. David Crowe chief political correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age asks: You had some quite alarming figures there on the number of cyber-attacks we are seeing. Can you put, in a budget perspective, because over the last couple of years there has been more money allocated to cyber defence of Australian federal budgets, $9.9bn in this year’s budget. There were projects such as Redspice. Are you banking that money and repurposing it all and putting it toward other functions? Is any money being returned to consolidated revenue or are you keeping the funding being given there to your department over time, and given the scale of the challenge you have outlined, are we going to need to spend more money on this overtime? O’Neil: I’m not in the habit of lavishly praising the former government but one important thing they did was make this Redspice investment run through the Australian signals directorate and important thing for the security of our country and our government is 100% committed to it. We are not spending enough on cyber defence at the moment so one of my challenges is how will we address that problem. One of the elements of this is that it is going to be expensive as securing government infrastructure. We talked a lot and thought a lot in the public sphere in recent months about cybersecurity in the private sector, will have to come at that discussion with a bit of humility because government has its problems as well, so part of the cyber strategy, one of the four goals is to establish how we’re going to lift and fund the security of Australian government infrastructure, and it is going to require more money. Pesutto wants to deliver policies with broad appeal New Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, is now holding a press conference after he was elected by the party room this morning. He says his priorities is improving the Liberal party as an organisation and delivering policies with broad appeal: Organisationally, we will work hard to make sure that we build our membership and our presence across the Victorian community, not just in inner city seats and suburbs but the outer suburbs, the regions and rural areas. We will work hard to make sure we are a strong presence right across our state. On policy, we will take the time that’s available to us to work every day to make sure we present the Victorian people with good constructive alternatives when we face the serious challenges that we have. And as a leader, I will be consultative, and I will work with my colleagues to make sure we push ourselves to be our very best. The review into the Reserve Bank has generated a lot more interest than when it was formally launched after the May election. Let’s say the RBA’s popularity – and that governor Philip Lowe – has been on the slide with each interest rate hike, and of this week we’ve had eight in as many months. The government, which is expecting to receive the review’s final report by March - has today published 78 submissions. (No sign of one from the federal opposition, unless I missed it.) And as part of the data release, the RBA itself has published an 84-page report of its responses to requests for information. There’s a bit to go through but among the perhaps expected points, the bank remains in favour of maintaining its 2%-3% target range for inflation over time. “A higher target has been seen as running the risk that inflation will affect decision-making, as occurred in previous decades in Australia when inflation was higher,” it said. “Changing the target (in either direction) could damage long-term credibility if it were not done in an appropriate way.” Again, they admit the increase in inflation since mid-2021 “has been a very large surprise relative to earlier expectations”. In August 2021, the RBA was forecasting that inflation over 2022 would be 1.75% and it now expects it will be 7¾%. “Other forecasters have recorded similar forecast errors for inflation, with a similar experience across most advanced economies,” it says (not without reason). Submissions and comments about the review have stressed the need to examine the make-up of the board and whether the ratio of votes in favour of the monthly rate decisions should be published (as is the case in some other nations). The bank noted, however, that at “each of its meetings over the past decade the Board has voted in support of the recommendation made by the staff”. In other words, the bank’s own view has carried the day for the past 100-plus meetings (the RBA board meets 11 times a year on rates). As for the media’s view of the RBA, sentiment has been “largely neutral”, except when it wasn’t, and then coverage was “more negative than positive”. The central bank gets about 3000 enquiries a year from the public with about 6% complaints. Odds favour that ratio rising. Something else on the rise are global temperatures. To that end, the bank “has recently created a Climate Analysis &amp; Policy section to bring together climate-related streams of work and created two new dedicated positions”. That’s a section likely to be expanded in the future. O’Neil says Australia needs to stand up for our system of government We cannot allow the global debate to settle into the lazy thinking of equivalency is where somehow or political systems are morally equal. They are not. People should choose their leaders. To me, to us, that is a truism. But democracy is not just a political system, it is a mindset about community, pluralism, tolerance, rationality, choice and freedom. And yet, trust in democracy is in substantial decline in Australia and around the world, and populism and polarisation are on the rise. And we cannot stand by and do nothing. I have had many discussions with global democracy experts over the last months. This is a much admired problem. Many can explain the shapes and contours but no one seems to know what to do and in this, I want Australia to lead the way. What can we do, concretely, about the problems our democracy faces so Australia can be the light on the hill. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, announces two new reviews. The first review will examine national resilience. That will be the home front implications of the climate and security environment Australia faces. The second will focus on the resilience of democracy, which O’Neil says is a national security issue. In our quest to keep Australians safe in the coming decades, our democracy will be our biggest national asset and we need to protect our national asset. And because competitor countries are seeking to undermine our democracy, and we need to fight back. Their intention is to justify authoritarianism by making it look like democracies are inherently dysfunctional, and to weaken countries like ours and constrain us from responding to global events that our adversaries may create. The taskforce will be completed in 2025 and will be undertaken in partnership with University of Canberra’s director of democracy, Prof Mark Evans. O’Neil says foreign interference, misinformation and disinformation are on the rise, and the review will look at what government can do with tech companies to reduce the spread of polarisation and falsehoods. Australians can get pretty down on our democracy. There are good reasons for that and indeed a bit of Australian scepticism in the world of politics is a very, very healthy thing. But politicians like me need to tell a better story about Australia’s world-leading democratic history. We are the sixth oldest democracy in the world. We are the great democratic innovator, the inventor of the secret talent, one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote. We have very high participation in our democracy and a strong and independent Electoral Commission and politicians do their part and respect the results. We have a brilliant independent media which despite its many challenges does a bloody good job. Disaster management needs to be a well practised function of government: O’Neil O’Neil says disaster management under the Albanese government is a centralised, well-coordinated function of the Australian government. It is time for us all to stop feigning shock at supposedly once in a generation floods and fires and storm. The world has witnessed a tenfold increase in the number of natural disasters since the 1960s and this is going to get worse as the world warms further. We need disaster management to be a routine, seamless, well practised function of Australian government so that when multiple disasters strike, government and the community are not completely consumed by them. Australia is the developed country in the world most at risk from the warming climate and the former government’s unwillingness to acknowledge this reality of climate change was flawless, dogmatic and reckless. O’Neil singles out former home affairs minister and current opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for approaching the portfolio he created with “a posture that was reactive to the issues and reactionary and the politics”. It didn’t make us any safer and I would like to change it. We know a lot about their national security environment we are heading into. Almost one million unprocessed visas when Labor came to government: O’Neil O’Neil says when Labor came to government, there were almost one million unprocessed visas waiting while Australia is in the middle of the “biggest labour shortage we have experienced since the second world war”. The result was large numbers of temporary lower-skilled workers were brought in and churned through the labour market and Australia now has a “large underclass of undocumented migrant workers” who are extremely vulnerable to exploitation, she says. That is not what a world-class migration system looks like and it’s completely out of step with Australia’s hugely successful historical focus on migration based on permanency, on citizenship and on fair rates for workers no matter where they come from the determining who should be invited to join us in our national endeavours is one of the most important thing is that the Australian government does and we are going to take a run at fixing it through a big piece of work being led by former secretary of the treasury and prime minister and Martin Parkinson. O’Neil: diaspora communities are best asset in fight against foreign interference On the topic of foreign interference, O’Neil says the former government’s approach was “overpoliticised and frankly a bit xenophobic, and any security expert will tell you that that approach deeply counter-productive for our national security”. She says the “loved and loyal” diaspora communities are the best asset in the fight against foreign interference. My experience in dealing with this problem so far is that for most people who would be targets of foreign interference, albeit that’s all that thought about politicians, community leaders, academics, they desperately want to fight this problem and one of the next phase of a policy response will be to start to open up a bit and focus on arming the people who need to understand this problem with usable information. So we will do that through a program of direct engagement with possible targets of foreign interference to help them understand what foreign interference looks like – how does it present? What does the playbook look like? – so we can help them understand what they can do to protect themselves so they can help us protect our country. Turning to cybersecurity, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, says all businesses and citizens need to change how they engage with the internet. “The truth is, in cybersecurity, we are unnecessarily vulnerable. We did not do the work nationally over the last decade to help us prepare for this national challenge,” she says. O’Neil says it was an “absolute shocker” that the former prime minister, Scott Morrison, abolished the cybersecurity ministry, and points to what the Albanese government has done so far – a new joint taskforce between the AFP and Australian Signals Directorate, and passing new data breach penalty laws. She says she feels for people caught up in the Optus and Medibank data breaches, noting she has family affected by both. O’Neil announces the Albanese government will develop a new cybersecurity strategy: The cybersecurity strategy will help Australia bring the whole nation into the fight to protect our citizens and to protect our economy. It will help us strengthen critical infrastructure and government networks. It will help us build sovereign capabilities in cybersecurity, because this is something Australia must be able to do for itself. And it will help us strengthen our international engagement, so Australia can play a leadership role on the global stage, and work in partnership with our Pacific neighbours to handle cybersecurity across our region. The project will be led by Andy Penn, former Telstra CEO, Rachael Falk, CEO of the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre, and Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld. In addition to this amazing group of Australians, some of the biggest cyber guns from around the world love the scale of our ambition [and] they have agreed to help. Former UK Cyber Security Centre CEO and … Oxford University professor Ciaran Martin will lead a global cyber-expert panel, who will ensure our work really is world-leading. Across government, finance minister Katy Gallagher will work with me on the government-facing aspects of the strategy and assistant minister Tim Watts will lead our international focus. We’ve got the platform, we’ve got the mandate for change, we’ve genuinely now got the best minds on the problem, and now it is time to translate that into a more cybersecure Australia. Treasurer welcomes parliamentary budget office’s report The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has had a look at the report and he has thoughts: While these are not the government’s forecasts, we welcome the report from the independent parliamentary budget office and the contribution it makes to the public debate around the long-term sustainability of our nation’s finances. The report underscores the challenges facing the economy and the budget from high inflation, rising interest rates, an uncertain global environment and mounting structural pressures. Since coming to office, the Albanese government has been upfront about the challenges facing our economy and our budget. After inheriting a trillion dollars in debt and deficits as far as the eye can see, our October budget began the hard yards of fiscal repair by making sensible savings, keeping real spending growth flat and returning more than 90% of revenue upgrades to the bottom line. As a result of our restraint, debt is lower in each year of the forward estimates than under the previous government. We’ve been clear about the structural pressures weighing on the budget, including the five big growing areas of spending – health, the NDIS, aged care, defence, and the cost of servicing the former government’s debt. The government will continue its responsible and disciplined approach to economic management in the May budget and beyond. Which is not exactly an answer, but it is an acknowledgment (if you read between the lines) that someone is going to have to come up with some answers soon. Global security challenges entering Australians’ everyday lives: O’Neil The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, discusses the rise of China, and of the rise of “big state politics” and democracies versus authoritarian regimes. She says Australians are facing the “most dangerous set of strategic circumstances since the second world war: During past periods of intense global competition, the security of Australians wasn’t really affected until we actively joined a conflict. But today, new tools of statecraft are bringing what would otherwise be global security challenges into the everyday lives and homes of our citizens. It’s felt in our economy where we are waking from a cyber slumber, it is felt in our private lives where our identities are under threat and personal information is at risk, it is felt in business and research, with Australia’s hard-won innovations are at constant risk of theft. And it is felt in our democracy, where foreign actors are trying to influence decisions in our parliaments and universities, subjecting Australians to online misinformation and disinformation campaigns which spread like viruses around our communities. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, is speaking at the National Press Club. She says climate change is an increasing national security risk. When Home Affairs was first created, the discussion about climate change in national security was largely academic and, indeed, derided by the former government. Five years on, climate change is a … growing part of Australia’s national security picture. Climate change is creating massive movements of people that may become unmanageable. Already, national disasters are forcing about 21.5 million people each year from their homes. In our region, this, alongside foreseeable food and energy shortages, will be big vulnerabilities that we will need to work with our neighbours to address. Climate change is creating natural disasters at rolling frequency. For affected Australians, these disasters can be life-shattering, and from a security perspective, their management is a hugely consuming task for government and the community, and this in itself is a national security risk. O’Neil says what she is most concerned about is “cascading disasters”. Imagine a future January where we see Black Saturday-sized bushfires in the south-east, a major flood in the north of our country, and then overlay a cyber-attack on a major hospital system on the west coast – government would be fully absorbed in the management of that crisis, and then consider how capable we would be responding to and engaging with a security issue in our region. Parliamentary budget office says costs of climate change becoming increasingly apparent The parliamentary budget office has released its report, Beyond the budget, which looks at the economic conditions Australia is headed into. The PBO is not the government. It is an independent body which uses the Treasury figures and comes to its own conclusions about the numbers. It is used during the election by oppositions to cross-check their budgetary numbers for election commitments, but it also keeps an eye on the forecasts and does a lot of very handy reports looking at the numbers away from government spin. (If you are not already checking out the PBO reports, you should.) This report builds on some previous work the PBO has done, and it includes that Australia’s fiscal position is likely to remain sustainable under most circumstances. Huzzah. BUT. It also points out that the costs of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent and makes the point that Australia’s ageing population is a ticking budgetary timebomb. And most of the revenue increases in 2025/26 are coming from income tax. Which is also not sustainable (although the stage three tax cuts are not the answer, for reasons we have laid out previously in the Guardian). UK releases first coinage of King Charles III The UK has released the first coinage featuring King Charles III into circulation but Australia will not see the new monarch on our money until next year. Across the UK a total of 4.9m 50p coins will be distributed from 9,452 post offices throughout the next month. The coins will be given out as change when customers make purchases and will circulate alongside the Queen’s coins. Australians should expect to see the face of King Charles on their coins “sometime in 2023” the federal government announced back in September. The assistant minister for Treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the face will look left, following the UK – which is a change from the Queen’s face looking right. Leigh said: It will be a remarkable moment when Australia moves from having, not a Queen on the coin, but the King. It is understood the Royal mint will make an announcement about the coins in the coming weeks. Gallagher highlights treatment of some women in Senate estimates Katy Gallagher continued her speech to include the parliament – where she singled out the treatment of some women during senate estimates as an example of where progress still needed to be made. Gallagher said: Whilst estimates is an important scrutiny role to ensure good governance, I don’t believe it should be used as a platform to pursue political campaigns that target individuals – often women outside the parliament, with personal attacks, especially where there is no right for those individuals to reply or defend themselves. I saw several examples of this just in the last round of hearings. And whilst estimates is a robust forum – believe me, I’ve had plenty of robust exchanges there – our behaviour as leaders and standard setters is public and on the record for all to see. We hold privileged and powerful positions. And with that should come great responsibility and the highest levels of personal conduct about how we choose to use that power. Perhaps the codes of conduct for MPs and senators will change and improve some of this behaviour. If not, it’s something the Senate should examine. There is still a long, long way to go on this issue. But at least we are now talking about it at a national leadership level. Gallagher made clear she was “not taking aim at the justice system and this is not a reflection of any one individual case”. Criticisms of women’s experience of the justice system are well documented and understood. The challenge is what can be done about it? If we continue to see women retraumatised by simply trying to seek justice – the hard work to empower women to report cases will be lost. The right to a fair trial is fundamental – as is the presumption of innocence – there’s no argument there. But it is a problem if we are operating in an environment that re-traumatises plaintiffs, victims-survivors and claimants. We have duty to look at our systems and processes. To understand where and why people who may access those systems see them as a deterrent to seeking justice. We have a responsibility to ensure that women feel comfortable and supported to report any act of violence against them. We are clearly not there yet. Katy Gallagher says more protections needed for women in legal system Hello from Canberra! Overnight, the minister for women, Katy Gallagher, reinforced her commitment to help bring about gender equality in Australia. You may have heard some of her comments on ABC radio RN Breakfast yesterday – well, in a speech in Melbourne, Gallagher doubled down, saying Australia had a problem when it came to gender equality and more needed to be done to help protect women in the legal system, as well as through examinations like Senate estimates. You may remember it was senate estimates which kicked off the Christine Holgate affair. Labor was asking the questions then, but it was Scott Morrison who picked up the baton and ran with it, including with his infamous “she can go” speech in the parliament. Gallagher says the whole thing needs a review, including what happens when women speak up. In the legal system and beyond. She said: While increased reporting shows that there is more public awareness avenues and encouragement for women to report, these statistics also show that we are not living up to our responsibility to ensure that when women do speak up. That they are supported. There are too many stories of women who tell us that when they report violence, particularly sexual violence – they feel abandoned, victimised, put in the spotlight. Every day, women around Australia are experiencing sexual violence and seeing the justice system as an extension to their trauma, not a response to it. Brad Battin, who was unsuccessful in this morning’s Liberal leadership ballot, has made a brief statement to media: It’s obviously a tough time when you come out and you do lose in a selection battle. Sometimes they can get quite emotional because the fact that we are all friends within the party room – that might bring some smiles to people’s faces, I know – but the one thing that I committed to at the start of this challenge was to ensure that it was kept clean and my integrity stayed in place. Let me assure you, I walk out of that party room today with my integrity in place. I will back John Pesutto 100%. The party has chosen John Pesutto to move forward and I’ll get behind him. I’m a very proud Liberal. The only message I send to all of my colleagues: Get behind John. Never take the Liberal logo off any of your signs. I don’t care what electorate you’re running. I’m a proud Liberal, I believe in our values, and I believe in our future. Pesutto ‘humbled’ by Victorian Liberal leadership win John Pesutto, flanked by his leadership team, has briefly spoken to media following the party room meeting: We’re very humbled by this result. It means a lot to be given this opportunity by our party colleagues to do the best we can by our party, but more importantly to do the best we can for the people of Victoria. These next four years are going to be really challenging for the people in Victoria and we need a government that is pushed to do its level best. We’ve just had an election, and although that election has sorted out the results, I want to make it clear that the challenges we face as a state remain. We will be a constructive opposition, but we will apply scrutiny when it’s necessary to do so. I’ll have more to say to you in a very short while but I might just confer with my leadership colleagues and we’ll schedule a time in the next few minutes for when we can have a bit more of a conversation with you. The independent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, is speaking to ABC News following the unveiling of new federal environment laws by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek. The legislation will go before parliament next year and the Senate’s support will be crucial to getting the new laws passed. Pocock proved pivotal in getting the government’s industrial reform passed in the last sitting week of parliament. So what does the senator, known for his strong stance on the environment, make of the government’s proposed reforms? I’m yet to read all 60 pages, but it’s a great thing to have an environment minister that is committed to turning things around. Clearly our environmental laws are not working and minister Plibersek has committed to no new extinctions, which is a huge commitment and is going to take reforming environmental law, having an independent agency but then crucially, having the kind of investment in nature, investment in conservation it is necessary to actually deliver on that promise. We have to ensure that the prime minister and cabinet back her on this and provide the sort of investment that is going to be needed every year going forward. Ros Childs: So of what you have seen so far, you would support this in the Senate? Pocock: I will wait for the details – this is a really big piece of work and as the minister said earlier, there isn’t the fine details yet, that will happen over next year – but we have to ensure that we look back on 2023 as a year that we did turn things around when it comes to the environment here in Australia. Price caps to feature at today’s energy ministers meeting in Brisbane Energy ministers began sitting at 10am Queensland time this morning for a scheduled five hours’ chinwag about all things energetic. We expect, among other things, for the federal, state and territory ministers to sign off a plan to provide incentives to accelerate the take-up of new storage in the market. We previewed the event in this piece, in case you need a primer: The form of the incentives such a guaranteed base price remains to be seen, but it does seem the states are advancing some big projects as it is, such as a whopping 4000MW-hour battery being considered for WA, as RenewEconomy reported here. (Back in 2017, the Hornsdale battery in SA was considered big with its 129MW-hour size, although that looks almost titchy now.) While the main horsetrading over a price cap for gas and electricity is likely to sit with the premiers and the prime minister tomorrow, it’s understood the issue will be discussed at today’s gathering. (Probably better to get through the set agenda first in case things get feisty.) FWIW, it looks like electricity is so cheap this morning it’s being given away with renewables supplying well over half the power – and rooftop solar alone generating a quarter of it. Those ample renewable supplies are currently (pun!) generating negative wholesale spot prices across all mainland states in the national electricity market. Looking ahead, we might see some strains on electricity supplies as that huge heatwave builds and bakes northern Australia. (Queensland has the odd electricity shortfall alert for next Tuesday and perhaps more will follow.) Our colleague Cait Kelly details what’s ahead for some remote communities in this piece: We’re already seeing the hottest temperatures so far in this warming season in the southern hemisphere and perhaps we’ll collect a few unwanted heat records before the heatwave ebbs. Flood-damaged roads to cost $3.8bn to fix With the cost of repairing Australia’s flood-damaged roads estimated at about $3.8bn, there are calls for a new approach to road construction, maintenance and funding. The president of the Australian local government association, Linda Scott, says thousands of kilometres of local roads across NSW, Victoria South Australia and Queensland have been severely damaged by recent flooding – with some washed away. The ALGA estimates the damage bill at $3.8bn but Scott says the cost of rebuilding roads to the same standard will only cost more in the long term. She said today: We can’t simply rebuild our local infrastructure – including roads, footpaths and cycleways – to current standards. We need a fundamental shift in the way we fund, deliver and maintain these assets. Councils want an increase in federal roads to recovery funding from $500m to $800m a year to help invest in new technologies and build more resilient roads. - from AAP Queensland SES receive 20 requests for assistance after lightning storms in south-east EPA will be ‘a tough cop on the beat’ operating independently: Plibersek More from the Plibersek press conference. Central to the overhaul of federal environment law is this plan for a federal protection agency, which will shift responsibility from politicians to this legislated body. The environment minister gave more detail about the agency taking questions, saying it is important it will operate independently from the government. One of the reasons that we are establishing it in this way is to make sure that it is transparent, that it is answerable to our democracy; people can see the decisions are being made, and why they are being made, and how they are being made, and have confidence that there is integrity in the system. The details of the design are, again, something that we will continue to work through with stakeholders over coming months. But this is an exciting Australia first and it delivers on an important promise that we made during the election to have a strong independent EPA, a tough cop on the beat that is operating at arm’s length from the government. John Pesutto will lead the Victorian Liberal party after defeating Brad Battin, sources have told Guardian Australia. Pesutto, a former shadow attorney general, narrowly reclaimed the inner east seat of Hawthorn, which he lost at the 2018 state election. He has argued the Liberal party needs to develop attractive policies that have broad appeal if it is to be successful come 2026. He is the Liberal’s fifth leader since Daniel Andrews secured the leadership of the Victorian Labor party in 2010 and it’s the party’s third leadership spill since March last year. Plibersek says understanding can be reached between forestry and conservation We just heard from the Australian Conservation Foundation that the native forestry industry needs to be included in national environmental standards, to protect Australia’s animals and forests. Moving on to questions at that Brisbane press conference, here is Plibersek’s response on the issue of forestry: That is something that we will be working through very closely with stakeholders, with the forestry industry and environmental organisations. We want to have a forestry industry here in Australia. We want a strong and sustainable forestry industry, both because we need the products that are produced and because we need the jobs as well. And we also know that we have some critical areas where there are threatened species and working cooperatively, collaboratively. I am sure that we can come to a common understanding of how we have a strong forestry industry and we better protect our environment, but that is something we will work very closely with the industry on. The New South Wales government will support an Indigenous voice to parliament being enshrined in the constitution. The state Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Franklin, confirmed the Coalition’s position on Thursday after his federal Nationals counterparts last week announced they would not be supporting it. He said: We support in principle enshrining an Aboriginal voice in the Australian constitution. Obviously we want some more information from the federal government about how we work, how it will operate. We know how important it is that Aboriginal voices be heard across the state. We know that it’s critical for Aboriginal voices to be considered at the heart of government and that’s why we’ve expressed our in principal support for a voice to parliament. Franklin said he expected more details to be revealed by the federal government in coming months. He said he had not heard from federal Nationals leader, David Littleproud, since making the announcement, nor would he be asking him to reconsider. I’m not going to comment on the federal National party and the decisions that they’ve made. We’ve made it very clear what our position is. We look forward to having more information about how it will work before we land, of course on our final position when you see all the details, the logistics on the table and then we’ll be able to go forth and continue to consider the issue. Environmental standards must include native forest logging and climate trigger, ACF says The Australian Conservation Foundation has welcomed the environment minister’s announcement. Paul Sinclair from ACF also stepped up to speak at that press conference in Brisbane saying “Australian environmental law is busted and mistrusted … failing to protect our wildlife and the habitats they depend on.” Having a minister willing to fix a broken system is a great thing and we are appreciative of that endeavour. With national environmental standards, we need to see those standards incorporating all sectors, including the native forrest logging sector. For too many years, that sector has been excluded from national environmental laws at great expense to species and some of the world’s greatest forests. We are disappointed that we don’t see reflected today a climate trigger in what is proposed. A climate trigger would assess the damage that is being done by burning coal and gas on the amazing places of Australia – from the Great Barrier Reef in the east to Ningaloo reef in the west to the seagrass meadows in the south and the wetlands in the north. However, Sinclair says he is optimistic these details can be worked through with the potential to create the best environmental law this country has ever had. There is a heap more detail to work through over the next six month. We are really excited and optimistic that together with the minister and stakeholders like the [Business Council of Australia], that we can work together to create a strong, positive national environmental law, the best that this country has ever had. The test of success of that law is going to be the degree to which you can stop the extinction of species like the amazing koala or the black cockatoo. Following the sweeping changes to Indonesia’s criminal code, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has updated its travel advice for Australians travelling to Indonesia. It has warned travellers of the new laws, flagging this includes penalties for cohabitation and sex outside marriage. But noted the laws do not come into force for another three years. It advises Australians to subscribe to the travel advice to stay up to date. The advice said Australians are subject to Indonesia’s local laws and penalties, including those that seem harsh by Australian standards. The overall advice for Australians travelling to Indonesia is to exercise a high degree of caution. However, this encompasses a number of other risks for Australians travelling to Indonesia, including the eruption of Mount Semeru in East Java on 4 December. Indonesia is Australia’s most popular overseas travel destination with more than 1m visits a year. Queensland to focus on urban development, rare-earth minerals and renewables The Queensland environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, steps up at the media conference after Plibersek. Scanlon says Queensland called on the former Morrison government to address the Samuels review recommendations – “not just cherrypick recommendations” – and welcomed the Albanese government releasing the report today “to appropriately respond to recommendations”. She says the Queensland government will be working with the federal government on the recommendation to deliver bio-regional plans. It works like a traffic light system, it looks at a landscape scale how we can protect, restore and allow sustainable development. So it looks at that cumulative impact not just projects one by one, but looks at the whole landscape scale. Looks at where we need to preserve wildlife corridors and where sustainable development can occur while not compromising biodiversity. She says the Queensland government will work with the federal government focusing on three key areas: The first will be around urban development, particularly in the south-east and the other two areas will be around rare-earth minerals as well as renewable energy. When it’s incredibly clear that if we are going to preserve biodiversity that we need to take action on climate change. But we need to make sure that doesn’t compromise on biodiversity. This regional planning is about making sure we can do both. Environment plan will be ‘good news for businesses’ – Plibersek Plibersek says business will be happy with the plan as it will deliver “more certainty, saving time and money with faster clearer decisions”. Regional plans will identify the area that we want to protect, areas that can be fast-tracked for development and areas where development can proceed with caution. Today, I am announcing, that we are kicking off this regional plan in process in partnership with Queensland … Other states are interested as well. That means less red tape, it means easy paperwork, it means less duplication, streamlining and speeding up assessment processes. Our nature positive plan is a win for business and win for the environment. I’m really looking forward to continuing to work with the business community, with environmental groups, with the First Nations people to give better environmental protection and faster decision-making. Pesutto arrives at Liberal leadership ballot Dipping out from Plibersek to head to Victoria … Liberal leadership hopeful John Pesutto has just arrived at parliament ahead of a partyroom meeting, flanked by supporter upper house MP Georgie Crozier. It’s his first time back since 2018, when he unexpectedly lost his seat of Hawthorn to Labor. He told reporters: It’s good to be back. It’s been a long, four years working my way back and I’m humbled and grateful to the people for the endorsement they gave me as the member for Hawthorn. I’m also grateful to all my colleagues for the time they’ve given me over the last couple of weeks … I’m encouraged I’m feeling positive, but it’s really now up to the party room to make a decision. I want to emphasise whatever the decision, we’re all going to get behind it. We’re going to work hard together in a unified way. We’re going to make sure that the Victorian people see an opposition that holds the government to account and that is ready to govern. Nature positive plan will deliver stronger environment laws – Plibersek Plibersek says the government will build legislation on three basic principles: Clear national standards of environmental protection. Improving and speeding up decisions. Building trust and integrity. She says: Our nature positive plan will be better for the environment by delivering stronger laws designed to repair nature, to protect our precious plants and animals and places. For the first time, our laws will introduce standards that decisions must meet. Standards described the environmental outcomes that we are seeking, This will ensure that decisions that are made will protect our threatened species and ecosystems. And of course, a new environment protection agency will make developments decisions and properly enforce them. ‘Environment laws are broken’: Plibersek unveils nature positive plan’ The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, is unveiling the response to the Samuel review right now in Brisbane. Opening her speech, she says: Australia’s environment laws are broken. Prof Graham Samuels’ 2020 review into the environment protection biodiversity conservation act found – and I’m quoting now – the EPBC Act is outdated and requires fundamental reform. Australians do not trust that the act is delivering for the environment, for business or for the community. Nature is being destroyed, businesses are waiting too long for decisions. That is bad for everyone and it has to change. Labor today is delivering on one of our key promises by responding to Prof Samuel’s review and announcing our nature positive plan, better for the environment, better for business. We want an economy that is nature positive to holt destruction and repair nature. The Albanese government has committed to establishing a new environment protection agency with powers to decide whether or not developments proceed and to enforce laws designed to protect and restore nature. Releasing the government’s response to a review of national environmental laws, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, confirmed the government would also introduce new national environmental standards against which conservation, protection and major development applications will be measured. It comes two years after the former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel delivered his review to the former Morrison government. The Coalition never formally responded. Plibersek said revamped environmental laws would set standards that decisions about developments must meet and would “describe the environmental outcomes we want to achieve” to ensure better protection of threatened species and declining ecosystems. She said: Our nature positive plan is a win-win: a win for the environment and a win for business. Our reforms are seeking to turn the tide in this country – from nature destruction to nature repair. The response, released at an event in Brisbane, includes proposed changes to conservation planning – formerly known as recovery planning – and a new three tier system to guide where development can and cannot occur. The government has also proposed applying the new national standards to regional forest agreements, which have been exempt from the current laws and expanding the water trigger – which assesses the impacts of coal and coal seam gas developments on water resources – to include all forms of unconventional gas. However, the government will not establish a long-called for climate trigger and its response did not provide any detail of additional government funding to meet its aims of environmental restoration and zero new extinctions.

The contest is between moderate John Pesutto, who recently reclaimed the inner-city seat of Hawthorn for the party, and Brad Battin, an outer suburban MP who has the support of several conservative in the party. The duo have offered alternative solutions to grow the Liberal’s constituency. Battin said if elected leader he would focus the Liberals’ efforts on “aspirational” voters in Melbourne’s growing outer suburbs and multicultural groups, while Pesutto said the party needed to develop attractive policies that have broad appeal. Former Liberal leader Michael O’Brien, who is believed to be supporting Pesutto, told reporters the party could not afford to sacrifice any areas: No, you win government by gaining the trust of more people, you gain government by building communities of support, not by abandoning communities. It should never happen under any party that wants to be a party of government as opposed to a party of protest. Asked what went wrong at the election, O’Brien said: We didn’t win enough votes, we didn’t connect with enough communities. And clearly, the message we were putting out didn’t resonate with enough people. And I don’t think the people delivering message were trusted by Victorians. Rowville MP Kim Wells described the loss as “embarrassing”. He said he expected Thursday’s ballot to be close. Upper house MP, Matt Bach, believed to be backing Pesutto but told reporters: The party room is like fight club and the first rule about fight club is you don’t talk about fight club. Bev McArthur, Richard Riordan and Ryan Smith, believed to be backing Battin, said the future of the party was bright.

Four emergency flood warnings in place in NSW The New South Wales SES has clocked more than 20,000 requests for assistance since record flooding commenced across inland NSW, almost three months ago. These areas include central western NSW, along the Lachlan River which received more than 3,000 requests (Forbes and Condobolin) and northern NSW, along the Namoi (Wee Waa) and Mehi (Moree) rivers which received more than 1,600 requests. UN biodiversity summit ‘vastly more important’ than Cop27, researchers say Yesterday the Cop15 UN biodiversity summit kicked off in Montreal, and no biggie, but it’s where leading scientists say the “fate of the entire living world” will be determined. The gathering of the world’s nations is “vastly more important than Cop27”, the recent high-profile UN climate meeting, according to researchers. They said: We say this because of the many dimensions of anthropogenic global change … the most critical, complex and challenging is that of biodiversity loss. It comes as closer to home, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, will respond to a review of national environment laws by the former consumer watchdog Graeme Samuel (see Lisa Cox’s earlier post). The report was handed to the Morrison government two years ago but the Coalition never formally responded. You can read the full story on the Cop15 from Guardian’s environment editor, Damian Carrington, here: More than 100,000 lightning strikes in six hours in south-east Queensland The Bureau of Meteorology says it amounted to roughly seven strikes a second, with the risk of severe thunderstorm persisting into the afternoon. Merri-bek council votes to no longer hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January A Melbourne council has voted to abandon holding citizenship ceremonies on 26 January, arguing the national celebration must be “inclusive” to all. In 2017 Merri-bek in Melbourne’s north became the city’s third local council to cease referring to 26 January as Australia Day and stopped holding celebrations on this day. But citizenship ceremonies were still held on this date. On Wednesday night the council passed the motion to stop holding citizenship ceremonies on the national day. But one councillor attempted to overturn the decision, meaning a final position will be reached later this month. The motion will ramp up pressure on the Albanese government to reverse a decision by the former Morrison government that requires local governments to hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January. Queensland senator denies claims in Niki Savva’s book The new book from journalist and commentator Niki Savva, Bulldozed, has made some big revelations about the Morrison government – including that the former prime minister’s close confidante Alex Hawke thought he was “addicted to executive authority” and that Josh Frydenberg was “staggered” by the multiple ministry scandal. But one Coalition member has pushed back on a claim in the book. Queensland senator Susan McDonald has denied reports that she was planning to cross the floor on the then government’s religious discrimination bill earlier this year (which passed the house, but never made it to the Senate after a moderate revolt where several Liberal MPs crossed the floor to oppose it). McDonald claimed in Twitter and Facebook posts that the claim she would have voted against the bill in the Senate was “categorically untrue” and said it was an “important issue”. The new Labor government has pledged to make their own religious discrimination reforms in this term of parliament. Program bringing Pacific workers into aged care homes praised About 100 workers from Fiji and Samoa have gained aged care qualifications in the past year under a pilot program being trialled by the government, ABC’s 7.30 program reported last night. The new program is intended to meet the shortfall in the aged care sector by recruiting workers from Pacific island nations. After the success of the trial, a further 500 workers will be placed in aged care jobs next year. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, praised the scheme: It’s a scheme that fills skills shortages here and it’s a scheme that’s critical to deepening relationship between Australia and the Pacific. On average a worker will send home $15,000 a year, and that’s in a context where more than a third of Pacific Islanders live on less than $1,000 a year. Despite historical problems of exploitation within the broader Pacific Labor Scheme, Conroy says there is “strong” oversight when it comes to this new program: That’s a key focus of the Australian government is lifting the paying conditions for Australian aged care workers. It’s early days with this trial but I am confident we’ve put in place a good system. They have to be paid as Australians do in the job, there’s random audits, the employers are pre-screened and really a strong oversight is put in place. ‘Difficult day’ for Australians after Bali bomb maker release, Marles says The Australian government is seeking assurances from its Indonesian counterparts that a man convicted of making the bombs used in the 2002 Bali terrorist attacks will continue to be monitored after his release from prison. Overnight, Indonesia released Bali bomb maker Umar Patek from prison on parole after serving little more than half his sentence. The attacks killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said the news would bring a “difficult day” for Australians and families who lost loved ones in the Bali bombings. He told ABC radio the government had advocated against Patek’s early release and would urge the Indonesian government to ensure he had “constant surveillance” while on parole. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the development was concerning but the government respected Indonesia’s legal system. He said it was important to keep dialogue open between the two nations, telling ABC News: Indonesians and Australians were killed by these terrible murders, Indonesians and Australians went through this terrible ordeal together. Now we are dealing with the ramifications together, understanding and respecting that Indonesia has their own legal system … [which] does tend to lead to long sentences with early release. – from AAP The Victorian Liberal leadership ballot will be taking place later this morning (around 10am). The contest is between Brad Battin and John Pesutto following Matthew Guy’s stepping down after the party’s election loss. My colleague, Guardian Australia’s Victorian state correspondent, Benita Kolovos, describes the contest on a “knife-edge” with both men confident they will emerge from the ballot successful: The ballot has been described by several Liberal MPs as the “fight for the soul of the party” following its crushing loss at last month’s state election. The Liberal party went to the election hoping to improve its lower house representation after the 2018 “Danslide” but its total number of seats will probably remain unchanged. Its primary vote has also dropped below 30% for the first time since the 1950s and there are fears demographic shifts could see this further deteriorate. Both Battin and Pesutto have argued the Liberal party struggled to articulate its values at the election, though they have offered alternative solutions to grow its constituency. Battin said if elected leader he would focus the Liberals’ efforts on “aspirational” voters in Melbourne’s growing outer suburbs and multicultural groups, while Pesutto said the party needed to develop attractive policies that have broad appeal. Read the full preview here: Australia, US and UK vow to be transparent with Pacific about Aukus Australia, the US and the UK say they will be open and transparent about Aukus, in an apparent bid to answer concerns from some countries in south-east Asia and the Pacific islands. A joint statement issued after a meeting of defence ministers and secretaries at the Pentagon today said the three countries “committed to continued openness and transparency with international partners on Aukus”. They further emphasised that Aukus is a strategic partnership focused on enhancing regional stability and safeguarding a free and open Indo-Pacific where conflicts are resolved peacefully and without coercion. They confirmed that Aukus will complement Aukus partners’ engagement with existing regional architecture, including Asean and the Pacific Islands Forum. A lot of the focus of public debate has been on Australia’s plan to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines, but the Aukus partnership also includes collaboration on advanced technologies. Today’s statement said the Aukus countries wanted to “accelerate near-term delivery of technologies that will meet our militaries’ requirements to enhance capability and increase interoperability”: These include initiatives for advanced trilateral maritime undersea intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and use of each country’s autonomous systems to enhance maritime domain awareness. They further noted the role recent exercises have played in demonstrating and testing advanced capabilities, and approved plans to pursue additional demonstrations of several collaborative initiatives – including hypersonic and autonomous systems – in the 2023-2024 timeframe and beyond. As part of this work on advanced technologies, Australia, the US and the UK plan to intensify targeted engagement with defence industry and academia next year. ‘Expect a big softening of the economy next year,’ treasurer says After the release of GDP figures yesterday, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there were “some really pleasing aspects in yesterday’s national accounts” including wages growth. But he says the figures don’t capture all the pressures, particularly when it comes to the global economy. These global economic challenges aren’t behind us. They’re ahead of us. And our prospects next year will be largely determined by some combination of the war in Ukraine, the Chinese economy what happens in the US to UK and Europe when these interest rate rises bite in our economy because they hit repayments immediately, but they hit the economy sometime after. And also we’ve got to be conscious about the prospects for the weather and natural disasters as well. Do expect a big softening of the economy next year, partly as a consequence of these rate rises, but also because the global economy is slowing considerably as well. Government yet to cap wholesale coal price, but still aiming to land ‘before Christmas’, treasurer says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to ABC Radio. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks him: Has the government resolved to cap the wholesale coal price at $125 a tonne and the gas price at $13 a gigajoule? Chalmers: There hasn’t been a concluded view reached yet, and that’s because this is a challenge of such complexity and such consequence for industry and for Australians around the country, that it needs to be a genuine partnership between governments and that requires all sides to come to the table in a reasonable and a constructive way, which recognises that one level of government can’t fix this all on its own. He says the government is still aiming to “land something before Christmas”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has hailed “great progress” in talks on Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. He also reiterated a pledge to ensure Australia “acquires this capability at the earliest possible date”. This morning Austin joined the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, and the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, at the Pentagon for the first Aukus defence ministerial meeting. The meeting comes a day after annual high-level talks between Australia and the US. Austin told today’s meeting that Australia, the US and the UK’s trilateral security partnership was an “historic endeavour”: The need for Aukus is even clearer today. More than ever, our three countries share of similar outlook on the key challenges and opportunities confronting our world. Aukus will enhance our shared ability to sustain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, and since creating this trilateral security partnership our defense forces, industries, and scientific communities have been hard at work. Over the past 15 months we’ve made great progress toward identifying a pathway for Australia to acquire conventionally armed and nuclear-powered submarines. Today on behalf of President Biden, I want to reaffirm the US commitment to ensuring that Australia acquires this capability at the earliest possible date, and in adherence with the highest nonproliferation standards. Marles told the meeting Aukus reflected “a shared mission between our three countries to work together to pursue advanced military capability, and do so at a time where the strategic circumstances faced by the world are as complex and precarious as really we’ve seen since the end of the second world war”: And central to that is Australia being able to acquire a nuclear-powered, highly capable submarine and we are deeply grateful for the work that we’ve been able to do with both the UK and the US to enable Australia to acquire that capability. And it’s not lost on us the significance of the US and the UK, working together and transferring this technology to Australia. And there has been an enormous amount of work being done by our officials to bring this about, and obviously to bring today about. I think as we talk today, we’re all going to speak to the fact that we’re on track to be able to make this announcement in respect of what will be the optimal pathway for Australia to take in the first part of next year, which is what we have always intended to do. Wallace said the UK would “do everything we can in our capability to help support you, get you that capability, to bring to the best Australia’s skills and its workforce to do so”. Government will not ‘stand by’ as energy companies profit off war: Bowen ABC News Breakfast’s Madeleine Morris asks Chris Bowen more about the truth of those news reports on energy: As you say, it is largely down to the invasion of Ukraine that we have seen this spike in energy prices, as you say. There are other factors as well. If what is being discussed, which is compensation, in some sense to states, but also to fossil fuel companies, as we understand. Why should the taxpayer be compensating fossil fuel companies who haven’t seen their input costs go up, it’s just the prices they can get on the wider international market are going up. Why should we pay for that? Bowen: I have seen lots of stories written about what we have been discussing. Morris: Is that untrue? Bowen: Some of them have had truth to it and some of them haven’t. That is the way of the world. That doesn’t worry me. I will say this: you’re right, it is not acceptable simply for some companies to make massive profits because of the invasion, make profess off a war situation and for other Australian businesses, heavy industries relying strongly on gas and energy costs to pay the price and in some cases have their viability threatened. Governments cannot and will not stand by and let that happen. Energy ministers to discuss ‘capacity mechanism’, Bowen says Chris Bowen is speaking to ABC from Brisbane where he is meeting with the state and territory energy ministers to try to bring down energy prices. He says there is a “spirit of cooperation around the table, recognising that we must work together on these big challenges”. As they attempt to secure an agreement to cap coal and gas prices, he says there are “two processes under way”: Our main job today is to settle something that has been in the too-hard basket for too long, what is called a capacity mechanism to keep the lights on and ensure our transition to renewables happens more quickly and in a more orderly fashion … I will be looking to take that agreement to the next step with my colleagues today. Separately, the prime minister and premiers are meeting tomorrow. … The prime minister will be talking to the premiers, particularly the coal state premiers about sensible interventions and responses. I have read various things in the newspaper, most of which haven’t been accurate about where the discussions are at. They will continue over the next 24 hours because it is our job as governments to work together to ensure that the worst impacts of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on the world energy markets don’t flow through to Australian industries and business without a response. ‘Australians have every right to be disappointed’ but dialogue with Indonesia important, Bowen says While he says “strong representations” from the Australian government are necessary, Chris Bowen does not believe Umar Patek’s early release will have repercussions for our relationship with Indonesia: I think it is important that Australia maintains strong dialogue with Indonesia, so we can have those discussions and that is exactly what we will do. These issues do come up in the relationship, between all countries but particularly between Australia and Indonesia with different legal systems. It is appropriate that the Australian government makes strong representations to the Indonesian government which we have done and will continue to do. Australians have every right to be disappointed and concerned by this news. We understand and respect the differences with the Indonesian system so therefore it is best we just engage in that dialogue with them to ensure all the necessary protections, all possible protections have been put in place. Hello, Natasha May now on deck with you. Indonesian authorities have released the chief bomb maker behind the Bali bombings, Umar Patek, after only serving half his 20 year sentence. It comes despite lobbying from Australia to keep him in jail for his full term. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said his impending release would cause further distress to bomb victims. Authorities deliberately postponed his release until after the bombing anniversary and last month’s G20 summit in Bali. But he has now been released on remission for good behaviour with authorities saying they no longer have the right to detain him as he has fulfilled the conditions for parole. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, is appearing on ABC News Breakfast and asked about the early release: I think all Australians would be concerned about this and the Australian government is concerned about this on their behalf. We have made, as you would expect, appropriate representations to the Indonesian government. Early release is not uncommon in Indonesia. Our particular representations have gone to seeking reassurances that he will continue to be monitored and appropriate protections will be in place. We have made appropriate representations through the normal channels and that dialogue with our friends in Indonesian government will continue. Government likely to consult on threatened species The Albanese government’s approach to developing new national environmental standards is likely to be done in stages. The highest priority standards, such as a standard that would apply to matters of national environmental significance including threatened species and world heritage sites, are expected to be consulted on first. It is also expected Tanya Plibersek’s announcement in Brisbane will outline the government’s proposed timeline for introducing a package of legislation for reform. Regional planning approaches have been discussed as a way to potentially deal with the cumulative environmental impacts of development. The Coalition proposed a shift to regional planning this year and had been considering locations for a pilot project. But its preferred model attracted criticism for being too focused on fast-tracking development in certain areas and not enough on conservation. Documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show the Albanese government has been in talks with the Queensland state government about the potential for a regional plan for south-east Queensland, an area where koala habitat and sites such as the Moreton Bay wetlands are under development pressure. Emails from federal environment officials in July this year state Queensland’s environment department was “keen to explore a regional plan approach for their future planning of SEQ (south-east Queensland)“ and was undertaking “preparatory work” for further discussions with the commonwealth later this year. A note from a meeting in July with the Places You Love Alliance of environment groups states Plibersek was “interested in how regional approaches, offsets, and natural capital markets could reinforce each other”. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, will give the first insight into how the Albanese government plans to rewrite the national environment laws this morning as she makes a major announcement in Brisbane. Plibersek will respond to a review of national environment laws by the former consumer watchdog Graeme Samuel that was handed to the Morrison government two years ago. The Coalition never formally responded. The response will include what the government plans to do on introducing uniform national environmental standards to guide conservation protection and the assessment of major development proposals – a key recommendation of the Samuel review. The minister is also expected to reveal the government’s preferred structure for a new national environment protection agency – an EPA – and to outline a proposal for regional approaches to environmental planning, which would guide where development can and cannot occur. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said the country needed strong national standards and an EPA that was independent, had decision-making powers, and was properly funded. The national campaigns director at the Wilderness Society, Amelia Young, said community appetite for major environmental reform had never been higher. The natural world needs a lot more attention than governments have been giving it and the time to rectify this is now. Infrastructure will be one of the themes of the day, with the federal minister for infrastructure, transport, regional development and local government, Catherine King, due to unveil the revamped Infrastructure Australia body later today. The minister will also attend the Boomtown property and infrastructure summit in Sydney today with the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet. The summit is seeking to promote the development of western Sydney. Amy Remeikis reports: Infrastructure Australia is dead. Long live Infrastructure Australia. The creation of the body by the Rudd government in 2008 forms part of the prime minister, Anthony Albanese’s legacy. Albanese has long had a love of nation-building infrastructure projects, and Infrastructure Australia was designed while he was in the portfolio, as a way of identifying and fast-tracking projects which would add value, help future-proof communities, or provide missing links within existing infrastructure frameworks. At the time, Albanese described it as “replacing neglect, buck-passing, and pork-barrelling with long-term planning where governments predict and anticipate infrastructure needs and demands, not merely react to them”. But the body set up to help identify and see through nation-building projects became increasingly sidelined, an independent review ordered by the new Albanese government found, and was seen as “reactive” rather than proactive. That has led to projects languishing, or the states moving forward without all the pieces. One of the first acts of the Albanese government was to review Infrastructure Australia. King had signalled an overhaul would be a priority of a Labor government ahead of the election, after former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce appointed the retiring mayor of Tamworth to chair the body. The review having been returned, King will unveil the revamped IA at an event later on Thursday. The government plans on overhauling the body, giving it a clear and legislated mandate, which will define its responsibilities and role, as well as shift from an advisory body governed by committee, to a new governance model. Good morning and welcome to our live blog. Natasha May will be along soon to take you through the day but before then here are a couple of stories making news overnight. The Australian Medical Association has blasted “weak political leadership” for what it sees as the premature relaxation of anti-Covid measures, saying that the health system is “not prepared” to deal with long-term issues stemming from the pandemic. The peak doctors’ body is so concerned about the lingering impact of long Covid on the population and the health system that it thinks governments should reconsider mask mandates to address the problem. One expert thinks long Covid could affect as many as 1 million Australians by next year. Australia’s energy ministers are expected to sign off on a scheme to accelerate the take-up of giant batteries to support the decarbonisation of the grid when they gather in Brisbane today but are unlikely to make a decision on any Albanese government proposal to impose price caps on coal and gas. There were reports last night that the government was pushing the states to cap the price of coal at $125 a tonne, less than half the market rate, but Guardian Australia understands no decision is expected before Friday’s national meeting between the prime minister, premiers and chief ministers. Also today the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, is due to make a major announcement on new national environmental standards, which will include Australia’s own environment protection agency. It is in response to a review of national laws that was handed to the Morrison government two years ago. Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will use a speech in Washington today to urge China to embrace US plans to prevent growing tensions from spiralling into war, while rejecting claims that Australia’s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines is driving a regional arms race. She will urge China to take up a US offer to put in place “guardrails” to prevent growing tensions from spiralling into war and suggest both sides learn from diplomacy spurred by the Cuban missile crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/08/qatar-gas-output-increase-catastrophic-global-heating-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"Qatar’s gas output increase could cause catastrophic global heating, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/08/qatar-gas-output-increase-catastrophic-global-heating-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/08/qatar-gas-output-increase-catastrophic-global-heating-report","fields":{"headline":"Qatar’s gas output increase could cause catastrophic global heating, report says","bodyText":"Qatar’s longest-lasting legacy following the World Cup won’t be football or even its human rights record – it will be the climate crisis, according to a new report warning that its huge expansion of gas extraction could push the planet into catastrophic global heating. Should Qatar exploit all of its oil and gas reserves it will eventually add an enormous 50bn metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere once burned, which is more than the entire annual emissions of the whole world, the new research, shared with the Guardian, has found. This vast output of emissions will in itself push the world beyond the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C of global heating beyond industrial times, beyond which scientists warn there will be increasingly disastrous impacts from heatwaves, droughts, floods and biodiversity die-offs. QatarEnergy, the state-owned petroleum operation that is overseeing a huge escalation in the country’s oil and gas output, is a sponsor of the World Cup currently under way in Qatar. Fifa, which has been accused of falsely claiming the World Cup will be carbon neutral, has featured QatarEnergy in sponsorship slots in stadiums and online even as the global football body launched a campaign called #SavethePlanet in which it warned the climate crisis “threatens the essential ingredients of good health” and causes “increasing destructiveness of extreme weather events”. Qatar’s vast oil and gas resources have greatly enriched the small Middle Eastern country, which this year became the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (or LNG), superseding the US and Australia. It is now looking to further cement its position by ramping up production from a vast offshore gas deposit called the north field, which will account for 70% of the emissions growth according to the new report by BankTrack, an NGO that used data from BP to ascertain the extent of Qatar’s “carbon bomb” projects. The emissions from Qatar’s oil and gas resources will cause $20tn in damages and 11m deaths around the world, BankTrack said, citing calculations based upon recent research looking at the economic and mortal cost of fossil fuels. QatarEnergy has signed recent partnership deals with western oil giants including Shell, Total, ConocoPhilips, Exxon and Eni in order to boost output of the north field by 60% over the next five years. Separate deals have been struck in the past month with Germany and China to provide the countries with gas amid concerns over supplies disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, Qatar’s energy minister and chief executive of QatarEnergy, said last month Qatar will “provide reliable and credible LNG supply solutions to customers across the globe”. No new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid breaching the 1.5C limit, the International Energy Agency has warned, but despite this there has been plenty of financial support for Qatar’s gas expansion. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, MUFG, Credit Suisse and Bank of America have all backed planned projects in the north field, providing nearly $12bn in bond underwriting services to QatarEnergy. “There’s a massive amount of emissions about to come from oil and gas taken from Qatar, although there hasn’t been much attention to it until now,” said Henrieke Butijn, climate campaigner and researcher at BankTrack. “What’s happening in Qatar is awful in terms of these projects and also worker conditions, but there is a level of hypocrisy here because Qatar isn’t acting alone. “Fifa selected Qatar for the World Cup and chose QatarEnergy as one of the main sponsors, even while they push their own climate campaign. And banks which have made net zero emissions commitments all know what they are doing when they are underwriting QatarEnergy. These banks need to cut off any finance that isn’t aligned with the 1.5C goal.” At the recent UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, the world’s governments again committed to keeping below 1.5C, although emissions reduction pledges currently fall drastically short of meeting this target. While wind and solar energy deployment is growing rapidly – clean energy is set to overtake coal as an energy source globally by 2025 – the world is still teeing up vast quantities of fossil fuels that would push societies into climate meltdown should they be burned. A huge 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gas emissions will be emitted if governments allow identified reserves of coal, oil and gas to be extracted and used, a recent released in September found. Qatar’s 50bn tons of emissions will occur if it allows all of its deposits to be burned. While this may not happen if other countries move decisively away from fossil fuels as an energy source, there is currently no commitment from Qatar that it won’t completely exhaust its reserves. In previous years there have been claims Qatar’s gas reserves could last more than 130 years. QatarEnergy was contacted for comment on the research. On its website, the state-owned body states that the climate crisis is “one of the most critical issues of our times and requires prompt and dedicated action at a global scale”. “Fossil fuels are weapons of mass destruction, carbon bombs ticking against the time we have left to avert the very worst of the climate crisis,” said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International. “Fossil fuel companies, the banks that fund them and the governments that support them are complicit in the suffering of millions. It is time to strip them off their social and economic licenses and make them pay up for climate damages.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/06/government-will-not-intervene-to-help-famers-with-rising-food-prices-therese-coffey-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T20:09:49Z","webTitle":"Thérèse Coffey rules out help for farmers and consumers facing higher costs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/06/government-will-not-intervene-to-help-famers-with-rising-food-prices-therese-coffey-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/06/government-will-not-intervene-to-help-famers-with-rising-food-prices-therese-coffey-says","fields":{"headline":"Thérèse Coffey rules out help for farmers and consumers facing higher costs","bodyText":"The government has ruled out making any intervention in the market to help farmers or consumers with high food prices, the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, has said. Food prices have soared in the past year, in part owing to higher input prices such as energy, fertiliser and animal feed. Last month, food price inflation hit a fresh high of 12.4%, with poorer households hit hardest. Farmers have also complained that supermarkets are driving down the prices they pay to producers at the farmgate, leaving them making tiny profits. A report published last week by the food charity Sustain found farmers made less than a tenth of a penny in profit from a supermarket loaf selling to consumers for £1.14, and just a penny in profit from a £2.50 block of mild cheddar cheese. But Coffey, secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs since Rishi Sunak took office in September, refused to criticise supermarkets and said the government would not be taking action. “I am not going to be particularly critical of supermarkets – overall, having a competitive supermarket environment has done a lot to help consumers,” she told the environment food and rural affairs committee of MPs on Tuesday afternoon. “I don’t think we are at the stage of a market intervention directly when it comes to pricing.” She acknowledged the growing demand for food banks around the country, and pointed to steps such as the forthcoming increase in benefits and measures to reduce energy bills, but declined to promise any further support. She said: “It is not the role of government to provide free food.” In her first grilling by MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee since taking up the post, she also said she was “very disappointed by the water companies” and acknowledged concern over sewage flows into waterways. She said water company bosses were being summoned to account for their actions next week, and that they would be subject to more monitoring and would have to submit “real-time data”. She stopped short of promising to crack down on sewage flows into rivers and beaches. Coffey did, however, give comfort to those hoping for an expansion of renewable energy across the UK countryside. She moved away from the position adopted by Sunak in his leadership campaign, when he rejected solar farms on UK agricultural land, and said a government review of land use to be published in the first half of next year would take a “balanced” view. She told the committee that land graded 3b for agricultural use – judged to be moderate quality, capable of producing cereals and grass – could be used for solar farms. She said: “I’m not suggesting by default I want to put solar over every bit of 3b land. I think we do need to get that careful balance across that and make the best use of land. I’m more inclined about brownfield sites and certainly thinking through how farms and others can do a lot more self-energy production. I’m already conscious there are challenges about connecting to the grid.” She added: “But undoubtedly, you know, we have 14 gigawatts of solar now. Right now, the ambition within the energy security strategy is to raise it up to 70 gigawatts.” The farming minister, Mark Spencer, confirmed the government was not going to ban solar farms from 3b land. He told the Guardian: “I believe Beis [the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy] and Defra are looking together at this, how we best use land and a land use framework is coming. But I am not in favour of a broad brush approach. “We shouldn’t be stopping farmers who want to diversify their income from doing that as that would be harmful so I’d have no problem with them putting some solar panels down on 3b land. But we can’t then have thousands and thousands of acres taken away that could otherwise be used for food production. It has to be a balance.” Dustin Benton, policy analyst at environmental think tank Green Alliance, welcomed the apparent shift in the government’s stance. “It’s refreshing to see ministers hint at a practical approach to making solar and farming work together,” he told the Guardian. “We know that putting solar panels on cropland or grazing land while continuing to grow food reduces yields by just eight per cent, and can even increase yields in hot and dry summers. The government needs to focus on helping farmers to make the most of their land, including where their land is best used for clean energy or for nature.” The solar industry also welcomed the move. “It will be a great relief to the solar industry to hear that Thérèse Coffey supports existing planning rules, which have successfully encouraged development away from the best quality agricultural land while recognising the critical need to expand solar farms in response to the climate and energy price crisis,” said Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK. “This looks like a significant shift from the anti-solar rhetoric of her predecessor,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/nov/30/thurrock-council-repeatedly-ignored-warnings-of-risks-to-public-money","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T18:59:17Z","webTitle":"Thurrock council ignored bankruptcy warnings and took ‘unprecedented risks’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/30/thurrock-council-repeatedly-ignored-warnings-of-risks-to-public-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/nov/30/thurrock-council-repeatedly-ignored-warnings-of-risks-to-public-money","fields":{"headline":"Thurrock council ignored bankruptcy warnings and took ‘unprecedented risks’","bodyText":"The Tory-led Thurrock council, which is on the brink of bankruptcy after losing hundreds of millions of pounds on failed commercial investments, repeatedly ignored warnings from financial experts over the “unprecedented risks” it was taking with public money, it has emerged. According to documents obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), Thurrock’s top finance official failed to act despite being cautioned about the scale, speed and risky nature of the council’s investments. According to the BIJ, Sean Clark, the corporate director of resources at Thurrock council, was the senior official behind a string of business deals in which it borrowed £1bn – several times its annual spending on local services – to invest in bonds linked to solar energy and other businesses. They included £655m invested in a solar farms company, Toucan Holdings 1, which went into administration this month, and £94m in Just Loans Group plc, a business lender which went bust in June. These two deals alone have left the council exposed to potential losses of up to £250m. Thurrock admitted on Tuesday that it faces a near £500m budget deficit this year – thought to be the biggest of its kind seen in local government – after writing off £275m on deals that went sour and setting aside a further £130m to pay back investments debts. The council has been forced to go cap in hand to the government for a bailout to keep it afloat and has warned it may have to drastically cut services and jobs, sell off assets and raise council tax as it attempts to recover from what opposition politicians called the “catastrophic handling” of its affairs in recent years. Clark, who earned £130,000 a year, was suspended on full pay from his role in September after the government sent in commissioners to take over the running of the council’s finances amid ministerial concerns over the “the exceptional level of financial risk and debt incurred”. According to the BIJ, Clark was personally warned in March 2018 by the council’s financial advisers Arlingclose of its urgent concerns regarding the council’s “extreme” appetite for risk. Arlingclose said in a letter it felt this was a level of risk “well beyond” all of its other clients, even those who had adopted relatively aggressive strategies. “The scale, risks and speed of implementation of the council’s activities which are based around a significant ‘borrow to invest’ strategy is of particular concern to us,” the letter said. It highlighted risk areas including £370m invested in unrated bonds, high levels of debt and “huge exposure” to local authority funding. The letter continued: “The council’s activities could be viewed as going well beyond what is prudent even though, we appreciate, the pressure to adopt more commercial practices within the significant financial and political issues exists within local government and at Thurrock in particular.” Clark subsequently terminated the council’s relationship with Arlingclose. Separately, an internal report into Clark’s conduct, leaked to the BIJ, alleges he failed to act upon Arlingclose’s concerns, or properly advise other senior figures, including senior councillors, of the risks associated with the investment strategy. The report referred to a “systematically lax” culture of due diligence on investments under Clark. “Evidence indicates that the quality of governance in place for a £1bn investment programme was inadequate and the scale of the delegated authority was too great.” Clark did not respond to requests from the Guardian for comment. Thurrock council said it did not comment publicly on internal employment matters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/nov/29/thurrock-council-admits-disastrous-investments-caused-500m-deficit","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T20:18:58Z","webTitle":"Thurrock council admits disastrous investments caused £500m deficit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/29/thurrock-council-admits-disastrous-investments-caused-500m-deficit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/nov/29/thurrock-council-admits-disastrous-investments-caused-500m-deficit","fields":{"headline":"Thurrock council admits disastrous investments caused £500m deficit","bodyText":"A Tory-led council has admitted a series of disastrous investments in risky commercial projects caused it to run up an unprecedented deficit of nearly £500m and brought it to the brink of bankruptcy. The staggering scale of the catastrophe at Thurrock council in Essex – one of the biggest ever financial disasters in local government – is contained in a report made to the council’s cabinet, which reveals it has lost £275m on investments it made in solar energy and other businesses, and has set aside a further £130m this year to pay back investment debts. Thurrock has appealed to the government for an emergency financial bailout and warned that it will have to push through a drastic programme of cuts to local services and staff redundancies, along with a probable fire sale of buildings, land and other assets as it attempts to stay afloat. Council tax rises are also likely. There was astonishment in the wider local government world at the scale of the financial disaster. “What we are seeing in Thurrock is shocking and unprecedented. I have not seen anything like this in my 30-year career in local government,” said Rob Whiteman, the chief executive of Cipfa, the public sector accountants body. Thurrock had become one of the most indebted of all English local authorities in recent years after borrowing £1.5bn – 10 times its annual spending on local services – to enable a string of investments in solar energy and other businesses. Three years of investigations by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) have helped force Thurrock to reveal the full scale of its investments, including hundreds of millions lent to companies owned by businessman Liam Kavanagh to invest in 53 solar farms. According to the BIJ, Thurrock invested £655m in Kavanagh’s companies, and expects to lose £188m on the deal. It also expects to make a £65m loss on its investment in a company called the Just Loans Group, which went bust in June, and millions more on a series of other deals that turned sour. In common with many other councils Thurrock attempted to offset the effects of years of austerity cuts to its funding by borrowing cheaply from the Treasury and investing in commercial business in the hope this would provide an alternative income stream. By 2019, English councils had borrowed over £6bn for this purpose. Concerns over Thurrock’s exposure to risky commercial investments led a panicked government to send in a team of commissioners to run its finances in September. The cabinet report reveals Thurrock’s finances are now in a significantly far worse state than originally thought just a few weeks ago – and could get even worse. The report predicts a further black hole in its budget of £185m in 2023-24, suggesting that it may have to declare effective bankruptcy. Three councils, Croydon, Slough and Northamptonshire, have gone insolvent in recent years, the former two after running up huge debts on borrowing. “This is a grave position and at this point the council cannot find a way to finance their expenditure in-year and is unlikely to achieve a balanced budget for 2023-24 without external support,” the report says. The council’s Conservative leader, Mark Coxshall, issued a statement saying that services would continue to operate as normal for now and staff would continue to be paid. But he also warned that there would be “extremely difficult decisions to come” in what he called “uncertain and unsettling times”. He added: “These are shocking numbers but the first stage to creating a good plan for recovery is to understand the full extent of the problem. I know that Thurrock residents will be concerned, and rightly so, about what this means for local services. Please rest assured that this report is the first stage of planning for our recovery.” John Kent, the leader of Thurrock council’s Labour opposition, said Thurrock residents will be paying the price for the Conservatives’ catastrophic handling of the council’s affairs for decades. “This report lays bare the culmination of six years of Conservative leadership of Thurrock council,” he said. “Just what were those Conservative councillors who make up the council’s cabinet doing? Are we really expected to believe they didn’t notice what was going on under their very noses? “The Tory cabinet are absolutely complicit in this scandal and with every new revelation their position becomes even more indefensible.” • This article was amended on 30 November 2022 to remove a reference to the Thurrock council report as being “internal”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/29/evidence-grows-of-forced-labour-and-slavery-in-production-of-solar-panels-wind-turbines","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T21:37:05Z","webTitle":"Evidence grows of forced labour and slavery in production of solar panels, wind turbines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/29/evidence-grows-of-forced-labour-and-slavery-in-production-of-solar-panels-wind-turbines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/29/evidence-grows-of-forced-labour-and-slavery-in-production-of-solar-panels-wind-turbines","fields":{"headline":"Evidence grows of forced labour and slavery in production of solar panels, wind turbines","bodyText":"The Australian clean energy industry has warned of growing evidence linking renewable energy supply chains to modern slavery, and urged companies and governments to act to eliminate it. A report by the Clean Energy Council, representing renewable energy companies and solar installers, has called for more local renewable energy production and manufacturing and a “certificate of origin” scheme to counter concerns about slave labour in mineral extraction and manufacturing in China, Africa and South America. Released on Tuesday, the paper said slavery in all supply chains was a global problem. But Australia is on a trajectory towards generating the vast majority of its electricity from solar, wind, hydro and batteries by 2030 and needs to play an active role in addressing it in renewable energy industries. “We’re at a moment in time when renewable energy supply chains are going to be scaling up significantly,” Dr Nick Aberle, the Clean Energy Council’s energy generation and storage policy director, said. “That means now is a critical opportunity to shape the future direction of those supply chains.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report cited detailed allegations of forced labour and slavery in supply chains for solar and wind energy and battery storage. Examples included that: About 2.6 million Uyghur and Kazakh people have been subjected to coercion, “re-education programs” and internment in the Xinjiang region of north-west China, which is the source of 40-45% of the world’s solar-grade polysilicon. A report by the United Nations office of the high commissioner for human rights three months ago found Xinjiang was home to “serious human rights violations”, and the US has listed polysilicon from China as a material likely to have been produced by child or forced labour. On batteries, there were major issues with the mining of between 15% and 30% of the world’s cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Amnesty International found that children, some as young as seven, were working in artisanal cobalt mines, often for less than $2 a day. Mining conditions were reportedly hazardous, and workers often did not have adequate protective equipment and were exposed to toxic dust that contributed to hard metal lung disease. On wind energy, there had been rapid growth in demand for balsa wood used in turbine blades that had reportedly led to workers in Ecuador’s Amazon region being subject to substandard labour conditions, including payment being made with alcohol or drugs. The demand for balsa has also reportedly increased deforestation, and affected the land rights of Indigenous people in Peru. Some balsa wood suppliers have more recently provided Forest Stewardship Council certifications, which verifies responsible forest management and fair wages and work environments. NSW’s anti-slavery commissioner, Dr James Cockayne, said urgent action was needed to address “the severe modern slavery risks in Australian renewable energy supply chains and investments”. “We need to see industry, government, the financial sector and civil society working together to provide access to competitively costed, slavery-free renewable energy,” he said. “If we don’t, modern slavery risks significantly complicating the just transition to a decarbonised economy.” Aberle said the government should create a taskforce of government, industry and civil society representatives to develop a plan to ensure Australia’s clean energy supply chain was “reliable, cost effective and slavery free”. He said strategies that should be explored included whether to establish domestic supply chain capabilities and how to improve “traceability and detectability” within existing supply chains. The report, compiled with the consultants from Norton Rose Fulbright, cited the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which came into force earlier this year and created a presumption that any products made in Xinjiang were linked to modern slavery and could not be imported into the US unless an importer provided “clear and compelling evidence” that there was no slavery in a product’s supply chain. It said a globally recognised certificate of origin scheme would be complex but was “imperative to achieving landmark change”. Existing examples of work in this area included a solar stewardship initiative launched in September 2022 and a global battery alliance that was developing a “battery passport” system to improve traceability. The Australian and US governments earlier this year said they wanted to break their near-complete reliance on China for clean energy and critical mineral supply chains, citing evidence the country was responsible for about 80% of solar energy technology manufacturing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T04:32:39Z","webTitle":"Queensland windfarm to provide enough power for 1.4m homes with new $2bn investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","fields":{"headline":"Queensland windfarm to provide enough power for 1.4m homes with new $2bn investment","bodyText":"One of Australia’s biggest windfarms will double its capacity to 2,000 megawatts, providing enough power for 1.4m homes and accelerating Queensland’s exit from fossil fuel-sourced electricity. Spain-based Acciona Energia announced on Monday it would extend a windfarm already being built within the MacIntyre Precinct, a region about 200km south-west of Brisbane. That first stage involves just under $2bn in investment and the construction of 180 wind turbines, each standing about 230m high with 5.7MW of capacity. The MacIntyre region is being developed in partnership with CleanCo, the Queensland government’s renewable energy arm, and has an expected start date in 2024. “With this project we expect to dramatically accelerate the decarbonisation of Queensland’s electricity grid,” said Acciona’s managing director in Australia, Brett Wickham. “Workers can move from one large-scale project to the next whilst staying in the same area.” The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the expansion plan was “a strong endorsement that Queensland is a renewable energy superpower”. Two months ago, Queensland announced a $62bn plan to accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, including an end to coal-fired power stations by as early as 2035. Up until then, the state had been the national laggard in terms of the share of renewable energy in the grid. The announcement of another $2bn to be pumped into renewables comes days after the Clean Energy Council said new commitment for large wind and solar plants had hit the lowest level in at least five years in the September quarter. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Just one new project, at 400MW, reached financial close during the period, down almost two-thirds on a year earlier. The council blamed policy uncertainty in recent years – particularly at the federal level – for the investment slowdown. Known as the Herries Range project, Acciona’s extension would also host 180 wind turbines and support as many as 600 additional jobs during construction, the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said. The state’s energy and jobs plan boasts more than 50 large-scale renewable energy projects that are operational, under construction or have reached financial commitment from developers, the government said. Prior to Monday’s announcement, New South Wales had signed up the most new projects and capacity over the past year, with eight projects accounting for more than a third of new projects and 65% of new capacity nationally, according to the Clean Energy Council. Victoria had the next most with six new projects accounting for 19% of new capacity, while Queensland had six projects (at 6% of capacity) and WA with three projects (and 4% of capacity). Acciona’s focus on windfarms rather than solar may be a template for other big energy companies. AGL Energy, for instance, has plans to invest as much as $20bn over the next decade or so into renewables and storage as its coal-fired power plants close. Its focus is likely to be on wind rather than solar energy because of the need to complement rather than compete with the spread of solar panels on households across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/27/new-berlin-art-museum-of-the-20th-century-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T13:50:26Z","webTitle":"Criticism mounts of ‘climate killer’ modern art museum in Berlin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/new-berlin-art-museum-of-the-20th-century-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/27/new-berlin-art-museum-of-the-20th-century-climate","fields":{"headline":"Criticism mounts of ‘climate killer’ modern art museum in Berlin","bodyText":"A vast modern art museum under construction in Berlin has been castigated by conservation experts and architecture critics for its poor environmental credentials, as the energy crisis intensifies scrutiny of the efficiency of new buildings. The Museum of the 20th Century, designed by the Swiss star architects Herzog and de Meuron, is intended to propel the German capital into the top tier of world cities for modern art, competing with New York’s Moma and London’s Tate Modern. Variously nicknamed “the barn” and “the beer tent” due to its sprawling A-frame shape and low-hanging roof, the museum was hailed as a “building of the future” when its plans were first made public. However, in recent months there has been growing criticism of its main construction material, concrete – one of the highest contributors to carbon dioxide emissions – and of its open and transparent internal structure, which will require a highly sophisticated ventilation system to maintain temperature and humidity levels. Stefan Simon, a leading expert in conservation science and proponent of “ecological museums”, has called the museum a “climate killer”, a “structural nightmare” in regards to its upkeep and running costs, and a big “step in the wrong direction” that will fail by a considerable margin to meet the EU’s climate neutrality goals. He estimates the museum will be several times less energy efficient than many old museums in Berlin, using 450 kilowatt hours of energy per sq metre a year – about four times the amount required by the similarly prominent Altes Museum, built in 1830 to house classical antiquities. Simon’s criticism is all the more damaging given that he works at an institute within the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation under whose auspices the project is taking place. The building’s energy inefficiency has been known about for some time, but has been brought into focus by the soaring consumer and business bills resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. The estimated cost of the building had already prompted controversy, having already doubled from €179m (£155m) to €450m. The federal audit office has declared the project to be “overpriced and unecological” and has called for a more sustainable design, arguing that as a building financed from taxpayers’ money, the museum’s creators have a specific duty to set an example. Nikolaus Bernau, a leading architecture critic, called the building a disaster from both an ecological and economic viewpoint. “Ecologically speaking the whole thing is an absolute disaster beyond all expectations, largely due to the fact that it is completely air permeable … leading to very large streams of air, which have to be either cooled or warmed, depending on whether it’s summer or winter,” he told the Deutschlandfunk Kultur radio station. Ventilation costs involving heating or cooling air would be “immense”, he added. Herzog &amp; Meuron have said little about the project, other than to comment that the escalation in costs had much to do with the need to dig deeper into Berlin’s marshy ground to increase the building’s volume after the museum’s surface area was seen to encroach too much on the adjacent St Matthäus church. Jacques Herzog has referred to “its truly massive rooms”, and the technical challenges they bring with them, as having added to the cost. The architects have argued that the building’s facades have been designed to protect the artworks from direct sunlight. In response to the criticism, Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, has granted the prestige project an extra €10m out of this year’s budget in order to tackle its deficiencies. The culture minister, Claudia Roth, has asked for the design to be revamped, with less concrete used and sustainable measures employed such as rainwater collection and solar energy panels introduced. Experts have dismissed her suggestions as insufficient and at best cosmetic. She has predicted the building, which will hold works by artists including Gerhard Richter, Joseph Beuys and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, will become “the coolest museum in the city” though recently admitted it currently “does not have such a good image”. Roth has been cautious about criticising her predecessor Monika Grütters, a Christian Democrat, who was a leading figure behind the project’s launch. But as a leading Green party member her reputation is arguably on the line if she fails to address the chaos. In a recent opinion piece for Die Zeit, Tobias Timm, an expert on the German-speaking art world, led calls for Roth to halt the project temporarily, at least during the energy crisis. He suggested that climate protesters who had in recent months glued themselves to works in German galleries and elsewhere in the hope of drawing attention to the environmental crisis should pay more attention to “CO2 generator” museums such as Berlin’s modern art gallery. The building, part of a major revamp of Berlin’s museum landscape, has been under discussion for decades and will allow thousands of artworks that do not fit inside the existing Neue Nationalgalerie to be permanently brought out of long-term storage. • This article was amended on 28 November 2022 to clarify that the museum’s estimated energy usage was calculated on an annual basis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/27/melting-point-could-cloud-brightening-slow-the-thawing-of-the-arctic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"Melting point: could ‘cloud brightening’ slow the thawing of the Arctic?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/27/melting-point-could-cloud-brightening-slow-the-thawing-of-the-arctic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/27/melting-point-could-cloud-brightening-slow-the-thawing-of-the-arctic","fields":{"headline":"Melting point: could ‘cloud brightening’ slow the thawing of the Arctic?","bodyText":"Like the apocryphal frog that doesn’t notice the rising water temperature until it’s boiled alive, we as a global society are still struggling to recognise that anthropic global warming is hastening us towards irreversible environmental and ecological catastrophe. While there is consensus among climate scientists about the urgency of the situation, and widespread political acknowledgment that the use of carbon fuels must be reduced, targets have not been met and as the UK’s Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, said, the lack of progress at this month’s Cop27 demonstrates the 1.5C limit is on “life support” and there is growing evidence that we are further along the road to a tipping point than previously thought. So advanced is this process that some scientists are beginning to argue that merely cutting carbon is not enough and an emergency measure involving what is known as geoengineering is called for. There have been a number of plans suggested, some more outlandish than others. They range from building giant mirrors in space to reflect away sunlight to painting the roofs of buildings white to help counteract heatwaves in cities. One particular area of concern is the Arctic, which, according to the latest research by Norwegian scientists, is warming at four times the speed of the rest of the planet. The more it warms, the more ice cover it loses, which in turn leads to further heating, creating a so-called positive feedback loop (although, paradoxically, the effect is entirely negative). Two suggestions for geoengineering the poles’ climate have drawn serious attention and have been the subject of theoretical modelling. The most popular and perhaps advanced of these is what is known as stratospheric aerosol injection, in which sulphur dioxide would be released into the stratosphere to gather around the poles. The idea is that the aerosols will have a similar effect to the ash clouds from volcanoes, which reach a high altitude and reflect sunlight, bringing down temperatures on Earth. There are many critics of the proposal, who point out that sulphur dioxide, which is associated with acid rain, asthma and chronic bronchitis, is itself environmentally damaging and there is no guarantee that its effects would be limited to the poles or, indeed, what its long-term effects might be. There has been some very limited field work examining aerosol effects, but it has been too restricted to offer any definitive answers. As Ben Kravitz, atmospheric scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, says: “It’s difficult for me to say whether I’m for or against stratospheric aerosol injection because it’s hard for me to even understand what I’m giving an opinion on. The effects will vary depending on how much aerosol injection is done, where, when and what material is used. And then we need to translate effects (such as changes in temperature, precipitation, etc) into impacts (such as food and water security). And then all of that needs to be compared to what would happen under climate change without stratospheric aerosol injection. So it’s too hard for me to say whether geoengineering is a good or bad idea at this stage.” Aside from the inherent uncertainty in the proposal, there is also concern about the politics of geoengineering, particularly in relation to indigenous people in the Arctic region, with one group of scientists arguing that “solar geoengineering at planetary scale is not governable in a globally inclusive and just manner within the current international political system”. A recent study led by Wake Smith, a lecturer at Yale University on venture capital and private equity, looked at the financial and logistical implications of aerosol injection deployment. The cost was estimated to be $11bn a year – no small sum, but a tiny fraction of the costs of dealing with damage done by climate change. The study suggested that 175,000 flights a year would be needed to release a cloud of microscopic sulphur dioxide particles at an altitude of 43,000ft and latitude of 60 degrees in each hemisphere. Such a massive air mobilisation would in turn release millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but it would also lead, say the models, to a 2C drop in temperature at the polar regions. Smith acknowledges that it’s a temporary measure that treats the symptoms rather than the underlying disease. “It’s aspirin, not penicillin,” he’s said. “It’s not a substitute for decarbonisation.” In theory, the sulphur dioxide particles would settle over the poles, but in practice, no one can be sure. It’s one of the reasons that cloud brightening has been suggested as a less risky and more viable option. Sir David King is the founder of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge (CCRC). A multidisciplinary team, it has three main objectives: to reduce CO2 emissions, remove excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and to refreeze damaged parts of the climate system. The CCRC is backing research into cloud brightening, which King insists is not geoengineering. “We reserve the phrase geoengineering for putting sulphates into the stratosphere,” he explains. While he is in favour of small-scale experiments with sulphates, he believes there should be a moratorium on “at scale” use of them in the stratosphere. Marine cloud brightening, by contrast, he says is not geoengineering but “biomimicry”, a means of imitating a natural process on a huge scale. The science is straightforward in theory. Clouds formed over oceans tend to build around salt crystals left after droplets of sea spray evaporate. Salt crystals vary in size and if they are at the smaller end of the spectrum, then clouds are formed of lots of small droplets. Clouds made from smaller droplets appear whiter than those composed of larger droplets and as a result reflect more sunlight, even if they carry the same amount of water. The idea is to whiten clouds by creating sea spray with a flotilla of boats armed with pumps and nozzles. “Once it’s all been proved operative and functional and there’s no deleterious effects,” says King, “we would need to have 500 to 1,000 ocean-going vessels placed around the Arctic Ocean.” “I think marine cloud brightening is promising,” says Kravitz, “but there’s still a lot of research that needs to be done. Interactions between aerosols and clouds are the single largest source of uncertainty in climate science right now.” The procedure, should it take place, would be restricted to the Arctic and not repeated in the Antarctic. “The North Pole is an ocean surrounded by land and the South Pole is land surrounded by ocean,” explains King. “So the melting ice of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is looking pretty dangerous, is happening because of warm seawater coming between the land the ice is sitting on and the ice. The problem there is extraordinarily difficult to manage because what is happening in the Antarctic with this warming of oceans is directly related to what’s happening in the Arctic.” He refers to the “overturning current”, or the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, as it’s technically called, part of the system in which cold water is circulated and which is thought to have been weakened by climate change and may itself reach a tipping point. In any case, the weakening of the AMOC has led to warmer waters in the Antarctic. To make the necessary tests and experiments, get agreements from native peoples, which is part of the CCRC’s plan, then design, build or fit out the vessels and implement the process seems like a monumental undertaking. It would require a unity of vision, large-scale fundraising, some agreed system of international governance and oversight and no doubt much else besides. How long does King estimate it will take to become operational? He runs swiftly through the necessary hurdles to clear, chief of which is fundraising, which he says comes from individual philanthropists. He expects three to four years of experimentation, possibly with a vessel at sea, but it could also take place on land in Orkney. “I hate to say this,” he warns, “but overall, it may be seven years before we are operating at anything like scale.” Given that it seems to take about seven years to get planning permission for a loft conversion, this seems to me like an astonishingly optimistic timescale. “Remember what I said,” he interrupts, when I voice my surprise, “the Arctic Circle is now heating up at four times the rate of the rest of the planet.” He says his team is working very hard to get acceptability from potentially affected people, including the Inuit and Sami people. But it’s getting the starting money, which he estimates to be “a few billion pounds”, which will be most time-consuming. The vessels, he says, would be remotely controlled and, he hopes, will run on solar energy and the movement of seawater and wind. “To scale up to 500 or 1,000 vessels,” he says, “would be in the region of £30bn to £40bn. Once we’ve got a few vessels built, it will all get a lot cheaper. The running costs may be £10bn a year. But compare this with the loss and damage [of the Arctic continuing to warm at its current rate].” Without intervention, the melting of Greenland’s ice cap is irreversible, he says, which would eventually lead to an average global sea level rise of “seven metres”. And that’s not the only issue. There is a vast amount of methane stored in the permafrost on the landmass in the Arctic region, which King notes is beginning to be released by rising temperatures in Siberia. “If it was released over a 20-year period, global temperatures would rise by five to eight degrees centigrade,” he says. The CCRC is talking to a number of governments, most prominently the Netherlands, which, given its reclaimed land and low-lying territory, is particularly concerned about managing rising sea levels. As he points out, though, few countries with significant coastlines are immune to the risks, including the UK. Brightening clouds or suffusing the stratosphere with sulphur dioxide sound like science fiction answers to our carbon dependency. Neither addresses the underlying cause – they’re sticking plasters placed over gaping wounds, at best a breathing space, if you don’t mind breathing sulphur dioxide – to enable time to complete a transfer from fossil fuels. But given the urgency of the situation, and the lack of effective global leadership in dealing with it, it seems sensible at least to test the efficacy of these stop-gap measures. Climate repair is not a one-method process. It will require innovation as well as abstinence. If the mimicking of the cycle by which microscopic salt crystals pick up water vapour can slow Arctic warming, then it will truly have produced clouds with a silver lining."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/nov/26/best-christmas-festive-days-out-around-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"Happy holly days: 10 of the best Christmas outings across the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/nov/26/best-christmas-festive-days-out-around-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/nov/26/best-christmas-festive-days-out-around-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"Step into Christmas … the best festive days out around the UK","bodyText":"We all need a bit of cheer at this time of year, when nights are long and days are often dark – maybe now more than ever. Luckily, the UK’s stately homes, galleries, gardens, theatres, churches and steam trains have been planning ahead and are ready with art and music, fire and ice, and mince pies with Santa. Even the most resolute Scrooge should find something to enjoy. Sound and light Each year, more venues join the floodlit fun, and there are now hundreds of light shows around the country, often set to stirring seasonal music. New this year are Hatfield Park, Hertfordshire, where Elizabeth I grew up, and Leeds Castle in Kent. One of Europe’s biggest city parks, Roundhay Park in Leeds, is also launching a light trail, complete with a fairy-lit tunnel and a fire garden, that winds through the trees and past the lake (various dates in Dec). For the 10th anniversary of the fast-selling epic light trail at Kew Gardens in south-west London, there are new features, including the illusion of a watery abyss in the lake, as well as Instagrammable projections and lasers playing over the Palm House (until 8 Jan). There’s a lantern walk at Wakehurst, Kew’s wilder sister garden in West Sussex, along with immersive soundscapes and the UK’s tallest living Christmas tree, decorated with 1,800 fairy lights (until 1 Jan). There’s a new mile-long trail round the Shugborough Estate in Staffordshire this winter, where a festoon-hung walkway leads through the after-dark gardens, lighting up natural and architectural features (until 1 Jan). In nearby Lichfield, England’s only triple-spired medieval cathedral is offering a sound-and-light show called Sing, Choirs of Angels. Frederick Oakeley, who lived in Lichfield, translated the Latin carol Adeste Fideles into the English O Come All Ye Faithful. Projection artists Illuminos have based their installations on this popular carol and the story of the nativity (16-20 Dec). There’s a nativity-themed sound-and-light show in Sheffield too. The manger will be projected over the cathedral, inside and out, bathing the facade in sunset colours or spangling the columns with stars (29 Nov-4 Dec). The same team, Luxmuralis, are also creating a spectacular installation at Liverpool cathedral, called The Angels are Coming (2-9 Dec) and Winchester cathedral’s Star of Wonder, illuminating the high arches and vaulted ceiling (13-18 Dec). Sparkly castles Start with a bracing walk on the beach and a kipper stottie at the Lord Crewe in Bamburgh, Northumberland, then climb a sandy path through banks of ivy to the castle. Gold rings, partridges in pear trees, maids-a-milking … this year’s decorations in the grand hall and staterooms, with theatrical sets and lighting, are inspired by The Twelve Days of Christmas (until 8 Jan). At Windsor Castle, Berkshire, the lampposts are wreathed in evergreens, the grand staircase is garlanded, and a twinkling six-metre Christmas tree, harvested from the neighbouring Great Park, stands in St George’s Hall, where local choirs will be carolling on 8, 9 and 15 Dec. With a festive menu in the castle’s first cafe, opened in 2020 in the medieval undercroft, the show goes on at the new king’s official residence (until 2 Jan). The rooms inside chateau-style Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire, are decked and open to the public for the first winter season since 2019. The conservatory is full of ferns and marble statues, and the Red Drawing Room has a gold ceiling, candelabras and portraits by Gainsborough. Outside you’ll find a Christmas market and a light trail through the landscaped grounds (until 2 Jan). This year’s Kingdom of the Snow Queen at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire involves supersized snowflakes and silver-frosted forests shimmering through the procession of staterooms. Outside, there’ll be a lavish light trail (book online) and a Christmas market (until 2 Jan). The art of Christmas shopping Brighton and Hove Artists Open Houses are running a winter festival on weekends until 11 Dec. Alongside prints, paintings, ceramics, they will be selling jewellery, knitted hot-water-bottle covers, lambswool gloves and more. Cards and pictures are often inspired by local seascapes or Brighton’s starling murmurations, which swirl through the winter sunset over the pier. Cockpit Open Studios in London is holding weekend sales in Bloomsbury (24-27 Nov) and Deptford (2-4 Dec) and championing the idea of sustainable slow design. The Makers Guild in Wales has a Winter Show at Cardiff Bay, with handmade decorations and stocking fillers, as well as larger works of art in glass, leather, patchwork or carved wood (until 8 Jan). There’s a Made in East Yorkshire market in the minster town of Beverley (7-9 Dec) to kick off its Festival of Christmas (11 Dec), which will fill the town centre with more than 100 stalls, fairground rides and street entertainers. Illuminating in more ways than one, Tate Liverpool is displaying this year’s Turner prize contenders (until March 2023), and there are interesting gifts in its colourful shop. There’s also a free light trail circling the colonnades of the Royal Albert Dock, passing a giant yellow submarine and glowing jellyfish, with bars and cafes selling everything from fresh croissants to happy hour cocktails. Oh no, it isn’t! Excellence in panto is recognised at the Pantomime Awards, and Morgan Brind, who won best dame last year, is back at Derby Arena, this time as Widow Twankey in Aladdin (9-31 Dec). Winner of best costumes, Celia Perkins, is doing the designs again at Oldham Coliseum, (until 7 Jan), where it’s Robin Hood this year, and Jonny Bowles is directing Cinderella at the Belfast Grand Opera House, where he scooped the choreography prize with last year’s Goldilocks (3 Dec-15 Jan). The Lyric Hammersmith stages the coolest pantos in London and this year it will be Jack and the Beanstalk, complete with skateboarding, OTT outfits and Beyoncé numbers (until 7 Jan). There’s a new digital set, using LED screens for the first time alongside traditional elements, at the Swansea Grand for Beauty and the Beast, starring Strictly glitterball-winner Joe McFadden (14 Dec-15 Jan). Seasonal bars and cinemas Manchester, where the UK’s first Christmas market opened at the end of the last century, has some unbeatable venues. The city’s Piccadilly Gardens becomes Winter Gardens, and this year sees a huge new heated double-tipi bar with a fire pit. Nearby food stalls include plant-based Panc, whose colourful vegan bratwurst was given top marks last year in the Manchester Evening News. Escape to Freight Island, a bar and restaurant complex in an old depot near Piccadilly station, reinvents itself for the season as Winter Island with music and a rooftop ice rink (until 24 Dec). An abandoned Edwardian railway station above the site has become a new Backyard Cinema, opened in October, with giant beanbags for watching Home Alone, Love Actually and other festive films. The cinema itself is dressed movie-set-style, so visitors arrive through tree tunnels into an overgrown palace (until 2 Jan). The original Backyard Cinema in Wandsworth, south London, has an Arctic voyage theme this winter. Another venue in the cinema-as-experience trend, the Scotsman Picturehouse in Edinburgh, opened under the Scotsman hotel in 2019, has red leather armchairs, retro lamps and free popcorn. Pricey-but-fun festive packages mean customers can sip prosecco while watching It’s a Wonderful Life. For even fancier offerings, Blythswood Square in Glasgow is offering Baubles and Brunch: screenings of Elf and Home Alone can be followed by two courses including steak and chocolate sundae. The Luna Winter Cinema festival at Saint George’s Hall in Liverpool has a giant screen under the columns and barrel-vaulted ceiling (10-23 Dec). And Liverpool cathedral is one of 11 venues for the Snowman Tour, where a live orchestra accompanies a screening of The Snowman and Aardman’s The Flight Before Christmas for a feelgood festive show (various dates). Take to the ice The ornate domes and minarets of Brighton’s Royal Pavillion glow blue and purple while skaters circle the ice beside them on a seasonal rink powered entirely by renewable wind and solar energy (until 8 Jan). Scotland’s biggest seasonal rink is outside the fabulous Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow with lights, music, a separate toddler rink and adults-only sessions after 9pm. There’s also a new 15-metre-high ferris wheel for a bird’s-eye view of the whirling skaters below (until 24 Dec). A short walk away, in the vaulted cloisters of Glasgow University, there’s a free carol concert on 13 Dec. Cardiff’s free-to-enter Winter Wonderland has a skating rink, the city’s only ice bar (tickets include iced shot and rented warm coat), and an ice walk through the castle, stretching 150 metres past the Norman keep (until Jan 8). The bar is kept at -10C, so it and the frozen seats don’t melt. Even the air-hockey table is made of ice and there are ice sculptures, this year on an undersea theme. Cardiff also has a light trail in Bute Park (until 1 Jan) and a Santa’s grotto in the changing rooms at the rugby stadium (Dec 2–24). Santa’s grotto with a twist Thousands of Father Christmases will be donning their red coats and white beards this winter, in shops, theme parks, zoos and castles. One imaginative idea is a reverse grotto at the National Trust’s Erddig Hall in Wrexham. You bring a donation for the local food bank, chat with Santa, see the 18th-century manor halls decked for Christmas, and follow a Rudolph-themed trail around the grounds. The Erddig estate’s 1,200 acres have waymarked woodland walks to the castle mound and a cathedral-style avenue of tall beeches and hornbeams. Windows on one side of the house become a giant advent calendar and the restaurant is open for cake and hot chocolate (weekends only, 3-18 Dec). There’s another reverse grotto at Chirk Castle, a medieval fortress near the Welsh-English border (various dates). Winter walks in the area include the castle’s oak woods, Chirk aqueduct and the Llangollen canal towpath. A reindeer trail through the grounds of Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire leads to Father Christmas in his cottage. Biddulph Gardens, a maze of spaces with topiary pyramids, a sphinx-flanked summerhouse, Chinese pagoda and Himalayan glen, are great for kids in any season, with bridges, tunnels and terraces to explore (various dates). Belfast’s Titanic Experience has a Christmas package involving a trip to see Father Christmas via a wishing tree in an enchanted forest, a workshop for handmade gifts and a post office for Christmas letters (until 23 Dec). The Historic Dockyard at Chatham, Kent closes as usual for December, but – for the first time this year – is running Mission Christmas, with a visit to Santa including a submarine adventure (until 24 Dec). Deck the halls Long Live the Christmas Tree! is the title of this year’s arty winter festival at Harewood House in West Yorkshire. Ten artists and makers have fashioned new versions of traditional trees from upcycled bottles, intricate paper mobiles, botanical sculptures using leaves from the gardens, and a carnivalesque celebration called One Love. There’s a pagan-style tree made with antlers in the Cinnamon Drawing Room, and a rotating, crystal-studded copper tree in the Music Room. People arriving car-free get half-price entry, and there are regular buses from Leeds and Harrogate. There is also 150 acres of grounds to explore, with illuminated walks, overwintering geese and bright holly berries before the drifts of lakeside snowdrops bloom again (until 2 Jan) At National Trust-owned The Argory, in County Armagh, the theme is Yesteryear, with the neoclassical house decked for a traditional festive season and open at weekends. The banisters are wreathed in greenery and baubles, and the grounds are home to robins, grey squirrels and a Christmas fair on 3-4 Dec. Visitors can make their own natural Christmas wreath, decorated with berries and leaves from the estate, at Downhill Demesne in County Derry. The workshop, with festive refreshments, takes place in thatched Hezlett House, one of Northern Ireland’s oldest domestic buildings (selected dates). Festive tram and train rides Illuminated heritage trams are running evening tours of Blackpool’s six miles of lights, which are shining for an extended season (until 2 Jan). Originally modelled in the 1960s, the trams are shaped like steam trains or open-topped boats. TV interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has given Blackpool’s Golden Mile an art-deco-style makeover this year. The promenade between the resort’s two piers now has what Llewelyn-Bowen calls “dynamic corridors of scintillating coloured light”. This season’s display includes a drag-themed digital show and a seven-metre-high walk-through beach balls. Blackpool’s festive village, Christmas by the Sea, includes a new free skating rink and artificial snow (until 2 Jan). There’s a grotto inside a decorated train carriage on the harbour at Porthmadog, Snowdonia, where the Ffestiniog railway’s Winter Wanderer service sets off into the frosty hills. There are hot drinks and mince pies on sale at the station cafe to enjoy with the scenery (various dates). A Train of Lights chugs along Dartmouth steam railway in Devon, through the 450-metre Greenway tunnel to an enchanted forest. On the way back, the town’s glowing windows and street lamps will be reflected in the river Dart (until 30 Dec). Sculpture trails Channel 4 first screened Raymond Briggs’s The Snowman 40 years ago and has shown it every Christmas since. Individually painted to represent the 12 days of Christmas, giant sculptures based on the Snowman form a free trail around Hitchin in Hertfordshire (until 20 Jan). There’s also a craft fair in Hitchin’s Schools Museum (3-4 Dec) and local cafes to warm up in include Molly’s Tea Room, with its bay window full of teapots and teddy bears. There’s another trail of snowmen at Winkworth Arboretum in Surrey. Camellias, mahonia, witch hazel and early snowdrops flower in the winter garden and down the wooded slopes, and mist rises from the reed-fringed pond on cold days. For the festive season, there are free traditional games and a carousel. Afterwards, there are mince pies and marshmallow-topped hot chocolate in the cafe, with 25p off for those who bring a reusable cup (trail until 2 Jan). Birmingham has a walking trail of 15 emperor penguin sculptures, a huge Frankfurt Christmas market (until 23 Dec), plus a programme of ballets, concerts and pantomimes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T15:25:19Z","webTitle":"De facto ban on solar farms in England to continue, Coffey signals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","fields":{"headline":"De facto ban on solar farms in England to continue, Coffey signals","bodyText":"The de facto ban on solar farms will be continued by Rishi Sunak’s government, the environment secretary has signalled. Thérèse Coffey, fresh from her visit to Cop27, suggested to parliament that she would be continuing with policy plans initiated under the former prime minister Liz Truss, which would block solar power from most farmland. Under Truss, Defra officials were looking at how to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. This would mean 60% of all agricultural land would be off-limits to solar farms. It was hoped the Sunak government would reverse this decision, as to reach net zero targets, the country needs a huge expansion of renewables. However, when asked by the shadow climate minister Kerry McCarthy on Thursday, Coffey signalled she would be keeping the policy. She said: “It’s really important we make the best use of our land to have that food security … It’s also really important when considering land use to consider the best place to put renewable energy, which by and large most people would agree, let’s use our best agricultural land for farming and make use of brownfield sites for a lot of these energy projects, too.” Backing her up, in response to the Conservative MP Siobhan Baillie, who is campaigning against solar in her Stroud constituency, the environment minister Mark Spencer said: “She should be assured that my officials are working closely with other departments to ensure the right balance between boosting food production and energy security.” McCarthy told the Guardian: “It is beyond belief that this government is still considering blocking new solar developments during an energy crisis. This will drive up bills, risk our energy security and prevent us meeting our crucial climate targets. “From the ban on onshore wind to blocks on solar, every week it becomes clearer that Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age. Labour’s plan would cut energy bills for good, creating thousands of good, green jobs and making Britain a clean energy superpower.” The solar industry was also unimpressed by the statements. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of Solar Energy UK, told the Guardian: “Since the resignation of Liz Truss and Ranil Jayawardena, all the ministerial statements from the departments that matter on energy policy, the Treasury and BEIS [Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy], have all been explicitly supportive of more renewables and specifically solar farms. “This gave the impression that anything that happened under Liz Truss’s brief tenure was to be disregarded, including the leaked proposals for changes to land classification leading to a de-facto ban on solar farms. “The new prime minister’s support for renewables at Cop27, as a means to deliver economic growth and energy security, reinforced that message. It is concerning that Thérèse Coffey has not clarified the position of her own department but existing policy already balances energy and food security effectively.” Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, James Cartlidge, said the new government was “serious about delivering cheaper, cleaner and more secure power” and would include solar farms in future auctions for “contracts for difference”. He added that the existing English planning system was “designed to take account” of the need to balance “community interests, food security and securing a clean, green energy system for the future”. Sunak has previously shown antipathy towards solar panels, and during the summer in his first run for leader he promised that “good agricultural land” would not be used for renewables. When asked if Coffey’s remarks meant she would be pushing for the block on solar farms, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to give an on-the-record comment but confirmed they had been looking at options to support farming and energy security while protecting nature and delivering on net zero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/nov/15/australia-live-news-anthony-albanese-china-dialogue-xi-jinping-flood-warnings-nsw-weather-g20-cop27-climate-change-chris-bowen","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"PM holds bilateral talks with Chinese president – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/15/australia-live-news-anthony-albanese-china-dialogue-xi-jinping-flood-warnings-nsw-weather-g20-cop27-climate-change-chris-bowen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/15/australia-live-news-anthony-albanese-china-dialogue-xi-jinping-flood-warnings-nsw-weather-g20-cop27-climate-change-chris-bowen","fields":{"headline":"PM holds bilateral talks with Chinese president – as it happened","bodyText":"Guardian Australia’s political editor Katharine Murphy is in Bali following Anthony Albanese at the G20 summit, and will file a despatch from the prime minister’s meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping. That will be live on our website shortly. With that, we’ll wrap up our live coverage of the day’s news. Here’s a summary of the day’s main news developments: Prime minister Anthony Albanese has raised the cases of two Australian citizens detained in China, human rights abuses in Xinjiang and concerns over Taiwan during a 32-minute meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping, as he became the first Australian leader to hold talks with Xi since 2016. The New South Wales town of Forbes faced record flooding on Tuesday, as the community of Eugowra reeled from the “inland tsunami” that inundated the town on Monday and resulted in more than one in five residents requiring an emergency rescue. Tennis star Novak Djokovic will be given a visa by the Australian government, allowing him to compete in the 2023 Australian Open. The Reserve Bank has stoked expectations it is prepared to pause in lifting its key interest rate, while also flagging it will curb the telegraphing of future moves. Covid hospitalisations have increased by 11% in the past week, the federal health minister Mark Butler said, as he announced new vaccines have been approved to boost supply. Two genetic experts have told the inquiry into the convictions of Kathleen Folbigg that a “bad variant”, or rare genetic mutation, likely led to the deaths of her two daughters. Billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has succeeded in shaking up the board of Australia’s biggest electricity producer, with all four of his proposed directors winning support from shareholders at AGL Energy’s annual general meeting. Have a great evening. We’ll be back to do it all again tomorrow. Eugowra residents recall moment flood hit NSW town leaving ‘total carnage’ The first warning came through on Sunday. Heavy rainfall – for the second time in a fortnight – was lashing central west New South Wales, from Mudgee in the north to Albury in the south. The Belubula River at Canowindra was flooding at a level not seen in more than 70 years. Flooding was expected to be worst at the nearby township of Eugowra early on Monday morning. When the rain came it came down hard. The mayor of Orange, Jason Hamling, was at home on Sunday night when it started “teeming down”. “It came rolling through and the country was already saturated,” he said. Then, the Wyangala Dam spilled, releasing torrents of water into the nearby Lachlan River. Hamling watched footage that showed the moment a tidal wave came rushing at the rate of 230,000 megalitres a day. Read more from Caitlin Cassidy and Cait Kelly: PM says Xi meeting went ‘over time’ Anthony Albanese played down any significance over the short length of his meeting with Xi – which lasted just 32 minutes in contrast to the three hours that Xi spent in his G20 meeting with US president Joe Biden. The prime minister denied Xi ended the meeting early, and insisted it had in fact run over time. It went over time (for) when it was scheduled, and it was very constructive.” Climate change ‘requires a global response’: Albanese to Xi Anthony Albanese spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping about the climate crisis and “the need for us to work together in tackling climate change”. I referred to the floods that are occurring in New South Wales, that climate change is a global issue and it requires a global response.” Albanese also said he spoke to Xi about his concerns over Taiwan. China has an important role to play on Taiwan. I certainly raised that issue. I put Australia’s position which is support for the status quo, which I put forward in the meeting. And that we didn’t wish to see any change to that status.” PM raises detention of Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun with China’s president Anthony Albanese said he raised issues including the detention of Australian citizens Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun during his meeting with Xi Jinping. The prime minister said he “put forward Australia’s position when it comes to the blockages in our trading relationship”. He said he also “put forward the differences that we have on human rights issues, including Xinjiang”, a reference to allegations of human rights abuses against the region’s Uyghur population. Albanese added: I also put forward our position on Ukraine and asked that China exercise its influence on Russia, specifically about Russia’s threats to use tactical nuclear weapons. I noted that China had called that out, and that that is a good thing.” Anthony Albanese is speaking after his meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping. The prime minister said the meeting was “a very positive and constructive discussion”. Albanese said: And I was pleased that it was held. We know that China is Australia’s largest trading partner. They are worth more than Japan, the US and Republic of Korea together, combined. So it’s an important relationship for Australia and Australia seeks a stable relationship with China. We have big differences to manage, but we’re always going to be better off when we have dialogue and are able to talk constructively and respectfully but also honestly about what those differences are and we were able to do that this afternoon. Today I think both countries took an important step to moving forward. There are many steps of course that we are yet to take and I have said consistently since before I became prime minister we will cooperate where we can and disagree where we must act in the national interest. One of the things that struck me was that both of us spoke about how we have highly complementary economies. It is clearly in Australia’s interest to export some of the foreign products that we have a choice in China’s interest to receive those foreign products. And so it was a very constructive discussion.” Anthony Albanese said his meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping was “a positive and constructive discussion”. In a tweet, the prime minister said: It was good to discuss our relationship with China’s President Xi Jinping. It was a positive and constructive discussion. We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in our national interest.” The leaders are on the clock tonight. They need to get to the summit’s gala dinner. The bilateral between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping spanned three hours on Monday night. Officials say the meeting between Albanese and Xi has now wrapped. The conversation spanned 32 minutes. Here is a translation of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s comments during the opening remarks of the bilateral meeting. According to the AFP news agency, Xi said: “I am very glad to meet Mr prime minister Albanese here. This is our first meeting so hereby I congratulate you again for your appointment as Australia’s prime minister. China-Australia relations used to be in the forefront of China’s relations with developed countries for a long time. This is worth cherishing. In the past few years, China-Australia relationship has run into some difficulties. That was not what we were willing to see. Because China and Australia are both important countries in the Asia Pacific Region. We should improve, maintain and develop our relationship as it is consistent with the fundamental interests of both countries’ people, and it is beneficial to peaceful development of the region and the world. Since you assumed the leadership, you have talked about China-Australia relations on various occasions and expressed multiple times that you would handle China-Australia relations in a mature manner. I attach great importance to your opinion.” After thanking Xi for the meeting, Albanese noted the discussion came at a time of great uncertainty. The world faced supply chain shocks, economic headwinds, the Covid-19 recovery and the lived reality of the climate crisis. “As we manage these challenges we need to work towards a stable, prosperous and peaceful Indo-Pacific, and an international system that is governed by international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations charter.” “We have had our differences and Australia won’t resile from our interests or our values. But our bilateral relationship is an important one. Both sides have worked to stabilise the relationship based upon mutual respect and mutual benefit.” This conversation is happening at the luxury Mulia Resort in Nusa Dua, Bali. Xi entered the room first. Albanese second. They shook hands and then took their places at the tables. As is the case during international summits, these events are high security, and they are covered by a small pool of journalists and cameras. The West Australian’s political editor, Katina Curtis, is the pool reporter for the Australian delegation. She tells me Xi had his head down writing notes as Albanese spoke. Hello from Bali. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have just delivered the opening remarks of tonight’s bilateral. Xi spoke first, in Mandarin, we do not yet have a translation. Albanese followed. Albanese told Xi he was very pleased the two leaders were meeting. Tonight ends a diplomatic freeze that’s been playing out since 2016. But he also made the difficulties clear. Albanese said the two countries have had their differences and Australia won’t resile “from our interests or our values”. Anthony Albanese has begun talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali this evening. Speaking in front of cameras at the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister said it was happening at “a time of great global uncertainty”, noting the “challenges of Covid and the recovery, dealing with climate change and also supply chain shocks”. “As we manage these challenges we need to work towards a stable, prosperous, and peaceful Indo-Pacific, and an international system that is governed by international law and the principles that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter,” Albanese said. Albanese also acknowledged the bilateral relationship had soured in recent times: We have had our differences, and Australia won’t resile from our interests or our values, but our bilateral relationship is an important one. Both sides have worked to stabilise the relationship based upon mutual respect and mutual benefit. We will soon reach, of course, the milestone of 50 years of diplomatic relations, when a former Labor prime minister, Gough Whitlam, established diplomatic relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of China in 1972. We agreed on principles to guide the relationship, based on equality, mutual respect and benefit and a commitment to co-exist peacefully, and these principles remain important today. President Xi I look forward to a constructive exchange and dialogue today, I thank you. Fair Work Commission may stop lockout at tugboat operator Svitzer The Fair Work Commission has announced that tugboat operator Svitzer’s announcement of a lockout on Friday has prompted it to consider making an order on its own initiative to suspend or terminate protected industrial action by Svitzer. The commission will hold a hearing at noon tomorrow to consider terminating the lockout which has prompted fears of widespread supply chain disruptions ahead of Christmas. The Fair Work Commission vice-president, Adam Hatcher, noted that in February 2022 it had suspended proposed 48-hour stoppages at Svitzer because they “threatened to cause significant damage to an important part of the Australian economy”. He said that findings the commission made at that time “give rise to a concern that the protected industrial action recently announced by Svitzer may similarly threaten to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it”. Anthony Albanese to meet Xi Jinping at G20 summit in Bali We’ll be keeping this live blog open a little later than usual tonight, as Anthony Albanese meets with China’s president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Indonesia. Ahead of the meeting, the Business Council of Australia has hailed the Albanese government’s “tremendous reset” with China. The BCA chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, told journalists on Monday night that Labor’s “huge foreign policy reset” with Indonesia and Pacific countries, as well as the thawing in relations with China, was creating opportunity “for business to come in behind … and start building those business-to-business relationships”.

A stench of rotting carpet and rubbish hangs over what was once a space of celebration, with the bowling green covered in mud, unusable anytime soon. The club’s treasurer, Yvonne Clyde, takes a deep breath when asked how she feels seeing the club ruined and empty. “I’m just very drained, very drained and devastated,” she says. “The water had come up to knee height and just got into every space and crevice. It feels like every time we make some progress with the clean-up, we find more mud, more water.” She says no part of the club was untouched by the surging flood waters, from the ATM to the glasses, the honours board, the vaults and seating, even the small office from which the club is run. “Everything has been ruined. I think we’d need a year to recover fully, beyond just the cosmetic clean-up. “I’m hoping we can rebuild, but we have already lost so much. We had so many bookings, so many parties and functions that are now lost. And its especially damaging because we were heading into Christmas.” ‘Everything has been touched by mud’: Molong unites for massive flood clean-up Empty shopfronts dot Bank Street in central Molong, as the town begins processing the scale of damage flood waters have wrought. Restaurants have emptied their seating onto the footpath, volunteers hose the mud out of businesses, and people hug closely when they see each other. Residents say they are proud of the resilience and community spirit in the small town, as people band together to quickly clean the major damage before getting to the more arduous, final phase of the clean-up. Volunteer Jenny, who is helping clean the local gym, says the water has “severely damaged” parts of the town. “We’ve seen flooding before, but not like this. It’s just gone through everything, all the equipment here is damaged, everything has been touched by mud. “But we’re so lucky to have this supportive community, they’ve just turned up. It’s amazing how quickly they cleaned everything up.” Harriet Pederick, who says she’s lost $40,000 worth of stock from her health store, says that despite the devastation the town spirit is “amazing.” “Everyone has come together for this massive clean-up, it’s been amazing to see. “There are some true heroes in this town, everyone has been out here today and yesterday, some just here to have a cry with. “We’ll be back though, we won’t give up on our business and this town.” Meanwhile, some more footage is coming out of Eugowra, the town of about 700 where more than one in five residents had to be rescued by emergency services on Monday. Floods have also hit Victoria this week. Had a busy day? Unable to keep up with the news? Check out Guardian Australia’s Afternoon Update: ‘Weeks and weeks of cleaning up to do’: Molong begins long process of rebuilding after flood Molong is in recovery mode, as residents begin the long process of rebuilding after flood waters swept through the town centre yesterday morning. Windows are boarded up, businesses closed, and volunteers are still hosing down the mud this afternoon, with a sense of exhaustion hanging over the town. Sharon Costa is volunteering at the hardware store, at the end of Bank Street, which saw waters reach as high as the awnings at the pub across the road. She says that while there is stock to be saved at the hardware store, many other businesses are completely ruined. “Their windows have been shattered, doorways and ceilings have collapsed, machinery or anything electrical is ruined. The local newsagency had to just throw everything out. It’s devastating. “I think some of these businesses won’t survive this.” Costa describes the scene as “surreal” as the sun shines on the town’s muddied roads. While much of the obvious debris and rubbish has been cleaned, she says the work has only begun. “It looks OK on the outside now, but there is weeks and weeks of cleaning up to do, behind and beside the buildings, in places you don’t notice. There’s still so much to do, behind the broken windows, down the alleyways of mud and rubbish.” A second Australian has died following a Halloween crowd crush in the South Korean capital last month, reports AAP. The woman succumbed to injuries sustained during the crush after two weeks. More than 150 people were killed in the tragedy during festivities in Seoul’s Itaewon district. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing assistance to the woman’s family. Sydney film production assistant Grace Rached was the first Australian to die in the days after the tragedy.

Guardian Australia understands that immigration minister, Andrew Giles, will give Djokovic a visa, overturning a three-year ban that accompanied the decision by the previous government to cancel his visa on the eve of the 2022 open. Read more of the Guardian’s exclusive story here: Wyangala dam spill forecast to ease but flood risks remain Most of the inland dams in eastern Australia are either full or spilling, it seems, with Wyangala Dam in central NSW putting on quite a spectacle: Of course, all that water entering the Lachlan River is not a good thing, swelling the river and raising the major flooding risks downstream in places such as Cowra. At its peak flows, Wyangala was dumping water at the record rate of 230 gigalitres a day (or almost half a Sydney Harbour). Fortunately, the spill rate had dropped to 80GL/day by Tuesday morning, WaterNSW said earlier today. With inflows mercifully dropping from 265GL/day at their peak to about a third of that, the dam outflows were forecast to drop to 60/GL a day too. Dam capacity remained slightly above 100%. All that flooding will likely raise questions about whether the dam wall should be raised 10 metres, as proposed by the fomer Berejiklian government. The price tag, though, had tripled to $2.1bn as of a couple of years ago, prompting unkind comments that it was a “brain fart”. More to the point, though, a higher dam wall would only increase the capacity by half to 1867GL. At the rate of the recent increases, would a couple of days of delayed outflows be worth spending so much money on? No doubt this issue will be debated - not least because the Albanese government is unlikely to stump up half the cash as originally agreed between the then Coalition-led federal and NSW governments. Health authorities in New South Wales are urging residents to check any poppy seeds in their kitchen are not affected by a nationwide recall of poppy seeds linked to poisoning. Investigations into the non-food grade poppy seeds sold as part of food grade products have indicated the presence of unusually high levels of the naturally occurring chemical thebaine that is causing toxicity. While warnings have previously been issued in relation to the poppyseed recall, new information discovered as part of the investigation has found the poppyseeds should not be consumed in any amount. A NSW Health statement said: Reports of unusual and severe symptoms following poppy seed consumption have now seen at least 12 people requiring medical attention in NSW after developing poisoning soon after ingestion, with additional cases nationally.” Medical director of the NSW Poisons Information Centre, associate professor Darren Roberts, said the product was not considered safe to eat or to drink as the chemical detected in the poppy seed product can be dangerous. Roberts urged anyone experiencing any unusual and severe symptoms to seek immediate medical attention. Reported symptoms have so far included severe muscle cramping, muscle spasms and abnormal movements, seizures and cardiac arrest. Products affected are listed on the FSANZ website and will be updated as needed. The NSW Poisons Information Centre can be contacted 24/7 on 13 11 26 and can provide more information about poisons and what to do in suspected cases of poppy seed poisoning. Snow falls in Tasmania Parts of Tasmania have been dusted with spring snow, with a weather system dumping more rain on the already drenched state. Snowfall reached as low as 400 metres on Tuesday morning and settled on areas including Hobart’s kunanyi/Mt Wellington, south of the capital and the Central Highlands. Read more: Sun Cable inks deal with Indonesia to “unlock” renewable riches Sun Cable, a firm backed by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, has inked a deal on the sides of the G20 meeting in Bali to boost “inter-island connectivity”, among other things. As we noted earlier, Cannon-Brookes has had a busy day with changes at AGL (outside his day job of being co-boss of Atlassian). Anyway, Sun Cable is planning a $30bn giant solar farm in Australia that could supply electricity to Darwin but also to Singapore via an undersea cable. Since that cable will run through Indonesia, it’s been a live question (so to speak) whether Indonesia might also tap into the power. Well, according to an MoU signed today between Sun Cable and Indonesia’s minister for energy and mineral resources, Arifin Tasrif, a formal collaboration will emerge “to advance opportunities for renewable energy generation and transmission within Indonesia”. Numbers can be a bit inflated around these things, but the two could help spur a “green industry” bonanza which would add as much as $US115bn to Indonesia’s GDP by 2035, the partners say. (In $A, that’s about $171bn, but in rupee, it’s 1.6 quadrillion - or a pretty big number). From what we can make of it, Indonesia has identified five key industries from mining and metals processing that could do with some “green hydrogen” (ie not made with fossil fuels), to transport and even “green fertilisers”. Sun Cable’s “expertise in solar energy generation and long distance transmission” could play a role. Given Indonesia is reportedly also talking about linking up Australia’s large lithium reserves with its plans to expand its battery production, we might expect more such ventures. Major anger among minor parties over preferences sting The state leader of Derryn Hinch’s Justice party, Stuart Grimley, has come out swinging against the Animal Justice party after it gained the support of parties working with “preference whisperer”, Glen Druery, but directed its own preferences to others at the last minute. The state election manager and lead southern metropolitan candidate for the Animal Justice party, Ben Schultz, gained Druery’s trust over several months and was allocated preferences from his voting bloc of minor parties. Schultz was meant to reciprocate but instead directed preferences to a bloc of progressive parties, including Fiona Patten’s Reason party, Legalise Cannabis, the Victorian Socialists, as well as Labor and the Greens. Druery’s preferences flowing to AJP candidate Georgie Purcell makes it much harder for Grimley’s Justice party colleague, Tania Maxwell to retain her seat in the northern Victoria region. Grimley says the Animal Justice party “had a deliberate strategy, from the outset, to deceive other minor parties in preference negotiations. They sought to scam parties, and they did”. “The Animal Justice Party will tell you they’re a party of integrity but take one look at their voting record and you’ll realise they’re just a lacky for the Government. Nothing more. If the AJP are happy to lie and deceive their way into the Parliament, what do you think will happen if they hold the balance of power? If you thought it couldn’t get any worse than the last 4 years, think again. Electoral analyst Ben Raue had an interesting take on the matter: Here’s our story on the saga - described by Druey as the “most elaborate sting in minor party history”: The State Emergency Service in New South Wales is focussing its flood assistance and rescue efforts on the town of Forbes, as the Lachlan River continues to rise toward record levels. The NSW SES chief superintendent, Dallas Burnes, said his organisation has “as many emergency services resources as possible in the Central West, including rescue helicopters” and that the Australian Defence Force and international personnel are arriving today. Burnes said: “After 120mm of rain fell in the area on Sunday night, our members have worked alongside emergency service partners to prepare the Forbes community, including sandbagging and public information.” Eugowra – the community of about 700 which faced devastating flood levels on Monday which resulted in more than one in five residents needing to be rescued – has reported significant damage with power and telecommunication coverage still being restored. “We have reports of floodwater moving whole houses downstream and bridges being moved off pylons. Police are continuing to work with welfare services to assist the Eugowra community. Burnes said the SES is asking flood victims to use the Australian Red Cross Register. Find. Reunite (https://register.redcross.org.au/) channel to connect family, friends and loved ones. The SES said planning is underway for more international resources to be deployed to assist with flood response and recovery, with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting further storms in the state’s south next weekend. In the 24 hours from 3pm on Monday, the SES in NSW has performed: Requests for assistance: 489 Flood rescues: 34 As of 3pm on Tuesday, the SES has 120 warnings in place, including 25 emergency warnings to either evacuate or shelter, 76 watch and act warnings and 19 alerts at advice level.

Australian Open organisers hopeful Djokovic can play Tennis Australia head, Craig Tiley, is optimistic about Novak Djokovic returning for next year’s Australian Open but has ruled out seeking any favours from government officials who will determine the Serb’s eligibility to enter the country, reports AAP. Djokovic is serving an automatic three-year ban from Australia after being dramatically deported on the eve of this year’s Open for trying to enter the country while not vaccinated against Covid-19. While the vaccine mandate is no longer an obstacle for the former world No.1, Djokovic’s lawyers are still trying to have his visa ban overturned. “Nothing official yet. We are waiting. They are communicating with the government of Australia. That’s all I can tell you for now,” Djokovic told reporters after winning his opening match at the ATP finals in Turin on Monday night. With Wednesday marking two months before the 2023 Open gets underway in Melbourne, the stalemate is hardly ideal, but Tiley is hopeful tennis fans - and Djokovic - will not have to endure a re-run of this year’s soap opera. Tiley said Djokovic would have to go through the normal visa application process and that he doesn’t think the former world No.1, nor any other players, should receive “preferential treatment”. Tiley told AAP: I fully expect to have an answer for everyone by the time that they need to book their flights and come in, including Novak. That’s entirely up to the Australian government. I know Novak wants to come and play and to get back to competing. He loves Australia and it’s where he’s had the best success but the timing (on any announcement) is up to somebody else and we’ll just play that one by ear. But I don’t know that. That’s really between he and the feds. But the conditions have changed significantly from where they were a year ago and I’d like to have Novak here.” Queensland police commissioner ‘hoping to survive’ in role amid force’s racism and sexism scandals The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, says she is “hoping” to keep her job amid increasing pressure on the Queensland police service’s leadership over revelations about racism, sexism and misogyny in the ranks. On Tuesday Carroll and the police minister, Mark Ryan, spent almost an hour answering questions from the media after the release of audio recordings – published by Guardian Australia – that contained officers using racist and violent language. “The stuff that we heard in the watch house is truly abhorrent,” Carroll said. Read more: Elias Visontay will take you through the rest of the afternoon. We will let you know if there is any more information on the Forbes flood situation. Thanks for joining me today and please – take care of you. The Reserve Bank is, as we know, as much about messaging as it is about interest rate hiking or cutting. Getting the public worried about coming rate rises helps dent demand, and in doing so, removes some of the need for those raises. So it’s notable today that the RBA is sending slightly mixed messages. On the one hand, the release of the minutes from its 1 November board meeting (when it raised interest rates for a seventh time in as many meetings) suggests the central bank might be quite happy to leave the cash rate at 2.85% a bit longer if necessary. Missing from the October board minutes this time around were the words that conditions were “likely to require further increases in interest rates over the period ahead”. As CBA’s top Australian economist, Gareth Aird, notes, the November tea leaves launched comments that were echoed later that day by governor Philip Lowe that, “the board is prepared to keep rates unchanged for a period while it assesses the state of the economy and the inflation outlook”. Aird counts five times this phrase has appeared since the rate hike ... basically every time a senior RBA official has popped her or his head up in public. We’ll find out on 6 December whether the RBA’s assessment is to stay relaxed and smiling as we head to the Christmas break. The bank, after all, takes a holiday in January unless something dramatic happens. (The GFC wasn’t dramatic enough for a board meeting in January.) Anyway, there’s another messaging issue to look at. The RBA has reviewed its “forward guidance” and whether telling everyone that it was unlikely to hike the cash rate (with certain caveats) until 2023 or 2024 was not an optimal outcome. The forward guidance was state-based, but at various times included a time-based element,” the RBA said in its findings. This complicated the Bank’s attempts to communicate the state-based nature of its policies and it could have done more to emphasise the conditionality of its statements about the future path of the cash rate.” In short, it will reserve the right not to give such specifics in the future. Forward guidance on interest rates will not always be provided, although the Board will continue to outline how monetary policy settings are adjusted in response to evolving economic conditions,” it said. The review of the RBA will go to the government next March. Expect that report to have a few more things to say about the bank’s communications. Five and a half million Australians haven’t had a third Covid vaccine dose In his press conference Mark Butler said: I‘ve said on a number of occasions in the first half of 2022, that then was the time to put out a very strong information campaign about the importance of booster doses. The evidence from around the world at that time was very clear that two doses, particularly against the Omicron variant of the virus - that has really swept the whole globe - that two doses of the vaccine was not sufficient, and you needed at that stage three doses to be fully vaccinated. And I think we lost very important time over a period of a few months leading into and during the election campaign not having that information out. We moved very quickly to provide that sort of public information, we’re still doing that, states have been doing that as well. But I think we all have to accept that it we’re not really shifting the dial much at all. So I talked about five and a half million Australians being eligible for a third dose last week, only 7000 of that five and a half million got their third dose, so that that number just is not shifting. We are taking advice about how to shift that, during the building wave that we’ve been experiencing over the last couple of weeks, is the obvious opportunity to reiterate the importance of being up to date with vaccinations. And as I said, the fact that vaccine numbers have increased by about 50% over the last fortnight, that’s pleasing, but there’s still much more to do, and we’re considering what we can do to improve that. Grok mystery solved One of our readers has answered a question which appeared a little earlier in the blog – so thank you! There was a question earlier on the blog “what’s a Grok”. It comes from the sci-fi novel by Robert Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land. It is a word Heinlein invented for his Martian language that means “to know everything” or “to empathise” or “to understand someone else so thoroughly you become part of them” In other words it is super-nerdy and perhaps also MCB making a statement about ethical investing. Thank you to all our readers for the lovely community you have built. We truly appreciate it, and you. Aged care minister says facilities preparing for Covid outbreak Further to health minister Mark Butler’s press conference on Covid wave preparations, aged care minister Anika Wells says the government is also working to shore up the the nation’s nursing home settings with more personal protective gear. By Friday we will have contacted every aged care facility to check on their PPE and antiviral treatment supply,” she tweeted on Tuesday afternoon. Wells said the health department was “pre-deploying summer packs of PPE” to all residential aged care facilities, making booster shots and anti-viral drugs more available, and readying a surge workforce if needed. The government will also continue funding for the Covid-19 support grant to support providers with outbreak costs, and maintain support for the High-Risk Settings Pandemic Payment for casual workers to not attend work if they contract Covid. The government says it is trying to be “on the front foot” in aged care as the Covid wave continues. Chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said Australia was likely nearing the middle of this wave, which he expected to be “short and sharp”. Covid infections in Australia spiked 47% last week and government officials are urging people to get booster shots if they are eligible. New Covid vaccines approved to boost supply Melissa Davey has looked at Mark Butler’s announcement a little earlier this afternoon. Covid hospitalisations have increased by 11% in the past week, the federal health minister Mark Butler said, as he announced new vaccines have been approved to boost supply. A fifth vaccine dose has not been recommended by the Australian Technical Advisory Group of Immunisation (Atagi) for the general population at this time, Butler said. But he said this may change next year ahead of winter, particularly if other variants emerge. Butler said the Omicron subvariant XBB, now present in Australia, led to a “short and small” wave of infections in Singapore, with severe disease and death very rare for people who had at least two vaccine doses. Government moves to protect ABC funding Amanda Meade reports the Albanese government is looking at ways to protect the ABC’s funding no matter who is in power. The Albanese government is reviewing ways to protect the financial stability of the ABC after the public broadcaster lost $526m in funding under the Coalition. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, told Guardian Australia that on top of a new five-year funding cycle work was under way on a review of funding certainty. A public consultation in the new year will examine how more stability can be given to the national broadcasters to “safeguard against funding cuts and political interference”. You can read the rest of that report, here: Second Victorian independent candidate to challenge VEC on how-to-vote cards Victorian independent candidate for Hawthorn, Melissa Lowe, is also challenging the Victorian Electoral Commission’s (VEC) decision to reject her how-to-vote card: At 10.30am yesterday, I submitted my how-to-vote card to the Victorian Electoral Commission for registration. At 11.22am today, the VEC advised that they would be rejecting my HTV [card], stating: ‘The VEC is satisfied that the how-to-vote card is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in the casting of their vote because the how-to-vote instruction contained on the how-to-vote card does not contain a preference or sequence of preferences that would result in a formal vote, or is likely to result in the elector voting in a way that is inconsistent with their intent.’ This is despite my how-to-vote card prominently displaying instructions in four places to number every box according to the elector’s preferences. I have since taken legal advice and will be seeking an urgent hearing at VCAT to appeal this decision. The VEC has cited no evidentiary basis for its decision, which appears to have been made on subjective (rather than objective) grounds. Mark McGowan will not hold inquiry into youth prisons The Western Australia premier, Mark McGowan, has declines to hold an inquiry into the state’s youth prison, AAP reports. WA’s troubled youth prison system is “working incredibly well”, the premier said, but the use of dangerous restraint techniques will be reviewed. Disturbing footage has been shown on the ABC’s Four Corners program of a teenager being “folded up” at Perth’s Banksia Hill juvenile detention centre. The technique, which involves officers using their body weight to force a person’s arms and legs against their head, is considered to pose a risk of suffocation. McGowan said WA may follow Queensland in outlawing the practice but any ban would not come into effect immediately. “We’re going to go to the department and say … that other techniques need to be investigated to deal with these sorts of situations,” he told ABC radio on Tuesday. But they’re not easy situations for the staff. Our youth custodial officers have to deal with some very difficult situations. Prison officers were only authorised to use the folding-up restraint as a last resort when there was a safety risk to staff or other detainees, WA’s Department of Justice said. Aboriginal leaders have led calls for an independent inquiry into Banksia Hill, the state’s only dedicated juvenile prison. Detainees have been subjected to repeated lockdowns which were ruled unlawful earlier this year by the supreme court. A group of boys accused of destructive behaviour has since been moved to Unit 18, a separate wing at the maximum-security Casuarina adult prison. Children’s Court president Hylton Quail last month warned the government was at risk of being found in contempt over its continued use of lockdowns at the facilities.

Lawyers claim Catholic church is pressuring survivors into smaller payouts The Catholic church has been accused of using recent rulings to pressure child abuse survivors to accept “paltry” amounts in cases where alleged perpetrators have died. We reported this morning that the Catholic church had taken an increasingly aggressive approach in civil cases where alleged paedophile priests had died. That followed rulings in the New South Wales courts that permanently stayed cases where clergy had died. In those cases, the courts found that the church could not have a fair trial. The child abuse royal commission found that, on average, survivors took more than 20 years to come forward, meaning that many cases involve alleged perpetrators who have since died. But multiple law firms told the Guardian that the church was using the recent rulings to try to pressure survivors in such cases. The head of Arnold Thomas &amp; Becker’s abuse case team, Kim Price, said: We have absolutely seen a change in the behaviour of defendants since these rulings were delivered, in particular the Catholic church. Defendants now frequently threaten to stay a claim on the basis that they cannot have a ‘fair trial’ because of the delay taken by a survivor to come forward. Including, astoundingly, cases where the alleged paedophile has multiple victims. The threat usually relates to the perpetrator being deceased and unable to assist the defendant with their investigations or defence. Rightside Legal, based in Victoria, said it expects the church to use the tactic as its latest strategy to discourage survivors from pursuing civil action. Partner Grace Wilson said the NSW cases had not yet been mirrored in Victoria, but said: It’s pretty galling to survivors that a religious order can say, ‘Our paedophile priest, whom we did nothing to deter, is dead and we can’t properly defend the claim because of that.’ Mike Cannon-Brookes congratulates new AGL board members As noted in earlier posts, Mike Cannon-Brookes – the billionaire climate activist – has had some more success in shaping AGL’s future. Against the wishes of the board, all four of his picks for directors got the nod from shareholders at today’s annual general meeting for AGL. A spokesperson for Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures (his slightly discordantly named family company – one shareholder asked, “what’s a Grok?”) – said they congratulated Kerry Schott, Christine Holman, Mark Twidell, and Prof John Pollaers. Plus added a bouquet to Miles George who was also re-elected to the AGL board. AGL shareholders clearly believe that these five directors bring essential experience and credentials to the board. This represents another majority vote by AGL shareholders pointing to their desire for change, fresh thinking and more execution capacity to realise the potential of this great company. The AGL board has Grok Ventures’ full support to deliver on the monumental task ahead, of rebuilding the company to lead Australia’s green energy transition, for the benefit of all stakeholders. That sounds like a “get on with it” message, rather than “let’s shake things up more”. Let’s see if that’s the way it pans out. Here’s our article on the gathering: Victorian independent candidate to appeal against how-to-vote card rejection As Benita reported a little while ago, Sophie Torney, an independent candidate for Kew, has decided to appeal against the Victorian Electoral Commission’s rejection of her how-to-vote cards: Today the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) rejected our how-to-vote cards on the basis that the VEC believes they will mislead voters. This decision ignores significant evidence from the federal election where blank boxes on how-to-vote cards were used by several independent candidates. In the 2022 federal election, Kooyong independent candidate, Dr Monique Ryan, had blank boxes on her how-to-vote card with instructions to number every box. At that election, the informal vote in Kooyong was 2.89% – lower than the national average of 3.4%, lower than Victoria’s average of 3.5%, and lower than Kooyong in the 2019 federal election at 2.97%. The VEC’s position is that in order for us to display a replica of the ballot on our HTV card we must direct preferences, as the political parties do. That is undemocratic, party-centric and not supported by legislation. Due to the VEC’s decision today, we will not have any how-to-vote cards at mobile polling booths. The VEC’s decision unfairly discriminates against our campaign, prevents us from sharing information with Victoria’s most vulnerable voters, and will cost us votes. Victoria’s Electoral Commissioner, Warwick Gately, has failed to respond to our urgent letter of inquiry of Thursday 10 November. The VEC has failed to provide a rationale and evidence for their claim that our how-to-vote card could mislead voters. The VEC has offered only a subjective view on the matter. Our campaign has engaged legal representation and will challenge the decision in VCAT. Medical experts concerned ‘hospitals have relaxed or removed mask requirements’ On some of the confusion around mask use in hospitals, Mel Davey has this story: Chief health officer says to consider wearing masks The chief health officer asks people who are at risk of Covid complications to consider wearing masks. That is good advice for anyone. Kelly also says he thinks Australia is in the middle of this latest wave. Two shipments of the new Pfizer vaccine are due in Australia in the next two weeks. Chief health officer says antivirals important to prevent severe illness Prof Paul Kelly expands on the need to have an anti-viral plan if you are 50 and over with two risk factors or over 70: For example, a person over 70 who, even those that have three or four dose of vaccine, can halve the rate of death by taking the tablets. Halve the rate of death. It is incredibly important to get those treatments as quick as possible within a day of being diagnosed as best but up to five days, it would also make a difference in both your chance of severe illness lengthy hospitalisation or indeed of dying from Covid. Vulnerable people should speak to GP about antivirals – Butler People over the age of 50 with two risk factors are being encouraged to have a plan with their doctor to be able to access antivirals in the case they test positive with Covid. Mark Butler: We know even from recent evidence from Victoria, just again, how important antivirals can be in protecting vulnerable Australians from severe disease, hospitalisation or even worse. The health minister Mark Butler says Atagi has not recommended a fifth dose: Atagi has considered international evidence as well as the local data around the vaccination numbers as well as case numbers in the pandemic. And decided not to recommend a fifth dose or a third booster, if you like. At this point in time. They have said they anticipate new booster recommendations being made in early 2023 in preparation for the southern hemisphere winter. Liberal MP says report of bullying and harassment in NSW parliament was ‘not surprising’ The leader of the New South Wales parliamentary advisory group of MPs, and current and former staff, Leslie Williams, has followed up O’Dea’s statement with one on behalf of the group. She acknowledged the harms that had occurred including abuses of leadership positions, the progress that had been made and what was still to be done following the Broderick report. The Liberal MP said while the extent of bullying and harassment claims captured in the report was “both disturbing and confronting” it was also “not surprising” for many. She told the parliament: We as an advisory group want to convey to all survivors, we stand with you, and we look forward to working collaboratively to address the recommendations to ensure that the NSW parliament and elected offices are safe and respectful places to work. We make a strong and unequivocal commitment to work towards change that will ensure a positive professional supportive culture for all. She explained the plans of the advisory group moving forward: We will recognise the unique and escalated risks of misconduct experienced by people of diverse gender, race and sexuality, Aboriginal people and people with disability. We will value and respect the role of survivors and their representatives in designing and monitoring responses to the risks of misconduct and we will ensure that the contributions of underrepresented voices are actively sought out and taken into account. Here is the media release for those who can’t read the tweet: Atagi has found this next generation vaccine triggers a modest improvement in the immune response against both strains. This vaccine and the original vaccines still provide significant protection from severe disease against Omicron subvariant infections. The first doses of the bivalent vaccine have arrived in the country and are undergoing batch testing by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Rollout of this vaccine will commence from 12 December 2022. This is the second bivalent vaccine approved for use in Australia. The Moderna Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine has been available for people aged 18 years or older since 14 October 2022. A separate recommendation from ATAGI to make the paediatric Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine available for certain at-risk children aged 6 months to under 5 years has also been accepted. This vaccine will become available for eligible children from mid-January 2023. The Pfizer vaccine is being restricted to children who are severely immunocompromised or who have other specific conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19. Government has also approved Pfizer’s Omicron-specific booster vaccine. Covid vaccination update Mark Butler is holding a press conference with the chief health officer, Dr Paul Kelly. That is after Atagi gave this advice on immunisation: “Atagi recommends the Pfizer 6 month to 4 years Covid-19 vaccine as a primary course of vaccination against Sars-CoV-2 for children aged 6 months to 4 years with severe immunocompromise, complex or multiple health conditions, or disability with significant or complex health needs. “This includes children with the following or similar conditions: Severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including those undergoing treatment for cancer, or on immunosuppressive treatments as listed in the Atagi advice on 3rd primary doses of Covid-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised. Bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or chimeric antigen T-cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients. Complex congenital cardiac disease. Structural airway anomalies or chronic lung disease. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Chronic neurological or neuromuscular conditions. A disability with significant or complex health needs, such as severe cerebral palsy or Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). “The Pfizer 6 months to 4 years vaccine requires 3 primary doses, each containing 3mcg of mRNA. Atagi recommends an interval of 8 weeks between each dose. Children with severe immunocompromise are also recommended to receive three primary doses. Atagi will update this recommendation if future evidence demonstrates a need for additional doses. “Atagi currently recommends the administration of Covid-19 vaccines be deferred for 3 months after a confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination after this interval is likely to provide a better immunological response and optimise the duration of protection.” Queensland police commissioner’s future under scrutiny – reports The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, says she is “hoping” to keep her job after the release of an inquiry report that is understood to be critical of her leadership. Carroll and the police minister, Mark Ryan, held an hour-long press conference on Tuesday morning. Most questions were about Guardian Australia’s reporting on the Brisbane city watch house tapes, which recorded officers using racist and violent language. Carroll said: The stuff that we heard in the watch house is truly abhorrent. It’s tough to stand here and listen to that being said and I know that I have apologised and I apologise again. A report in the Australian on Tuesday said the final report of the inquiry into QPS responses to domestic violence was critical of Carroll. Guardian Australia understands the report includes an entire section on leadership and that Carroll’s future is being discussed by the state government, ahead of the release of the report next week. Ryan said Carroll had his confidence. She would need the confidence of the cabinet to continue. Asked if she thought she would survive, Carroll said: I am hoping to survive. I actually believe that I am the person to take this organisation forward. AGL shareholders unimpressed with remuneration plan for executives AGL Energy’s AGM continues with the chair, Patricia McKenzie, retaining support from shareholders for now. Shareholders, were less enamoured with the company’s remuneration plan (which also includes four more directors after today) – delivering what looks to be the first “strike” about executive pay. Reaction to the new directors – a win for Mike Cannon-Brookes – was initially positive on the stock market itself. Shares were up about 1% on the news, but have given up their gains to be roughly unchanged by midday. Among the reactions, director of independent thinktank Climate Energy Finance and energy finance analyst, Tim Buckley, who says today was a “turning point for the company”. AGL has been by far the biggest carbon emitter in Australia, and a global laggard in accepting and acting on the climate science. This board renewal is critical for AGL investors given the opportunity to start to reverse the $10bn of shareholder wealth destruction in the last six years, but also for the wider context given AGL is a key Australian energy sector incumbent, with financial resources and staffing that can be leveraged constructively, with the right leadership. NSW parliament acknowledges bullying and harassment Harms caused by poor behaviour in the New South Wales parliament have been acknowledged in a statement delivered by the house speaker, Jonathan O’Dea. The statement comes following the Broderick review that found systemic bullying and widespread sexual harassment in parliament. O’Dea said: Today, as we near the end of the parliamentary term, we deliver this statement of acknowledgment on behalf of the NSW parliament. We sincerely apologise to all those who have experienced bullying, sexual harassment or sexual misconduct in any of the parliament’s workplaces. We acknowledge the harms caused and deeply regret the trauma experienced by some here in this parliament and in our offices that serve the communities of NSW. We acknowledge your pain and the mental stress and anguish caused by such behaviour. We understand the lasting impact of your experiences. We thank those who came forward to share their lived experiences and observations as part of the review. We acknowledge how hard it is to speak up about these issues. Your courage will help to create the safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces we all deserve. He said the implementation plan to deal with the recommendations made by Broderick would be released shortly. Five years since Australia’s marriage equality vote For many people, today is not a commemoration, but a reminder of just how much people had to go through: Science minister thanks outgoing CSIRO chief for ‘dedicated service’ The federal science minister, Ed Husic, has responded to the news the CSIRO chief executive, Dr Larry Marshall, is finishing up in June 2023: Dr Marshall has steered CSIRO through a rapidly changing scientific environment. A period of much scientific promise amid global turbulence, particularly through the Covid pandemic. When he completes his term in June next year, Dr Marshall will have been the national science agency’s longest serving chief executive in the past 50 years. Undoubtedly he will leave the organisation with a lasting legacy and I thank him for his dedicated service. Husic paid tribute to achievements the body made under Marshall’s tenure, including the launch of the CSIRO missions program, which brought together Australia’s top researchers and research bodies, with government, industry and community to try to address some of the nation’s most pressing issues. Husic finished with: I particularly welcomed the opportunity in August to launch CSIRO National Vaccine and Therapeutics Lab alongside Dr Marshall. CSIRO’s contribution to Australia’s resilience during the pandemic cannot be overstated. And it will play a vital role in developing sovereign capability in the years to come. The Commonwealth Bank has reported a $2.5bn profit in the September quarter – 13% more than it made in the same period last year. AAP reports the unaudited figures show the bank’s operating performance was also up 12% from the last two quarters. The CBA chief executive, Matt Comyn, said: In a competitive environment we remained disciplined and achieved good volume growth in our core markets. The economy has shown resilience in the face of growing cost of living and interest rate pressures and despite these near-term challenges we remain optimistic on the medium to long term outlook. Also reported – household deposits have grown by 8.6% year on year, home lending increased by 6.3% and business lending rose by 12.6%. The number of loans and assets the bank considered to be “troublesome and impaired” fell slightly from 0.48% to 0.45% since the last quarterly report. All in all, that saw share prices increase 1.4% to $106.53. The Victorian electoral commission has rejected the how-to-vote cards of at least four independent candidates who placed a “1” beside their names only. Nomi Kaltmann in Caulfield, Kate Lardner in Mornington, Melissa Lowe in Hawthorn and Sophie Torney in Kew have all told Guardian Australia the VEC rejected their how-to vote cards, which had the number one beside their names and blank preference boxes next to other candidates. The same type of cards were distributed at the federal election in May by independents Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel. Under Victoria’s Electoral Act, how-to-vote cards for election day must be registered with the commission and indicate the voting preference for all candidates listed on the card, or contain a statement that a number must be placed against the name of each candidate. In 2018, the independent MP for Shepparton, Suzanna Sheed, unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the rejection of her how-to-vote card due to blank boxes at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Kaltmann, Larder, Lowe and Torney, who are all being backed by Simon Holmes à Court’s Climate 200 outfit, are considering taking legal action. The ACT chief coroner, Lorraine Walker, has tested positive for Covid, resulting in the hearings for the inquest into Canberra’s 2020 summer bushfires being postponed until 2023, AAP reports. The inquest was announced in July 2021, but the wait for information on how it took 45 minutes for an army helicopter’s crew to alert the ACT Emergency Service Agency they had started a fire will continue. On Monday, the court heard the crew on board the MRH-90 Taipan helicopter were landing for a toilet break when they inadvertently ignited the monster blaze. They were scouting remote helipads in preparation for bushfire season, when they landed with their searchlight still on and started the fire in the Orroral Valley. An onboard recording heard one of the helicopter’s passengers yell “Come up, come up, we’ve started a fire, turn the searchlight off”. The helicopter only stopped for about one minute before returning to Canberra airport, but neither the pilots nor their passengers contacted emergency services to let them know they had started a fire, which one pilot estimated was already “200m by 200m” when they evacuated. The pilot said he was “concerned we were going to fall out of the sky” because of aircraft damage. The fire, which burned for five weeks, was declared out of control after 6pm when more than 1000ha were alight and would eventually grow to burn 87,923ha throughout the ACT. Walker opened proceedings by saying the inquest wasn’t about “crucifying any individual or decision made in the heat of the moment”. “We’re here to explore how we can learn from it with a view to enhancing everyone’s safety in the future,” she said. Acting eSafety commissioner in contact with local Twitter representatives Australia’s eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant wrote to Twitter’s new boss Elon Musk earlier this month expressing concern about the mass sackings at the company and what it might mean for the company’s ability to comply with Australian law when it comes to child protection and dealing with online harassment and abuse. The acting commissioner Toby Dagg told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that Twitter had since been in contact with the commissioner’s office since the letter to confirm that people in the company are still contactable: I’m pleased to say we’ve re-established those connections. Dagg did not say who he was in contact with, but said it was local and regional representatives for Twitter. Dagg said there had not been a marked increase in the number of reports made about Twitter since the takeover. In response to questions from Greens senator David Shoebridge about why eSafety had not taken a proactive approach in investigating problems on the service, Dagg said eSafety could not “police the internet” and Twitter was a huge website, so the organisation is reliant on complaints being made. If you haven’t read it as yet, this from Peter Lewis raises some interesting questions: For cricket followers, Pat Cummins has some news, as AAP reports: Cummins’ decision to forego a $1.3m Indian Premier League (IPL) pay cheque has exposed cricket’s overloaded calendar, with Australia’s best players set for more than 100 days of international games in the next 12 months. Cummins made the call on Tuesday morning to skip next year’s IPL tournament for the Kolkata Knight Riders, pointing to a heavy international workload. Australia have a four-Test tour of India next February and March before the tournament, followed by an Ashes series in England and one-day World Cup in India. Cummins’ decision comes just weeks after he was elevated to the captaincy of Australia’s one-day team, meaning he will probably feature in more white-ball series before next year’s global event. He tweeted: I’ve made the difficult decision to miss next years IPL. The international schedule is packed with Tests and ODI’s for the next 12 months, so will take some rest ahead of an Ashes series and World Cup.” When factoring in all Tests this summer as well as one-day and T20 series on the road in 2023, Australia’s players have up to 106 days of international cricket in the next 12 months. That figure includes a possible World Test Championship final in London with Australia currently top of the table, as well as the semi-finals and final of next year’s ODI World Cup. The problem is most significant for fast bowlers Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, and allrounder Cameron Green who will each play against England in ODIs this week. David Warner, Alex Carey, Steve Smith, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne also play across both red and white-ball formats, meaning nine of Australia’s top XI are now regulars in the Test and one-day teams. ABC reports Australian navy was tracked by Chinese military last month The ABC’s defence correspondent, Andrew Greene, has reported two Australian warships were “closely tracked” by the Chinese military last month, as they travelled in the South China Sea. That was part of naval exercises with the US and Japan. Greene reports: Officials with knowledge of the operation say destroyer HMAS Hobart and auxiliary tanker HMAS Stalwart sailed close to the Spratly Islands and were challenged by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in international waters claimed by China. The interaction with the PLA occurred during a ‘regional presence deployment’, where the Australian navy was accompanied by the Japanese destroyer JS Kirisame and US navy destroyer USS Milius for a trilateral transit of the South China Sea. One defence figure, speaking to the ABC on the condition of anonymity, said the Chinese military closely tracked the vessels and showed a ‘significant increase in tactical acumen and use of EM (electronic warfare) capabilities’. Guardian Australia understands that AGL energy’s climate plan has been approved by shareholders. The number voting in favour isn’t yet known, but the proposal has the numbers. Mike Cannon-Brookes, via his Grok Ventures family company, had been pressing AGL to do more than was proposed. In short, he argued the decarbonisation approach taken by the company implied a path consistent with a world heating 1.8C v pre-industrial era levels He wanted a plan consistent with a 1.5C path, but that meant exiting coal faster than AGL wanted. In September, AGL announced it would bring forward the closure date of its Loy Yang A brown coal-fired power station in Victoria by a decade to 2035 while leaving its black-coal burning Bayswater power station in NSW running until between 2030 and 2033. AGL’s Liddell plant, also in NSW, shuts next April. So, AGL thinks shareholders are satisfied with this plan. One question is whether Cannon-Brookes, with his 11.3% or so holding in AGL, will stay put – especially if he thinks he has a more supportive board. Victorian Labor pledges $71m for women’s health The Andrews government has vowed to deliver a $71m women’s health funding package if it wins this months’ state election. Healthcare is a key battleground in the state election. Under the funding, $58m would be delivered for 20 new women’s health clinics across the state. The state government has also pledged to almost double sexual and reproductive hubs across the state as part of a $6.4m package. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said the funding was about “equity” and “funding.” Victoria’s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said women’s health issues had been routinely ignored by the sector. Thomas said the sexual health hubs would be a “one-stop shop” for women in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. An update from Katharine Murphy at G20 Good morning from the G20 meeting in Bali. Events yesterday moved at a clip so readers might appreciate a short stock take of where things are up to. After days of speculation about whether or not Australia’s prime minister would meet the Chinese president when both delegates arrived in Bali, Anthony Albanese confirmed the meeting was on minutes after disembarking his aircraft on Monday. If you’ve been hanging on the daily news of the summit season, you’ll know Joe Biden met Xi Jinping face-to-face for the first time in the Biden presidency last night on the sidelines of the G20 in an effort to reset great power relations. So Albanese’s meeting with the president will be the focal point of the day but it will be this evening Australia time (around 7pm). Meanwhile, the G20 has opened in Bali. I’m watching arrivals now. Australia’s former finance minister Mathias Cormann, now head of the OECD, has just made a jaunty entrance along the red carpet. Apart from tonight’s meeting, Albanese will participate in today’s summit events considering energy, food security and global health. AGL Energy’s board will expand with all four of the candidates put up by tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes winning support from shareholders ahead of today’s annual general meeting in Melbourne this morning. AGL’s chair, Paticia McKenzie, has opening the meeting by stating: Based on the proxies lodged ahead of the meeting, the election of Mark Twidell, Dr Kerry Schott, Christine Holman and John Pollaers as directors has been supported by our shareholders. The board welcomes these new directors to the board and will work constructively with them in the best of interests of shareholders. MCB, as the Atlassian founder and climate activist is known, backed these four in September, claiming they would be independent. (Schott, a former head of the Energy Security Board, was reported in the AFR as saying she had never spoken to Cannon-Brookes.) AGL’s board had only supported Twidell, a solar energy veteran, ahead of the vote. Anyway, assuming Miles George, a wind energy specialist, is also of a like mind to MCB, it’s possible to count five of the nine board members as being particularly pro-renewables. More to come, as the AGM rolls on. Small businesses in Forbes are preparing for their second major flood in two weeks, with many having to once again lift or remove their stock and close up, hoping the damage is minimal. The Forbes CBD has completely shut down as flood waters rise, with many small business owners lamenting the lost business during what should be a busy period. Business owner and head of the Forbes Business Chamber, Margaret Duggan, said some businesses could lose up to 50% of stock and trade. This should be a positive and happy time, its a time of harvest, and its close to Christmas, but its deja-vu once again after the floods last week. People are very anxious about what’s going to happen, we’re planning for the worst and hoping it doesn’t happen. Duggan said that while residents had been keeping a positive mindset, and were resilient, there are concerns for the mental health of business owners in the town. We had businesses lose 25% to 30% of turnover when the main highway into the town was closed due to flood waters. We’re mentally trying to prepare, but the repeat floods take their toll. Lots of places are damaged already, water has gotten into places its never been before. We’ve never had this kind of ran before, and we’re on flat ground so its all water logged. It’s just a waiting game now. The head of CSIRO for the past eight years, Larry Marshall, will exit the post when his third term ends in June 2023, Australia’s national science agency said this morning. The chair of the CSIRO board, Kathryn Fagg, said: Dr Marshall has led CSIRO to deliver significant scientific breakthroughs, translate its research into real world solutions and deliver a staggering benefit for our nation – eight times the investment. Marshall thanked the 5,672 people from CSIRO “who bring their best every day for the nation”: It is a rare privilege to work with people so driven to achieve for the benefit of a nation and its people. Over the past eight years, together we have reignited Australia’s ambition to solve our greatest challenges with science. Marshall’s term, the longest in half a century, was not without its controversies, none bigger perhaps than his aborted effort to cull most of climate science at the agency. (As was reported here at the time.) Lately, some of the wariness about CSIRO’s commitment to climate science surfaced when the agency scrapped its fully funded decadal climate research (and forgot to tell the World Meteorological Organization about it). Hints that the Albanese government wasn’t entirely happy with CSIRO showed up with the science minister, Ed Husic, warning the agency about “renting out its brand”. Similarly, the agency’s plan to accelerate the commercialisation of science at CSIRO – potentially at the expense of science that might have broader public benefit – raised fresh questions about the direction of the agency. Something for Marshall’s successor to consider. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg is still hopeful he will get his crypto bill up. Queensland youth prison expansion does not address drivers of offending, expert says Queensland has more children in detention than any other jurisdiction in the country, AAP reports. The state’s adult prison population also surged 68% over the past decade – the fastest pace of growth in the country, according to a Justice Reform Initiative report released on Tuesday. Almost nine in 10 of all children in detention in the state are yet to be sentenced, while the number of youths in detention under the age of 17 has risen from 172 to 219 since 2014-15. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are also significantly over-represented in the figures, making up 35% of the adult prison population and nearly 63% of young people. The rate of incarceration for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is 33 times the rate for non-Indigenous children. According to the report, the “revolving door” model costs Queensland taxpayers $716.9m a year in prison operating costs and this is set to grow further as the incarceration rate continues to climb. The growth in incarceration has been driven “by political, policy and legislative choices”, it said. The Justice Reform Initiative executive director, Dr Mindy Sotiri, said building more prisons, as the Queensland government was planning to do with its proposed $500m youth prison expansion, did not work to deter crime or rehabilitate offenders. “This is a shortsighted and counterproductive policy that will make it more likely that vulnerable children will commit further offences and become trapped in the revolving prison door that has become a devastating feature of Queensland’s justice system,” she said. Holding children in detention fails to address the underlying drivers of incarceration, she added. Sotiri said taxpayers would be far better served by investment in early intervention, diversion and evidence-based alternatives outside the youth justice system. In New South Wales, Forbes is preparing for what could be the worst flooding its ever seen, with the Lachlan River already rising higher than expected. The town’s deputy mayor, Chris Roylance, said Forbes had been “cut in half” by the rising flood waters, and that the CBD had been emptied by evacuation orders. My wife was one of the last cars through now, the town is about to be cut in half. The river was expected to get to 10.55 metres, and its already at 10.62. I’ve lived through many floods in my time here, but this will be the biggest we’ve ever seen. The town has been cut off by the rising flood waters, with roads in and out currently blocked. Roylance said the CBD looked like a “war zone”, but added that the community sentiment was still positive. Everyone is prepared, we’re all sandbagged and set, we’re just sitting around waiting. We told people to get out and make sure they didn’t wait around, so the CBD has been emptied out. It looks like a war zone down there, with plastic covers all over and sandbags everywhere. We’re worried, but prepared. CSIRO chief to leave science organisation after term ends The CSIRO is about to receive (another) shake up. The science agency’s chief executive, Larry Marshall, will leave in June. (As an aside, the CSIRO is an excellent Instagram follow, if you aren’t following already.) Australian physicians back Raise the Age campaign The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) is part of the Raise the Age campaign, calling on governments to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14, which is in line with medical evidence and advice. Children as young as 10 years old are being locked up in Australian detention centres, despite medical evidence showing they are too young to take responsibility for what they have done. The RACP president and paediatrician, Dr Jacqueline Small, said children need help, not prisons. The college has been campaigning for years for state and territories to raise the age of criminal responsibility. Incarcerating children this young causes serious harms for them and their communities. 14 years old is the absolute youngest age a child should be held criminally responsible, and we’ve been very disappointed to see the NT government attempt this reform, only to miss the mark with an age of 12. More must be done to ensure children are not incarcerated for behaviours that are a direct consequence of their young age, their disability or their earlier trauma and provide these children with the care, support and treatment that they need and that preserves their dignity and human rights. Exposure to the criminal legal system has direct consequences on the education, development, mental and physical health, and adult incarceration rates, on these children. Tasmania flood advice warning for Tahune Bridge area The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a minor flood warning for the Huon River: A “flood advice – monitor conditions” warning has been issued for Tahune Bridge and surrounds by Tasmania SES. Locations likely to be affected are: Tahune Bridge and surrounds During the next 12 to 24 hours: Flooding in nearby streams and rivers is likely. Some low-lying properties may become isolated by flood waters. Property, livestock, equipment, and crops in low lying areas may be at risk from flood waters. Driving conditions may be dangerous. If you live in or are travelling near the Tahune Bridge and surrounds, SES advises: If you have a flood emergency plan, check it now. Monitor conditions and prepare now to go to a safer place if conditions become more dangerous. For SES Flood Warning updates, visit TasALERT.com or listen to ABC local radio. Have your Medibank records been posted online? You can tell us your story In the past week, we have seen a bit over 1,000 Medibank customer records being posted on the dark web by a Russian hacking group after the Australian health insurer refused to pay a ransom to the company. If you are one of those people who were included in the records posted online, and feel comfortable telling your story to us (your name and details can be anonymised) please get in contact with reporter Josh Taylor by email at josh.taylor@theguardian.com. Just noting that Medibank will have likely contacted you more directly to tell you what ended up online and have assigned you a case manager if that is the case. If you’ve just received an email informing you that your data was taken – it doesn’t yet mean it has been posted online. Later this morning, we’ll get the Reserve Bank of Australia’s minutes from its 1 November meeting when it raised its cash rate for a record seventh time in as many meetings. Ahead of that 11.30am (AEDT) release, it’s worth looking at how consumer sentiment has been holding up. According to the latest weekly survey from ANZ and Roy Morgan, confidence actually perked up a bit, with the 2.7% snapping six weeks of declines that lowered the index more than 10%. We’re still down in the dumps, apparently, although still spending like we’re emerging from lockdowns all cashed-up. While many sub-indices have lately improved, the “good time to buy a major household item” gauge has retreated further – and is the lowest since the April 2020 Covid wave. As the ANZ’s top Australian economist, David Plank, notes there’s a paradox in that “household spending has held up despite the weakness in sentiment”. Whether this disconnect can continue is a central issue for policymakers. (By which he mostly has the RBA in mind.) In fact, inflation expectations have also eased in the past week, and are steady on a rolling four-week average: That’s interesting since fuel prices have continued to nudge towards the $2 a litre mark, according to the Australian Institute of Petroleum. Speaking of energy, more than a few people will be watching AGL Energy‘s annual general meeting that kicks off in Melbourne at 10.30am AEDT. (You can follow it here.) It’s something of a clash of the titans, with Atlassian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes effectively trying to change the board of AGL and potentially upend the remaining leaders on Australia’s largest electricity generator. We published this primer on Sunday to set the scene at the Melbourne Recital Centre here: As bad as the floods are for New South Wales and Victoria of late, it’s worth keeping in mind that the tropical cyclone season is also under way. Now, it worth noting that in an average year, we should get about 11 tropical cyclones in the Australian region for the November-April period. During La Niña years, odds tend to favour a busier than usual season, and that’s what the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting – that there’s a 75% chance this season will get more than 11. As it happens, the number of tropical cyclones has been of decline in the past couple of decades even as waters have warmed. But a new science paper out recently suggested the decline may be natural variability, and conditions may snap back to longer-run averages. We have written about the paper here today: A couple of key take-aways include that cyclones are likely to get more intense and keep that intensity longer (in large part because of those warming waters). Also of worry is the prospect that these tempests will travel further south (or north, in the northern hemisphere). We got a taste for that last year when tropical cyclone Seroja crossed much further south on the Western Australia coast than is usual for a cyclone (let alone one that was of category three severity): As noted by Andrew Watkins, a senior BoM scientist, we saw a Gold Coast cyclone in the 1950s. But, of course, we have a lot more people in south-east Queensland and northern NSW now than we did seven decades ago (more than 3 million). Australia’s biggest insurer, IAG, supported that cyclone research. They think it’s time to consider strengthening our building codes to limit future damage – and step up retrofitting efforts. Anyway, a reminder that a hotter world, with a more energetic atmosphere, is something we need to both work against (limiting emissions) and prepare for. Good morning everyone and very big thank you to Tash for taking us through a very busy morning. If you are in the New South Wales central-west, we are thinking of you and we will keep you updated with any new information as it comes to hand. I am bidding you farewell for now. It’s a surprise treat as we have Amy Remeikis back on the blog outside parliament sitting! The BoM spokesperson moves on to other river systems beyond the Lachlan: Turning to the Macquarie River and specifically Bathurst, we have major flooding occurring at Bathurst. The river at Bathurst peaked at 6.64 metres around yesterday afternoon. It is currently falling and that level is very similar to the flooding that they had in 1998 at 6.69 metres. It’s currently at four and a bit metres and it’s falling but it’s still in the major flood category for Bathurst. Turning to the Bulubula and Mendageri Creek which feed into the Lachlan we had major flooding at Canowindra and Eugowra, of course. For Canowindra, upstream, that has peaked at 7.79 metres yesterday morning. And that is the highest peak it’s had in 70 years according to hydrologists this morning. So that’s a significant flood for the town of Canowindra. In Eugowra, of course, it’s peaked and it is falling but it’s had significant impacts. The levels are around the 9-metre mark. In Tamworth, moderate flooding is occurring. The Tamworth Road Bridge peaked at 5.35 metres last night. It’s currently falling but it’s in the moderate flood range. For the Tumut and Murrumbidgee Rivers, we have major flooding higher than the September 1974 flood occurring at Hay. I’ll point to Hay specifically as that’s the most significant one in that area. It’s 9m and it’s rising with major flooding. And it may stay that way right through till Wednesday. And just a brief touch on the Murray and the Edwards River. Major flooding higher than the 1975 flooding occurring at Yacool Junction there and possibly at Boundary Bend, Euston, Mildura and Wentworth as flood waters move further south. The Bureau of Meterology spokesperson moves onto floods: For the floods, the focus is on the fact that we still have 17 flood warnings issued for the state. Eight of those are in a major category and they’re the focus of today. They’re affecting about 25 locations. Moving through some of these catchments, probably in order of significance right now, for the Lachlan River and Lachlan catchment, we have major flooding occurring at Forbes and we have a reach mark of 10.8 metres possible this afternoon. That’s similar to the June 1952 flood. We have major flooding at Cowra, Nanami, Cottons Weir and Jemalong Weir. I’ll focus on this particular catchment for some details. For Cowra in particular we have a peak of 14.3 metres. It’s steady at the moment. In November, it peaked at 13.5 metres, so it’s a metre above the early November peak. If you’re wondering how that peak arrived, Cowra from a rainfall event over the weekend had 121mm and according to records this morning, that’s the highest daily rainfall at the Cowra ag station in 118 years. For the Lachlan and the Namoi, the town of Namoi it may reach 13.6 metres this afternoon. Earlier this November, it was 13.4. In Forbes, the Ironbridge may reach 10.8 metres this afternoon – for context, the flood in Forbes in earlier November was 10.67 metres. Further downstream for Cottons Weir, it may reach 7.3 metres today. Potential for further rise is possible as more water is coming down. Downstream of the Lachlan, I want to point to Condoblin. Condoblin Bridge is currently at 7.35 metres and steady. It does have major flooding and it’s likely that it may remain around 7.4 metres through to Thursday. So it’s a significant lag in the way it moves away from the bridge there. In Euabalong, it may reach 7.4 metres around 20 November, as the flood peaks move further south or further along the river. And it’s slightly below the 1952 flood. Significant cooling of conditions in NSW, as more November snow predicted: BoM A representative from the NSW Bureau of Meteorology is up next – they’re providing a general update of weather conditions before giving flood-specific info. The good news is the rain and thunderstorm risk we experienced over the weekend has eased and abated. There is still a slight chance of thunderstorms around the Hunter to the mid north coast today. But largely you’ll see settled conditions across much of the state. Conditions are cooling off today in the southern districts and they’ll be the first to feel a fairly significant cold snap. The rest of the state into tomorrow, Wednesday, will start to see temperatures drop to eight or 10 degrees below average, which is a significant cooling of conditions for this time of year. That is likely to lead to frost for the tablelands, very unseasonable for November, and we will likely see some snow on the Alps this week. That said, it is generally settled. The next front that is lining up in the west of the state or over in the Bight is scheduled around the weekend. Power outages and communication problems due to flooding in Eugowra York goes on to say flooding has also seen power outages which has caused people to become concerned for loved ones they are unable to reach: So there are a number of power outages and communication problems around the Eugowra area and the broader geographical area of Eugowra. A number of people have obviously heeded our warnings and evacuated early, but, because of the communication problems, sometimes you can’t reach your friends and loved ones, and family are concerned. I’d remind you of the benefit of registering at the Red Cross’s Register Find Reunite. It’s important if you have not gone to an evacuation centre but have left your home, that you registered on the site – Register, Find, Reunite – so we aren’t sending out resources to search for you when you are safe and well at other premises. York also reminded farmers to keep their animals dry: There are many rural properties severely affected by these floods and, again, particularly downstream of Forbes we’re asking those farmers to ensure their livestock are put to higher ground so they are safe as well. York has reiterated that “the flood risk remains high for weeks and months to come”. Carlene York, NSW SES commissioner takes the mic saying this flood event has required the biggest operations in the state’s history. The New South Wales SES are leading what would be the biggest operations in relation to flood response across New South Wales in its history. And I thank our emergency services partners to be able to go out and meet the community’s needs and respond to their requests for assistance. Our main area of focus today is Eugowra and as mentioned, at Forbes, so what we’re seeing is a number of creeks and rivers flowing into that Lachlan river area, flowing down into Forbes and then expected to flood further downstream from Forbes. York says rivers are now rising more quickly than expected in the central west: Yesterday, we had an immense amount of requests by communities for our assistance in flood rescues in the Eugowra area and it did rise much quicker than we had expected, as is Forbes today, rising quicker than we had expected. It was incredibly serious and significant. We saw river heights double in size through to 8am on Monday morning, where it peaked at 9.75 metres and the emergency warning was issued at 6.14am. We received 180 requests for assistance and 159 flood rescues, many off roofs of houses and businesses. We’ve been able to preposition resources there but when calls for assistance came, we moved many more resources and helicopters to assist in those flood rescues. We had over 140 emergency service personnel assisting that community. We had 14 helicopters and we have four that are helping us move our resources around that can’t get down the roads because of flooded waters down those roads so today not only are we helping to respond downstream from Forbes but we’re starting rapid damage assessments. We have 100 additional ADF personnel coming in to assist us today and we have 12 personnel from New Zealand fire and emergency services come and help us. Condobolin entirely isolated by flooding, as schools all along Lachlan River closed Cooke: We are also turning our attention to downstream of Forbes. Once the peak passes through Forbes, we know the lower Lachlan area has been in major flood now for 12 months and, again. Our heart goes out to the communities of Condobolin which are entirely isolated at this point. We have schools all along the lower Lachlan who are closed at present. We have children learning from home and assisting their families on properties as required. Cooke: Everyone across New South Wales today is thinking of the communities right across the central west, where we’ve seen inundation in many communities, including Canowindra, Eugowra and Molong. We are deploying as many resources as we possibly can to get into those communities as quickly as that flood water recedes, so that we can do those rapid damage assessments and get people back into their homes. We now have 70 local government areas that are the subject of a natural disaster declaration as a result of this event, which is now in its 63rd day. And so our focus at this time is really two-pronged. We are still in the emergency response in many communities and that includes as the premier has mentioned, Forbes and Eugowra, and we are in the early stages of recovery in places like Molong and Canowindra. Up to 600 homes and businesses to be inundated in Forbes NSW emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, is up next: Overnight we’ve seen the river levels at Forbes increase faster than expected which has led forward to the bring forward of the evacuation order from 9:00am to 7:00am this morning. We’ve got around 1,000 properties covered about by that order, hundreds of people, and we are expecting that 500 to 600 homes and businesses will experience inundation from the flooding that we anticipate to come through Forbes because we’re anticipating similar river levels there, around 10.88m over the days ahead, similar to what that community experienced just two weeks ago. It’s devestating for the Forbes community that they are experiencing this once again and particularly in such a short period of time. Many of those residents have not been able to return to their home from the flooding two weeks ago and are now facing a situation where their home is likely to be inundated again. This is not just people’s houses. This is their homes. It’s their belongings, their memories, their livelihoods and futures. One hundred ADF personnel to assist NSW flood efforts Perrottet thanks the defence minister, and acting prime minister, Richard Marles, for the support that Australian defence personnel have provided flood affected communities. I want to thank the acting prime minister, Richard Marles. I spoke to him yesterday in relation to getting additional ADF support. We’ll have more boots on the ground today, an additional 100 ADF personnel. The cooperation between the federal government, the state government and local councils in those areas has been incredibly important in making sure that care and support is there. Perrottet said there are also more than 14 aircraft from the SES, ADF, police and Surf Life Saving that have been rescuing many people in the Eugowra area. A press conference is happening at the NSW emergency operations centre. Premier Dominic Perrottet is up first: Over the last 24 hours, we’ve had over 900 requests for assistance. There have been 222 flood rescues. There’s obviously concerns for our communities in Eugowra and Forbes, particularly Forbes this morning, where evacuation orders are in in place. Those evacuation orders affect properties, impacting hundreds of people. I say to the community in Forbes we will be with you every step of the way. We were only there two weeks ago. They have gone through flood event after flood event after flood event. We do expect a difficult period of time over the next couple of days … We know for many communities in the central west, there is a lot of pain and hurt. We’ve got through these challenges in the past and will get through them again. Australia spearheads online safety push Australia’s eSafety Commission will team with online regulators from the UK, Ireland and Fiji to create new laws combating abuse, harmful content and illegal material on social networks. Representatives for the four countries announced their partnership at a conference in Washington DC on Tuesday, revealing the global online safety regulators network would collaborate on an “international approach to online safety regulation”. The news comes after Australia introduced a world-first adult cyber abuse scheme and Online Safety Act in January, and follows major cutbacks to online safety and moderation teams at Twitter and Facebook this month. The collaboration received early praise from social media experts who said the fight against online abuse and trolls needed “all the firepower” it could get. The group will be made of Australia’s eSafety Commission, UK communications regulator Ofcom, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and Fiji’s Online Safety Commission. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said teaming up would allow the agencies to share information and develop consistent laws, avoiding a “splinternet” of rules for social networks and their users across different countries. She said: I’ve always believed the future of effective online safety regulation would involve a network of global regulators working together to make the online world a safer place for everyone. Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes said sharing experiences and research across countries would help to ensure the safety of “everyone from Melbourne to Manchester”. - from AAP Steggall calls for MPs to speak up on koalas and native forest protection Federal and state politicians as well as advocates have welcomed the news that the NSW government has pulled its contentious forestry bill which would have threatened koala habitat, but say more needs to be done to protect natural resources and species. Independent MP for Warringah, Zali Steggall, has called on more members of parliament to “speak up and cross the floor”. The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, has said that he’s “devastated” at the way the industrial dispute at Svitzer has unfolded. Danish tug boat company Svitzer has said it will lock out about 590 workers from 17 metropolitan and regional ports from midday on Friday, and will keep them shut out indefinitely. Svitzer and the unions have been working to finalise a new enterprise agreement for workers at the 17 ports for the last three years, however increasing agitation from the union has begun to harm their operations, the company says. Burke told 2GB Radio that it was long-running disputes such as this one that had led Labor to propose giving the Fair Work Commission the power to arbitrate “intractable” disputes. He noted under the current law, the “umpire can only blow the whistle” when both sides agree to arbitration. He said: I want the umpire to be able to make decisions on protracted disputes. This is not the only long running dispute that has been driving people spare, particularly across NSW over the last 12 months or so. You’ll often get in a negotiation brief disputes that go back and forth ... compared to other countries, we don’t have a lot. But these long protracted ones – you need to have a system where the umpire can step in and say ‘OK we’re going to sort this out’. I’m hopeful we’re only two or three weeks away from that being law. I wish the company could just pause and take breath and wait for those laws to be in place. Early voting yesterday opened for the Victorian state election which saw a record 115,065 votes cast. The Victorian Electoral Commission said the figure represented a 52% increase on the figures recorded on the first day of the last state election. The surge might be explained that Victorians don’t have to give a reason for voting early at the state level, unlike the federal election. Nevertheless, the result comes despite the fact printing delays and wet weather did delay 21 centres from opening on time. Of course, votes will not be counted before election day. Australians can help Somalia, World Vision chief urges not to be overwhelmed With famine looming over Somalia, World Vision Australia’s chief says it’s not too late to help those in the “hungriest place on Earth”. Daniel Wordsworth talked to Guardian Australia from a town called Doolow, where a camp for displaced people has been set up. He said people are travelling for weeks to get there, walking at night to avoid the heat, searching for food and clean water. He said: I talked to one grandma who’s in her 90s. She travelled for 20 days. I talked to a young mother, who had five children … they’re all under the age of 10. I talked to another family whose kids are all under 10 and they lost one of their bubbas on the way there. It’s hard to imagine as a parent making that decision [to leave home in search of aid] because you are fully realising that if you stay, it may be too late. We get too weak, we’ve gone without for too long and we can’t make the journey. We go now, when we have some strength, you realise you may lose someone on the way. That’s a dreadful decision. Wordsworth said once they get to the camp, people are triaged, with medical help for the most urgent cases, while the others set up basic camps. He said he worries that Australians might feel overwhelmed by the scale of the catastrophe unfolding, but that they should be reassured they can help. He said: There’s always a danger that you can feel like there’s nothing you can do. You feel like you’re just one small thing, how, in the face of something like global famine, can you actually do anything? But you can … we are here on the ground, we can translate within days, donations into life-saving assistance. It’s real. It actually happens. So you don’t have to worry that alone you can do nothing. Because you’re not alone. Read more about the crisis in Somalia here: Break in rain coming Our resident weather connoisseur Peter Hannam has good news for (most of) you. Up to a week to clear derailed rail wagons near Geelong It could take up to a week to reopen the rail corridor between Melbourne and Adelaide as authorities work out how to remove more than a dozen derailed train carriages near Geelong, in Victoria’s west. Shipping containers were sent tumbling when a 1.7 kilometre-long train with 55 carriages derailed near Inverleigh early on Monday. Sixteen of the carriages went off the tracks, blocking the rail corridor between Adelaide and Melbourne. No one was injured and the cause is under investigation. The Victorian State Emergency Service chief officer, Tim Wiebusch, told reporters on Monday: We know there was heavy rainfall and some flash flooding in that area but at this stage it’s too early to know what the cause was of the train derailment. We are lucky we weren’t dealing with a passenger train in this instance and that the crew on board that freight train were also unscathed. Wiebusch said authorities were working out how to get heavy machinery to the rural area and it could take more than a week for the debris to be cleared. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has taken control of the site. Bureau chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said: Investigators will survey the site and collect any relevant components for further examination and analysis. They will also obtain and review any recorded data, weather information, witness reports, and relevant train and track operator records. – From AAP Torrents of water spill from Wyangala Dam We mentioned on the blog earlier that Wyangala Dam across the Lachlan River is spilling over record megalitres of water and increasing the risk of flooding for those surrounding central west communities, including Forbes. The Wyangala Dam ais at at 104.1% capacity, with WaterNSW saying the 230,000 megalitre outflow from the dam was a record surpassing the 205,000 megalitres during flooding in 1990. To understand how big those numbers are, just take a look for yourself. Chalmers says the war in Ukraine hangs over the G20 meeting, with Russia’s invasion making it “difficult to get outcomes”. Chalmers says: The chaos in energy markets, brought about by Russia’s war in Ukraine is the defining challenge in the global economy. On domestic gas prices, the treasurer says when it comes to mechanisms: Our first preference is to find a regulatory solution here, rather than a tax solution here, I think we’ve said that in different days over the course of the last couple of weeks and see if we can find a temporary, meaningful, sensible and responsible intervention in this market. Karvelas asks Chalmers, once a decision on the intervention is made, how long until it starts to lower prices? We’ll do it in a calm and considered way, but we’ll do it as urgently as we can. There’s a lot of complexity in these policy areas and I don’t want to pretend to your listeners there’s an easy lever to pull. You can’t click your fingers and make a war in Ukraine go away. Karvelas challenges Chalmers that you can make the “glut of greed” of gas producers go away, as the industry minister Ed Husic has pointed out. Nobody pretending issues raised ‘will be solved overnight’: Chalmers Albanese has said there are no preconditions ahead of the meeting with Xi but Karvelas is pressing Chalmers on what could be on the table. He’s staying pretty tight-lipped but here are some of his answers. On whether the meeting between Xi and Albanese will see trade sanctions wound back, Chalmers says: We’ve made it really clear for some time … that these trade sanctions are not in Australia’s interests, and we want to see them lifted. Beijing has made its own demands of Australia, Chalmers is asked what concessions Australia will be willing to make: I don’t think anybody pretends some of the issues China has raised, certainly some we have raised will be solved overnight, but again we give ourselves a much better chance where there is engagement and dialogue. On whether the prime minister would bring up the treatment of two Australians including journalist Cheng Lei and writer Yang Hengjun, Chalmers says: Australia’s made its views clear over a long period of time when it comes to the detention of these two people. PM’s meeting with President Xi seeking to stabilise relationship with China, treasurer says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking with ABC Radio following the big news yesterday that the country’s leader Anthony Albanese had secured a meeting with his Chinese counterpart for the first time since 2016. Chalmers has just gotten back from the G20 meeting in Bali where he was with the prime minister yesterday. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas: What’s Australia’s ambition here? Chalmers: We seek a more stable relationship with China. We will speak up for our national interest where necessary, but we believe engagement is important to give ourselves the chance to work through some of these issues if we’re talking to each other. Lachlan River reaching major flood level at Forbes Shortly after residents of Forbes were told to evacuate or risk being cut off, data from the Bureau of Meteorology shows that the Lachlan River at Forbes is reaching major flood levels. Tasmanians warned of heavy rainfall in south east corner Tasmania’s south east corner is getting drenched. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall. Australia needs more ‘impactful projection’ and lethality: Marles The acting prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, last night spoke at the Sydney Institute, revealing some of his thinking after receiving the interim advice from the defence strategic review. Marles said: Gone are the days of simply paying the entry price to obtain our guarantee from our security guarantor. The world and our region is far too precarious for that. We will have to be willing – and capable – to act on our own terms, when we have to. Crucially, for my portfolio, this will mean ensuring that the military arm of national power is match fit. Australia’s defence capabilities cannot match those of major powers. Australian statecraft is only viable if it is underpinned by the ability to project force and power: to deter military threats, and defend Australia’s national interests within our immediate region. And so I believe the cornerstone of future Australian strategic thought will be impactful projection. We must invest in targeted capabilities that enable us to hold potential adversaries’ forces at risk at a distance and increase the calculated cost of aggression against Australia and its interests. And we must be able to do this through the full spectrum of proportionate response. This will require the Australian defence force to recalibrate its military capabilities, force structure and posture. Our approach must strengthen the lethality, resilience and readiness of the ADF. We must ensure we accord adequate priority to high-end military capabilities to do this. The ADF must augment its self-reliance to deploy and deliver combat power through impactful materiel, enhanced strike capability – including over longer distances – and better logistics and supply chain support, including through a vibrant and innovative partnership with industry. But Marles also flagged the need for cuts elsewhere: If we are to grow the defence budget, then in the same breath we must also open up defence spending to scrutiny. The defence strategic review will inevitably foreshadow some difficult decisions. As we think about how we reconfigure our defence force for a very different strategic environment inevitably we will have to make some hard choices. But the very process of exposing the defence budget to scrutiny and criticism is exactly what will provide the licence for the defence budget to grow in the way it must. He warned of a defence personnel crisis: Today, the reality is defence faces greater challenges to recruit, retain and grow its workforce than we have for decades. The ADF is almost 3,000 below its allocated force strength. The Department of Defence is more than 1,000 below its budgeted size. In part the defence establishment is simply experiencing the demand for labour which is being felt right around the country. But it also has to do with ensuring that defence’s recruitment reflects the way young Australians approach their careers and that within this context the defence offering is competitive. What is completely clear is that urgent action is required if we are to respond to our more challenging strategic environment. Because right now we have a defence personnel crisis. Equality Australia asks ‘what’s next’ on five-year anniversary of yes vote Five years ago the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the results of the marriage law postal survey: 61.6% of Australians voted yes to allow two people, regardless of sex, to be able to marry. Three weeks later, marriage equality became law. Since then, almost 18,000 same sex couples have married in Australia, according to the ABS. Including 6,538 in the year following the yes vote (5.5% of all marriages). On Tuesday peak LGBTIQ+ body Equality Australia will use the anniversary to launch the YES, What’s Next? campaign, calling for an end to gender and sexuality discrimination in religious schools and organisations, ending “conversion therapy” practices and ensuring trans people are fully equal. Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, said: Five years ago, Australians said YES to marriage equality. They said yes to love, fairness and acceptance. It’s a bittersweet day for our communities – both a landmark moment in our national history that has brought great happiness to 36,000 people and their families, and a reminder of a divisive and unnecessary public debate about our lives and our families ... We’ve come a long way as a society in the last five years, but there’s so much more to do. Still today, many of us face discrimination at school, in our workplace or when accessing services. Violence against people in our communities still happens and the opponents who lobbied against marriage equality have shifted focus, doubling down on their attacks on trans and gender diverse people in Australia. Ian Thorpe, five time Olympic gold medal swimmer and prominent marriage equality campaigner, said: The YES vote meant more than simply saying yes to same sex marriage, it was also saying yes to all the LGBTQ+ kids out there that they are just as much a part of society as everyone else, and that all of us are equal no matter who we love. Australia is at its best when we embrace all of our differences. We are better and stronger together. And that’s what the YES vote did, it brought us all together – not only in spirit but also in law ... The YES, What’s Next? pledge is a rallying cry to political leaders across the country to build a more fair, equal and just society by ending conversion practices, ensuring trans people are fully equal, protecting LGBTIQ+ students and staff from discrimination in religious school, and protecting intersex people from harm. Natasha May now on deck with you. Residents of Forbes were warned to evacuate before 7am or risk being cut off this morning as the SES say the Lachlan River is rising faster than originally forecast. The central west town in NSW has had several major floods over the past 12 months, the last only two weeks ago coming in just under the level reached in the June 1952 flood. This time, the Bureau of Meteorology predicts water levels will peak around 10.8 metres on Wednesday – similar to the 1952 level. The flooding in Forbes comes as the Wyangala Dam across the Lachlan River is spilling over at at 104.1% capacity. A WaterNSW spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald that the 230,000 megalitre outflow from the dam was a record surpassing the 205,000 megalitres during flooding in 1990. NSW flood warnings for Lachlan and Macquarie rivers The Bureau of Meteorology has issued more flood warnings for central west New South Wales as the state continues to feel the impact of massive rainfall over recent days and the Wyangala Dam continues to spill. “With all the rain over the weekend we are still seeing significant flooding for large parts of the country – particularly for Bathurst and Forbes,” Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Jonathan How told Australian Associated Press. The BoM released a warning for the Lachlan River in the early hours of this morning: Moderate to heavy rainfall observed across the Lachlan River catchment has resulted in renewed river level rises and areas of flooding. Major flooding is occurring at Cowra and Nanami. Major flooding is likely at Forbes from early Tuesday morning. Major flooding is occurring at Cottons Weir. It also said major flooding was occurring at Bathurst but the Macquarie River was now falling. Further south-west, the town of Eugowra has been cut off and residents had to be rescued by helicopter and taken to Orange. Our reporter Cait Kelly filed this story last night, including this quote from emergency services minister, Steph Cooke. “With a population of 700, one in five residents have been rescued in the last few hours, by helicopter or by boat. This [severe weather] event is now in its 62nd day, and every day it throws up new challenges.” And that’s it from me this morning, my colleague Natasha May will keep you up to date on everything you need to know. A new report published overnight shows that Australia still lags most developed countries in the climate performance index despite the Labor government’s attempts to improve the country’s standing. Australia is ranked 55th out of 63 in the index, a slight improvement on its 59th place last year as a lack of national plan to phase out fossil fuel mining contin ues to hold the country back. Nicki Hutley, an economist with the Climate Council, said Australia had “gone from dead last to a pass”. “Despite the nation’s recent progress, there is no escaping just how far behind we are and how much catching up we’ve got to do,” she said. Adam Morton has the full story here. Welcome to our live blog where the day will be dominated by the run up to Anthony Albanese’s meeting with Xi Jinping in Bali tonight. My colleague Natasha May will be here soon to guide you through the day but in the meantime, let’s see what’s coming up. The Business Council of Australia has hailed the prime minister’s meeting with Xi as a “tremendous reset” and an opportunity to rebuild relations with our biggest trading partner after trade wars and spats about the pandemic and human rights. Our political editor, Katharine Murphy, is in Bali and will keep us informed every step of the way. She has this take on the comments by BCA chief Jennifer Westacott. Another summit, another country, and climate minister Chris Bowen is in Egypt for the Cop27 climate talks. He plans to give a speech later today criticising the World Bank for failing to offer a rigorous enough response to the climate emergency, and also suggesting that the architecture of the global financial system needs to be reworked to create better solutions to the problem. Our environment editor, Adam Morton, is in Sharm el-Sheikh and has filed this take on Bowen. Severe flooding continues to pose a serious risk to communities in the central west of New South Wales with major flooding expected in towns including Forbes and Bathurst. In addition, there are emergency orders in place for areas from the Queensland border to Victoria as far south as Geelong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/15/agl-energy-board-directors-mike-cannon-brookes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T02:44:30Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes succeeds in shaking up AGL board ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/15/agl-energy-board-directors-mike-cannon-brookes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/15/agl-energy-board-directors-mike-cannon-brookes","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes succeeds in shaking up AGL board ","bodyText":"Billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has succeeded in shaking up the board of Australia’s biggest electricity producer, with all four of his proposed directors winning support from shareholders at AGL Energy’s annual general meeting. The company, though, won backing for its decarbonisation plans, which were less ambitious than those proposed by Cannon-Brookes, AGL’s biggest single shareholder. AGL is the country’s largest carbon emitter. Patricia McKenzie, AGL’s chair, told the meeting in Melbourne that the company’s climate transition action plan – which would see it shut its final coal-fired power plant by 2035 – had support from shareholders. The vote was about two-thirds in favour. McKenzie said that based on proxy votes ahead of the meeting, the five-member board would be expanded to include all four of Cannon-Brooke’s proposed new directors: Mark Twidell, Dr Kerry Schott, Christine Holman and John Pollaers. AGL’s board had only supported Twidell, a solar energy veteran, ahead of the vote. It remains to be seen whether the expanded board, which also includes the recently appointed wind energy expert, Miles George, will opt to accelerate AGL’s plans. A spokesperson for Grok Ventures, a family company owned by Cannon-Brookes, welcomed the new board additions. “This represents another majority vote by AGL shareholders pointing to their desire for change, fresh thinking and more execution capacity to realise the potential of this great company,” the spokesperson said. “The AGL Board has Grok Ventures’ full support to deliver on the monumental task ahead, of rebuilding the company to lead Australia’s green energy transition, for the benefit of all stakeholders,” he said. AGL’s chair McKenzie also welcomed the new directors, saying the board “will work constructively with them in the best of interests of shareholders”. “It’s great to have diversity on the board,” McKenzie said in answer to questions, adding that Grok “does not control AGL”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Cannon-Brookes had raised concerns about McKenzie’s ongoing role as chair since she had backed AGL’s demerger. That plan was ditched in May because of Grok’s activism. In September, AGL announced it would bring forward the closure date of its Loy Yang A brown coal-fired power station in Victoria by a decade, to 2035, while leaving its black-coal burning Bayswater power station in NSW running until between 2030 and 2033. AGL’s Liddell plant, also in NSW, shuts next April. McKenzie said AGL had the “ambition to add up to 12 gigawatts of new renewable and firming capacity by 2036, which will require a total investment of up to $20bn”.  This plan included an interim target to have up to 5GW of new renewables and firming in place by 2030, she said, adding AGL now has a 3.2GW pipeline of high-quality energy projects and access to a 3.5GW high quality renewables development pipeline via its investment in Tilt Renewables. McKenzie said each of the new directors had issued statements of independence, saying “they are not representing any particular shareholder”. In recorded comments, Schott said AGL needed cut carbon emissions “as much as they can, as fast as they can”, that much of the company’s value was in its gas and electricity retailing arms. Schott said it was important that the directors worked collaboratively: “The last thing a board needs is to be balkanised.” Brynn O’Brien, executive director of The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, welcomed the shareholders’ action. “History has been made today,” O’Brien said. “The board of an Australian listed company has been transformed by shareholders over its handling of climate risks. “This is both a victory for shareholders and a scathing indictment on those who spent years destroying shareholder value by delaying the inevitable in the face of an escalating energy transition. “It is vital that lessons are learned from AGL’s colossal waste of time and shareholder funds. “The boards of other high-emitting companies should be taking note of today’s outcome: climate risk management is an ever-increasing pressure and those who remain flat-footed in the face of rapidly shifting market dynamics will be held to account.” Tim Buckley, energy finance analyst and director of independent thinktank Climate Energy Finance, said AGL had been “a global laggard in accepting and acting on the climate science” but was now at “a turning point”. “This board renewal is critical for AGL investors given the opportunity to start to reverse the $10bn of shareholder wealth destruction in the last six years, but also for the wider context given AGL is a key Australian energy sector incumbent, with financial resources and staffing that can be leveraged constructively, with the right leadership,” Buckley said. AGL would put its transition plan up for shareholders to vote on every three years, McKenzie said. About 30% of shareholders voted against the remuneration plan for executives, delivering a so-called “first strike” that could place extra pressure on management in the future. Geoff Wilson, an AGL shareholder and chair of Wilson Asset Management, said Tuesday’s outcome was “a positive step forward for shareholder democracy”. “It is important that all Australian company boards understand that they only serve at the wishes of their shareholders,” he said. AGL shares gave up early gains to trade about 1.4% lower close to close of trade. The benchmark ASX200 index was flat for the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/14/the-big-idea-we-need-to-reverse-climate-change-not-just-stop-it","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T12:30:38Z","webTitle":"The big idea: stopping climate change isn’t enough – we need to reverse it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/14/the-big-idea-we-need-to-reverse-climate-change-not-just-stop-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/14/the-big-idea-we-need-to-reverse-climate-change-not-just-stop-it","fields":{"headline":"The big idea: stopping climate change isn’t enough – we need to reverse it","bodyText":"The past year has seen an unending drumbeat of climate-driven disasters. And yet, the climate story of this past decade has been one of slow but steady progress. Global CO2 emissions have flattened, and countries representing 88% of global emissions have adopted or announced plans to get to net zero in the latter half of the 21st century. Another reason to be hopeful is that clean energy became cheaper much faster than expected. The cost of both solar energy and batteries fell tenfold in the last 10 years and the cost of wind energy by two-thirds. Solar is the cheapest form of new electricity to build in much of the world today, and electric vehicles now represent 13% of new vehicle sales globally. But this doesn’t mean we can rest on our laurels. Far from it. We are still nowhere near where we need to be to meet our climate goals. In the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which I contributed to, we found that if we want to limit warming to 1.5C we can only emit 420bn more tons of CO2 – equal to around 10 years of current emissions. This means that even with the progress we’ve made, the increase in global temperatures is very likely to exceed 1.5C by the early 2030s. So where does that leave us? The short answer is: “It’s complicated.” To start with, it’s important to emphasise that climate change happens incrementally rather than in big jumps. There is no evidence that 1.5C represents a boundary between manageable and catastrophic impacts. But the further we push the climate beyond where it has been for the past few million years, the greater and more unpredictable the risks become. Large climate shifts in the Earth’s past, and potential future tipping points such as CO2 release from thawing permafrost, should give us pause: we can’t easily predict what might happen. Every tenth of a degree matters if we want to minimise the harm we inflict on ourselves and leave to future generations. But equally, just because we pass 1.5C does not mean that there is no way back. We know that if we can get emissions down to zero the world will effectively stop warming. And climate models show that if we remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than we are emitting it will actually cool the world back down. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere and oceans was highlighted in the recent IPCC report as an “essential element” of meeting our climate goals. Virtually all climate models suggest that we need to remove 6bn tons of CO2 per year by 2050 alongside rapid emissions reductions to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century. One form of carbon dioxide removal people are already familiar with comes in the form of trees and soil. The Earth’s living systems already sequester about a quarter of the CO2 we emit today (with another quarter absorbed by the oceans). There is real potential to enhance this “natural carbon sink” by protecting forests, planting more of them, and changing how we manage agricultural land and pasture to get more carbon into the soil. This is relatively low cost today, but it is also likely to prove temporary. Trees may be cut down, burn down, or die from beetle infestations, while soil may dry up due to drought or heat – and these risks will increase as a result of climate change. There are also limits to the land available to use. All in all, models suggest that trees and soil could provide only half of the carbon dioxide removal that we need. There are other more reliable ways to take carbon out of the atmosphere over the long term. Such approaches are still at an early stage, but are being rapidly developed by hundreds of companies around the world. They include direct air capture, which sucks CO2 directly from the atmosphere; taking agricultural waste or wood and storing carbon from it deep underground; spreading minerals like basalt that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere on to agricultural fields; removing CO2 directly from ocean water; making ocean water less acidic so it absorbs more CO2; and sinking kelp or other plants into the deep ocean where the carbon they have absorbed will stay for millennia to come. These approaches are less likely to be reversed and are less limited by available land. But they tend to be much more expensive, at least at the moment. It follows that we should be focusing on making them cheaper, the way we did with renewable energy. This is the goal of Frontier, a $925m advance market commitment that Stripe, where I am climate research lead, has launched alongside Alphabet, Shopify, Meta and McKinsey. The idea is simple: by guaranteeing money up front, we’re sending a signal to entrepreneurs and researchers that if they build and scale those early-stage technologies, we will buy them. This approach was piloted a decade ago to accelerate the development of the pneumococcal vaccines in low-income countries, and saved an estimated 700,000 lives. We have a saying in the climate science world – that CO2 is forever. It will take close to half a million years before a ton of CO2 emitted today from burning fossil fuels is completely removed from the atmosphere naturally. This means that when we try to neutralise or undo fossil fuel emissions – for example, with carbon offsets – those interventions should operate over a similar timeframe: a ton of emissions from cutting down trees can be neutralised by putting more carbon in trees or soils, but CO2 from fossil fuels needs to be balanced by more permanent carbon removal. This is the reason why the respected Science Based Targets initiative only allows measures that permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere to neutralise a company’s remaining fossil fuel emissions in their net-zero standard – and only alongside deep emissions reductions. We should not oversell the role of carbon removal. The vast majority of the time it is cheaper to reduce emissions than to remove CO2 from the atmosphere after the fact. Models that limit warming to 1.5C show that we need to reduce global CO2 emissions by around 90%, while only using carbon removal for around 10%. But 10% of the solution to a problem as big as climate change is still something we cannot afford to ignore. In 2021 the world spent a total of $755bn on reducing emissions. We should probably aim to spend about 1% of that money on carbon removal technologies. But we cannot simply sit back and assume that ways of removing billions of tons of CO2 per year will magically appear in the decades to come. By investing today, we can ensure that we are in a good position to make net-zero a reality, stop the world from continuing to heat up, and give ourselves the tools to ultimately reverse global warming in the future.

Demand for fossil fuels is likely to fall sharply in the medium term, according to a report published on Monday by the Carbon Tracker thinktank. That makes relying on gas exports to fuel economic growth a short-term, risky strategy, while boosting solar power would prove a better long-term bet, the analysis found. Although gas prices are high now, and the top five oil and gas companies alone have made profits of more than $170bn so far this year, gas revenues would fall by half by 2040, and the gas market would see record low prices owing to shrinking demand, the report forecast. That would leave Africa with huge investments in gas infrastructure, but no export market, if countries pursued a “dash for gas” now, the analysis found. Kofi Mbuk, senior clean tech analyst at Carbon Tracker and lead author of the report, warned that companies investing in fossil fuels in Africa would be left with stranded assets. “The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is inevitable and irreversible,” he said. “The growth in energy demand globally and regionally is now being met by renewables and squeezing out fossil fuel demands. In Africa, and across emerging economies, solar and wind offer the best route for economic development.” The future of Africa’s vast gas reserves is a major topic at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt, now in its second week. Although not formally on the agenda for the UN talks, the conference is buzzing with talk of Africa’s potential as a gas exporter. Countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea and Algeria have sizeable gas reserves, as does the Cop27 host country, Egypt. There are more than 600 fossil fuel executives and lobbyists at the talks, and a host of African heads of government who attended the leaders’ summit segment of the summit last week were keen to use the opportunity to strike gas deals. Macky Sall, president of Senegal, told the Guardian at the talks that it was wrong for developed countries to try to urge African leaders not to drill for gas when the west had grown rich on fossil fuels. “Why not Africa?” he asked. “Why should we not do the same?” Other leading figures have also voiced support for Africa to exploit its gas reserves. Tony Blair, former prime minister of the UK, told the Guardian: “They’ve got to be able to get gas. Gas for them is going to be a transitional fuel. Large numbers of people are burning wood for their fuel, which is bad for emissions but also bad for their health. For a transitional phase, they’re going to need to develop their gas resources.” This could save reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to some alternatives, he argued. “If you could swap, for example, heavy-duty diesel for gas, that would be highly beneficial for those countries. And in time you will have the potential for the development of hydrogen off the back of it [gas],” he said. Before the talks, the Sudanese-British billionaire Mo Ibrahim also called for Africa to exploit its resources. “We need a balanced and fair policy for everybody. Gas can be useful to our transition. [Developed countries who say otherwise] are hypocrites,” he told the Guardian. There are 600 million people in Africa without access to electricity. “How can we even think of development if people don’t have power?” he asked. “How can we have education, hospitals, business, companies, social life, TVs, tablets, computers, whatever?” Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of former world statespeople and business leaders, told the Guardian in June she supported the expansion of gas in Africa to provide access to modern energy for the 600 million people across the continent currently without it. Gas could provide clean cooking fuel as an alternative to biomass and paraffin, which currently kill thousands through indoor air pollution, especially women and children, she told the Guardian. “Africa is trying to get its voice out about its needs for just, equitable energy, and of course that implies some use of gas as a just transition,” she said. Egypt, host of the Cop27 summit, is understood to be eager to expand its gas industry, positing it as a help to European countries struggling with supplies to replace imports from Russia. However, many African climate experts and activists are speaking out against the expansion of gas on the continent. They argue that African’s poor are unlikely to see any benefit from the gas, which is likely to be exported abroad to the highest bidder by multinationals, with profits siphoned off to the countries’ elites. “The “dash for gas” in Africa is dangerous and shortsighted,” wrote a coalition of dozens of African climate groups in an open letter as part of a campaign called “Don’t Gas Africa”. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said Africa’s plentiful solar and wind resources offered a better route to energy than investing in gas. “For far too long, Africa has been controlled by outside interests – a resource pool for extraction and export, and a dumping ground for the practices and technologies no longer wanted elsewhere,” he said. In its report entitled African Sun: Why solar not gas offers the continent the best economic opportunity in the transition, published on Monday, Carbon Tracker argues that Africa could be an exporter of solar energy, rather than gas. “Electricity will be the backbone of Africa’s economic future, with solar leading the way,” the report predicted. “Even though prior to the Ukraine conflict, solar was competitive with coal and gas for power generation, the conflict means that the continent should, more than ever, build solar as a means to decrease its dependence on its global commodity market and achieve a secure and affordable source of domestic energy. Further acceleration of cost reduction will put Africa in a unique position as a beneficiary from one of the best abundance of solar potential on the planet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
